  ],
  "overall_failure_reason": "There was disagreement: one juror scored the agent as perfect (1.0) and did not recommend RL triggering, while two jurors scored lower (0.8–0.85) and recommended triggering due to missing key next steps. I resolved this by weighing the shared critique that the agent has not yet produced its main deliverable (a consolidated seed prompt/strategy) and has not explored the actual data files; thus performance is good but incomplete, warranting TRIGGER=1 and a score below 1.0. (Note: only 3 jury verdicts were provided despite the prompt stating 4.)"
