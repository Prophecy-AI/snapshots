    "# Loop 4 Analysis: Understanding the Gap\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Findings:\n",
    "1. Eazy optimizer produces INVALID submissions (overlaps detected by Kaggle but not Shapely)\n",
    "2. Strict ensemble scores 70.615745 - 0.06 better than baseline, NO overlaps\n",
    "3. Gap to target: 70.615745 - 68.891380 = 1.72 points (2.5%)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Strategy Assessment:\n",
    "- Local optimization (SA, eazy) is stuck at local optimum\n",
    "- Ensemble from multiple sources provides marginal improvement\n",
    "- Need fundamentally different approach to close 1.72 point gap"
