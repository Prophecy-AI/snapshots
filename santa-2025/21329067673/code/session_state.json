      "finding": "This is a 2D polygon packing problem: pack Christmas tree-shaped polygons (15 vertices) into smallest square bounding box for N=1 to 200 trees. Score = sum of (side_length^2 / N) for all N. Target score: 68.894234. Trees have specific shape with trunk, 3 tiers. Key approaches from kernels: 1) Greedy placement with collision detection using Shapely STRtree, 2) Simulated Annealing (bbox3 binary), 3) Shake optimization (shake_public binary), 4) fix_direction - rotation optimization to minimize bounding box, 5) Overlap validation and repair.",
