      "text": "The best techniques for 2D polygon packing optimization in the Kaggle Santa 2025 competition, particularly to achieve scores below 69, focus on advanced geometric algorithms and high-precision placement strategies. According to recent discussions and code repositories, a key approach involves precise geometric calculations, such as using high-precision arithmetic (e.g., Decimal types) to manage complex polygon shapes and avoid floating-point errors, which is crucial for non-deformable, complex polygons like Christmas trees ([Shan WAN](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/shan-wan-65015060_santa-2025-christmas-tree-packing-challenge-activity-7397258249777098752-R7De), [Kaggle discussion](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/santa-2025/discussion/665978)). \n\nAdditionally, heuristic algorithms such as genetic algorithms and nesting techniques are recommended for exploring optimal placements by iteratively adjusting rotations and translations to minimize wasted space while ensuring no overlaps. For example, solutions utilizing no-fit polygon calculations for convex shapes and advanced nesting heuristics are suggested, as they can handle irregular, non-convex polygons effectively ([Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6864382/packing-arbitrary-polygons-within-an-arbitrary-boundary), [soln.tech](https://soln.tech/blog/2d-packing-problem)). \n\nIn summary, achieving scores below 69 involves combining high-precision geometric algorithms, such as no-fit polygon calculations, with heuristic optimization methods like genetic algorithms, to efficiently pack complex polygonal shapes with minimal wasted space, as validated by recent Kaggle discussions and code repositories ([Kaggle Santa 2025](https://www.kaggle.com/code/zwxiang123/santa-2025-christmas-tree-packing-challenge?scriptVersionId=287416463)).",

This is the game-changer:\nNo Compression: Since the exact polygonal shape is given, optimization through deformation (like real-world netting) is excluded.\nThe Constraint: We are strictly limited to finding the optimal rotation and translation for up to 200 rigid shapes while ensuring zero strict overlap (collision), only allowing for perfect contact.\n2\\. The Algorithmic Imperative\nTo succeed, the solution must focus entirely on robust geometric algorithms and advanced optimization techniques:\nPrecision is Key: The notebook's use of the Decimal type is a huge hint. This mandates that our solution relies on high-precision arithmetic to manage the complex geometry and avoid floating-point errors, especially in the crucial collision checks.\nThe Solving Method: The heavy lifting requires a powerful Metaheuristic like Simulated Annealing (SA). SA is necessary to efficiently search the vast, multi-dimensional solution space of 3N variables and minimize the side of the Minimum Bounding Square (our cost function).\n3\\. Conclusion\nThis challenge boils down to mastering Algorithmic Geometry and Stochastic Optimization (the core of the SA algorithm). Our submission will be the precise set of coordinates and angles that yields the mathematically tightest fit. It's a deep test of mathematical implementation!\n[https://lnkd.in/e-vyv4NJ](https://lnkd.in/e-vyv4NJ?trk=public_post-text)

Anything that works with distinct shapes should trivially work with identical shapes too. If you have an algorithm that works well for a rectangular boundary, you can try to adapt it for an arbitrary boundary. Modify it so that you can at a flip opre-fill your boundary with some shapes that cannot be moved or deleted (e.g. there's only one way to place them). Solve for a rectangular boundary, pre-filled with some shapes that just leave your original boundary unfilled. Not all algorithms can be adapted like this.\n\n\u2013\u00a0[n. m. could be an AI](https://stackoverflow.com/users/775806/n-m-could-be-an-ai)\n\nCommentedJul 28, 2011 at 20:22\n\n- The case with only one kind of filling polygon is definitely a special case of the general situation with different filling polys. I believe most heuristics for solving this kind of cutting/packing problem uses the no-fit polygon, so googling \"no-fit irregular packing\"' or something like that could be a good start.\n\n\u2013\u00a0[Anders Forsgren](https://stackoverflow.com/users/678410/anders-forsgren)\n\nCommentedJul 28, 2011 at 23:05\n\n- I think you should as this in the theoretical cs version of SO.\n\n\u2013\u00a0[Ira Baxter](https://stackoverflow.com/users/120163/ira-baxter)\n\nCommentedAug 31, 2011 at 5:25\n\n- for the algorithm: this is commonly called \"nesting\", which means to pack irregular, potentially non-convex, 2D/3D shapes into some piece of \"stock\" that is then cut. things need not be nested literally, but they could be.\n\n\u2013\u00a0[Christoph Rackwitz](https://stackoverflow.com/users/2602877/christoph-rackwitz)\n\nCommentedJun 26, 2023 at 19:18\n\n\n[Add a comment](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6864382/packing-arbitrary-polygons-within-an-arbitrary-boundary)\u00a0\\|\n\n## 4 Answers 4\n\nSorted by:\n[Reset to default](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6864382/packing-arbitrary-polygons-within-an-arbitrary-boundary?answertab=scoredesc#tab-top)\n\nHighest score (default)Trending (recent votes count more)Date modified (newest first)Date created (oldest first)\n\n4\n\nThe question you ask is very hard. To put this in perspective, the (much) simpler case where you're packing the interior of your bounded polygon with non-overlapping disks is already hard, and disks are the simplest possible \"packing shape\" (with any other shape you have to consider orientation as well as size and center location).\n\nIn fact, I think it's an open problem in [computational geometry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_geometry) to determine for an arbitrary integer N and arbitrary bounded polygonal region (in the Euclidean plane), what is the \"optimal\" (in the sense of covering the greatest percentage of the polygon interior) packing of N inscribed non-overlapping disks, where you are free to choose the radius and center location of each disk. I'm sure the \"best\" answer _is_ known for certain special polygonal shapes (like rectangles, circles, and triangles), but for arbitrary shapes your best \"heuristic\" is probably:\n\n1. Start your shape counter at N.\n2. Add the largest \"packing shape\" you can fit completely inside the polygonal boundary without overlapping any other packing shapes.\n3. Decrement your shape counter.\n4. If your shape counter is > 0, go to step 2.\n\nI say \"probably\" because \"largest first\" isn't always the best way to pack things into a confined space. You can dig into that particular flavor of craziness by reading about the [bin packing problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bin_packing_problem) and [knapsack problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem).\n\n**EDIT:** Step 2 by itself is hard. A reasonable strategy would be to pick an arbitrary point on the interior of the polygon as the center and \"inflate\" the disk until it touches either the boundary or another disk (or both), and then \"slide\" the disk while continuing to inflate it so that it remains inside the boundary without overlapping any other disks until it is \"trapped\" - with at least 2 points of contact with the boundary and/or other disks. But it isn't easy to formalize this \"sliding process\". And even if you get the sliding process right, this strategy doesn't guarantee that you'll find the biggest \"inscribable disk\" - your \"locally maximal\" disk could be trapped in a \"lobe\" of the interior which is connected by a narrow \"neck\" of free space to a larger \"lobe\" where a larger disk would fit.\n\n[Share](https://stackoverflow.com/a/7342898)\n\n[Improve this answer](https://stackoverflow.com/posts/7342898/edit)\n\nFollow\n\n[edited Feb 27, 2013 at 20:29](https://stackoverflow.com/posts/7342898/revisions)\n\nanswered Sep 8, 2011 at 3:46\n\n[![Peter's user avatar](https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f031e9e9b7476fc5d3674fe4a9c59ef2?s=64&d=identicon&r=PG)](https://stackoverflow.com/users/227491/peter)\n\n[Peter](https://stackoverflow.com/users/227491/peter) Peter\n\n2,53611 gold badge2323 silver badges3232 bronze badges\n\n[Add a comment](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6864382/packing-arbitrary-polygons-within-an-arbitrary-boundary)\u00a0\\|\n\n3\n\nThanks for the replies, my requirements were such that I was able to further simplify the problem by not having to deal with orientation and I then even further simplified by only really wor...",

The goal is to arrange these shapes in a way that minimizes wastage. This is known as the 2D packing problem. In this article, we will study at how to solve this problem using genetic algorithm.\n\ncovers a sub-problem of no-fit polygon required to solve the 2d packing problem. describes the genetic algorithm approach to solving the 2d packing problem. covers an industry-grade, opensource nesting software, Deepnest, built using the approach described in this article.\n\n## No-fit polygon\n\nSolving the 2D packing problem involves trying different placements of shapes on the sheet, adjusting their positions, and selecting the arrangement with the least unused space. A key challenge is ensuring that no shapes overlap during placement. To simplify, assume one shape is fixed at a certain location. The question then becomes: where can the next shape be placed so it does not overlap with the first? This is known as the no-fit polygon problem.\n\n### No-fit polygon for convex shapes\n\nThe paper [shoemaking and the milk tray problem](https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg12316773-700/) proved a result for the case of two convex polygons A and B. Let the two shapes be represented by their edges and a reference point. To obtain a no-fit polygon for two convex polygons, arrange the edges of A and -B in order of their slope.Deomonstration of no-fit polygon algorithm for convex shapes by CunninghameIn , shape A's edges are labelled as A0, A1, ..., A4; shape -B's edges are labelled as B0, B1 and B2. Arranging the edges in order of their slope and placing them one after the other yields NFP\\[A,B\\], the no-fit polygon for shapes A and B.\n\n#### Algorithm: No-Fit Polygon for Two Convex Polygons\n\n**Input:**\n\n- Convex polygon \\\\( A \\\\) with vertices \\\\( V\\_A = \\[a\\_1, a\\_2, \\\\dots, a\\_m\\] \\\\), ordered counter-clockwise (CCW).\n- Convex polygon \\\\( B \\\\) with vertices \\\\( V\\_B = \\[b\\_1, b\\_2, \\\\dots, b\\_n\\] \\\\), ordered CCW.\n- Reference points \\\\( r\\_A \\\\in A \\\\) and \\\\( r\\_B \\\\in B \\\\).\n\n**Output:**\nVertices \\\\( V\\_{\\\\text{NFP}} \\\\) of the no-fit polygon (NFP) of \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( B \\\\).\n\n1. **Edge Vector Extraction:**\nCompute edge vectors for polygon \\\\( A \\\\)\n\\\\\\[ E\\_A = \\[a\\_2 - a\\_1, a\\_3 - a\\_2, \\\\dots, a\\_m - a\\_{m-1}, a\\_1 - a\\_m\\] \\\\\\]\nReverse \\\\( V\\_B \\\\) to maintain CCW after negation\n\\\\\\[ V\\_{-B} = \\[b\\_n, b\\_{n-1}, \\\\dots, b\\_1\\] \\\\\\]\nNegate edge vectors of \\\\( B \\\\)\n\\\\\\[ E\\_{-B} = \\[-(b\\_{n-1} - b\\_n), -(b\\_{n-2} - b\\_{n-1}), \\\\dots, -(b\\_1 - b\\_2), -(b\\_n - b\\_1)\\] \\\\\\]\n\n2. **Merge and Sort Edges by Angle:**\nLet \\\\( E = E\\_A \\\\cup E\\_{-B} \\\\).\nFor each vector \\\\( v = (x, y) \\\\in E \\\\), compute angle \\\\( \\\\theta = \\\\text{atan2}(y, x) \\\\).\nSort \\\\( E \\\\) in increasing order of \\\\( \\\\theta \\\\).\n3. **Initialize No-Fit Polygon:**\nReference point: \\\\( p\\_0 = r\\_A - r\\_B \\\\).

The resulting NFP is convex and corresponds to the Minkowski sum boundary of \\\\( A \\\\) and \\\\( -B \\\\).\n\n#### Python code for no-fit polygon for convex shapes\n\n```\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\ndef compute_edge_vectors(vertices):\n    \"\"\"\n    Compute edge vectors of a polygon.\n    Each vector is from vertex i to vertex i+1 (mod n).\n    \"\"\"\n    n = len(vertices)\n    return [vertices[(i + 1) % n] - vertices[i] for i in range(n)]\n\ndef negate_and_reverse(vertices):\n    \"\"\"\n    Reverse the order of polygon B's vertices and negate its edge vectors.\n    This ensures -B remains counter-clockwise and forms the correct Minkowski sum boundary.\n    \"\"\"\n    reversed_vertices = vertices[::-1]\n    n = len(reversed_vertices)\n    # Negate edge directions: -(v[i+1] - v[i])\n    edge_vectors = [-(reversed_vertices[(i + 1) % n] - reversed_vertices[i]) for i in range(n)]\n    return edge_vectors\n\ndef angle(v):\n    \"\"\"\n    Compute angle of vector v = (x, y) using atan2 for proper sorting.\n    \"\"\"\n    return np.arctan2(v[1], v[0])\n\ndef no_fit_polygon(V_A, V_B, r_A, r_B):\n    \"\"\"\n    Compute the No-Fit Polygon (NFP) for two convex polygons A and B.\n\n    Parameters:\n        V_A: list of np.array points representing polygon A (CCW order)\n        V_B: list of np.array points representing polygon B (CCW order)\n        r_A: reference point in polygon A (np.array)\n        r_B: reference point in polygon B (np.array)\n\n    Returns:\n        V_NFP: list of np.array points representing vertices of the no-fit polygon\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Compute edge vectors for A\n    E_A = compute_edge_vectors(V_A)\n\n    # Step 1 continued: Negate and reverse edge vectors for B\n    E_negB = negate_and_reverse(V_B)\n\n    # Step 2: Merge and sort edge vectors by angle\n    E = E_A + E_negB\n    E.sort(key=angle)\n\n    # Step 3: Initialize the no-fit polygon with starting point\n    p0 = r_A - r_B\n    V_NFP = [p0.copy()]\n\n    # Step 4: Walk along sorted edges to trace NFP boundary\n    p = p0.copy()\n    for e in E:\n        p = p + e\n        V_NFP.append(p.copy())\n\n    # Step 5: Return final list of NFP vertices\n    return V_NFP\n\ndef plot_polygon(vertices, style='-o', label=None):\n    \"\"\"\n    Plot a polygon given its vertices.\n    Automatically closes the polygon by connecting last to first.\n    \"\"\"\n    closed = vertices + [vertices[0]]\n    xs, ys = zip(*closed)\n    plt.plot(xs, ys, style, label=label)\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Convex polygon A (triangle)\n    V_A = [np.array([0, 0]), np.array([2, 0]), np.array([1, 2])]\n\n    # Convex polygon B (square)\n    V_B = [np.array([0, 0]), np.array([1, 0]), np.array([1, 1]), np.array([0, 1])]\n\n    # Reference points in A and B\n    r_A = np.array([1, 1])\n    r_B = np.array([0.5, 0.5])\n\n    # Compute the no-fit polygon\n    V_NFP = no_fit_polygon(V_A, V_B, r_A, r_B)\n\n    # Plotting\n    plt.figure(figsize=(8, 8))\n\n    # Plot original polygons\n    plot_polygon(V_A, style='-o', label='Polygon A')\n    plot_polygon(V_B, style='-o', label='Polygon B')\n\n    # Plot the resulting NFP\n    plot_polygon(V_NFP, style='-ro', label='NFP')\n\n    # Set plot properties\n    plt.axis('equal')\n    plt.grid(True)\n    plt.legend()\n    plt.title('No-Fit Polygon (NFP)')\n    plt.show()\n\n```\n\n**Output of Python code**\n\nNo-fit polygon for convex shapes\n\nshows the output of the Python code.

No-fit polygon is obtained by taking a union of no-fit polygon for convex shapes. This approach creates another problem of efficiently dividing a non-convex shape into multiple convex shapes.\n\nIn this article, we wil limit our discussion to 2d packing problem for convex shapes.
