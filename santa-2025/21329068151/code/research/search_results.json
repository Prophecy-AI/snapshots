The proposed algorithm\nconstructively creates layouts from an ordered list of items and a placement heuristic. A\nmoveable item is exclusively placed on a collision free region vertex. The container has a fixed\nwidth, while its length can change so that all items are placed on it. The objective is to find a\nlayout of the set of items that minimizes the length of the container. The proposed algorithm has\ntwo hierarchical levels: core level with a simulated annealing algorithm, and the external level\ncontrolling the container length. The simulated annealing algorithm controls the ordered list of\nitems and the placement of the items. If a feasible layout is found, the external level decreases\nthe container length and applies the simulated annealing again. Otherwise, the container length\nis increased and the simulated annealing is applied again. Computational comparisons on\nbenchmark problems show that the proposed algorithm generated highly competitive solutions.\nMoreover, our algorithm updated some best known results. Copyright \rc 2011 IFAC.\nKeywords: Simulated Annealing, Placement Problems, Optimization, Probabilistic Heuristic.\n1. INTRODUCTION\nCutting and packing are classic problems of finding the\nmost efficient layout for a set of input items out of a\ngiven container with the objective of minimizing the waste\nmaterial. The applications of cutting and packing, e.g.\nclothing, shipbuilding, and furniture industry are numer\u0002ous. W\u00a8ascher et al. (2007) have developed a typology that\nclassifies the nesting problems according to dimension,\nobjective, assortment of item type, as well as the number\nand nature of the container where the items are to be\nallocated. In this paper, we consider the irregular shape\npacking problem, classified as a two-dimensional irregular\nopen dimension problem (ODP).\nThe problem is NP-complete (Fowler et al., 1981) and\nas a result solution methodologies predominantly utilize\nheuristics. Although there are many different solution\napproaches presented in the literature, there appears to\nbe two key strategies for representing and searching the\nsolution space. The first approach represents the solution\nas an ordered list of items and applies a placement rule\nto construct the solution (Babu and Babu, 2001; Gomes\nand Oliveira, 2002; Burke et al., 2007, 2006). The second\napproach represents the solution as a physical layout on\nthe container and moves items within the layout (Bennell\n1 e-mail: andre.kubagawa@gmail.com. This author was partially\nsupported by CNPq.\n2 e-mail: thiago@usp.br. This author was partially supported by\nFAPESP (grant 2009/14699-0).\n3 e-mail: mtsuzuki@usp.br. This author was partially supported by\nCNPq (grant 304258/2007-5) and FAPESP (grant 2009/07173-2).\nand Dowsland, 1999; Gomes and Oliveira, 2006; Egeblad\net al., 2007). The former strategy is dependent on two\ncritical characteristics of the algorithm; the placement rule\nand the placement order of the items.\nWhen irregular shaped items are involved an extra di\u0002mension of complexity is generated by the geometry. The\nno-fit polygon is the principal approach for handling the\ngeometry in cutting and packing problems with irregular\nshaped items (Burke et al., 2007; Bennell and Song, 2008;\nCosta et al., 2009). The no-fit polygon is used to ensure\nfeasible layouts; i.e. layouts where the items do not overlap\nand fit inside the container.\nIn this paper, the solution is represented as an ordered\nlist of items and a constructive heuristic is applied se\u0002quentially. A simulated annealing algorithm controls how\nthe items are ordered in the list and where the items are\nconstructively placed. The proposed algorithm has two\nhierarchical levels. The inner level solves the placement\nproblem where the container has fixed dimensions. The\nexternal level reduces or increases the container dimen\u0002sion that must be minimized. Experiments show that the\nproposed method is very efficient compared with other\npublished methods.\n2. PREVIOUS WORKS\nThe no-fit polygon alone has limited utility in cutting\nand packing problems. Some recent works are using the\ncollision free region to determine feasible layouts in con\u0002tainers with fixed dimensions. Martins and Tsuzuki (2006)\nproposed a constructive heuristic where the collision free\nPreprints of the 18th IFAC World Congress\nMilano (Italy) August 28 - September 2, 2011\nCopyright by the\nInternational Federation of Automatic Control (IFAC)\n3968\nFig. 1. Cost function behavior when the container has fixed\ndimensions. The cost function assumes only discrete\nvalues, while the rotating angle \u03b8 is continuous.\nregion represents feasible placements for a moveable item\nconsidering the already placed items and the container.\nThe cost function is the non occupied area inside the\ncontainer with fixed dimensions. As the non occupied\narea can change only by adding or removing areas of\nitems, the cost function can assume only a finite set of\nvalues, becoming discontinuous (see Fig. 1). A simulated\nannealing algorithm with adaptive neighborhood (Martins\nand Tsuzuki, 2008, 2009a) controls the sequence of items\nand the placement on the collision free region boundary.\nThe collision free region was calculated using regularized\nBoolean operations implemented with limited precision\n(Hobby, 1999).\nMartins and Tsuzuki (2007) combined the simulated an\u0002nealing with deterministic heuristics (larger first and bot\u0002tom left). They showed that it is possible to create problem\ninstances where deterministic heuristics cannot reach the\nlayout associated with the global optimum.\nSato et al. (2010) implemented a robust algorithm to\ndetermine the collision free region with two dimension\nnon manifold Boolean operations. They created a problem\ninstance where the the global optimum can not be reached\nby placing the moveable item exclusively on collision free\nregion vertices. Such situation rarely occurs considering\nstudied and practical problems. They showed several re\u0002sults where the area of the container was exactly equal\nto the total area of the items. The layout associated with\nglobal optimum was reached in averagely 15 times fewer\niterations when compared to previously published results\n(Martins and Tsuzuki, 2009b, 2010) where the area of the\ncontainer was larger than the total area of the items. The\ncorrect calculation of the collision free region showed to be\nan effective tool to obtain such results.\n3. NO-FIT POLYGONS AND COLLISION FREE\nREGION\nNo-fit polygons represent set of translations of an item\nand are mathematically represented by a set of vectors.\nFor a better understanding of the properties of the no-fit\npolygons, the set of translations of an item is represented\nby polygons in the plane. Every item has a reference point\nthat can be internal or external to it. The no-fit polygon\nrepresents a set of forbidden translations, as shown in\nFig. 2.

      "text": "What Is Simulated Annealing in AI? | Algorithm and Example\n[](https://gogloby.io)\nHire with Us\n* [Home](https://gogloby.io/)/\n* [AI Glossary](https://gogloby.io/ai-glossary/)/\n* Simulated Annealing In AI?\n[](https://gogloby.io)\n# What Is Simulated Annealing In AI?\n[Back to the list](https://gogloby.io/ai-glossary/)\n## Simulated Annealing In AI Definition\nArtificial intelligence Simulated annealing is a probabilistic algorithm that optimizes a problem based on the physical properties of annealing in metals, whereby the material is heated and gradually cooled to stabilize in a crystalline structure.\nSimulated annealing is a search algorithm applied in artificial intelligence in an attempt to approximate solutions to complex optimization problems. It does not become trapped in local optima by permitting some degradation of the solution at some times, and this probability diminishes as the temperature parameter decreases. This renders it very useful in AI where there are numerous possible states in a problem, large search spaces, or non-linear solution landscapes.\n### Key Takeaways\n* **Definition**: Simulated annealing is a probabilistic AI optimization inspired by metallurgical annealing.\n* **Search process**: it accepts worse solutions early on to escape local optima, then gradually converges as the temperature cools.\n* **Key parameters**: Initial solution, temperature, neighborhood, cost function, acceptance rule, cooling schedule, and stopping criteria.\n* **Cooling schedules**: Exponential, linear, logarithmic, and adaptive approaches balance exploration with convergence.\n* **Applications**: Widely used in scheduling, combinatorial optimization, neural network training, and constraint satisfaction.## Why and when is simulated annealing used in AI?\nSimulated annealing is applied in AI when the search space is too large to do exhaustive searches, solutions risk being trapped in local optima, and approximate solutions are satisfactory. It is common to use it in optimization, scheduling, neural network training, and constraint satisfaction problems.\n### Situations where simulated annealing is used\nSimulated annealing is applied to large and complicated search spaces, to problems where local optima are likely to be found, and to problems where there is no need to have a precise solution.\n* **Large or complex search spaces**: Cannot be fully explored by brute force methods.\n* **Risk of local optima**: Greedy algorithms may fail, while SA can escape traps.\n* **Approximate solutions**: Works well when near-optimal results are sufficient instead of exact solutions.### Applications of simulated annealing in AI\nSimulated annealing is applied in AI for scheduling and planning, combinatorial optimization, neural network training, and solving complex constraint satisfaction problems.\n* **Scheduling and planning:**Used for job-shop scheduling, time tabling, and resource allocation.\n* **Combinatorial optimization:**Helps solve the traveling salesman problem and similar NP-hard tasks.\n* **Neural network training:**Finds weight configurations that improve performance while avoiding poor minima.\n* **Constraint satisfaction:**Supports circuit design, allocation tasks, and other problems with multiple constraints.\nThis makes simulated annealing most valuable when exact solutions are computationally infeasible but high-quality results are still required.\n## How does simulated annealing search work?\nSimulated annealing search: In Simulated annealing search, the search is performed step by step by exploring potential solutions. It is also possible that at the start, the algorithm enables broader exploration and can even tolerate poor solutions to avoid local optima. With time, the more the temperature is lowered, the more selective it becomes and slowly focuses on a solution that is stable and nearly optimal.\n### Initialization\nIt begins with heuristically generated or randomly selected initial solution and a high temperature value. A large initial temperature provides the algorithm with a chance to search the search space widely without getting stuck in a local optimum at the beginning of the search.\n### Neighbor selection\nIn every step, a nearby solution is generated by making a little modification to the existing state. It may involve the replacement of elements, a change of positions, or change of values about the kind of problem. The neighborhood function determines the perturbation of solutions.\n### Evaluation\nAn objective or cost function is used in measuring the new candidate solution against the current one. This analysis will measure the goodness or badness of the new state relative to the current solution, and use this to determine whether it is accepted or not.\n### Acceptance criteria\nWhenever the new solution enhances the objective function, it is never rejected. When it is worse, it can yet be accepted, and with a probabilistic depending on the temperature itself and the cost difference itself. The rule assists the algorithm in overcoming local minima and proceeds with searching new areas of the solution space.\n### Cooling\nA cooling schedule (e.g., exponential or logarithmic) is followed after every iteration, decreasing the temperature. The colder the temperature, the less inclined to take worse solutions, and the algorithm will be driven towards convergence.\n### Termination\nThe search is terminated when the temperature falls below a minimum temperature, or the maximum number of iterations has been reached, or no further significant improvements are found. At this stage, the algorithm gives the solution that was considered the best.\n## What are the key components and parameters?\nThe main aspects of simulated annealing include the initial solution, temperature regulation, neighborhood function, cost function, acceptance probability, cooling schedule, and stopping criteria that determine the orientation of the algorithm in hunting and finding solutions.\n* **Initial solution:**The algorithm\u2019s starting point, chosen randomly or via heuristics. A good start can speed up convergence.\n* **Temperature (T):**Controls acceptance of worse solutions. High T allows wide exploration, low T pushes toward convergence.\n* **Neighborhood function:**Defines how new solutions are generated, e.g., swapping, shifting, or reversing elements.\n* **Cost or objective function:**Measures solution quality, such as total distance in the traveling salesman problem.\n* **Acceptance probability:**Often exp(\u2013\u0394E / T). Let the algorithm accept worse moves to escape local minima.\n* **Cooling schedule:**Determines how temperature decreases (linear, exponential, or logarithmic), balancing search and convergence.\n* **Stopping criteria:**Ends the algorithm when the temperature is low, iterations are exceeded, or no improvements appear.\nWhen the number of iterations set is surpassed or improvements are not recorded, then it indicates that the algorithm has reached its termination point. These parameters need careful tuning to achieve the right balance between exploration and exploitation, and frequently it is their combination that can give simulated annealing either a high-quality solution or a premature solution.\n## What are the cooling schedules in simulated annealing?\nThe cooling schedule defines how the temperature decreases during the search, directly shaping how the algorithm balances exploration and convergence. A well-designed schedule ensures that the system explores broadly at the start but gradually focuses on fine-tuning as it cools.\n### Exponential decay\nIn exponential cooling, the temperature is updated as T(k) = T0 \u00d7\u03b1^k, where 0 &lt; \u03b1&lt; 1. This is one of the most common and practical methods because it cools quickly while still allowing exploration in early iterations. However, if \u03b1is chosen poorly, the algorithm may converge too fast or too slowly.\n### Linear decay\nIn linear cooling, the temperature follows T(k) = T0 \u2013\u03b2k, where \u03b2is a fixed decrement. This method is simple to imple...",

We need to place the items into a minimal number of bins. The orienta\u0002tion of the items is parallel to the bounds of the bins. Overlaps of items are not al\u0002lowed.\nIn this paper we consider a more complicated real-world problem originating in\nthe steel industry. The bins are inhomogeneous sheets with impurities. We assume\nthat each impure area is rectangle. For each bin we are given a set of impurities,\nsize, and location of each impurity into the bin. As a consequence now the bins are\nnot identical anymore and the number of bins is finite. Moreover, we introduce the\nlinear order on the set of bins. First of all, we have to use the first bin. If we need\nadditional bins we use the second bin and so on. The items have the attribute\nwhether they can be located in the area with impurities. The goal is to find solu\u0002tions with a minimal number of bins.\nFor solving this NP-hard problem we have developed a tailored Simulated\nAnnealing algorithm (SA). Feasible solutions are presented by the directed root\ntree encoding scheme. It has linear decoding time if the maximal number of\n2 B. Beisiegel , J. Kallrath , Y. Kochetov , A. Rudnev\nencoding scheme. It has linear decoding time if the maximal number of impurities\nper bin is a constant. The initial solution is built by a greedy algorithm. It is a\npolynomial time heuristic which allows us to start SA with low temperature. The\nSA algorithm packs the items separately in each bin. It uses two types of neigh\u0002borhoods. The first one changes the structure of the directed root tree. The second\none swaps two items in the vertices of the tree. Computational experiments show\nthat the algorithm produces feasible solutions with small deviations from the\nlower bound within a few minutes.\n2 Representation of solutions\nThere are many encoding schemes for the 2D Rectangular Packing problems [3].\nIn this paper we use the oriented tree representation.\n2.1 Encoding\nLet us consider a feasible solution and show how to generate an oriented tree for\neach bin.\nDefinition 1. A feasible solution is called compacted if there is no item that can be\nshift left or bottom from its original position with other items fixed.\nIn Figure 1 we can see compacted and non-compacted feasible solutions. Further\nwe consider the compacted solutions only.\nDefinition 2. The item B is in the horizontal relation to the item A if\n1. B is to the right of A.\n2. The projections of A and B on the vertical axis are overlapped.\n3. A and B are either adjunct or are divided by impurities only.\nA\nE\nB\nF\nC\nD\nA\nE\nB\nF\nC\nD\nA\nE\nB\nF\nC\nD\nA\nE\nB\nF\nC\nD\nFig. 1. An example of non-compacted (left) and\ncompacted (right) placements for a bin\nSimulated Annealing Based Algorithm for the 2D Bin Packing Problem with Impurities 3\nThe oriented tree is built as follows. The set of nodes is the set of items in the bin\nwith an additional node representing the root of the tree. The root corresponds to a\ndummy item placed on the left bound of the bin. The height of this item is the\nheight of the bin. Node A is the parent of node B if item B is in horizontal relation\nto item A. If B is in horizontal relation with several items then the lowest one is the\nparent for B. In Figure 2 an example of oriented tree is presented.\n2.2 Decoding\nFor a given oriented tree we generate packing by the following way. The root\ndummy rectangle is placed on the left side of the bin. According to the depth-first\nrule for the tree, we place items one by one in such a way that the left side of each\nitem and the right side of its parent are on the same vertical line. The y-coordinate\nis defined by the previous packed items. Roughly speaking, we \u201cdrop\u201d the current\nitem on the right of its parent. If the item overlaps an impurity and cannot use it\nwe consider two new positions for the item: above and right of the impurity. In the\nfirst case the item is shifted upwards and put on the impurity. In the second case\nthe item is shifted to the right and put after the impurity. In the last case the new\nvertical position is defined by the previous packed items again. If the new position\nis overlapped with other impurities we put the item on the impurities. So we have\ntwo positions for the item. The lowest one is selected for packing. In Figure 3 we\nillustrate the idea of this algorithm. The time complexity of the algorithm is linear\nif the number of impurities per bin is a constant.\n0\n1\n2\nFig. 3.

Rudnev\n3 Neighborhood\nLet us consider an oriented root tree. Each node of the tree corresponds to an item.\nThe set of neighbors for the tree consists of two parts. In the first part we include\nall trees, which can be obtained by moving a leaf to another position. It gives us\nO(n\n2\n) neighbors, n is number of nodes. The second part of this set contains\n(n-1)(n-2)/2 neighbors. They are obtained by swapping items for the non root\nnodes. This neighborhood has the following property. We can reach an arbitrary\noriented root tree from an arbitrary starting tree in a finite number of steps by\nmoving from a tree to a neighboring one.\n4 Simulated annealing\nWe apply the Simulated Annealing algorithm [4] for each bin in parallel. The al\u0002gorithm is shown in Figure 4. The initial solution, i.e. initial set of trees, can be\nselected at random but we develop a polynomial time heuristic to get near optimal\nsolutions. It allows us to start SA with low temperature. The objective function\nF(T) which we wish to minimize is the used part of the bin with penalties. We ap\u0002ply the penalties for infeasible solutions when some items go out from the bin. For\nfixed temperature t>0 we apply the random search during prescribed number of it\u0002erations for all bins (Step3.1) and decrease the temperature (Step 3.2, r<1). If the\ncurrent solution is feasible we apply the Unload algorithm to change the set of\nitems into the bins. This algorithm tries to unload the last bins by moving or\nswapping \u201clarge\u201d items.\n1. Find initial tree for every bin\n2. Set initial temperature t>0\n3.

Simulated annealing\nSimulated Annealing Based Algorithm for the 2D Bin Packing Problem with Impurities 5\n5 The initial solution\nLet us remove all impurities of the bins and compute the lower bound NLB for the\nminimal number of bins [1]. Put the items in decreasing order of their areas and\ndeclare all bins are closed. Open the first NLB bins. We place the items into the\nbins one by one: the first item into the first bin, the second item into the second\nbin and so on. At the (NLB+1) step we put the current item into the NLB bin, the\nnext one we put into the (NLB -1) bin and so on. We try to distribute \u201clarge\u201d items\nthrough the NLB bins. If we spend all items then we have an optimal solution. Oth\u0002erwise we repeat this approach for the unpacked items. In Figure 5 we show the\nidea of this algorithm. It is polynomial time heuristic where we generate oriented\nroot trees for all bins step by step.\n6 Unload algorithm\nThis algorith...",

For large numbers of local optima, SA can find the global optimum.[&#91;1&#93;](#cite_note-1)It is often used when the search space is discrete (for example the[traveling salesman problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traveling_salesman_problem), the[boolean satisfiability problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_satisfiability_problem),[protein structure prediction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_structure_prediction), and[job-shop scheduling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Job-shop_scheduling)). For problems where a fixed amount of computing resource is available, finding an approximate global optimum may be more relevant than attempting to find a precise local optimum. In such cases, SA may be preferable to exact algorithms such as[gradient descent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent)or[branch and bound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_and_bound). The problems solved by SA are currently formulated by an[objective function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective_function)of many variables, subject to several[mathematical constraints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_constraints). In practice, a constraint violation can be penalized as part of the objective function.\nSimilar techniques have been independently introduced on several occasions, including Pincus (1970),[&#91;2&#93;](#cite_note-2)Khachaturyan et al. (1979,[&#91;3&#93;](#cite_note-3)1981[&#91;4&#93;](#cite_note-4)), Kirkpatrick, Gelatt and Vecchi (1983), and Cerny (1985).[&#91;5&#93;](#cite_note-5)In 1983, this approach was used by Kirkpatrick, Gelatt Jr., and Vecchi[&#91;6&#93;](#cite_note-:2-6)for a solution of the[traveling salesman problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traveling_salesman_problem). They also proposed its current name, simulated annealing.\nThe name of the algorithm comes from[annealing in metallurgy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annealing_(metallurgy)), a technique involving heating and controlled cooling of a material to alter its[physical properties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_properties). This notion of slow cooling implemented in the simulated annealing algorithm is interpreted as a slow decrease in the probability of accepting worse solutions as the solution space is explored. Accepting worse solutions allows for a more extensive search for the global optimal solution. Simulated annealing algorithms work by progressively decreasing the temperature from an initial positive value to zero. At each time step, the algorithm randomly selects a solution close to the current one, measures its quality, and moves to it according to the temperature-dependent probabilities of selecting better or worse solutions.\nThe simulation can be performed either by a solution of[kinetic equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kinetic_equations&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1)for[probability density functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_density_functions),[&#91;7&#93;](#cite_note-:0-7)[&#91;8&#93;](#cite_note-:1-8)or by using a[stochastic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic)sampling method.[&#91;6&#93;](#cite_...",

For example, if N=4, this is a solution:\n![](queens2.png)\nThe goal of this assignment is to solve the N-queens problem using simulated annealing.\nHere is the simulated annealing algorithm:\n```\nsimulated-annealing(*initial*solution)let*solution*be*initial*let*t*be an initial temperature\runtil*t*is almost zero\rlet*neighbor*be a random neighbor of*solution*if the cost of*neighbor*is less than the cost of*solution*let*solution*be*neighbor*stop if the cost is now 0\rotherwise\rlet*c*be the cost increase\rcompute*p*= e^(-c/t)\rwith probability*p*, let*solution*be*neighbor*multiply*t*by a decay rate\rreturn*solution*\n```\nA Board class and an Agent class have been started for you below. Once you complete the indicated methods, you will be able to watch a random initial solution being annealed. Adjust the height of your console window to match the board height, so that each display appears in the same place.\n**Algorithm notes:**\n* You will need to decide on a cost function that decreases towards 0 as the board gets closer to a solution.\n* You will also need to decide what types of moves to allow and how to represent them.\n* Finally, you will need to keep track of the sequence of moves taken during the annealing process.\n**Parameter notes:**\n* You may need to try a few values for the initial temperature (e.g. 1, 10, 100), the stopping threshold (e.g. 0.1, 0.01, 0.001), and the decay rate (e.g. 0.9, 0.99, 0.999) to find an effective combination.\n```\nimport time\rimport random\rclass Board(object):\r\"\"\"An N-queens solution attempt.\"\"\"\rdef \\_\\_init\\_\\_(self, queens):\r\"\"\"Instances differ by their queen placements.\"\"\"\rself.queens = queens.copy() # No aliasing!\rdef display(self):\r\"\"\"Print the board.\"\"\"\rfor r in range(len(self.queens)):\rfor c in range(len(self.queens)):\rif self.queens[c] == r:\rprint 'Q',\relse:\rprint '-',\rprint\rprint\rdef moves(self):\r\"\"\"Return a list of possible moves given the current placements.\"\"\"\r# YOU FILL THIS IN\rdef neighbor(self, move):\r\"\"\"Return a Board instance like this one but with one move made.\"\"\"\r# YOU FILL THIS IN\rdef cost(self):\r\"\"\"Compute the cost of this solution.\"\"\"\r# YOU FILL THIS IN\rclass Agent(object):\r\"\"\"Knows how to solve an n-queens problem with simulated annealing.\"\"\"\rdef anneal(self, board):\r\"\"\"Return a list of moves to adjust queen placements.\"\"\"\r# YOU FILL THIS IN\rdef main():\r\"\"\"Create a problem, solve it with simulated anealing, and console-animate.\"\"\"\rqueens = dict()\rfor col in range(8):\rrow = random.choice(range(8))\rqueens[col] = row\rboard = Board(queens)\rboard.display()\ragent = Agent()\rpath = agent.anneal(board)\rwhile path:\rmove = path.pop(0)\rboard = board.neighbor(move)\rtime.sleep(0.1)\rboard.display()\rif \\_\\_name\\_\\_ == '\\_\\_main\\_\\_':\rmain()\n```",

This problem is approached with an heuristic based on Simulated Annealing (SA) with adaptive neighborhood. Traditional \u201cexternal penalization\u201d techniques are avoided through the application of the no\u2013fit polygon, that determinates the collision-free area for each polygon before its placement. The SA controls continuous and discrete parameters. The rotation applied and the translation of the polygon are continuous parameters, and the sequence of placement is represented as a set of discrete parameters. For each non\u2013placed item, a limited depth binary search is performed to find a scale factor that when applied to the item, would allow it to be fitted in the container.\n\n- [Previous article in issue](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1474667015355488)\n- [Next article in issue](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1474667015355506)\n\n## Keywords\n\nSimulated Annealing\n\nPlacement Problems\n\nOptimization\n\nProbabilistic Heuristics\n\n[View PDF](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S147466701535549X/pdf?md5=7bca88c33d2daef044751913b4156e2b&pid=1-s2.0-S147466701535549X-main.pdf)\n\nSpecial issue articlesRecommended articles\n\n## References\n\n01.
