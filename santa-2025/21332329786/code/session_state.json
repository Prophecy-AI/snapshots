For identical shapes, this can achieve near-optimal packing density. Key steps: (1) Compute No-Fit Polygon (NFP) for valid placement vectors, (2) Iterate through lattice configurations, (3) Optimize base configuration and translation vectors using SA. This is fundamentally different from local optimization - it exploits periodicity for large N.",

      "query": "What is the tessellation or lattice approach for 2D polygon packing optimization problems?",
      "finding": "The tessellation or lattice approach for 2D polygon packing optimization problems involves arranging polygons in a regular, repeating pattern that fills the plane without overlaps or gaps. This method leverages the concept of tessellation, where a shape or set of shapes tile a surface in a systematic way, often using a lattice structure to define the positions and orientations of the polygons ([Result 1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6242836); [Result 2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0377221799001150)). In these approaches, the plane is divided into a grid or lattice, and polygons are placed at lattice points according to specific rules, such as rotation angles and spacing, to optimize space utilization.\n\nLattice-based packing often aims to maximize the density of congruent polygons arranged in a periodic pattern, which can be mathematically modeled using functions like the \u03a6-function to find optimal configurations ([Result 2](https://www.sciencedire",
