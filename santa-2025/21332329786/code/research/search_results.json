      "text": "The tessellation or lattice approach for 2D polygon packing optimization problems involves arranging polygons in a regular, repeating pattern that fills the plane without overlaps or gaps. This method leverages the concept of tessellation, where a shape or set of shapes tile a surface in a systematic way, often using a lattice structure to define the positions and orientations of the polygons ([Result 1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6242836); [Result 2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0377221799001150)). In these approaches, the plane is divided into a grid or lattice, and polygons are placed at lattice points according to specific rules, such as rotation angles and spacing, to optimize space utilization.\n\nLattice-based packing often aims to maximize the density of congruent polygons arranged in a periodic pattern, which can be mathematically modeled using functions like the \u03a6-function to find optimal configurations ([Result 2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0377221799001150)). These methods are particularly useful for problems where the shapes are identical and the goal is to find the most efficient, repeating arrangement. They are applied in various industrial contexts, such as sheet metal cutting, textile manufacturing, and material layout design, where maximizing material usage is critical ([Result 7](https://paginas.fe.up.pt/~balobo/PPExt/Papers/CGO09.pdf)). Overall, the lattice approach provides a structured framework for solving polygon packing problems by exploiting symmetry, periodicity, and geometric regularity to achieve optimal or near-optimal packing solutions.",

Fabrication of molecular tessellation with higher symmetry compared with traditional Bravais lattices promises potential applications as photonic crystals. Here, we demonstrate that highly complex tessellation can be constructed on Au(111) from a single molecular building block, hexakis(4-iodophenyl)benzene (HPBI). HPBI gives rise to two self-assembly phases on Au(111) that possess the same geometric symmetry but different packing densities, on account of the presence of halogen-bonded and halogen\u2013metal coordinated networks. Sub-domains of these phases with self-similarity serve as tiles in the periodic tessellations to express polygons consisting of parallelograms and two types of triangles. Our work highlights the important principle of constructing multiple phases with self-similarity from a single building block, which may constitute a new route to construct complex tessellations.\n\nMolecular tessellations of complex tilings are difficult to design and construct. Here, the authors show that molecular tessellations can be formed from a single building block that gives rise to two distinct supramolecular phases, whose self-similar subdomains serve as tiles in the periodic tessellations.\n\n## Introduction\n\nTwo-dimensional (2D) tessellation involves the tiling of a plane using one or more cl...",

The feasible solution region is contained in the set of pairs of points of the _\u03a6_-function 0-level surface of the polygon. The region is partitioned into a finite number of subregions corresponding to pairs of linear segments of the _\u03a6_-function 0-level surface. The frontiers of the subregions are generated by the conditions of non-overlapping of polygons. Only four such conditions imply non-overlapping of each pair of polygons in a lattice packing. The solution can be attained only in a finite number of points on the frontiers of these subregions. Hence, it is possible to use an organized sorting of such points with discarding of subregions whose objective function upper bound is lower than the record.\n\n## Introduction\n\nIt is necessary to find such a lattice 6, 22, 10 packing of congruent similarly oriented non-overlapping non-convex bounded polygons in the plane so that the density of packing \\[22\\] of the plane with these polygons be the greatest.\n\nThe problems of lattice packing of geometric objects were considered in the works of Refs. 20, 6, 22, 23, 27, 7, 9. Packings being exact coverings and their connection with Fyodorov's crystallographic groups 10, 11 were investigated in the works of Ref. \\[12\\]. Optimization problems of regular (single-row, multirow and lattice \\[22\\]) packing of geometric objects were investigated in the works of Refs. 24, 27, 23, 7, 9. For convex polygons the optimal lattice packing problem was investigated in Ref. \\[21\\]. The lower bounds for double lattice packings of centrally symmetric convex bodies were obtained by Kuperberg and Kuperberg \\[16\\].\n\nThe concept of _\u03a6_-functions \\[28\\] made it possible to represent various cutting and packing problems in terms of mathematical programming. _\u03a6_-function is a function on the set of placement parameters of objects positive when the objects are non-overlapping and negative if their interiorities intersect. 0-level surface of the _\u03a6_-function is the hodograph of the dense placement function \\[25\\] or the frontier of the non-fit polygon \\[19\\].\n\nIn the frames of the typology of cutting and packing problems proposed by Dyckhoff \\[4\\] our problem may be classified as two-dimensional \\`Beladeproblem' with one object (infinite plane) and congruent items (polygons) (abbreviation 2/B/O/C).\n\nThe approach adopted in this work for solving the problem in consideration is based on the use of the _\u03a6_-function properties \\[28\\] as well as on the concept of decomposition of the problem proposed in Refs. 7, 9 and on the properties of lattice packings investigated in Refs. 7, 9.\n\nWe give here proofs of the results justifying the approach proposed in Refs. 7, 9, select the set of pairs of the _\u03a6_-function 0-level surface vertices on which extremum can be attained. Algorithmic realization involves treating singularity cases and estimations reducing the region of feasible solutions.\n\nMethods of construction of 0-level surface of the _\u03a6_-function proposed in Refs. 14, 17, 1, 19 were used when obtaining optimal lattice packings.\n\nIn the present paper we describe in Section 2some properties of _\u03a6_-function and its 0-level surface used for formalization of conditions of mutual non-overlapping of polygons.\n\nIn Section 3some properties of lattices used when simplifying the mathematical model of the problem are described.\n\nIn Section 4the mathematical model of the problem is formulated. The number of conditions describing the region of feasible solutions is reduced by means of applying some properties of densest lattice packings. Namely, it is shown that for finding a densest lattice packing only lattice packings in which a polygon touches two ones obtained by translations by the basis lattice vectors may be taken into account. It is also shown that when a lattice packing is dense all the conditions of mutual non-overlapping are implied by only four ones written for the combinations _a_ 1, _a_ 2, _a_ 1+ _a_ 2, \u2212 _a_ 1+ _a_ 2 of basis lattice vectors _a_ 1 and _a_ 2. Thus, the ends of basis lattice vectors _a_ 1 and _a_ 2 lie on the piecewise linear _\u03a6_-function 0-level surface and satisfy a structure \\[18\\] of linear equations.\n\nIn Section 5the feasible solution region is decomposed into subsets represented parametrically as subsets of \\[0,1\\]\u00d7\\[0,1\\] with a piecewise linear frontier. The objective function in our problem has no extrema in the interiors of such subregions. Since each segment of their frontier has a unique extremum a sorting of such extrema allows to solve the problem.\n\n## Section snippets\n\n## Formalization of conditions of mutual non-overlapping of polygons\n\nIn order to construct a mathematical model of the problem it is necessary to present the objective function and the constraints describing the region of feasible solutions in the analytical form. The conditions of mutual non-overlapping of the polygons are such constraints.\n\nWe designate the interior of _S_ as intS, the closure of _S_ as clS and the frontier of _S_ as frS.\n\nLet there be a polygon _S_ _i_. Its position in _R_ 2 is well known to be fully characterized by three parameters _x_ _i_, _y_ _i_, _\u03b8_ _i_ where ( _x_ _i_, _y_ _i_)= _v_ _i_\n\n## Lattices and lattice packing\n\nIf _a_ 1, _a_ 2\u2208 _R_ 2 are linearly independent, a set of vectors \\[22\\]r=na1+ma2,n,m\u2208Z,is called a lattice with the basis _a_ 1, _a_ 2 and is denoted by _L_ = _\u039b_( _a_ 1, _a_ 2) where Z={0,\u00b11,\u00b12,\u2026} is the set of integers, _\u039b_ is an operator mapping a set of pairs of vectors onto a set of families of the form (6)....",

Introduction\nNesting has been widely studied (Dowsland and Dows\u0002land, 1992), as it is a common problem in several industrial\nproduction processes (textile, garment, footwear, metal\u0002ware, furniture, etc.). Most of the published papers impose\norientation constraints: the shape can only be rotated a\npredetermined number of fixed angles (the most common\nis 180\u0003 and, less commonly, 90\u0003) or it cannot be rotated\nat all. However, in certain particular cases, orientation con\u0002straints do not arise. Additionally, some industries fre\u0002quently need to cut big quantities of each type of shape.\nIn these two situations, the periodic packing of the shapes\n(lattice packing) proved to be a very competitive approach,\nbecause:\n\u2013 good cutting patterns, with very small waste, can be\nobtained;\n\u2013 the automatic cutting process is more efficient when a\nperiodic placement is considered;\n\u2013 reduced computational time (when compared with gen\u0002eral nesting approaches, where each piece has to be trea\u0002ted individually), which allows to tackle problems of\ngreater dimension.\nIn this section, we start by describing the problem and\nrefer to related works in a brief review. In Section 2, we\npoint out the geometric considerations necessary to under\u0002stand this work. Section 3 describes the underlying rules\nand criteria used to build the three heuristic approaches,\nwhich are proposed in the fourth section.

Finally, in\nthe last section, we draw conclusions and make some com\u0002ments about future work.\n1.1. Problem description\nThe periodic placement of congruent copies of one\nshape can be found in literature under the keywords \u2018\u2018peri\u0002odic packing\u2019\u2019, \u2018\u2018regular packing\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018lattice packing\u2019\u2019. The\nlattice packing may be defined over an infinite plane or a\nlimited sheet. If it is the plane, the main objective is to reg\u0002ularly place the shapes so that the density obtained is max\u0002imised. When lattice packing on a limited stock sheet, the\ngoal is to maximise the percentage of stock sheet utilisa\u0002tion, which is equivalent to maximise the number of shapes\nplaced inside the plate. As will be shown later, these two\n\u2018\u2018apparently\u2019\u2019 similar objectives are not quite equivalent.\nHowever, the definition of a lattice is identical in the two\nsituations. A lattice is generated by two linearly indepen\u0002dent vectors, v0 and v1, whose linear combinations will pro\u0002duce a grid that guarantees that pieces do not overlap. The\nshapes are located in each node of the grid.\nThe problem we propose to solve does not considerer\norientation constraints, so, any rotation of the given shape\ncan be allowed. However, after a specific orientation is cho\u0002sen, all the shapes must follow the same orientation (Sin\u0002gle-Lattice \u2013 Fig. 1a) or be alternately rotated 180\u0003\n(Double-Lattice \u2013 Fig. 1b). According to the typology by\nWa\u00a8scher et al. (2007), the problem described in this paper\nis a 2-dimensional irregular IIPP (Identical Item Packing\nProblem).\nThe orientation of the shapes is not relevant when lattice\npacking on the plane, as maximum density remains\nunchanged. However, when stock sheet borders need to\nbe taken into account, the orientation of the shapes may\nbe extremely important as will be shown in the following\nsections.\nIn this work, we propose to solve the problem of Peri\u0002odic Packing of Irregular Shapes (PPIS) on a limited stock\nsheet (a rectangle) by heuristic methods.\n1.2. Related work\nThere are references in the literature to the Lattice Pack\u0002ing Problem since the fifties, the first results concerning\nonly theoretical aspects of the lattice packing of a single\nconvex polygon on the plane (Rogers, 1951). However,\nonly a few publications during the next 30 years can be\nfound, and some of them are just marginally related to lat\u0002tice packing. O\u2019Rourke et al. (1986) have considered the\nproblem of finding minimal enclosing triangles and Dori\nand Ben Bassat (1983) have dealt with the problem of find\u0002ing minimal enclosing convex polygons with fewer sides.\nThose approaches can be seen as a pre-processing to lattice\npacking, as regular convex polygons can be easily packed\nthan the original ones.\nBetween 1990 and 2000, essentially theoretical results on\nlattice lacking have been published, mostly considering\nunlimited sheets and convex shapes (Mount and Silverman,\n1990; Mount, 1991; Kuperberg and Kuperberg, 1990; Sto\u0002yan and Patsuk, 2000).\nMore recently, results concerning real industrial prob\u0002lems, with limited sheets, irregular shapes and no orienta\u0002tion constraints, have been published. Prasad et al. (1995)\ndescribe a nesting problem of irregular shaped metal\nblanks and propose a heuristic search, considering the var\u0002iation in the orientation of the blanks on the stock sheet. In\nCheng and Rao (1999), Cheng and Rao (2000), Milenkovic\n(2002), heuristic algorithms have also been proposed, to\nsolve problems concerning real industrial irregular shapes\nand limited sheets. Simplifications of a mathematical model\nare described and solved to optimality by Stoyan and Pan\u0002kratov (1999), being the presented results related to an\napplication in the footwear industry.\nWhen lattice packing on the plane, the vectors v0 and v1\nmust be chosen (Fig. 2) so that the density of the packing is\nmaximised (Milenkovic, 2002), what corresponds to mini\u0002mising the area of the parallelogram defined by the two\nvectors, minjv0 \u00b7 v1j. When lattice packing on a limited\nstock sheet, the vectors v0 and v1 must be chosen so that\nthe number of shapes entirely placed inside the stock sheet\nis maximised. However, maximising the percentage of\nstock sheet utilisation does not always correspond to a\nmaximum density lattice (as if there were no borders). This\ncan be shown with the simple example given in Fig. 2. It\ncan be ea...",

That requirement number 3 does not seem entirely natural imho because it excludes the triangular aka hexagonal lattice \"A2\" in 2D. The packing of triangles as opposed to hexagons is a very symmetric tiling of 2D space with one element, arguably superior to the hexagonal packing you describe (which is 2/3 of the A2 lattice corresponding to the packing of triangles). Imho in 2D, you want to exclude a rectangular packing but include the square packing to define an interesting category. 7D diplo-simplex is actually excluded by (1), not equilateral$\\\\endgroup$\n\n\u2013\u00a0[Dan Haxton](https://math.stackexchange.com/users/789922/dan-haxton)\n\nCommentedJan 19, 2022 at 4:21\n\n- $\\\\begingroup$In other words it seems that you are imposing a maximum convexity requirement with (3) and I do not think this can be satisfied.. I think you are requiring that the coordination number of a vertex in N dimensions must be N+1, i.e. vertex figure and voronoi polytope is a simplex, and while the hexagonal packing satisfies your criteria because its voronoi tesselation is the A2 lattice, the A2 lattice is the only simplex packing, so I think the hexagonal packing is provably the only example that satisfies your criteria$\\\\endgroup$\n\n\u2013\u00a0[Dan Haxton](https://math.stackexchange.com/users/789922/dan-haxton)\n\nCommentedJan 19, 2022 at 4:43\n\n- $\\\\begingroup$I think that the Schlafli 2\\_21 polytope is equilateral, having edges of the same length, and I think that this is the best you can do.

The goal is to either pack a single container as[densely](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packing_density)as possible or pack all objects using as few containers as possible. Many of these problems can be related to real-life[packaging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packaging), storage and transportation issues. Each packing problem has a dual[covering problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covering_problem), which asks how many of the same objects are required to completely cover every region of the container, where objects are allowed to overlap.\nIn a[bin packing problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bin_packing_problem), people are given:\n* A*container*, usually a two- or three-dimensional[convex region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_region), possibly of infinite size. Multiple containers may be given depending on the problem.\n* A set of*objects*, some or all of which must be packed into one or more containers. The set may contain different objects with their sizes specified, or a single object of a fixed dimension that can be used repeatedly.\nUsually the packing must be without overlaps between goods and other goods or the container walls. In some variants, the aim is to find the configuration that packs a single container with the maximal[packing density](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packing_density).

A particular case of the nesting problem occurs when congruent copies of one single shape have to fill, as much as possible, a limited sheet. Traditional approaches to the nesting problem have difficulty to tackle with high number of pieces to place. Additionally, if the orientation of the given shape is not a constraint, the general nesting approaches are not particularly successful. This problem arises in practice in several industrial contexts such as footwear, metalware and furniture. A possible approach is the periodic placement of the shapes, in a lattice way. In this paper, we propose three heuristic approaches to solve this particular case of nesting problems. Experimental results are compared with published results in literature and additional results obtained from new instances are also provided.\n## Introduction\nNesting has been widely studied (Dowsland and Dowsland, 1992), as it is a common problem in several industrial production processes (textile, garment, footwear, metalware, furniture, etc.). Most of the published papers impose orientation constraints: the shape can only be rotated a predetermined number of fixed angles (the most common is 180\u00b0 and, less commonly, 90\u00b0) or it cannot be rotated at all. However, in certain particular cases, orientation constraints do not arise. Additionally, some industries frequently need to cut big quantities of each type of shape. In these two situations, the periodic packing of the shapes (lattice packing) proved to be a very competitive approach, because:\n* \u2013good cutting patterns, with very small waste, can be obtained;\n* \u2013the automatic cutting process is more efficient when a periodic placement is considered;\n* \u2013reduced computational time (when compared with general nesting approaches, where each piece has to be treated individually), which allows to tackle problems of greater dimension.\nIn this section, we start by describing the problem and refer to related works in a brief review. In Section 2, we point out the geometric considerations necessary to understand this work. Section 3 describes the underlying rules and criteria used to build the three heuristic approaches, which are proposed in the fourth section. In Section 5, the instances used to evaluate the quality of the proposed approaches are defined and the results obtained with all the three heuristics are presented and compared. Finally, in the last section, we draw conclusions and make some comments about future work.\nThe periodic placement of congruent copies of one shape can be found in literature under the keywords \u201cperiodic packing\u201d, \u201cregular packing\u201d or \u201clattice packing\u201d. The lattice packing may be defined over an infinite plane or a limited sheet. If it is the plane, the main objective is to regularly place the shapes so that the density obtained is maximised. When lattice packing on a limited stock sheet, the goal is to maximise the percentage of stock sheet utilisation, which is equivalent to maximise the number of shapes placed inside the plate. As will be shown later, these two \u201capparently\u201d similar objectives are not quite equivalent. However, the definition of a lattice is identical in the two situations. A lattice is generated by two linearly independent vectors,*v*0and*v*1, whose linear combinations will produce a grid that guarantees that pieces do not overlap. The shapes are located in each node of the grid.\nThe problem we propose to solve does not considerer orientation constraints, so, any rotation of the given shape can be allowed. However, after a specific orientation is chosen, all the shapes must follow the same orientation (*Single-Lattice*\u2013 Fig. 1a) or be alternately rotated 180\u00b0 (*Double-Lattice*\u2013 Fig. 1b). According to the typology by W\u00e4scher et al. (2007), the problem described in this paper is a 2-dimensional irregular IIPP (Identical Item Packing Problem).\nThe orientation of the shapes is not relevant when lattice packing on the plane, as maximum density remains unchanged. However, when stock sheet borders need to be taken into account, the orientation of the shapes may be extremely important as will be shown in the following sections.\nIn this work, we propose to solve the problem of Periodic Packing of Irregular Shapes (PPIS) on a limited stock sheet (a rectangle) by heuristic methods.\nThere are references in the literature to the Lattice Packing Problem since the fifties, the first results concerning only theoretical aspects of the lattice packing of a single convex polygon on the plane (Rogers, 1951). However, only a few publications during the next 30 years can be found, and some of them are just marginally related to lattice packing. O\u2019Rourke et al. (1986) have considered the problem of finding minimal enclosing triangles and Dori and Ben Bassat (1983) have dealt with the problem of finding minimal enclosing convex polygons with fewer sides. Those approaches can be seen as a pre-processing to lattice packing, as regular convex polygons can be easily packed than the original ones.\nBetween 1990 and 2000, essentially theoretical results on lattice lacking have been published, mostly considering unlimited sheets and convex shapes (Mount and Silverman, 1990, Mount, 1991, Kuperberg and Kuperberg, 1990, Stoyan and Patsuk, 2000).\nMore recently, results concerning real industrial problems, with limited sheets, irregular shapes and no orientation constraints, have been published. Prasad et al. (1995) describe a nesting problem of irregular shaped metal blanks and propose a heuristic search, considering the variation in the or...",

In doing so we consider only those packings for which the polygons form rows (columns) parallel to one of the sheet sides. The problem arises in many branches of industry in particular in footwear industry. The mathematical model of the problem is built. Simplification of the mathematical model, reducing of the problem dimensionality and its decomposition on a number of independent subproblems is done on the basis of analysis of the properties of the mathematical model. The approximate method to solve the problem is suggested. The example of solving of the real problem is given.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe rectangular sheet packing (cutting) is called a regular one if the pieces landed in it form a fragment of some single lattice packing (Fig. 1(a)) or double lattice packing (Fig. 1(b)). We shall be restricted by the case of pieces which can be represented as polygons i.e. point subsets the arithmetic Euclidean space R2 homeomorphic to a nonempty circle and having a piecewise linear frontier.\n\n_Problem statement_: Let there be a rectangular sheet of material having the size _A_ \u00d7 _B_ and a polygonal piece. It is required to find a regular cutting of the sheet on the congruent polygonal pieces (in what follows polygons) which provides the optimal dense factor.\n\nThus the objective is to find a way of packing identical copies using regular patterns allowing just two orientations.\n\nA great number of papers have devoted various aspects of the problem of optimal packing of the given set of objects in the bounded domains. As a rule, because of the cumbersome calculations and the complexity of formalization the mathematical models of these problems are frequently simplified and so they are approximately solved 1, 2, 3, 4, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 21, 22. The methods of the exact solution for some types of the above mentioned problems appeared only recently \\[23\\]. The bibliography of scientific publications considering mathematical models construction and development of the methods of the solution of the packing (cutting) problems is given in 5, 6, 28. These publications show the contemporary level of investigations in the field of irregular packing.\n\nMany authors pay much attention to the problems of optimal packing of the plane. Lattice packings of geometric objects were considered by Minkovsky \\[18\\], Feies Tot \\[7\\], Rogers \\[20\\], Stoyan 24, 25 and Fesenko 8, 9, 10. Packings being exact coverings and their connection with Fyodorov's crystallographic groups 11, 12 were investigated in the works of Heesch \\[13\\]. The problem of searching for the optimal regular (single-row, multi-row and lattice \\[20\\]) packings of geometric objects were considered by Stoyan 21, 24, 25 and Fesenko 8, 10. Double lattice packing for two sets of polygons, one of them being obtained by the rotation of the other polygon about the angle _\u03c0_, was considered in \\[26\\].\n\nApart from these two basic trends of investigations the class of intermediate problems may be selected which are of practical and theoretical interest. To such problems there relates the problem of sheet cutting onto a great number of equal details (up to some hundreds of details). On the one hand, a great number of equal details is advantageous for regular cutting (lattice packings) and on the other hand, since the placement domain is bounded, we have to take into account the conditions of object landing in the sheet that makes the mathematical model much more complex and requires the working out special methods to solve it. The approach adopted in this work for solving the problem of optimal lattice packing of congruent oriented polygons on the rectangular sheet is based on the use of the _\u03a6_-function apparatus 23, 27 as well as on the properties of lattice packings investigated in 8, 10. Methods of construction of 0-level surface of the _\u03a6_-function proposed in \\[14\\] are used when obtaining lattice packings.\n\nThe statement of the problem of regular cutting of the rectangular sheet is formulated and its mathematical model is built. The efficient method to solve it is suggested.\n\nThe paper is organized as follows. The basic definitions used in this paper are given and a set of bases of dense lattice packing of the polygon built on the plane are described in Section 2. A set of bases of dense lattice packings of the given polygon built on the sheet is considered in Section 3. Additional restrictions of technological nature on the basis of regular packings are analyzed and a set of bases of dense lattice packings satisfying these restrictions is chosen in Section 4. The mathematical model of problem is formulated, its properties are studied and the approximate method of its solution is suggested in Section 5. Some examples are also given here.\n\n## Section snippets\n\n## Lattices and lattice packings in R2\n\nSince lattices and lattice packings are the basis of the problem being studied, let us consider these notions in detail. The set of vectorsr=na1+ma2,n,m\u2208Z(where a1=(a1x,a1y),a2=(a2x,a2y)\u2208R2 are linearly independent and Z={0,\u00b11,\u00b12,\u2026} is the set of integers) is called the lattice with the basis _a_ 1, _a_ 2 and it is designated as _L_ = _\u039b_( _a_ 1, _a_ 2)( _\u039b_ is the operator mapping a set of pairs of vectors at a set of families of the type (1)) \\[20\\]. The pair _W_ =( _L_, _L_ + _b_) of two lattices _L_ and _L_ + _b_, _b_ =( _b_ _x_, _b_ _y_) where _L_ + _b_ is\n\n## Lattice packings onto the sheet\n\nWhen considering lattice packings of the objects on the sheet (generally speaking in any bounded region) it ...",
