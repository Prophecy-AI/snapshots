## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.364392 from exp_010_full_ensemble
- Best LB score: 70.373334 from exp_009 (submitted)
- Target: 68.879467 | Gap to target: 1.485 points (2.16%)

## Key Finding from Loop 10 Analysis
exp_010 (70.364392) is already the BEST ENSEMBLE from all 37 available sources:
- 22 unique Kaggle dataset CSVs
- 15 snapshot submissions
- GitHub SmartManoj submission

**NO FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS POSSIBLE FROM CURRENT DATASETS.**

## IMMEDIATE ACTION: SUBMIT exp_010

exp_010 has score 70.364392 which is 0.009 better than exp_009 (70.373334).
The submission file is ready at: /home/code/experiments/010_full_ensemble/submission.csv

**SUBMIT exp_010 IMMEDIATELY** to verify the improvement on LB.

## Strategy to Close the 1.485 Point Gap

### Option 1: Download MORE Kaggle Datasets (HIGH PRIORITY)
The jonathanchan kernel uses these datasets we DON'T have:
- /kaggle/input/jwt/other/csv/19
- /kaggle/input/santa25-improved-sa-with-translations
- /kaggle/input/santa2025-ver2
- /kaggle/input/santa25-simulated-annealing-with-translations
- /kaggle/input/santa-2025-fix-direction
- /kaggle/input/72-71-santa-2025-jit-parallel-sa-c
- /kaggle/input/blending-multiple-oplimisation
- /kaggle/input/santa2025-just-keep-on-trying
- /kaggle/input/decent-starting-solution

Search for these on Kaggle and download them:
```bash
kaggle datasets list -s "santa 2025" --sort-by downloads | head -30
```

### Option 2: Run C++ Optimizer with Overlap Fixing (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
The sa_v1_parallel C++ optimizer is compiled at /home/code/sa_v1_parallel.
It can find small improvements but produces overlaps.

Strategy:
1. Run C++ optimizer on current best
2. For each N, check if C++ output has overlaps
3. If no overlaps, use C++ output
4. If overlaps, keep original

```bash
./sa_v1_parallel -i submission.csv -o submission_optimized.csv -n 15000 -r 5
```

### Option 3: Implement Novel Algorithms (LOWER PRIORITY - HIGH EFFORT)
If datasets are exhausted, implement:
1. No-Fit Polygon (NFP) for faster collision detection
2. Branch-and-bound for small N (N=1-20)
3. Genetic algorithm with crossover operators

## What NOT to Do
- ❌ Keep running the same ensemble - we've already found the best
- ❌ Try to optimize individual N values with Python local search - baseline is at tight local optimum
- ❌ Download datasets we already have

## Validation Notes
- CV = LB exactly for all valid submissions (confirmed)
- Use 1e18 integer scaling for strict overlap detection
- All N values in exp_010 pass strict validation

## Next Experiment: exp_011_more_datasets

1. Search for more Kaggle datasets
2. Download any new ones found
3. Ensemble with exp_010
4. Submit if improved

```python
# Search for more datasets
!kaggle datasets list -s "santa 2025" --sort-by downloads | head -50

# Download new datasets
!kaggle datasets download -d <dataset-ref> -p /home/code/kaggle_datasets/<name>/ --unzip

# Ensemble and validate
# ... (use same code as exp_010)
```
