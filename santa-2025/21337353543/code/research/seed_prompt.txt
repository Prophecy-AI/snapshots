## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.364392 from exp_010 (full ensemble)
- Best LB score: 70.3733 (exp_009 - not yet submitted exp_010)
- Target: 68.879467 | Gap to target: 1.485 points (2.1%)

## CV-LB Relationship Analysis
- CV = LB EXACTLY for all valid submissions (perfect alignment)
- This means any CV improvement translates directly to LB improvement
- No distribution shift - just need better solutions

## Response to Evaluator
The evaluator correctly identified that:
1. ✅ Diverse source strategy is WORKING - we improved from 70.615 to 70.373 to 70.364
2. ✅ CV-LB alignment is PERFECT (no gap)
3. ✅ Need to ensemble ALL available sources

I've now implemented the full ensemble from 22 sources and found 42 additional improvements from the chistyakov dataset. The improvement is 0.009 points - small but real progress.

## What's Working
1. **Diverse source ensembling**: Each new source adds small improvements
2. **Per-N best selection**: Taking best per-N from all sources works
3. **Strict validation (1e18 scaling)**: Matches Kaggle exactly

## What's NOT Working
1. **Local optimization**: SA, fractional translation find only microscopic improvements
2. **Single-source approaches**: Any single source is worse than ensemble
3. **Python optimization**: Too slow to compete with C++ optimizers

## Gap Analysis: 1.485 Points to Target

**Where can we find 1.485 more points?**

The jonathanchan kernel uses 15+ diverse sources. We have:
- exp_009 (santa-2025.csv + exp_008)
- chistyakov dataset (70.378)
- bucket-of-chump (just downloaded)
- santa25-public (17 files)
- telegram-public-shared-solution

**Sources NOT yet ensembled:**
1. bucket-of-chump/submission.csv (just downloaded)
2. More Kaggle notebooks (need to download their outputs)
3. GitHub SmartManoj (already checked - worse than ours)

## Recommended Approaches (Priority Order)

### 1. **IMMEDIATE: Submit exp_010 to verify improvement**
Score: 70.364392 (improvement of 0.009 over exp_009)
This should give LB = 70.364392 (exact match expected)

### 2. **HIGH PRIORITY: Download more Kaggle notebook outputs**
The jonathanchan kernel lists these sources we don't have:
- santa-2025-try3
- santa2025-just-keep-on-trying
- santa25-improved-sa-with-translations
- blending-multiple-oplimisation
- decent-starting-solution

Each new diverse source could add 0.01-0.1 points.

### 3. **MEDIUM PRIORITY: Run C++ optimizer on ensemble**
The sa_v1_parallel C++ optimizer is compiled at /home/code/sa_v1_parallel
It can find small improvements but produces overlaps.
Strategy: Run C++ optimizer, then post-process to fix overlaps using Python validation.

### 4. **LOWER PRIORITY: Implement novel algorithms**
If diverse sources are exhausted, implement:
- No-Fit Polygon (NFP) for faster collision detection
- Branch-and-bound for small N (N=1-20)
- Genetic algorithm with custom crossover

## Experiment Plan for exp_010

1. **Log exp_010** with score 70.364392
2. **Submit exp_010** to verify LB = CV
3. **Download more Kaggle datasets** (santa-2025-try3, etc.)
4. **Ensemble ALL sources** including new downloads
5. **If improvement found, submit again**

## Validation Notes
- Use 1e18 scaling for overlap detection (matches Kaggle exactly)
- CV = LB for all valid submissions
- Any solution with overlaps will be rejected by Kaggle

## What NOT to Try
- Running bbox3/sa_fast binaries (already at local optimum)
- Python local search (too slow, finds only microscopic improvements)
- Single-source optimization (ensemble is always better)

## SUBMISSION STRATEGY
- Remaining submissions: 92
- Submit exp_010 immediately to verify improvement
- Submit after each successful ensemble improvement
- LB feedback is free - use it!
