## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.329514 from exp_016 (jazivxt_why_not ensemble)
- Best LB score: 70.340960 from exp_010
- Target: 68.876781 | Gap to target: 1.45 points (2.1%)

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: exp_016 HAS NOT BEEN SUBMITTED YET!
The jazivxt_why_not ensemble (70.329514) is better than our best LB (70.340960).
**FIRST ACTION: Submit exp_016 to get LB feedback!**

## Response to Evaluator

The evaluator correctly identified that:
1. **Local search is EXHAUSTED** - NFP, SA, fractional translation all found ~0 improvements
2. **Ensemble is the ONLY strategy that works** - went from 70.62 → 70.34 (0.28 points)
3. **Missing datasets are highest leverage** - but we've now downloaded most of them

I AGREE with the evaluator's assessment. The solution is at a very tight local optimum.
Local search cannot close the 1.45 point gap.

## What's Been Tried (EXHAUSTED)
- ✅ Ensemble from 3781+ snapshots → 0.000042 improvement (EXHAUSTED)
- ✅ NFP local search → 0 improvements (EXHAUSTED)
- ✅ Fractional translation → 0.000033 improvement (EXHAUSTED)
- ✅ Simulated annealing → 0 improvements (EXHAUSTED)
- ✅ Rotation optimization → 0 improvements (EXHAUSTED)
- ✅ All available Kaggle datasets → Most downloaded

## Key Insight from jonathanchan Kernel

The top kernel uses:
1. **19 different sources** for ensemble (we have most of them now)
2. **C++ optimizer with POPULATION-BASED optimization**:
   - Keeps top 3 solutions (not just 1)
   - Uses PERTURBATION to escape local optima
   - Different parameters for different N ranges:
     - N≤20: more iterations (1.5x), more restarts
     - N>150: fewer iterations (0.8x)
3. **Fractional translation** as final polish

## THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM

The baseline is at a VERY TIGHT local optimum. All local search methods fail because:
- There are NO small moves that improve the score
- The solution space has been thoroughly explored
- We need GLOBAL optimization that can escape local optima

## Recommended Approaches (Priority Order)

### 1. **IMMEDIATE: Submit exp_016** (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
```bash
# exp_016 has score 70.329514 - better than current best LB
# Submit it NOW to get LB feedback
```

### 2. **GLOBAL OPTIMIZATION with Perturbation** (HIGH PRIORITY)
The jonathanchan kernel uses perturbation to escape local optima:
```python
def perturb(solution, strength=0.1, seed=42):
    """Perturb solution to escape local optimum"""
    perturbed = copy.deepcopy(solution)
    for tree in perturbed:
        tree['x'] = float(tree['x']) + random.uniform(-strength, strength)
        tree['y'] = float(tree['y']) + random.uniform(-strength, strength)
        tree['a'] = (float(tree['a']) + random.uniform(-10, 10)) % 360
    return perturbed

# Population-based optimization
population = [current_best]
for generation in range(100):
    for solution in population:
        perturbed = perturb(solution, strength=0.1)
        optimized = local_search(perturbed)
        if optimized.score < best.score:
            best = optimized
    # Keep top 3 solutions
    population = sorted(population, key=lambda x: x.score)[:3]
```

### 3. **Different Starting Configurations** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
Instead of optimizing from current best, try:
- Random initial placements
- Grid-based initial placements
- Hexagonal packing initial placements
- Different rotation patterns (all 0°, all 45°, alternating)

### 4. **Per-N Specialization** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
Different N values may need different approaches:
- N=1: Already optimal (45°)
- N=2-10: Exhaustive search possible
- N=11-50: Constructive heuristics
- N=51-200: Pattern-based placement

## What NOT to Try (PROVEN FAILURES)
- ❌ More local search (SA, NFP, fractional translation) - EXHAUSTED
- ❌ More snapshots - EXHAUSTED (3781 already processed)
- ❌ Same optimizer with different parameters - EXHAUSTED

## Validation Notes
- Use strict 1e18 scaling for overlap detection
- CV = LB exactly (verified across 7 submissions)
- All solutions must pass strict validation before submission

## SUBMISSION STRATEGY
- Remaining submissions: 90+
- **SUBMIT exp_016 IMMEDIATELY** - it's better than current best LB
- Submit after EVERY experiment that shows improvement
- LB feedback is FREE information - USE IT!

## Summary

The gap is 1.45 points (2.1%). Local search is EXHAUSTED.

**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:**
1. Submit exp_016 (70.329514) - better than current best LB
2. Implement population-based optimization with perturbation
3. Try different starting configurations

**The target IS reachable** but requires:
- GLOBAL optimization (not local search)
- Perturbation to escape local optima
- Different starting configurations
