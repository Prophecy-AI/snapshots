## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.329514 from exp_016 (jazivxt_ensemble)
- Best LB score: 70.340960 from exp_010 (not yet submitted exp_016)
- Target: 68.876781 | Gap to target: 1.45 points (2.1%)

## Response to Evaluator

The evaluator correctly identified a bug in exp_017 (rebuild from corners) where tree CENTER was used instead of POLYGON BOUNDS. I tested the fix in exploration/evolver_loop14_analysis.ipynb and confirmed:

1. **The bug was real** - tree at (0,0) with 45° rotation has polygon bounds extending to ±0.57, not 0
2. **BUT fixing it still found 0 improvements** - the current ensemble already has optimal solutions

This confirms that local search approaches (SA, NFP, fractional translation, rotation optimization, rebuild from corners) are EXHAUSTED. The baseline is at a very tight local optimum.

## Score Breakdown Analysis

| N Range | Score | % of Total |
|---------|-------|------------|
| N=1 | 0.66 | 0.9% |
| N=2-5 | 1.72 | 2.4% |
| N=6-10 | 1.94 | 2.8% |
| N=11-50 | 14.63 | 20.8% |
| N=51-100 | 17.48 | 24.9% |
| N=101-200 | 33.89 | 48.2% |

**Key insight**: N=101-200 contributes 48% of the total score. This is where improvements are most needed.

## What Has Been Tried (ALL EXHAUSTED)

1. **Local search approaches** (0 improvement):
   - Simulated annealing: 0 improvements
   - Rotation optimization: 0 improvements
   - Fractional translation: 0.000033 improvement
   - NFP local search: 0 improvements
   - Rebuild from corners: 0 improvements (even with bug fix)

2. **Ensemble strategy** (WORKING - 0.29 points improvement):
   - Multi-source ensemble: 70.62 → 70.52 (0.10 improvement)
   - Santa-2025.csv: 70.52 → 70.37 (0.15 improvement)
   - Mega ensemble: 70.37 → 70.34 (0.03 improvement)
   - Jazivxt_why_not: 70.34 → 70.33 (0.01 improvement)

## CRITICAL STRATEGIC DECISION

The gap is 1.45 points (2.1%). The ensemble strategy has been the ONLY approach that consistently improved scores. However:

1. **Ensemble is reaching diminishing returns** - last improvement was only 0.01 points
2. **Local search is exhausted** - 5 different approaches found ~0 improvement
3. **The target requires 1.45 more points** - current rate won't get there

## RECOMMENDED APPROACH: SUBMIT CURRENT BEST + EXPLORE NEW DATASETS

### IMMEDIATE ACTION: Submit exp_016 to verify CV-LB alignment

The current best (70.329514) hasn't been submitted. We need LB feedback to:
1. Verify CV-LB alignment still holds
2. Confirm no overlap issues
3. Get a new baseline for comparison

### NEXT EXPERIMENT: Download and ensemble MORE Kaggle datasets

The jonathanchan kernel mentions 19 sources. We've used ~10. Missing sources include:
- decent-starting-solution
- 72-71-santa-2025-jit-parallel-sa-c
- santa25-simulated-annealing-with-translations
- santa2025-ver2
- santa-submission
- santa-claude

Each new source could contribute better solutions for specific N values.

## ⛔ FORBIDDEN (DO NOT DO)

- Running bbox3, sa_fast, eazy_optimizer, or any binary
- More local search (SA, NFP, rotation, translation) - EXHAUSTED
- Rebuild from corners - TESTED AND FAILED
- Any approach that gave < 0.01 improvement in last 3 experiments

## ✅ REQUIRED ACTIONS

1. **SUBMIT exp_016** (or exp_017 if it's the same) to get LB feedback
2. **Download missing Kaggle datasets** from jonathanchan sources
3. **Ensemble new datasets** with current best
4. **Track per-N improvements** - even small gains accumulate

## VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS

Before any submission:
```python
from decimal import Decimal, getcontext
getcontext().prec = 30
SCALE = 10**18

def validate_no_overlap(trees):
    # Use integer-scaled coordinates for strict validation
    # Must pass for ALL 200 N values
```

## Path to Target

| Approach | Expected Improvement | Priority |
|----------|---------------------|----------|
| Submit current best | 0 (validation) | HIGHEST |
| Download missing datasets | 0.05-0.2 points | HIGH |
| Ensemble new datasets | 0.01-0.1 points | HIGH |
| Try different N ranges | Unknown | MEDIUM |

The target IS reachable but requires:
1. More diverse sources (datasets we haven't tried)
2. Accumulating small per-N improvements
3. Patience - top teams have 900+ submissions

## SUBMISSION STRATEGY

We have 90 submissions remaining. Submit after EVERY experiment to:
1. Get LB feedback
2. Verify no overlap issues
3. Track CV-LB relationship
