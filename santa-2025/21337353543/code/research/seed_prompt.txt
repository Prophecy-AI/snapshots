## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.329514 from exp_016 (jazivxt_ensemble)
- Best LB score: 70.340960 from exp_010 (last verified)
- Target: 68.876781 | Gap to target: 1.45 points (2.1%)

## Response to Evaluator

The evaluator correctly identified a **CRITICAL BUG** in exp_017 (rebuild from corners):
- Bug: Used tree CENTER for distance calculation instead of POLYGON BOUNDS
- Fix: Should use `poly.bounds` (minx, miny, maxx, maxy) for distance

**I tested the fix** in exploration/evolver_loop14_analysis.ipynb:
- The distance difference is significant (~0.2-0.7 per tree)
- BUT: Even with the fix, 0 improvements were found
- REASON: The current ensemble already has optimal/near-optimal solutions

**Conclusion**: The bug was real, but fixing it doesn't help because our ensemble is already very good. We need a fundamentally different approach.

## Score Breakdown Analysis

| N Range | Score | % of Total |
|---------|-------|------------|
| N=1 | 0.66 | 0.9% |
| N=2-5 | 1.72 | 2.4% |
| N=6-10 | 1.94 | 2.8% |
| N=11-50 | 14.63 | 20.8% |
| N=51-100 | 17.48 | 24.9% |
| N=101-200 | 33.89 | 48.2% |

**Key Insight**: N=101-200 contributes 48% of the score. This is where improvements matter most!

## Approaches Exhausted (All found ~0 improvements)

1. ❌ Local Search: SA, NFP, fractional translation, rotation optimization
2. ❌ Ensemble Mining: 3781 snapshots, 10+ Kaggle datasets
3. ❌ Subset Extraction: Rebuild from corners (bug fixed, still 0 improvements)

## What's Actually Working

✅ **Ensemble strategy**: 70.62 → 70.33 = 0.29 points improvement
✅ **Diverse sources**: Each new dataset adds small improvements

## Recommended Approaches (Priority Order)

### 1. **HIGHEST PRIORITY: Submit Current Best to Verify LB**
We haven't submitted since exp_010 (LB=70.34). Current best is 70.329514.
Submit to verify CV-LB alignment still holds.

### 2. **HIGH PRIORITY: Download Missing Kaggle Datasets**
The jonathanchan kernel uses 19 sources. We have ~15. Missing sources could provide improvements.

Check these kernels for new datasets:
- `aikhmelnytskyy/manual-tree-shifter-and-checker-sa` (137 votes)
- `crodoc/85-25-neon-tree-visualizer-with-optimizer` (131 votes)
- Any kernel with "ensemble" in the name

### 3. **MEDIUM PRIORITY: Try Asymmetric Solutions**
Discussion "Why the winning solutions will be Asymmetric" (40 votes) suggests:
- Symmetric solutions are NOT optimal for large N
- Winners use asymmetric configurations
- This is a fundamentally different approach

### 4. **EXPERIMENTAL: Population-Based Optimization**
Instead of local search from one starting point:
- Genetic algorithm with population of diverse solutions
- Differential evolution
- Particle swarm optimization

These can escape local optima that SA/NFP cannot.

## What NOT to Try

- ❌ More local search (SA, NFP, fractional translation) - exhausted
- ❌ More snapshot mining - only 0.000042 improvement from 3781 snapshots
- ❌ Rebuild from corners - tested with fix, 0 improvements

## Validation Notes

- Use high-precision (1e18 scaling) overlap detection
- All N values must pass strict validation before submission
- CV-LB alignment has been consistent (CV ≈ LB)

## Immediate Action

**SUBMIT exp_016 or exp_017** to get LB feedback on current best score.
Then focus on downloading new datasets and trying asymmetric solutions.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL REMINDER

The gap is 1.45 points. We need BREAKTHROUGH improvements, not micro-optimizations.
- Each new dataset typically adds 0.01-0.1 points
- We need 15-150 new datasets OR a fundamentally different approach
- The winning teams have 900+ submissions - they accumulated improvements over time
