## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.316708 from exp_018 (018_new_sources_ensemble)
- Best LB score: 70.329514 (exp_013 - last submitted)
- Target: 68.876781 | Gap to target: 1.44 points (2.05%)
- Submissions: 11 used, 99 remaining

## Response to Evaluator

The evaluator correctly identified:
1. ✅ The rebuild from corners bug was real - but I tested the fix and it STILL finds 0 improvements. The current ensemble is already at a tight local optimum.
2. ✅ New sources exist - I found kumarandatascientist_ensemble has 34 improvements!
3. ✅ We need LB verification - CV-LB alignment is perfect (CV = LB for all submissions), so we should submit exp_018.

**Key insight**: The rebuild from corners technique, even when properly implemented with polygon bounds, cannot improve the current ensemble. This confirms the baseline is extremely well-optimized.

## Score Breakdown Analysis
| Range | Score | % of Total | Notes |
|-------|-------|------------|-------|
| N=1 | 0.66 | 0.9% | Already optimal (45° rotation) |
| N=2-5 | 1.72 | 2.4% | Small N, hard to improve |
| N=6-10 | 1.94 | 2.8% | Small N, hard to improve |
| N=11-50 | 14.63 | 20.8% | Medium N |
| N=51-100 | 17.48 | 24.9% | Medium N |
| N=101-200 | 33.89 | 48.2% | **LARGEST CONTRIBUTION** |

**Key insight**: N=101-200 contributes 48.2% of total score. This is where improvements are most impactful.

## Recommended Approaches (Priority Order)

### 1. **[IMMEDIATE]** Add kumarandatascientist_ensemble to current best
- Found 34 N values with improvements
- This is a quick win - just ensemble it with current best
- Expected improvement: ~0.01-0.02 points

### 2. **[IMMEDIATE]** Submit exp_018 to verify LB
- CV-LB alignment is perfect, so CV = LB
- But we should verify the new score
- 99 submissions remaining - use them!

### 3. **[HIGH PRIORITY]** Download more kernel outputs
Top kernels we haven't tried:
- saspav/santa-submission (518 votes)
- smartmanoj/santa-claude (380 votes)
- yongsukprasertsuk/santa-2025-best-keeping-bbox3-runner (370 votes)
- yongsukprasertsuk/santa2025-bbox-optimization (155 votes)

### 4. **[MEDIUM PRIORITY]** Try different large N layouts for rebuild
- Current N=200 layout doesn't help
- Try N=150, N=180, N=190 as source layouts
- Different large layouts might have different corner structures

### 5. **[RESEARCH]** Understand what top teams are doing
- The gap is 1.44 points (2.05%)
- Top teams have 900+ submissions
- They must be doing something fundamentally different

## ⛔ FORBIDDEN (DO NOT DO)
- bbox3, sa_fast, eazy_optimizer, tree_packer - FORBIDDEN
- subprocess.run() or os.system() - FORBIDDEN
- Running ANY binary or executable - FORBIDDEN
- "Optimizing" existing CSV files with local search - PROVEN NOT TO WORK

## What NOT to Try
- Rebuild from corners (tested with fix, 0 improvements)
- Local search (SA, fractional translation) - baseline is at tight local optimum
- Constructive heuristics from scratch - much worse than optimized solutions

## Validation Notes
- CV scheme: Direct score calculation (deterministic)
- CV-LB alignment: PERFECT (CV = LB for all submissions)
- Overlap validation: Use 1e18 integer scaling to match Kaggle

## Concrete Next Steps

**exp_019: Add kumarandatascientist_ensemble**
```python
# Load current best (exp_018)
# Load kumarandatascientist_ensemble/submission.csv
# For each N, keep the better solution
# Validate with strict 1e18 precision
# Save and submit
```

**Then: Download more kernel outputs**
```bash
kaggle kernels output saspav/santa-submission -p ./saspav_submission
kaggle kernels output smartmanoj/santa-claude -p ./smartmanoj_claude
kaggle kernels output yongsukprasertsuk/santa-2025-best-keeping-bbox3-runner -p ./yongsuk_bbox3
```

## SUBMISSION STRATEGY
- Remaining submissions: 99
- Submit after EVERY experiment
- LB feedback is FREE information - use it!
- Even if score is worse, we learn what doesn't work
