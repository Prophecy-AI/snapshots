      "text": "Solving 2D irregular polygon bin packing problems to optimality or near-optimality involves a variety of advanced techniques, many of which are reviewed in recent research. Traditional approaches include exact methods like mixed-integer programming (MIP), which can find optimal solutions but are often computationally expensive for large or complex instances ([Guo et al., 2022](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/mechanical-engineering/articles/10.3389/fmech.2022.966691/full)). To address this, heuristic and metaheuristic algorithms have become popular, offering near-optimal solutions with reduced computational effort. For example, Jostle heuristics and local search algorithms have been adapted to irregular shapes, often incorporating strategies like unrestricted rotation and sophisticated placement criteria to improve space utilization ([Martinez Sykora, 2018](https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/414392); [Martinez Sykora, 2017](https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/415314)). \n\nRecent innovations include learning-based methods such as attention-based diffusion models, which learn complex geometric relationships and support continuous rotation and arbitrary boundaries, thus enhancing packing efficiency ([Xue et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1)). Other approaches leverage knowledge reuse and improved heuristics, combining image processing, genetic algorithms, and local search techniques to handle multiple bin sizes and irregular shapes effectively ([Fang et al., 2024](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5); [Martinez Sykora, 2024](https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/415314)). Overall, the state-of-the-art blends exact optimization for small instances with heuristic, learning, and hybrid methods for larger, more complex problems, aiming for solutions that balance optimality with computational efficiency ([Guo et al., 2022](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/mechanical-engineering/articles/10.3389/fmech.2022.966691/full)).",

An efficient 2D irregular packing algorithm can effectively improve material utilization and reduce processing costs. The reduction in material consumption will also have a beneficial impact on the environment ( [Ke et al., 2020](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B76)). Therefore, research of the packing problem is of great significance for technology and social interest.\n\nThe 2D packing problem is a type of combinatorial optimization problems to locate parts with different shapes compactly in one or more master sheet material to minimize the occupied space or maximize the utilization of the material. The 2D packing problem is currently recognized as a NP problem, which is mainly solved by heuristic algorithms. In recent years, many scholars have conducted research on 2D irregular packing problems with a verity of solutions.\n\nThere exists a number of review articles on packing and cutting problems. We have summarized the main review literature in the field of 2D packing and cutting as shown in [Table 1](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#T1). Brown ( [Brown, 1971](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B17)) introduced an optimum packing and depletion problem with optimization of space and resource usage. Harvey ( [Salkin and De Kluyver, 1975](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B116)) surveyed the application of mathematical optimization models such as linear programming to the knapsack problem. Bruce ( [Golden, 1976](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B50)) surveyed various approaches to the cutting stock problem. Hinxman ( [Hinxman, 1980](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B65)) surveyed the trim-loss and assortment problems, this research paid more attention to cutting and packaging problems in practical applications, and did not mention much about theoretical methods. Garey and Coffman ( [Garey and Johnson, 1981](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B47); [Coffman et al., 1984](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B27)) surveyed the approximation algorithms for bin packing problems. Israni ( [Israni and Sanders, 1982](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B72)) reviewed the 2D cutting stock problem including almost all 2D packaging problems. The author also proposed a rectangular layout method. Sarin ( [Sarin, 1983](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B118)) reviewed methodologies and literature to solve 2D stock cutting problems and introduced an interactive optimization procedure for a general 2D stock cutting problem. Dyckhoff ( [Dyckhoff et al., 1985](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B38)) described a trim loss and related problems and categorized them briefly. Dudzi\u0144ski ( [Dudzi\u0144ski and Walukiewicz, 1987](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B36)) summarized the exact methods for knapsack problems, such as linear programming. Matthias ( [Rode and Rosenberg, 1987](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B114)) analyzed the algorithm for the trim-loss problems. Haessler ( [Haessler and Sweeney, 1991](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B59)) reviewed the solution process of cutting stock problems, including placement algorithm and sequence optimization algorithm. Dowsland ( [Dowsland and Dowsland, 1992](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B34)) reviewed the application of operations research methods to the packing problem and summarized some exact heuristics. Sweeney ( [Sweeney and Paternoster, 1992](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B128)) categorized cutting and packing problems and made application-oriented research records. Cheng ( [Cheng et al., 1994](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B22)) discussed 2D cutting stock problems and their application cases including the pallet loading problem and VLSI placement problem. With the gradual deepening of research on 2D layout problems, typology becomes a common research topic. 2D regular and irregular layout problems are clearly distinguished in practical applications and theoretical methods. Dowsland ( [Dowsland and Dowsland, 1995](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B29)) gave a special review of the 2D irregular nesting problem for the first time. Mavridou ( [Mavridou and Pardalos, 1997](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B98)) summarized applications of the genetic algorithm and simulated annealing algorithm in the optimization of facility layout problems. Dyckhoff ( [Dyckhoff, 1990](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B37)) made a typology of the cutting and packing problems in detail, and W\u00e4scher ( [W\u00e4scher et al., 2007](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B135)) improved the typology later. Hopper ( [Hopper and Turton, 1999](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B67); [Hopper and Turton, 2001a](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B68); [Hopper and Turton, 2001b](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B69)) investigated the application of meta-heuristic and heuristic algorithms in 2D and 3D packing problems. Lodi ( [Lodi et al., 2002a](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B90); [Lodi et al., 2002b](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B91)) reviewed algorithms proposed in the 1990s of 2D packing problems.

The classic packing solution is a hybrid algorithm based on heuristic positioning and meta-heuristic sequencing, which has the problems of complex solving rules and high time cost. In this study, the similarity measurement method based on the twin neural network model is used to evaluate the similarity of pieces in the source task and the target task. The reusability evaluation of packing tasks is designed to select appropriate source task knowledge. The transfer operator is used to transfer the piece sequence knowledge from the source task to complete the reuse of packing knowledge in the target task. The bottom-left algorithm is improved to complete the placement of 2D irregular pieces. The computational experiments show that the proposed algorithm for the bin packing problem using knowledge reuse and improved heuristic (KRIH) has good robustness. The KRIH algorithm can obtain 8 equal or better results on 16 instances in a relatively short time compared with some classical heuristic algorithms, which has good application potential.\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n![](https://media.springernature.com/w215h120/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-025-94748-x/MediaObjects/41598_2025_94748_Fig1_HTML.png)\n### [A sampling-based winner determination model and algorithm for logistics service procurement auctions under double uncertainty](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-94748-x?fromPaywallRec=false)\nArticleOpen access08 April 2025\n![](https://media.springernature.com/w215h120/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-023-40974-0/MediaObjects/41598_2023_40974_Fig1_HTML.png)\n### [Predicting elastic and plastic properties of small iron polycrystals by machine learning](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-40974-0?fromPaywallRec=false)\nArticleOpen access26 August 2023\n![](https://media.springernature.com/w215h120/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-025-07730-y/MediaObjects/41598_2025_7730_Fig1_HTML.png)\n### [Research on dimension measurement algorithm for parcel boxes in high-speed sorting system](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-07730-y?fromPaywallRec=false)\nArticleOpen access01 July 2025\n## Introduction\nPacking problems are commonly found in industries such as mechanical manufacturing, aviation, clothing, automotive manufacturing, shipbuilding, and furniture manufacturing. The manufacturing process of typical heavy industry products is shown in Fig.[1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#Fig1). In actual production, efficient packing algorithms can improve the utilization of raw materials and reduce production costs within an acceptable time. In a sense, the reduction of raw material consumption can have a beneficial impact on the environment[1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#ref-CR1). Packing problems, also known as bin packing problems or nesting problems, can be divided into three categories[2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#ref-CR2): the one-dimensional (1D) packing problem (wire cutting stock problem)[3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#ref-CR3),[4](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#ref-CR4), the two-dimensional (2D) packing problem (planar packing problem)[5](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#ref-CR5),[6](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#ref-CR6)and the three-dimensional (3D) packing problem[7](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#ref-CR7). The 2D packing problem is an interesting combinatorial optimization problem, which is used to place pieces of different shapes on one or more plates according to certain rules to minimize the space occupied by pieces or maximize the utilization of raw materials. The pieces here are general terms. In the metal processing industry, it refers to the pieces to be processed. In the garment manufacturing industry, it refers to the sample to be cut. And in the logistics industry, it refers to the goods to be placed. The packing problem has a large solution space and is an NP-complete (NP-C) problem, and the optimal solution cannot be obtained in polynomial time[8](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#ref-CR8). According to the regularity of piece shape, 2D packing problems can be further divided into 2D regular and 2D irregular packing problems. Among them, 2D irregular packing problems have received widespread attention due to their more diverse piece shapes and complex packing operations. Compared with the rectangular packing problem, the 2D irregular piece packing problem is very different in constraint calculation, solution strategy, overlap detection, so it has a larger solution space and more complicated technical operation. The 2D irregular piece packing has more applications in actual production. For 2D irregular packing problems, the existing research focuses on finding the approximate optimal solution or satisfactory solution within an acceptable time. The solving of the 2D irregular packing problem often involves two stages: sequence optimization and position optimization. In the sequence optimization stage, the sequence of pieces arranged on the plate is optimized. In the position optimization stage, the final placement scheme of pieces on the plate is determined.

The proposed attention-based diffusion model for 2D irregular packing, GFPack++, supports\ncontinuous rotation and accommodating arbitrary boundaries.\n\n## 1\\. Introduction\n\nIrregular shape packing is a classic challenge in operation research, with significant implications for various applications such as texture atlas generation and material utilization in manufacturing\u00a0(Wang et\u00a0al., [2021](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib34)). Its NP-hard nature requires practical and effective packing algorithms to optimize space utilization.\n\nTraditional numerical optimization methods are often slow and costly. Recently, learning-based methods have emerged as a promising alternative for irregular packing, mainly using reinforcement learning\u00a0(Xu et\u00a0al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib37); Yang et\u00a0al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib39)).\nAnother promising approach is the diffusion model, which learns geometric relationships from teacher packing examples and establishes a gradient field for all objects, guiding them to move simultaneously\u00a0(Hosseini et\u00a0al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib11); Xue et\u00a0al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib38)).\nIn particular, the work of (Xue et\u00a0al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib38)), namely GFPack, achieves a notable trade-off between computational cost and space utilization, demonstrating scalability in terms of polygon count and generalizability to rectangular container boundaries.\nHowever, it still faces unresolved issues, notably the lack of support for rotation, a relatively high occurrence of object collisions in results, and limited adaptability to arbitrary boundaries.\n\nThe main idea of the learning-based packing framework is to capture the geometric relationships between shapes, which are essential for the gradient computation.\nSuch relationships in latent space encompass multiple facets: the _spatial (position, orientation) relationship_ of the shapes, the _geometric features relationship_ among them, and the _container boundary conditions_ that constrain them.\nHowever, GFPack falls short in fully representing these relationships.\nIt solely focuses on the positional aspect, neglecting orientation, thus hindering rotational capabilities. Furthermore, it relies on PointNeXt\u00a0(Qian et\u00a0al., [2022](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib24)) for geometric feature extraction, ignoring critical details like polygon edges and resulting in a loss of topological and local features.\nThus, we argue that the full potential of gradient learning has not been thoroughly exploited in GFPack.\n\nIn this study, we introduce two primary strategies to tackle the challenge of learning packing policies.\nFirstly, we use a graph to represent each object and encode it with an _attention-based geometric encoder_, which can capture polygonal geometry information effectively.\nSecondly, we design an _attention-based relation encoding_ mechanism to encode intricate relationships both between polygons and among polygons and boundaries, eliminating the need to explicitly represent the relationships with a graph.\nThis attention-based diffusion model enhances the understanding of how objects interact with each other and the boundaries, resulting in superior performance in both training and inference.\nWe also investigate the utilization distribution between the teacher and inference data and design a weighting function to prioritize tighter teacher data during training, confirmed to be effective.\n\nThis paper makes the following contributions:\n\n1. -\n\n\nWe propose GFPack++, a novel packing framework that employs attention-based learning of gradient fields, supporting continuous rotation and enhancing generalization.\n\n2. -\n\n\nAdvancing beyond GFPack, we encapsulate geometric relationships in an attention-based encoder, incorporating mutual spatial (position, orientation) relationships of objects, their geometric features, and container boundary conditions, and a weighting function to facilitate effective learning policies.\n\n3. -\n\n\nGFPack++ achieves superior irregular packing results, demonstrating higher space utilization over several widely used baselines, one order of magnitude faster than the previous diffusion-based method, coupled with promising generalization for arbitrary boundaries.\n\n\n## 2\\. Related Work\n\n#### Traditional packing approaches\n\nTraditional methods usually involve placement optimization and sequence planning ( _c.f_.surveys\u00a0(Bennell and Oliveira, [2009](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib3); Leao et\u00a0al., [2020](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib18))). Most research focuses on placement optimization with heuristic rules (e.g., BL, BLF), NFP-based search\u00a0(Bennell and Song, [2008](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib4)), or mathematical models\u00a0(Hopper and Turton, [2001](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib10)). Novel approaches include SDF-based placement\u00a0(Pan et\u00a0al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib23)) and spectral domain correlation\u00a0(Cui et\u00a0al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib6)), but they only support limited rotations.

      "text": "[University of Southampton Institutional Repository](https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/)\n\n# Jostle heuristics for the 2D-irregular shapes bin packing problems with free rotation\n\nJostle heuristics for the 2D-irregular shapes bin packing problems with free rotation\n\nJostle heuristics for the 2D-irregular shapes bin packing problems with free rotation\n\nThe paper investigates the two-dimensional irregular packing problem with multiple homogeneous bins (2DIBPP). The literature on irregular shaped packing problems is dominated by the single stock sheet strip packing problem. However, in reality manufacturers are cutting orders over multi-stock sheets. Despite its greater relevance, there are only a few papers that tackle this problem in the literature. A multi-stock sheet problem has two decision components; the allocation of pieces to stock sheets and the layout design for each stock sheet. In this paper, we propose a heuristic method that addresses both the allocation and placement problems together based on the Jostle algorithm. Jostle was first applied to strip packing. In order to apply Jostle to the bin packing problem we modify the placement heuristic. In addition we improve the search capability by introducing a diversification mechanism into the approach. Furthermore, the paper presents alternative strategies for handling rotation of pieces, which includes a restricted set of angles and unrestricted rotation. Very few authors permit unrestricted rotation of pieces, despite this being a feature of many problems where the material is homogeneous.

The literature on irregular shaped packing problems is dominated by the single stock sheet strip packing problem. However, in reality manufacturers are cutting orders over multi-stock sheets. Despite its greater relevance, there are only a few papers that tackle this problem in the literature. A multi-stock sheet problem has two decision components; the allocation of pieces to stock sheets and the layout design for each stock sheet. In this paper, we propose a heuristic method that addresses both the allocation and placement problems together based on the Jostle algorithm. Jostle was first applied to strip packing. In order to apply Jostle to the bin packing problem we modify the placement heuristic. In addition we improve the search capability by introducing a diversification mechanism into the approach. Furthermore, the paper presents alternative strategies for handling rotation of pieces, which includes a restricted set of angles and unrestricted rotation. Very few authors permit unrestricted rotation of pieces, despite this being a feature of many problems where the material is homogeneous. Finally, we investigate alternative placement criteria and show that the most commonly applied bottom left criteria does not perform as well as other options. The paper evaluates performance of each algorithm using different sets of instances considering convex and non-convex shapes. Findings of this study reveal that the proposed algorithms can be applied to different variants of the problem and generate significantly better results.\n\nText\n\n**Accepted\\_article\\_IJPE**\n**\\- Accepted Manuscript**\n\nAvailable under License [Creative Commons Attribution Non-commercial No Derivatives](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/).\n\n[Download](https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/414392/1/Accepted_article_IJPE.pdf) (1MB)\n\n## More information\n\nAccepted/In Press date: 20 September 2017\n\ne-pub ahead of print date: 22 September 2017\n\nPublished date: January 2018\n\nKeywords:\nCutting and packing , bin packing, Irregular shapes, heuristics\n\n[Learn more about Southampton Business School research](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/business-school/research/index.page)\n\n## Identifiers\n\nLocal EPrints ID: 414392\n\nURI: http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/id/eprint/414392\n\nDOI: [doi:10.1016/j.ijpe.2017.09.014](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpe.2017.09.014)\n\nISSN: 0925-5273\n\nPURE UUID: ad1935b2-7607-4c53-95fd-422c2185d298\n\nORCID for Antonio Martinez Sykora: [orcid.org/0000-0002-2435-3113](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2435-3113)\n\n## Catalogue record\n\nDate deposited: 28 Sep 2017 16:31\n\nLast modified: 16 Mar 2024 05:46\n\n## Export record\n\nASCII CitationAtomBibTeXData Cite XMLDublin CoreDublin CoreEP3 XMLEndNoteHTML CitationHTML CitationHTML ListJSONMETSMODSMPEG-21 DIDLOpenURL ContextObjectOpenURL ContextObject in SpanRDF+N-TriplesRDF+N3RDF+XMLRIOXX2 XMLReferReference ManagerSimple Metadata\n\n## Altmetrics\n\n## Share this record\n\n[Share this on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/414392/) [Share this on Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Jostle%20heuristics%20for%20the%202D%2Dirregular%20shapes%20bin%20packing%20problems%20with%20free%20rotation+https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/414392/) [Share this on Weibo](http://service.weibo.com/share/share.php?url=Jostle%20heuristics%20for%20the%202D%2Dirregular%20shapes%20bin%20packing%20problems%20with%20free%20rotation+https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/414392/)\n\n## Contributors\n\nAuthor:Ranga, Prasad Abeysooriya\n\nAuthor:Julia Bennell\n\nAuthor: [Antonio Martinez Sykora](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/business-school/about/staff/am1u10.page)\n\n## Download statistics\n\nDownloads from ePrints over the past year.

Despite a large number of studies on the two-dimensional irregular strip packing problem, much less attention has been paid to the two-dimensional irregular bin packing problem (2DIBPP), and most of the current research on 2DIBPP is about free rotations. However, limited by the texture of the material, sometimes only some specific degrees of rotations are allowed. To pack a set of irregular pieces with some specific degrees into multi-stock sheets and maximize the utilization, we propose a heuristic algorithm that combines some pieces into one block for packing and uses residual spaces with reference lines to help select the next piece to be packed. In order to further increase the utilization of bins, we adopt fine-tuning, movement, filling, replacement and swap operations, as well as partial and full repack strategies. The computational results show that the proposed algorithm can obtain superior results on the instances with small number of pieces, relatively large number of types of pieces, large bins and more specific degrees of rotations.\n\n## Introduction\n\nIrregular packing problems are also called nesting problems (Bennell and Oliveira, 2009). Irregular packing problems can be further divided into different variants based on various perspectives. W\u00e4scher et al. (2007) introduced six kinds of cutting and packing problems, namely Identical Item Packing Problem (IIPP) (Costa et al., 2009), Placement Problem (PP) (Romanova et al., 2019), Knapsack Problem (KP) (Baldacci et al., 2014), Open Dimension Problem (ODP) (Rodrigues and Toledo, 2017, Mundim et al., 2017, Wang et al., 2018), Cutting Stock Problem (CSP) (MirHassani and Bashirzadeh, 2015) and Bin Packing Problem (BPP) (Martinez-Sykora et al., 2017, Abeysooriya et al., 2018, Bennell et al., 2018).\n\nThis paper addresses the two-dimensional irregular bin packing problem (2DIBPP) where the pieces are irregular with concavities. Even though many studies have focused on the two-dimensional irregular packing problem in recent years, they are mainly about the irregular strip packing problem which is a type of ODP. In the strip packing problem, the width of the stock sheet is fixed and the objective is to minimize the total length (Rodrigues and Toledo, 2017, Cherri et al., 2016). However, in real life, manufactures often use multi-stock sheets (bins) with fixed dimensions, which is related to 2DIBPP. 2DIBPP is a type of BPP and can be classified as a two-dimensional Single Bin Size Bin Packing Problem (SBSBPP).\n\nRotation is an important attribute of pieces, and plays a vital role on the final packing patterns. For two-dimensional irregular packing problems, rotations are usually divided into {0,180} degrees, {0,90,180,270} degrees (Sato et al., 2019), and free rotations (Martinez-Sykora et al., 2017, Abeysooriya et al., 2018, Cherri et al., 2018). For example, in the garment industry, the rotation is restricted, while in glass and sheet metal cutting applications, free rotations are allowed. For three-dimensional irregular packing problems, the vertical direction is sometimes fixed but the horizontal direction can be rotated, that is, the bottom area is unchanged. For some specific situations, items can be rotated in any direction (Romanova et al., 2018).\n\nCurrently, most studies of the 2DIBPP are about free rotations. Martinez-Sykora et al. (2017) combined the free rotation of irregular pieces with the bin packing problem for the first time. Abeysooriya et al. (2018) applied Jostle algorithm and addressed simultaneously both the allocation of pieces and the placement of bins. However, due to the limitation of material texture, only some specific degrees of rotations are allowed. Liu et al. (2020) proposed a heuristic for 2DIBPP with limited rotations where the overlapping removal based placement was used. Zhang et al. (2022) proposed an iteratively doubling local search approach for 2DIBPP with limited rotations, including a least waste first decreasing strategy, a simple greedy local search approach and an overlap minimization approach. In this study, we also consider the 2DIBPP with limited rotations but design different heuristics to solve it.\n\nOur study makes several contributions to the literature. First, our paper is the first to introduce blocks to 2DIBPP, which were previously used for strip packing problems. We also extend to generate blocks with more than two pieces. The pieces are combined into blocks so that the shapes of the pieces can be complementary to reduce wasted bin space. Second, we are the first to apply residual spaces with reference lines to 2DIBPP to guide the selection of the next piece to pack. Third, a series of operations are used to further increase the utilization of bins, including fine-tuning, movement, filling and replacement for the placement of one bin, and swap between bins. Most of these operations are rarely used in the irregular packing problems. Fourth, to find better solutions without increasing too much computational time, we newly propose the partial and full repack strategies. Partial repack draws on previous experience to keep some of the higher utilization bins intact and only repack the remaining bins, while full repack throws away the experience and starts packing from the first empty bin. Finally, we can improve the best-known results for some benchmark instances.\n\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we define some notations and describe the problem. Section 3 introduces our heuristic method, including the block, residual spaces with reference lines, fine-tuning, movement, filling, replacement and swap operations, and partial and full repack strategies. In Section 4, we present the experimental data and the computational results. We summarize our conclusions and ...",

Algorithms are adapted from papers of Abeysooriya 2018 and Dalalah 2014. Bin packing places a given set of polygons in standard single/multiple rectangular sheet(s), to minimize the use of the sheet(s).\n\nThis library does not involve other libraries, however, the example uses core.jar ( [https://processing.org](https://processing.org)) for a graphical interface. The algorithm is effective when the ratio (number of polygons / number of the types of polygons) is small.\n\nThe processing user needs to create \u201c\u2026/libraries/dalsoo/library/dalsoo.jar\u201d, and then write \u201cimport pack.\\*;\u201d to import the library.\n\n## 1\\. Input\n\n**a**. Only simple polygon: no holes, no self-intersection.\n\n**b**. Data structure: point - double\\[\\]; polygon - double\\[\\]\\[\\]; all polygons - double\\[\\]\\[\\]\\[\\].\nOne might use other library to convert other formats (e.g., dxf, obj) of polygon to double\\[\\]\\[\\].\n\n**c**. It's better to represent a polygon with a moderate number of points.\nToo many points (e.g. a local detail contains dozens of points) slows down the algorithm. Avoid using too many points for a smooth curve.\nOne might use _segment\\_max\\_length_ to let the algorithm create more points on a long straight edge of a polygon, if the polygon has very few points or the edge is very long.\n\n## 2\\. Choose an algorithm\n\n**a**. _useAbey_ =true, _Jostle heuristics for the 2D-irregular shapes bin packing problems with free rotation, R. P. Abeysooriya et al. 2018_. However, Jostle method is not used.\n\n_rotSteps_: Each polygon is rotated in the layout. Few steps (say 16) -> run fast & poor result; many steps (say 48) -> run slow & good results\n\n_segment\\_max\\_length_: if (an edge of a polygon > segment\\_max\\_length), breaks it into smaller segments.\nlarge value -> run fast & poor result; small value -> run slow & good results\n\n_segment\\_max\\_length_ is related to translation steps.\n\n**b**. _useAbey_ =false, _Waste minimization in irregular stock cutting, D. Dalalah et al. 2014_\n\nthe rotation/translation steps depend on the polygons.\n\n## 3\\. Output options\n\n**a**. obtain the transformation of each polygon in the final layout, including:\n\nint\\[\\] _result\\_pack\\_id_; // result\\_pack\\_id\\[8\\]=2 means the 9th polygon is on the 3rd sheet.\n\ndouble\\[\\]\\[\\] _result\\_cos\\_sin_; // result\\_cos\\_sin\\[8\\]={0.5, 0.866} means the 9th polygon is rotated 60 degree around (0,0).\n\ndouble\\[\\]\\[\\] _result\\_position_; // result\\_position\\[8\\]={7.4, 9.0} means that the 9th polygon should be translated by (7,4, 9.4) after rotation.\n\n**b**. obtain the geometry of each polygon in the final layout\n\nPack pack = packs.get(id); //obtain a sheet (pack) by id.\n\nfor (Strip strip : pack.fixs) { // obtain a placed strip (polygon) in a sheet.\n\nstrip.inps // the polygon's points, one might use other library to convert double\\[\\]\\[\\] to other formats (e.g., dxf: [https://github.com/whitegreen/DXF-Laser](https://github.com/whitegreen/DXF-Laser)) of polygon\n\n}\n\n## About\n\n2D Irregular Bin Packing\n\n### Topics\n\n[bin-packing](https://github.com/topics/bin-packing)\n\n### Resources\n\n[Readme](https://github.com/github.com#readme-ov-file)\n\n### License\n\n[MIT license](https://github.com/github.com#MIT-1-ov-file)\n\n### Uh oh!\n\nThere was an error while loading.
