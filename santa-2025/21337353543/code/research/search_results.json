An efficient 2D irregular packing algorithm can effectively improve material utilization and reduce processing costs. The reduction in material consumption will also have a beneficial impact on the environment ([Ke et al., 2020](#B76)). Therefore, research of the packing problem is of great significance for technology and social interest.\nThe 2D packing problem is a type of combinatorial optimization problems to locate parts with different shapes compactly in one or more master sheet material to minimize the occupied space or maximize the utilization of the material. The 2D packing problem is currently recognized as a NP problem, which is mainly solved by heuristic algorithms. In recent years, many scholars have conducted research on 2D irregular packing problems with a verity of solutions.\nThere exists a number of review articles on packing and cutting problems. We have summarized the main review literature in the field of 2D packing and cutting as shown in[Table 1](#T1). Brown ([Brown, 1971](#B17)) introduced an optimum packing and depletion problem with optimization of space and resource usage. Harvey ([Salkin and De Kluyver, 1975](#B116)) surveyed the application of mathematical optimization models such as linear programming to the knapsack problem. Bruce ([Golden, 1976](#B50)) surveyed various approaches to the cutting stock problem. Hinxman ([Hinxman, 1980](#B65)) surveyed the trim-loss and assortment problems, this research paid more attention to cutting and packaging problems in practical applications, and did not mention much about theoretical methods. Garey and Coffman ([Garey and Johnson, 1981](#B47);[Coffman et al., 1984](#B27)) surveyed the approximation algorithms for bin packing problems. Israni ([Israni and Sanders, 1982](#B72)) reviewed the 2D cutting stock problem including almost all 2D packaging problems. The author also proposed a rectangular layout method. Sarin ([Sarin, 1983](#B118)) reviewed methodologies and literature to solve 2D stock cutting problems and introduced an interactive optimization procedure for a general 2D stock cutting problem. Dyckhoff ([Dyckhoff et al., 1985](#B38)) described a trim loss and related problems and categorized them briefly. Dudzi&#x00144;ski ([Dudzi&#x00144;ski and Walukiewicz, 1987](#B36)) summarized the exact methods for knapsack problems, such as linear programming. Matthias ([Rode and Rosenberg, 1987](#B114)) analyzed the algorithm for the trim-loss problems. Haessler ([Haessler and Sweeney, 1991](#B59)) reviewed the solution process of cutting stock problems, including placement algorithm and sequence optimization algorithm. Dowsland ([Dowsland and Dowsland, 1992](#B34)) reviewed the application of operations research methods to the packing problem and summarized some exact heuristics. Sweeney ([Sweeney and Paternoster, 1992](#B128)) categorized cutting and packing problems and made application-oriented research records. Cheng ([Cheng et al., 1994](#B22)) discussed 2D cutting stock problems and their application cases including the pallet loading problem and VLSI placement problem. With the gradual deepening of research on 2D layout problems, typology becomes a common research topic. 2D regular and irregular layout problems are clearly distinguished in practical applications and theoretical methods. Dowsland ([Dowsland and Dowsland, 1995](#B29)) gave a special review of the 2D irregular nesting problem for the first time. Mavridou ([Mavridou and Pardalos, 1997](#B98)) summarized applications of the genetic algorithm and simulated annealing algorithm in the optimization of facility layout problems. Dyckhoff ([Dyckhoff, 1990](#B37)) made a typology of the cutting and packing problems in detail, and W&#x000e4;scher ([W&#x000e4;scher et al., 2007](#B135)) improved the typology later. Hopper ([Hopper and Turton, 1999](#B67);[Hopper and Turton, 2001a](#B68);[Hopper and Turton, 2001b](#B69)) investigated the application of meta-heuristic and heuristic algorithms in 2D and 3D packing problems. Lodi ([Lodi et al., 2002a](#B90);[Lodi et al., 2002b](#B91)) reviewed algorithms proposed in the 1990s of 2D packing problems. Bennell et al. ([Bennell and Oliveira, 2008](#B10);[Bennell and Oliveira, 2009](#B9)) discussed 2D irregular packing problems and related geometric problems. Leao ([Leao et al., 2020](#B81)) introduced the mathematical models in the 2D irregular packing problem.\nTABLE 1\n[![www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/966691/fmech-08-966691-HTML/image_m/fmech-08-966691-t001.jpg)](https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/966691/fmech-08-966691-HTML/image_m/fmech-08-966691-t001.jpg)\n**TABLE 1**. Review literature in the field of cutting and packing problems.\nThe scope of these reviews is broad, mainly for all 2D packing problems including rectangular packing and other regular packing problems.

The container has a fixed width, while its length can change so that all items are placed in it. The objective is to find a layout of the set of polygons that minimizes the length of the container. The proposed algorithm constructively creates layouts from an ordered list of items and a placement heuristic. The placement determines the collision free region (represents the set of translations to create a feasible layout) for the item to be placed. It is shown that the collision free region must be calculated using non-regularized Boolean operations, as contours of no-fit polygons should be ignored. The proposed algorithm to solve the placement problem has two levels, in the internal level the container has fixed dimensions, and the external level reduces or increases the variable dimension. The placement heuristic searches for degenerated vertices and edges as they represent local maximum compaction. Computational comparisons on benchmark problems show that the proposed algorithm generated highly competitive solutions. Moreover, our algorithm updated some best known results.\n...Read more\n## Key takeaways\n![sparkles](https://a.academia-assets.com/images/icons/sparkle.svg)\nAI\n1. The proposed two-level algorithm effectively minimizes container length for irregular polygon packing.\n2. Collision free regions (CFRs) are determined using non-regularized Boolean operations to avoid contour interference.\n3. Placement heuristic prioritizes degenerated edges and vertices for optimal item fitting and compaction.\n4. Benchmark tests with 13 datasets demonstrated competitive results, achieving 100% density in some cases.\n5. Simulated annealing (SA) is integrated for sequence and position control of item placements.\n## Related papers\n[Rotational Placement of Irregular Polygons over Containers with Fixed Dimensions using Simulated Annealing and No-Fit Polygons](https://www.academia.edu/58884840/Rotational_Placement_of_Irregular_Polygons_over_Containers_with_Fixed_Dimensions_using_Simulated_Annealing_and_No_Fit_Polygons)\n[Thiago de Castro Martins](https://independent.academia.edu/ThiagodeCastroMartins)\nJournal of the Brazilian Society of Mechanical Sciences and Engineering, 2008\nThis work deals with the problem of minimizing the waste of space that occurs on a rotational placement of a set of irregular bi-dimensional small items inside a bidimensional large object. This problem is approached with an heuristic based on simulated annealing. Traditional &quot;external penalization&quot; techniques are avoided through the application of the no-fit polygon, that determinates the collision-free region for each small item before its placement. The simulated annealing controls: the rotation applied and the placement of the small item. For each non-placed small item, a limited depth binary search is performed to find a scale factor that when applied to the small item, would allow it to be fitted in the large object. Three possibilities to define the sequence on which the small items are placed are studied: larger-first, random permutation and weight sorted. The proposed algorithm is suited for non-convex small items and large objects.\ndownloadDownload free PDF[View PDFchevron\\_right](https://www.academia.edu/58884840/Rotational_Placement_of_Irregular_Polygons_over_Containers_with_Fixed_Dimensions_using_Simulated_Annealing_and_No_Fit_Polygons)\n[An effective heuristic for the two-dimensional irregular bin packing problem](https://www.academia.edu/69875946/An_effective_heuristic_for_the_two_dimensional_irregular_bin_packing_problem)\n[Gabriela Ochoa](https://independent.academia.edu/GabrielaOchoa10)\nAnnals of Operations Research, 2013\nThis paper proposes an adaptation, to the two-dimensional irregular bin packing problem of the Djang and Finch heuristic (DJD), originally designed for the one-dimensional bin packing problem. In the two-dimensional case, not only is it the case that the piece&#39;s size is important but its shape also has a significant influence. Therefore, DJD as a selection heuristic has to be paired with a placement heuristic to completely construct a solution to the underlying packing problem.

It adopts two neighborhoods, swapping two given polygons in a placement and placing one polygon into a new position. The local search algorithm is used to minimize the overlap on the basis of the neighborhoods mentioned above and the unconstrained[nonlinear programming](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/nonlinear-programming)model is adopted to further minimize the overlap during the search process. Moreover, the[tabu](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/tabu)search algorithm is used to avoid[local minima](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/local-minimum), and a compact algorithm is presented to improve the result. The results of standard test instances indicate that when compared with other existing algorithms, the presented algorithm does not only show some signs of competitive power but also updates several best known results.\n## Introduction\nThe irregular strip packing problem, also known as the nesting problem, has a wide area of applications. Given a set of irregular shapes and a rectangular strip with a fixed width and an arbitrary length, the target of the two-dimensional irregular strip packing problem is to place all shapes within the strip such that the length of the strip is minimized and the irregular shapes do not overlap. A classic example application is clothing industry. Several pieces of clothes will be cut from a roll of fabric and the objective is to minimize the waste of fabric. The fabric has a fixed width and its length can be generally assumed infinite; so the problem is to minimize the length required for producing the specified number of irregular shapes.\nThe irregular strip packing problem is a NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem [1]. Numerous papers on nesting problem have been published since the first paper by Art [2]. Meta-heuristics are often used to solve this problem. Hopper and Turton [3] reviewed these methods, and a summary of geometric methods was published by Bennell and Oliveira [4]. As research progressed, further breakthroughs in algorithms for this problem have achieved in recent years. When compared with the previous years, these solutions have markedly improved the effect and speed of nesting results. The typical methods include Burke et al. [5], Gomes and Oliveira [6], Egeblad et al. [7], Imamichi et al. [8], etc.\nAlbano and Sapuppo [9] proposed an algorithm that places each shape at the bottom-left position, and the sequence of places is obtained by tree search. Jakobs [10] proposed a two-stage solution which first generates the rectangular enclosure of each irregular shape, and then finds the placement for these enclosures through a genetic algorithm. Secondly, a shrinking algorithm moves the shapes to another one as close as possible using the idea of the bottom-left heuristic. Gomes and Oliveira [11] based on bottom-left heuristic and find a good placement by exchanging two shapes in the layout. Dowsland et al. [12] developed a compact algorithm to improve the bottom-left heuristic algorithm. The algorithm first gets the initial placement by the bottom-left heuristic, and then uses a shaking process to compact the placement. Burke et al. [5] presented a new bottom-left heuristic algorithm based on discretization, and combination with hill climbing or tabu search to get a high quality solution. This algorithm can also pack the shapes with circular arcs and holes. Egeblad et al. [7] proposed an efficient fast local search method whose neighborhood is any horizontal or vertical translation of a given shape. They also formulated a polynomial time algorithm to find a translation with minimum overlap area between the given polygon and the other polygons in the current placement. Gomes and Oliveira [6] presented a separation algorithm to locally optimize the placement based on linear programming models, and used simulated annealing to guide the search. A new separation algorithm based on unconstrained nonlinear programming is proposed by Imamichi et al. [8]. They also designed an algorithm that swaps two polygons in a placement, and then the algorithms are combined as a component into an iterated local search algorithm for the overlap minimization problem. This method yielded several best known results on the standard test instances. Our algorithm is based on a separation algorithm presented by Imamichi et al. [8], and local search is adopted to guide the search. Moreover, a tabu search algorithm is used to avoid local minima and a compacted algorithm is used to improve the packing results.\n## Section snippets\n## Formulation\nIn this section, some fundamental elements of geometry are first defined, before formulation of the irregular strip packing problem algorithm is given.\n**Definition 1 (point)**\nA point*p*in two-dimensional space is represented by a pair:p=(px,py)\u2208R2.\n**Definition 2 (line segment)**\nA line segment*s*is a point set defined by two endpoints*p**a*and*p**b*:s={p\u2208R2,t\u2208[0,1]|p=pa+t(pb\u2212pa)}.\n**Definition 3 (polygon)**\nA polygon is a plane figure bounded by a closed path composes of a finite sequence of line segments denoted by*S*.

In the two-dimensional case, not only is it the case that the piece\u2019s size is important but its shape also has a significant influence. Therefore, DJD as a selection heuristic has to be paired with a placement heuristic to completely construct a solution to the underlying packing problem. A successful adaptation of the DJD requires a routine to reduce computational costs, which is also proposed and successfully tested in this paper. Results, on a wide variety of instance types with convex polygons, are found to be significantly better than those produced by more conventional selection heuristics.\n\nThis is a preview of

INTRODUCTION\nCutting and packing are classic problems of finding the\nmost efficient layout for a set of input items out of a\ngiven container with the objective of minimizing the waste\nmaterial. The applications of cutting and packing, e.g.\nclothing, shipbuilding, and furniture industry are numer\u0002ous. W\u00a8ascher et al. (2007) have developed a typology that\nclassifies the nesting problems according to dimension,\nobjective, assortment of item type, as well as the number\nand nature of the container where the items are to be\nallocated. In this paper, we consider the irregular shape\npacking problem, classified as a two-dimensional irregular\nopen dimension problem (ODP).\nThe problem is NP-complete (Fowler et al., 1981) and\nas a result solution methodologies predominantly utilize\nheuristics. Although there are many different solution\napproaches presented in the literature, there appears to\nbe two key strategies for representing and searching the\nsolution space. The first approach represents the solution\nas an ordered list of items and applies a placement rule\nto construct the solution (Babu and Babu, 2001; Gomes\nand Oliveira, 2002; Burke et al., 2007, 2006). The second\napproach represents the solution as a physical layout on\nthe container and moves items within the layout (Bennell\n1 e-mail: andre.kubagawa@gmail.com.

This author was partially supported by\nCNPq (grant 304258/2007-5) and FAPESP (grant 2009/07173-2).\nand Dowsland, 1999; Gomes and Oliveira, 2006; Egeblad\net al., 2007). The former strategy is dependent on two\ncritical characteristics of the algorithm; the placement rule\nand the placement order of the items.\nWhen irregular shaped items are involved an extra di\u0002mension of complexity is generated by the geometry. The\nno-fit polygon is the principal approach for handling the\ngeometry in cutting and packing problems with irregular\nshaped items (Burke et al., 2007; Bennell and Song, 2008;\nCosta et al., 2009). The no-fit polygon is used to ensure\nfeasible layouts; i.e. layouts where the items do not overlap\nand fit inside the container.\nIn this paper, the solution is represented as an ordered\nlist of items and a constructive heuristic is applied se\u0002quentially. A simulated annealing algorithm controls how\nthe items are ordered in the list and where the items are\nconstructively placed. The proposed algorithm has two\nhierarchical levels. The inner level solves the placement\nproblem where the container has fixed dimensions. The\nexternal level reduces or increases the container dimen\u0002sion that must be minimized. Experiments show that the\nproposed method is very efficient compared with other\npublished methods.\n2. PREVIOUS WORKS\nThe no-fit polygon alone has limited utility in cutting\nand packing problems. Some recent works are using the\ncollision free region to determine feasible layouts in con\u0002tainers with fixed dimensions.

The cost function assumes only discrete\nvalues, while the rotating angle \u03b8 is continuous.\nregion represents feasible placements for a moveable item\nconsidering the already placed items and the container.\nThe cost function is the non occupied area inside the\ncontainer with fixed dimensions. As the non occupied\narea can change only by adding or removing areas of\nitems, the cost function can assume only a finite set of\nvalues, becoming discontinuous (see Fig. 1). A simulated\nannealing algorithm with adaptive neighborhood (Martins\nand Tsuzuki, 2008, 2009a) controls the sequence of items\nand the placement on the collision free region boundary.\nThe collision free region was calculated using regularized\nBoolean operations implemented with limited precision\n(Hobby, 1999).\nMartins and Tsuzuki (2007) combined the simulated an\u0002nealing with deterministic heuristics (larger first and bot\u0002tom left). They showed that it is possible to create problem\ninstances where deterministic heuristics cannot reach the\nlayout associated with the global optimum.\nSato et al. (2010) implemented a robust algorithm to\ndetermine the collision free region with two dimension\nnon manifold Boolean operations. They created a problem\ninstance where the the global optimum can not be reached\nby placing the moveable item exclusively on collision free\nregion vertices. Such situation rarely occurs considering\nstudied and practical problems. They showed several re\u0002sults where the area of the container was exactly equal\nto the total area of the items. The layout associated with\nglobal optimum was reached in averagely 15 times fewer\niterations when compared to previously published results\n(Martins and Tsuzuki, 2009b, 2010) where the area of the\ncontainer was larger than the total area of the items. The\ncorrect calculation of the collision free region showed to be\nan effective tool to obtain such results.\n3. NO-FIT POLYGONS AND COLLISION FREE\nREGION\nNo-fit polygons represent set of translations of an item\nand are mathematically represented by a set of vectors.\nFor a better understanding of the properties of the no-fit\npolygons, the set of translations of an item is represented\nby polygons in the plane. Every item has a reference point\nthat can be internal or external to it. The no-fit polygon\nrepresents a set of forbidden translations, as shown in\nFig. 2. For an item P, let i(P) be its interior, \u2202P be its\nboundary and c(P) be its complement.\nFig. 2. Set of translations of a shape represented as a region\ncontaining all possible translations from its reference\npoint.\nDefinition 3.1. The no-fit polygon induced by item Pi to\nitem Pj , denoted by \u03a5(Pi, Pj ), is the set of translation\nvectors applied to Pj that leads it to a collision with Pi.\nThus,\n\u03a5(Pi, Pj ) = i(Pi) \t i(Pj ) (1)\n= {v | \u2203 a \u2208 i(Pj ), a + v \u2208 i(Pi)}\nThe no-fit polygon can be obtained by the Minkowski\nsum algorithm (Agarwal et al., 2002), that can be calcu\u0002lated very efficiently for convex polygons. The result of a\nMinkowski sum of two convex polygons is a convex polygon\nbuilt from the original polygon ed...",

Irregular shape packing is one of the most recent variants to be widely researched and its history extends over 40 years. The evolution of solution approaches to this problem can be attributed to increased computer power and advances in geometric techniques as well as more sophisticated and insightful algorithm design. In this paper we will focus on the latter. Our aim is not to give a chronological account or an exhaustive review, but to draw on the literature to describe and evaluate the core approaches. Irregular packing is combinatorial and as a result solution methods are heuristic, save a few notable exceptions. We will explore different ways of representing the problem and mechanisms for moving between solutions. We will also propose where we see the future challenges for researchers in this area.\n\n## Suggested Citation\n\nJ A Bennell & J F Oliveira, 2009.\n\" **[A tutorial in irregular shape packing problems](https://ideas.repec.org/a/pal/jorsoc/v60y2009i1d10.1057_jors.2008.169.html)**,\"\n[Journal of the Operational Research Society](https://ideas.repec.org/s/pal/jorsoc.html), Palgrave Macmillan;The OR Society, vol. 60(1), pages 93-105, May.\nHandle: _RePEc:pal:jorsoc:v:60:y:2009:i:1:d:10.1057\\_jors.2008.169_\n\nDOI: 10.1057/jors.2008.169\n\nas\n\nHTMLHTML with abstractplain textplain text with abstractBibTeXRIS (EndNote, RefMan, ProCite)ReDIFJSON\n\n## Download full text from publisher\n\n**File URL:** http://link.springer.com/10.1057/jors.2008.169\n\n**File Function:** Abstract\n\n**Download Restriction:** Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.\n\n* * *\n\n**File URL:** https://libkey.io/10.1057/jors.2008.169?utm\\_source=ideas\n\n**LibKey link**: if access is restricted and if your library uses this service, LibKey will redirect you to where you can use your library subscription to access this item\n\n---><---\n\nAs the access to this document is restricted, you may want to [search](https://ideas.repec.org/cgi-bin/htsearch2?q=%22A+tutorial+in+irregular+shape+packing+problems%22) for a different version of it.\n\n## References listed on IDEAS\n\nas\n\nHTMLHTML with abstractplain textplain text with abstractBibTeXRIS (EndNote, RefMan, ProCite)ReDIFJSON\n\n01.

It explores the procedure of applying the bottom-left strategy to a given order the bottom-left algorithm. The chapter explains the irregular strip packing problem and introduces some practical algorithms for irregular packing problems. It focuses on the problem of packing irregular shapes represented in bitmap format and analyses the rectilinear block packing problem and also introduces various schemes used to represent solutions to the rectilinear block packing problem and algorithms based on such coding schemes. The chapter considers two-dimensional irregular packing problems, which have been actively studied in the last decade. It provides some basic techniques including bottom-left strategy, clustering strategy, and no-fit polygons. The chapter shows that various algorithms proposed for the irregular strip packing and bin packing problems and their variants. T. Imamichi et al. proposed an iterated local search based on nonlinear programming for the irregular strip packing problem.\n\n[Taylor & Francis Group Logo![Taylor & Francis Group Logo](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/assets/images/tfgroup-logo-white.svg)](https://www.taylorfrancis.com)\n\n- PoliciesPolicies\n\n- [Privacy Policy](https://informa.com/privacy-policy/)\n- [Terms & Conditions](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/terms-and-conditions/)\n- [Cookie Policy](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/cookie-policy/)\n\n- JournalsJournals\n\n- [Taylor & Francis Online](https://www.tandfonline.com)\n\n- CorporateCorporate\n\n- [Taylor & Francis Group](https://taylorandfrancis.com/)\n\n- Help & ContactHelp & Contact\n\n- [Students/Researchers](https://help.taylorfrancis.com/students_researchers)\n- [Librarians/Institutions](https://help.taylorfrancis.com/librarians_institutions)\n\n- Connect with us\n\n\nRegistered in England & Wales No. 3099067\n\n5 Howick Place \\| London \\| SW1P 1WG\u00a9 2024 Informa UK Limited\n\nBack to Top",
