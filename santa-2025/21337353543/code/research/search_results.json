      "text": "To solve the 2D irregular polygon packing problem using simulated annealing and achieve a global optimum, you can follow these steps based on the relevant research:\n\n1. **Formulate the problem**: Define the set of irregular polygons to be packed within a fixed or extendable container, aiming to minimize container size or waste ([Result 1](https://skoge.folk.ntnu.no/prost/proceedings/ifac11-proceedings/data/html/papers/0563.pdf); [Result 3](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmech.2022.966691/full)).\n\n2. **Use collision-free region construction**: Implement a collision detection method such as Minkowski sums or no-fit polygons to determine feasible placement areas for each polygon, especially when rotations are involved ([Result 2](https://www.scielo.br/j/jbsmse/a/NjF3nW9xTMnxmMThYJ8WQyv); [Result 5](https://abcm.org.br/symposium-series/SSM_Vol2/Section_XII_Emerging_Technologies_and_AI_Applications/SSM2_XII_02.pdf)).\n\n3. **Design the simulated annealing algorithm**: \n   - Initialize with a feasible layout.\n   - Generate neighboring solutions by perturbing polygon positions or orientations, using adaptive neighborhood heuristics to improve search efficiency ([Result 9](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/6509/3a9d2d6b9b38ac2c9a2da79c3905b76ef008.pdf); [Result 6](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S147466701535549X)).\n   - Accept or reject new solutions based on a probabilistic criterion that depends on a cooling schedule, allowing escape from local minima ([Result 1](https://skoge.folk.ntnu.no/prost/proceedings/ifac11-proceedings/data/html/papers/0563.pdf); [Result 6](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S147466701535549X)).\n\n4. **Incorporate geometric cooling schedules**: Use geometrical or adaptive cooling schedules to gradually reduce the acceptance probability of worse solutions, guiding the search toward the global optimum ([Result 9](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/6509/3a9d2d6b9b38ac2c9a2da79c3905b76ef008.pdf)).\n\n5. **Optimize parameters and neighborhood moves**: Adjust neighborhood move types (translation, rotation, scaling) and cooling parameters to balance exploration and exploitation, improving chances of reaching the global optimum ([Result 9](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/6509/3a9d2d6b9b38ac2c9a2da79c3905b76ef008.pdf)).\n\n6. **Iterate until convergence**: Continue the annealing process until a stopping criterion is met, such as a maximum number of iterations or negligible improvement in solution quality.\n\nBy combining collision-free region construction, adaptive neighborhood moves, and a carefully designed cooling schedule, simulated annealing can effectively explore the solution space and approach the global optimum for 2D irregular polygon packing problems ([Results 1, 2, 5, 9](https://skoge.folk.ntnu.no/prost/proceedings/ifac11-proceedings/data/html/papers/0563.pdf); [Result 3](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmech.2022.966691/full)).",

INTRODUCTION\nCutting and packing are classic problems of finding the\nmost efficient layout for a set of input items out of a\ngiven container with the objective of minimizing the waste\nmaterial. The applications of cutting and packing, e.g.\nclothing, shipbuilding, and furniture industry are numer\u0002ous. W\u00a8ascher et al. (2007) have developed a typology that\nclassifies the nesting problems according to dimension,\nobjective, assortment of item type, as well as the number\nand nature of the container where the items are to be\nallocated. In this paper, we consider the irregular shape\npacking problem, classified as a two-dimensional irregular\nopen dimension problem (ODP).\nThe problem is NP-complete (Fowler et al., 1981) and\nas a result solution methodologies predominantly utilize\nheuristics. Although there are many different solution\napproaches presented in the literature, there appears to\nbe two key strategies for representing and searching the\nsolution space. The first approach represents the solution\nas an ordered list of items and applies a placement rule\nto construct the solution (Babu and Babu, 2001; Gomes\nand Oliveira, 2002; Burke et al., 2007, 2006). The second\napproach represents the solution as a physical layout on\nthe container and moves items within the layout (Bennell\n1 e-mail: andre.kubagawa@gmail.com. This author was partially\nsupported by CNPq.\n2 e-mail: thiago@usp.br. This author was partially supported by\nFAPESP (grant 2009/14699-0).\n3 e-mail: mtsuzuki@usp.br. This author was partially supported by\nCNPq (grant 304258/2007-5) and FAPESP (grant 2009/07173-2).\nand Dowsland, 1999; Gomes and Oliveira, 2006; Egeblad\net al., 2007). The former strategy is dependent on two\ncritical characteristics of the algorithm; the placement rule\nand the placement order of the items.\nWhen irregular shaped items are involved an extra di\u0002mension of complexity is generated by the geometry. The\nno-fit polygon is the principal approach for handling the\ngeometry in cutting and packing problems with irregular\nshaped items (Burke et al., 2007; Bennell and Song, 2008;\nCosta et al., 2009). The no-fit polygon is used to ensure\nfeasible layouts; i.e. layouts where the items do not overlap\nand fit inside the container.\nIn this paper, the solution is represented as an ordered\nlist of items and a constructive heuristic is applied se\u0002quentially. A simulated annealing algorithm controls how\nthe items are ordered in the list and where the items are\nconstructively placed. The proposed algorithm has two\nhierarchical levels. The inner level solves the placement\nproblem where the container has fixed dimensions. The\nexternal level reduces or increases the container dimen\u0002sion that must be minimized. Experiments show that the\nproposed method is very efficient compared with other\npublished methods.\n2. PREVIOUS WORKS\nThe no-fit polygon alone has limited utility in cutting\nand packing problems. Some recent works are using the\ncollision free region to determine feasible layouts in con\u0002tainers with fixed dimensions. Martins and Tsuzuki (2006)\nproposed a constructive heuristic where the collision free\nPreprints of the 18th IFAC World Congress\nMilano (Italy) August 28 - September 2, 2011\nCopyright by the\nInternational Federation of Automatic Control (IFAC)\n3968\nFig. 1. Cost function behavior when the container has fixed\ndimensions. The cost function assumes only discrete\nvalues, while the rotating angle \u03b8 is continuous.\nregion represents feasible placements for a moveable item\nconsidering the already placed items and the container.\nThe cost function is the non occupied area inside the\ncontainer with fixed dimensions. As the non occupied\narea can change only by adding or removing areas of\nitems, the cost function can assume only a finite set of\nvalues, becoming discontinuous (see Fig. 1). A simulated\nannealing algorithm with adaptive neighborhood (Martins\nand Tsuzuki, 2008, 2009a) controls the sequence of items\nand the placement on the collision free region boundary.\nThe collision free region was calculated using regularized\nBoolean operations implemented with limited precision\n(Hobby, 1999).\nMartins and Tsuzuki (2007) combined the simulated an\u0002nealing with deterministic heuristics (larger first and bot\u0002tom left). They showed that it is possible to create problem\ninstances where deterministic heuristics cannot reach the\nlayout associated with the global optimum.\nSato et al. (2010) implemented a robust algorithm to\ndetermine the collision free region with two dimension\nnon manifold Boolean operations. They created a problem\ninstance where the the global optimum can not be reached\nby placing the moveable item exclusively on collision free\nregion vertices. Such situation rarely occurs considering\nstudied and practical problems. They showed several re\u0002sults where the area of the container was exactly equal\nto the total area of the items. The layout associated with\nglobal optimum was reached in averagely 15 times fewer\niterations when compared to previously published results\n(Martins and Tsuzuki, 2009b, 2010) where the area of the\ncontainer was larger than the total area of the items. The\ncorrect calculation of the collision free region showed to be\nan effective tool to obtain such results.\n3. NO-FIT POLYGONS AND COLLISION FREE\nREGION\nNo-fit polygons represent set of translations of an item\nand are mathematically represented by a set of vectors.\nFor a better understanding of the properties of the no-fit\npolygons, the set of translations of an item is represented\nby polygons in the plane. Every item has a reference point\nthat can be internal or external to it. The no-fit polygon\nrepresents a set of forbidden translations, as shown in\nFig. 2. For an item P, let i(P) be its interior, \u2202P be its\nboundary and c(P) be its complement.\nFig. 2. Set of translations of a shape represented as a region\ncontaining all possible translations from its reference\npoint.\nDefinition 3.1. The no-fit polygon induced by item Pi to\nitem Pj , denoted by \u03a5(Pi, Pj ), is the set of translation\nvectors applied to Pj that leads it to a collision with Pi.\nThus,\n\u03a5(Pi, Pj ) = i(Pi) \t i(Pj ) (1)\n= {v | \u2203 a \u2208 i(Pj ), a + v \u2208 i(Pi)}\nThe no-fit polygon can be obtained by the Minkowski\nsum algorithm (Agarwal et al., 2002), that can be calcu\u0002lated very efficiently for convex polygons.

Three possibilities to define the sequence on which the small items are placed are studied: larger-first, random permutation and weight sorted. The proposed algorithm is suited for non-convex small items and large objects.\n**Keywords:**knapsack problem, cutting and packing, optimization\n**Introduction**\nThe knapsack problem arises in the industry whenever one must place multiple small items inside a large object such that there is no collision between the small items, while either minimizing the size of the large object or maximizing the volume occupied by the small items. High material utilization is of particular interest to mass production industries since small improvements of the layout can result in large savings of material and considerably reduce production cost.\nThe knapsack problem belongs to the more general class of combinatorial problems known as cutting and packing problems. According to Dyckhoff (1990), the cutting and packing problems are mainly characterized by the number of relevant dimensions, the regularity and irregularity of the shapes of the small items and large objects and the problem assignment. Considering assignment, it is possible to identify two situations: output maximization and input minimization. In the input minimization, the set of large objects is sufficient to accommodate all small items, and there is no selection regarding the small items. In the case of output maximization, the set of large objects is not sufficient to accommodate all the small items and a set of small items has to be assigned to a given set of large objects. The survey made by Wascher et al. (2005) improved the typology of cutting and packing problems proposed by Dyckhoff (1990). According to Wascher et al. (2005), the problem studied in this work can be defined as: \" ... the knapsack problem represents a problem category which is characterized by a strongly heteroge-neous assortment of small items which have to be allocated to a given set of large objects. Again, the availability of the large objects is limited such that not all small items can be accommodated. The value of the accommodated small items is to be maximized\" . In this survey, Wascher et al. (2005) identified 294 papers containing material relevant to cutting and packing. Only 5...",

An efficient 2D irregular packing algorithm can effectively improve material utilization and reduce processing costs. The reduction in material consumption will also have a beneficial impact on the environment ([Ke et al., 2020](#B76)). Therefore, research of the packing problem is of great significance for technology and social interest.\nThe 2D packing problem is a type of combinatorial optimization problems to locate parts with different shapes compactly in one or more master sheet material to minimize the occupied space or maximize the utilization of the material. The 2D packing problem is currently recognized as a NP problem, which is mainly solved by heuristic algorithms. In recent years, many scholars have conducted research on 2D irregular packing problems with a verity of solutions.\nThere exists a number of review articles on packing and cutting problems. We have summarized the main review literature in the field of 2D packing and cutting as shown in[Table 1](#T1). Brown ([Brown, 1971](#B17)) introduced an optimum packing and depletion problem with optimization of space and resource usage. Harvey ([Salkin and De Kluyver, 1975](#B116)) surveyed the application of mathematical optimization models such as linear programming to the knapsack problem. Bruce ([Golden, 1976](#B50)) surveyed various approaches to the cutting stock problem. Hinxman ([Hinxman, 1980](#B65)) surveyed the trim-loss and assortment problems, this research paid more attention to cutting and packaging problems in practical applications, and did not mention much about theoretical methods. Garey and Coffman ([Garey and Johnson, 1981](#B47);[Coffman et al., 1984](#B27)) surveyed the approximation algorithms for bin packing problems. Israni ([Israni and Sanders, 1982](#B72)) reviewed the 2D cutting stock problem including almost all 2D packaging problems. The author also proposed a rectangular layout method. Sarin ([Sarin, 1983](#B118)) reviewed methodologies and literature to solve 2D stock cutting problems and introduced an interactive optimization procedure for a general 2D stock cutting problem. Dyckhoff ([Dyckhoff et al., 1985](#B38)) described a trim loss and related problems and categorized them briefly. Dudzi&#x00144;ski ([Dudzi&#x00144;ski and Walukiewicz, 1987](#B36)) summarized the exact methods for knapsack problems, such as linear programming. Matthias ([Rode and Rosenberg, 1987](#B114)) analyzed the algorithm for the trim-loss problems. Haessler ([Haessler and Sweeney, 1991](#B59)) reviewed the solution process of cutting stock problems, including placement algorithm and sequence optimization algorithm. Dowsland ([Dowsland and Dowsland, 1992](#B34)) reviewed the application of operations research methods to the packing problem and summarized some exact heuristics. Sweeney ([Sweeney and Paternoster, 1992](#B128)) categorized cutting and packing problems and made application-oriented research records. Cheng ([Cheng et al., 1994](#B22)) discussed 2D cutting stock problems and their application cases including the pallet loading problem and VLSI placement problem. With the gradual deepening of research on 2D layout problems, typology becomes a common research topic. 2D regular and irregular layout problems are clearly distinguished in practical applications and theoretical methods. Dowsland ([Dowsland and Dowsland, 1995](#B29)) gave a special review of the 2D irregular nesting problem for the first time. Mavridou ([Mavridou and Pardalos, 1997](#B98)) summarized applications of the genetic algorithm and simulated annealing algorithm in the optimization of facility layout problems. Dyckhoff ([Dyckhoff, 1990](#B37)) made a typology of the cutting and packing problems in detail, and W&#x000e4;scher ([W&#x000e4;scher et al., 2007](#B135)) improved the typology later. Hopper ([Hopper and Turton, 1999](#B67);[Hopper and Turton, 2001a](#B68);[Hopper and Turton, 2001b](#B69)) investigated the application of meta-heuristic and heuristic algorithms in 2D and 3D packing problems. Lodi ([Lodi et al., 2002a](#B90);[Lodi et al., 2002b](#B91)) reviewed algorithms proposed in the 1990s of 2D packing problems. Bennell et al. ([Bennell and Oliveira, 2008](#B10);[Bennell and Oliveira, 2009](#B9)) discussed 2D irregular packing problems and related geometric problems. Leao ([Leao et al., 2020](#B81)) introduced the mathematical models in the 2D irregular packing problem.\nTABLE 1\n[![www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/966691/fmech-08-966691-HTML/image_m/fmech-08-966691-t001.jpg)](https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/966691/fmech-08-966691-HTML/image_m/fmech-08-966691-t001.jpg)\n**TABLE 1**.

G.\nDepartment of Mechatronics and Mechanical Systems Engineering, EPUSP\nmtsuzuki@usp.br\nThis work deals with the problem of minimize the waste of space that occurs on a placement of a set of bi-dimensional\npolygons inside a bi-dimensional container. This problem is approached with an heuristic based on Simulated Annealing,\nwhich is inspired on the physico-chemical process that take place during the recrystalisation of a metal. Traditional \u201cex\u0002ternal penalisation\u201d techniques are avoided through the application of the Minkowski sum algorithm, that determinates\ncollision-free areas for the set of polygons. That gives to the proposed process a more universal character, as external\npenalisations are based on empiric parameters of great influence on the optimisation performance. The proposed process\nis suited for non-convex polygons and containers, and can be easily adapted for related problems, such as container size\nminimisation.\n1. Introduction to placement problems\nThe polygonal placement problems arises in the industry whenever one must place multiple objects inside a container\nso that there is no collision between the objects, while either minimizing the size of the container either maximizing the\nvolume occupied by the objects. For instance, on the shoe industry, a maximum number of shoe parts must be placed\nover a leather piece. Another instance of the problem occurs in the textile industry, where cloth parts must be placed over\nthe smallest possible sheet of tissue. Those problems are also closely related to robot motion planning, where a trajectory\nfor an object (the robot) that leads it from one point to another must be found while avoiding collisions with pre-placed\nobstacles. Those placement problems are also known by the names of nesting, containment, layout, packing and cutting\nstock (Downsland et al., 1995). Surveys of placement problems can be found at (Lodi et al., 2002; Downsland et al., 1992;\nDownsland et al., 1995). Computational approaches often focus on purely translational versions of the problem, and the\nmajor part of them approach problems whose polygons are constrained to rectangular shapes.\n2. This work\nAs seen on the section 1, due to their complexity, irregular placement problems are the least computationally ap\u0002proached, despite their great relevancy for the industry. This is the motivation for this work, which deals with the bidi\u0002mentional placement on its most unconstrained form, the translational and rotational placement of heterogeneous irregular\nforms (both nonvex and non convex) on irregular containers (also both convex and non convex).\n2.1 Problem statement\nThe problem can be defined as the problem of, given a container (a polygon, convex or non-convex) and a polygon\nset, to determinate a subset of polygons and the transformations (translations and rotations) that, when applied to their\nrespective polygons, place them without collisions inside the container while minimising the wasted space (see Figure 1).\nDefinition 1 There is a collision between two polygons when their intersection is a non-empty set.\nAs mentioned, it can be show that even restricted versions of this problem (for instance, limiting the polygon shape to\nrectangles only) are NP-Complete, which means it is believed they cannot be algorithmically solved for practical instances\n(Fowler et al. 1981). This motivates an heuristic approach, that while is not guaranteed to find the optimal solution, can,\nin a reasonable amount of time, find a good solution. Probabilistic optimisation heuristics follow this pattern: while a\nstipulated stop criteria is not satisfied, at each step the function to be optimised is evaluated at a set of points and a set of\nrules is applied to determinate the set of points to be evaluated at the next step. The process converges to a solution of the\nproblem.\nFor our problem, the space of valid solutions is the set of transformations (\u2206x, \u2206y, \u2206\u03b8) to be applied to the polygons\nrestricted to the condition of no-collisions between them. The space delimited by those restrictions is very complex (and\nmutable). Usually, when confronted to such complex spaces, probabilistic heuristics \u201crelax\u201d the original constrains of\nProcedings of COBEM 2005\nCopyright \u00b0c 2005 by ABCM\n18th International Congress of Mechanical Engineering\nNovember 6-11, 2005, Ouro Preto, MG\nPolygon set Container\nSolution\nFigure 1. A placement problem and its optimal solution.\nthe problem, allowing the search to go through points outside the space of valid solutions and applying penalisations to\ntheir cost. This technique is known as external penalisation. While at first this technique greatly simplifies the problem,\nit also introduces and additional problem: How to determinate the exact amount of penalisation to be applied to external\npoints? Another drawback of external penalisation is that it can lead the optimisation process to non-valid solutions. This\ncan be seen on the work of Heckman (1995), where problems very similar to those studied here are approached with\nsimulated annealing. On his work. Heckman points that his optimisation process can produce invalid solutions (solutions\nwith collisions between polygons), requiring a post-processing step of the obtained data.\nThe approach adopted here avoids the pitfalls of external penalisation by the continuous mapping (meaning it is\nupdated at each step of the process) of the complex space of valid solution into a simplified space. Although this additional\nmapping step increases the complexity of the process, it confers to the process a more universal character, as there is one\nless empiric parameter to be defined. Actually, the proposed process does not explores the whole space of possible\nsolutions, focusing instead on a reduced space, that contains at least one optimal solution. This reduces the search through\nirrelevant points and enhances the performance of the process.\n2.2 Simulated annealing\nSimulated Annealing (Kirkpatrick et al., 1983) is the probabilistic meta-heuristic adopted on this work. It was chose\ndue to its capacity of \u201cescape\u201d from local minima (which are very frequent on this problem). It is also worth of mention\nthat the process of recrystalisation, the inspiration for simulated annealing, is a natural instance of a placement problem.\n2.2.1 Description\nSimulated annealing comes from the Metropolis algorithm, a simulation of the recrystalisation of atoms on a metal\nduring its annealing (gradual and controlled cooling). During annealing, atoms migrate naturally to configurations that\nminimize the system total energy, even if during this migration the system must pass through high-energy configurations.\nThe observation of this behavior suggests the application of the simulation of such process to combinatorial optimisation\nproblems.\nSimulated annealing is a hill-climbing local exploration1 optimisation heuristic, which means it can skip local minima\nby allowing the exploration of the space in directions that lead to an increase on the cost function. It sequentially applies\nrandom modifications on the evaluation point of the cost function. If a modification yields a point of smaller cost,\nit is automatically kept. Otherwise, the modification also can be kept with a probability obtained form the Boltzman\ndistribution (1).\nP(\u2206E) = e\n\u2212 \u2206E\nkt (1)\nwhere P(\u2206E) is the probability of the optimisation process to keep a modification that incurred on an increase \u2206E of\nthe cost function, k is a parameter of the process (analogous to the Stefan-Boltzman constant) and t is the instantaneous\n\u201ctemperature\u201d of the process. This temperature is defined by a cooling schedul...",

This problem is approached with an heuristic based on Simulated Annealing (SA) with adaptive neighborhood. Traditional \u201cexternal penalization\u201d techniques are avoided through the application of the no\u2013fit polygon, that determinates the collision-free area for each polygon before its placement. The SA controls continuous and discrete parameters. The rotation applied and the translation of the polygon are continuous parameters, and the sequence of placement is represented as a set of discrete parameters. For each non\u2013placed item, a limited depth binary search is performed to find a scale factor that when applied to the item, would allow it to be fitted in the container.\n\n- [Previous article in issue](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1474667015355488)\n- [Next article in issue](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1474667015355506)\n\n## Keywords\n\nSimulated Annealing\n\nPlacement Problems\n\nOptimization\n\nProbabilistic Heuristics\n\n[View PDF](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S147466701535549X/pdf?md5=7bca88c33d2daef044751913b4156e2b&pid=1-s2.0-S147466701535549X-main.pdf)\n\nSpecial issue articlesRecommended articles\n\n## References\n\n01.

Introduction\nSimulated annealing has been applied to a wide range of problems: combinatorial and\ncontinuous optimizations. This work approaches a new class of problems in which the\nobjective function is discrete but the parameters are continuous. This type of problem arises in\nrotational irregular packing problems. It is necessary to place multiple items inside a container\nsuch that there is no collision between the items, while minimizing the items occupied area.\nA feedback is proposed to control the next candidate probability distribution, in order to\nincrease the number of accepted solutions. The probability distribution is controlled by\nthe so called crystallization factor. The proposed algorithm modifies only one parameter\nat a time. If the new configuration is accepted then a positive feedback is executed to\nresult in larger modifications. Different types of positive feedbacks are studied herein. If\nthe new configuration is rejected, then a negative feedback is executed to result in smaller\nmodifications. For each non-placed item, a limited depth binary search is performed to find a\nscale factor that, when applied to the item, allows it to be fitted in the layout. The proposed\nalgorithm was used to solve two different rotational puzzles. A geometrical cooling schedule\nis used. Consequently, the proposed algorithm can be classified as simulated quenching.\nThis work is structured as follows. Section 2 presents some simulated annealing and\nsimulated quenching key concepts. In section 3 the objective function with discrete values and\ncontinuous parameters is explained. Section 4 explains the proposed adaptive neighborhood\nbased on the crystallization factor. Section 5 explains the computational experiments and\nsection 6 presents the results. Finally, section 7 rounds up the work with the conclusions.\n2. Background\nSimulated annealing is a probabilistic meta-heuristic with a capacity of escape from local\nminima.

The simulated annealing was modified in order to apply to the optimization of\nmultimodal functions defined on continuous domain [4]. The choices of the cooling schedule\nand of the next candidate distribution are the most important decisions in the definition of a\nsimulated annealing algorithm [13]. The next candidate distribution for continuous variables\nis discussed herein.\nIn the discrete domain, such as the traveling salesman and computer circuit design problems,\nthe parameters must have discrete values; the next point candidate xk+1 corresponds to a\npermutation in the list of cities to be visited, interchanges of circuit elements, or other discrete\noperation. In the continuous application of simulated annealing a new choice of the next point\ncandidate must be executed. Bohachevsky et al. [1] proposed that the next candidate xk+1 can\nbe obtained by first generating a random direction vector u, with |u| = 1, then multiplying it\nby a fixed step size \u0394r, and summing the resulting vector to the current candidate point xk.\nBrooks & Verdini [2] showed that the selection of \u0394r is a critical choice. They observed that an\nappropriate choice of this parameter is strictly dependent on the objective function F(x), and\nthe appropriate value can be determined by presampling the objective function.\nThe directions in [1] are randomly sampled from the uniform distribution and the step size is\nthe same in each direction. In this way, the feasible region is explored in an isotropic way and\nthe objective function is assumed to behave in the same way in each direction. But this is not\noften the case. The step size to define the next candidate point xk+1 should not be equal for all\nthe directions, but different directions should have different step sizes; i.e. the space should\nbe searched in an anisotropic way. Corana et al. [4] explored the concept of anisotropic search;\nthey proposed a self-tuning simulated annealing algorithm in which the step size is configured\nin order to maintain a number of accepted solutions. At each iteration k, a single variable of\nxk is modified in order to obtain a new candidate point xk+1, and iterations are subdivided\ninto cycles of n iterations during which each variable is modified. The new candidate point is\nobtained from xk in the following form xk+1 = xk + v \u00b7 \u0394ri \u00b7 ei. Where v is a uniform random\nnumber in [\u22121, 1], and \u0394ri is the step size along direction ei of the i-th axis. The anisotropy is\nobtained by choosing different values of \u0394ri for all the directions. The step size is kept fixed\nfor a certain number of cycles of variables, and the fraction of accepted moves in direction ei\nis calculated. If the fraction of accepted moves generated in the same direction is below 0.4,\nthen the step size \u0394ri along ei is decreased. It is assumed that the algorithm is using too large\nsteps along ei thus causing many moves to be rejected. If the fraction is between 0.4 and 0.6\nthe step size is left unchanged. If the fraction is above 0.6 then \u0394ri is increased. It is assumed\nthat the step size is too small thus causing many moves to be accepted.\nThis procedure may not be the best possible to process the different behavior of the objective\nfunction along different axes. Ingber [7] proposed that the random variable should follow a\nCauchy distribution with different sensitivities at different temperatures. The maximum step\nsize is kept constant during the algorithm and it allows escaping from local minima even at\nlow temperatures. The parameter space can have completely different sensitivities for each\ndimension, therefore the use of different temperatures for each dimension is suggested. This\nmethod is often referred to as very fast simulated re-annealing (VFSR) or adaptive simulated\nannealing (ASA). The sensitivity of each parameter is given by the partial derivative of the\nfunction with relation to the i-th dimension [3].\n4 Simulated Annealing \u2013 Advances, Applications and Hybridizations\nAdaptive Neighborhood Heuristics for Simulated Annealing over Continuous Variables 3\n3. Integer objective function with float parameters\nIrregular packing problems arise in the industry whenever one must place multiple items\ninside a container such that there is no collision between the items, while minimizing the\narea occupied by the items. It can be shown that even restricted versions of this problem (for\ninstance, limiting the polygon shape to rectangles only) are NP complete, which means that\nall algorithms currently known for optimal solutions require a number of computational steps\nthat grow exponentially with the problem size rather than according to a polynomial function\n[5]. Usually probabilistic heuristics relax the original constraints of the problem, allowing the\nsearch to go through points outside the space of valid solutions and applying penalization to\ntheir cost. This technique is known as external penalization. The most adopted penalization\nheuristic for external solutions of packing problems is to apply a penalization based on\nthe overlapping area of colliding items. While this heuristic leads to very computationally\nefficient iterations of the optimization process, the layout with objective function in minimum\nvalue may have overlapped items [6].\nFig. 1 shows an example in which the c...",

The container has a fixed width, while its length can change so that all items are placed in it. The objective is to find a layout of the set of polygons that minimizes the length of the container. The proposed algorithm constructively creates layouts from an ordered list of items and a placement heuristic. The placement determines the collision free region (represents the set of translations to create a feasible layout) for the item to be placed. It is shown that the collision free region must be calculated using non-regularized Boolean operations, as contours of no-fit polygons should be ignored. The proposed algorithm to solve the placement problem has two levels, in the internal level the container has fixed dimensions, and the external level reduces or increases the variable dimension. The placement heuristic searches for degenerated vertices and edges as they represent local maximum compaction. Computational comparisons on benchmark problems show that the proposed algorithm generated highly competitive solutions. Moreover, our algorithm updated some best known results.\n...Read more\n## Key takeaways\n![sparkles](https://a.academia-assets.com/images/icons/sparkle.svg)\nAI\n1.

This problem is approached with an heuristic based on simulated annealing. Traditional &quot;external penalization&quot; techniques are avoided through the application of the no-fit polygon, that determinates the collision-free region for each small item before its placement. The simulated annealing controls: the rotation applied and the placement of the small item. For each non-placed small item, a limited depth binary search is performed to find a scale factor that when applied to the small item, would allow it to be fitted in the large object. Three possibilities to define the sequence on which the small items are placed are studied: larger-first, random permutation and weight sorted. The proposed algorithm is suited for non-convex small items and large objects.\ndownloadDownload free PDF[View PDFchevron\\_right](https://www.academia.edu/58884840/Rotational_Placement_of_Irregular_Polygons_over_Containers_with_Fixed_Dimensions_using_Simulated_Annealing_and_No_Fit_Polygons)\n[An effective heuristic for the two-dimensional irregular bin packing problem](https://www.academia.edu/69875946/An_effective_heuristic_for_the_two_dimensional_irregular_bin_packing_problem)\n[Gabriela Ochoa](https://independent.academia.edu/GabrielaOchoa10)\nAnnals of Operations Research, 2013\nThis paper proposes an adaptation, to the two-dimensional irregular bin packing problem of the Djang and Finch heuristic (DJD), originally designed for the one-dimensional bin packing problem. In the two-dimensional case, not only is it the case that the piece&#39;s size is important but its shape also has a significant influence. Therefore, DJD as a selection heuristic has to be paired with a placement heuristic to completely construct a solution to the underlying packing problem. A successful adaptation of the DJD requires a routine to reduce computational costs, which is also proposed and successfully tested in this paper. Results, on a wide variety of instance types with convex polygons, are found to be significantly better than those produced by more conventional selection heuristics.\ndownloadDownload free PDF[View PDFchevron\\_right](https://www.academia.edu/69875946/An_effective_heuristic_for_the_two_dimensional_irregular_bin_packing_problem)\n[Irregular rotational placement of shapes over non-convex containers with fixed dimensions](https://www.academia.edu/104990568/Irregular_rotational_placement_of_shapes_over_non_convex_containers_with_fixed_dimensions)\n[Thiago de Castro Martins](https://independent.academia.edu/ThiagodeCastroMartins)\n8th IFAC International Workshop on Intelligent Manufacturing Systems, 2007, 2007\nThis work deals with the problem of minimize the waste of space that occurs on a placement of a set of bi-dimensional items inside a bi-dimensional container with fixed dimensions.

High material utilization is of particular interest to mass production industries since small improvements of the layout can result in large savings of material and considerably reduce production cost. In this work the Simulated Annealing is combined with deterministic heuristics (larger first (LF), bottom left (BL) and translations only (Tr)) and compared. The rotational generic approach has discrete (sequence of placement) and continuous (angle and position) parameters. It is very important to notice that the cost function (non occupied space) has only discrete values.\n\n- [Previous article in issue](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1474667016340174)\n- [Next article in issue](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1474667016340198)\n\n## Keywords\n\nComputer vision\n\nmatched filter\n\ninvariant mapping\n\n[View PDF](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1474667016340186/pdf?md5=8b357149307a0ecbdb40b0d6add2590e&pid=1-s2.0-S1474667016340186-main.pdf)\n\nSpecial issue articlesRecommended articles\n\n## References\n\n01.
