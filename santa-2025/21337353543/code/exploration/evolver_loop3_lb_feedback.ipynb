    "## Strategic Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Local Search Failed\n",
    "1. The baseline was already optimized by sophisticated C++ tools (bbox3, SA)\n",
    "2. Simple moves (translation, rotation) cannot escape the local optimum\n",
    "3. The configurations are already tightly packed\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Could Work\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Simulated Annealing from Scratch** - Accept worse moves to escape local optima\n",
    "2. **Random Restart** - Start from different initial configurations\n",
    "3. **Constructive Heuristics** - Build solutions from scratch (like zaburo kernel)\n",
    "4. **Ensemble Best Per-N** - Combine best solutions from multiple sources\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Insight from Zaburo Kernel\n",
    "The zaburo kernel shows a CONSTRUCTIVE approach:\n",
    "- Build solutions using alternating rows (0° and 180° angles)\n",
    "- Trees at 0° and 180° can interlock efficiently\n",
    "- This achieves 88.33 initially but provides a DIFFERENT starting point\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommended Next Steps\n",
    "1. Implement simulated annealing FROM SCRATCH in Python\n",
    "2. Start from RANDOM configurations, not the optimized baseline\n",
    "3. Focus on finding DIFFERENT local optima, not improving the current one"
