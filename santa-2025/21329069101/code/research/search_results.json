Despite a large number of studies on the two-dimensional irregular strip packing problem, much less attention has been paid to the two-dimensional irregular bin packing problem (2DIBPP), and most of the current research on 2DIBPP is about free rotations. However, limited by the texture of the material, sometimes only some specific degrees of rotations are allowed. To pack a set of irregular pieces with some specific degrees into multi-stock sheets and maximize the utilization, we propose a heuristic algorithm that combines some pieces into one block for packing and uses residual spaces with reference lines to help select the next piece to be packed. In order to further increase the utilization of bins, we adopt fine-tuning, movement, filling, replacement and swap operations, as well as partial and full repack strategies. The computational results show that the proposed algorithm can obtain superior results on the instances with small number of pieces, relatively large number of types of pieces, large bins and more specific degrees of rotations.\n\n## Introduction\n\nIrregular packing problems are also called nesting problems (Bennell and Oliveira, 2009). Irregular packing problems can be further divided into different variants based on various perspectives. W\u00e4scher et al. (2007) introduced six kinds of cutting and packing problems, namely Identical Item Packing Problem (IIPP) (Costa et al., 2009), Placement Problem (PP) (Romanova et al., 2019), Knapsack Problem (KP) (Baldacci et al., 2014), Open Dimension Problem (ODP) (Rodrigues and Toledo, 2017, Mundim et al., 2017, Wang et al., 2018), Cutting Stock Problem (CSP) (MirHassani and Bashirzadeh, 2015) and Bin Packing Problem (BPP) (Martinez-Sykora et al., 2017, Abeysooriya et al., 2018, Bennell et al., 2018).\n\nThis paper addresses the two-dimensional irregular bin packing problem (2DIBPP) where the pieces are irregular with concavities. Even though many studies have focused on the two-dimensional irregular packing problem in recent years, they are mainly about the irregular strip packing problem which is a type of ODP. In the strip packing problem, the width of the stock sheet is fixed and the objective is to minimize the total length (Rodrigues and Toledo, 2017, Cherri et al., 2016). However, in real life, manufactures often use multi-stock sheets (bins) with fixed dimensions, which is related to 2DIBPP. 2DIBPP is a type of BPP and can be classified as a two-dimensional Single Bin Size Bin Packing Problem (SBSBPP).\n\nRotation is an important attribute of pieces, and plays a vital role on the final packing patterns. For two-dimensional irregular packing problems, rotations are usually divided into {0,180} degrees, {0,90,180,270} degrees (Sato et al., 2019), and free rotations (Martinez-Sykora et al., 2017, Abeysooriya et al., 2018, Cherri et al., 2018). For example, in the garment industry, the rotation is restricted, while in glass and sheet metal cutting applications, free rotations are allowed. For three-dimensional irregular packing problems, the vertical direction is sometimes fixed but the horizontal direction can be rotated, that is, the bottom area is unchanged. For some specific situations, items can be rotated in any direction (Romanova et al., 2018).\n\nCurrently, most studies of the 2DIBPP are about free rotations. Martinez-Sykora et al. (2017) combined the free rotation of irregular pieces with the bin packing problem for the first time. Abeysooriya et al. (2018) applied Jostle algorithm and addressed simultaneously both the allocation of pieces and the placement of bins. However, due to the limitation of material texture, only some specific degrees of rotations are allowed. Liu et al. (2020) proposed a heuristic for 2DIBPP with limited rotations where the overlapping removal based placement was used. Zhang et al. (2022) proposed an iteratively doubling local search approach for 2DIBPP with limited rotations, including a least waste first decreasing strategy, a simple greedy local search approach and an overlap minimization approach. In this study, we also consider the 2DIBPP with limited rotations but design different heuristics to solve it.\n\nOur study makes several contributions to the literature. First, our paper is the first to introduce blocks to 2DIBPP, which were previously used for strip packing problems. We also extend to generate blocks with more than two pieces. The pieces are combined into blocks so that the shapes of the pieces can be complementary to reduce wasted bin space. Second, we are the first to apply residual spaces with reference lines to 2DIBPP to guide the selection of the next piece to pack. Third, a series of operations are used to further increase the utilization of bins, including fine-tuning, movement, filling and replacement for the placement of one bin, and swap between bins. Most of these operations are rarely used in the irregular packing problems. Fourth, to find better solutions without increasing too much computational time, we newly propose the partial and full repack strategies. Partial repack draws on previous experience to keep some of the higher utilization bins intact and only repack the remaining bins, while full repack throws away the experience and starts packing from the first empty bin. Finally, we can improve the best-known results for some benchmark instances.\n\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we define some notations and describe the problem. Section 3 introduces our heuristic method, including the block, residual spaces with reference lines, fine-tuning, movement, filling, replacement and swap operations, and partial and full repack strategies. In Section 4, we present the experimental data and the computational results. We summarize our conclusions and ...",

Recent performance gains of the Mixed-Integer Linear\nProgramming (MILP) solvers have encouraged the proposal of exact optimization\nmodels for nesting. The Dotted-Board (DB) MILP model solves the discrete version\nof the nesting problem by constraining the positions of the polygons to be on a grid of\nfixed points. However, its number of non-overlapping constraints grows exponentially\nwith the number of dots and types of polygons, which encouraged the proposal\nof a reformulation called the DB Clique Covering (DB-CC) that sets the current\nstate-of-the-art by significantly reducing the constraints required. However, DB-CC\nrequires a significant preprocessing time to compute edge and vertex clique coverings.\nMoreover, current knowledge of the stable set polytope suggests that achieving a\ntighter formulation is unlikely. Thus, our hypothesis is that an ad-hoc exact algorithm\nrequiring no preprocessing might be a better option to solve the DB model than the\ncostly Branch-and-Cut approach. This work proposes an exact branch-and-bound\u0002and-prune algorithm to solve the DB model from the conflict inverse graph based\non ad-hoc data structures, bounding, and forward-checking for pruning the search\nspace. We introduce two 0-1 ILP DB reformulations with discrete rotations and\na new lower-bound algorithm as by-products. Our experiments show that DB-PB\nsignificantly reduces the resolution time compared to our replication of the DB-CC\nmodel. Seventeen open instances are solved up to optimality.\n1. Introduction\nCutting and packing regular (convex) and irregular (non-convex) polygons onto a rectangular strip with\nunbounded length is a tedious and usual task in most manufacturing industries based on the cutting of any flat\nmaterial. For instance, Milenkovic et al. [84] study the nesting problem for the fashion and apparel industry,\nwhilst Heistermann and Lengauer [64] and Whelan and Batchelor [124] do it for leather manufacturing,\nElamvazuthi et al. [45] in furniture, Han et al. [62] in the glass industry, Alves et al. [8] in the automotive\nindustry, and Cheok and Nee [29] and Hamada et al. [61] in shipbuilding. The irregular strip-packing problem\nis also known as nesting or marker making in the industry, and it consists in computing a non-overlapping\nplacement of a set of irregular polygons, called pieces, onto a fixed-width rectangular strip with unbounded\nlength, called the board, whose length is the minimum possible. Another closely related problem, called\ntwo-dimensional bin packing [80, 66], is defined as the computation of a non-overlapping placement of a set\nof polygons onto a larger closed polygon, called the bin, to minimize the number of bins required. Regular\nand irregular strip and bin packing problems, and all their variants concerning the geometry of the pieces\n\u2217Corresponding author\njlastra@ucm.es (J.J.

[122], and extensively reviewed by Sweeney and Paternoster [116], Dowsland and\nDowsland [41], Wang and W\u00e4scher [120], and Bennell et al. [18], among others.\nResearch on the irregular strip and bin packing problems can be traced back to the pioneering Linear\nProgramming (LP) models for rectangular bin packing introduced by Gilmore and Gomory [55], and the\npioneering heuristic methods for irregular strip packing proposed by Art [10], Adamowicz and Albano [4, 3],\nand Albano and Sapuppo [6] in the late nineteen sixties and seventies. These early works introduce many of\nthe basic ideas subsequently exploited by all heuristics methods reported in the literature, such as the notion\nof a feasible non-overlapping region between pieces based on the No-Fit Polygon (NFP) representation [16],\nand the sequential placement of pieces based on bottom-left heuristics. The boundary and outer region of the\nno-fit polygon \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc39 \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc35 set the feasible positions in which polygon \ud835\udc35 can be placed, without rotating, into\na non-overlapping position with respect to polygon \ud835\udc34. Thus, the no-fit polygon allows one to compute the\nfeasible relative placements between polygons \ud835\udc34 and \ud835\udc35 a priori by checking whether their relative position\nvector \ud835\udeff\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc35 = \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc35 \u2212 \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc34 belongs to either the boundary or the outer region of \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc39 \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc35, where \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc34 and \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc35\ndenote their corresponding reference points. This property has converted the NFP into the most broadly\nadopted and effective geometric representation for nesting reported in the literature, both for the families of\nheuristics methods [17] and for exact mathematical models [73].\nFowler et al. [51] show that the irregular strip-packing problem is NP-complete. For this reason, most\npractical solutions reported in the literature since the pioneering work of Art [10] are based on sequential\nplacement heuristics to build efficiently feasible solutions that are combined with meta-heuristics for\nexploring the space of feasible solutions, as shown in most of surveys on nesting [42, 43, 65, 17, 102]. Elkeran\n[46] introduces the current state-of-the-art heuristic method for nesting, called Guided Cuckoo Search (GCS),\nwhich defines a two-stage method based on piece clustering and NFP-based bottom-left heuristics [57] to\nbuild an initial feasible solution that is shrunk by solving an overlap minimization problem using a variant\nof the cuckoo search meta-heuristics. Although GCS was introduced more than a decade ago, subsequent\nworks have been unable to outperform its results, as shown by Pinheiro et al. [98, table 3], Sato et al. [107,\ntable 5], Cherri et al. [30, table 4], Mundim et al. [87, table 6], Amaro J\u00fanior et al. [9, table 2], and Sato et al.\n[106, tables 4-5]. More recently, other authors have introduced new heuristics for the continuous and discrete\nversions of the nesting problem, such as the works of Fang et al. [48], Na and Yang [88], Guo et al. [60],\nSato et al. [108], Queiroz and de Queiroz [101], Umetani and Murakami [119], and Queiroz and Andretta\n[100]. For a recent comparison of heuristics and exact mathematical models for nesting, we refer the readers\nto the comparative evaluation carried out by Giovenali et al. [56].\nThe recent performance gains achieved by state-of-the-art Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) solvers\n[22, 2, 67] have encouraged the proposal of exact mathematical models for nesting during the last\ndecade, as shown by the literature reviews of Leao et al. [73] and Lastra-D\u00edaz and Ortu\u00f1o [70]. The\nexact mathematical models for nesting can be categorized into mixed-integer linear programming models,\nConstraint Programming (CP) models, and non-linear programming models, as shown in the categorization\nof Lastra-D\u00edaz and Ortu\u00f1o [70, Fig. 1]. In turn, the family of mathematical programming models for nesting\ncan be categorized into three large families according to the type of decision variables used to represent\nthe position of the pieces as follows. Firstly, the family of continuous models, such as the pioneering MILP\nmodel of Li [76, \u00a78], and the subsequent MILP models propo...",

Findings of this study reveal that the proposed algorithms can be applied to different variants of the problem and generate significantly better results.\n\nText\n\n**Accepted\\_article\\_IJPE**\n**\\- Accepted Manuscript**\n\nAvailable under License [Creative Commons Attribution Non-commercial No Derivatives](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/).\n\n[Download](https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/414392/1/Accepted_article_IJPE.pdf) (1MB)\n\n## More information\n\nAccepted/In Press date: 20 September 2017\n\ne-pub ahead of print date: 22 September 2017\n\nPublished date: January 2018\n\nKeywords:\nCutting and packing , bin packing, Irregular shapes, heuristics\n\n[Learn more about Southampton Business School research](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/business-school/research/index.page)\n\n## Identifiers\n\nLocal EPrints ID: 414392\n\nURI: http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/id/eprint/414392\n\nDOI: [doi:10.1016/j.ijpe.2017.09.014](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpe.2017.09.014)\n\nISSN: 0925-5273\n\nPURE UUID: ad1935b2-7607-4c53-95fd-422c2185d298\n\nORCID for Antonio Martinez Sykora: [orcid.org/0000-0002-2435-3113](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2435-3113)\n\n## Catalogue record\n\nDate deposited: 28 Sep 2017 16:31\n\nLast modified: 16 Mar 2024 05:46\n\n## Export record\n\nASCII CitationAtomBibTeXData Cite XMLDublin CoreDublin CoreEP3 XMLEndNoteHTML CitationHTML CitationHTML ListJSONMETSMODSMPEG-21 DIDLOpenURL ContextObjectOpenURL ContextObject in SpanRDF+N-TriplesRDF+N3RDF+XMLRIOXX2 XMLReferReference ManagerSimple Metadata\n\n## Altmetrics\n\n## Share this record\n\n[Share this on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/414392/) [Share this on Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Jostle%20heuristics%20for%20the%202D%2Dirregular%20shapes%20bin%20packing%20problems%20with%20free%20rotation+https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/414392/) [Share this on Weibo](http://service.weibo.com/share/share.php?url=Jostle%20heuristics%20for%20the%202D%2Dirregular%20shapes%20bin%20packing%20problems%20with%20free%20rotation+https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/414392/)\n\n## Contributors\n\nAuthor:Ranga, Prasad Abeysooriya\n\nAuthor:Julia Bennell\n\nAuthor: [Antonio Martinez Sykora](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/business-school/about/staff/am1u10.page)\n\n## Download statistics\n\nDownloads from ePrints over the past year.

An efficient 2D irregular packing algorithm can effectively improve material utilization and reduce processing costs. The reduction in material consumption will also have a beneficial impact on the environment ([Ke et al., 2020](#B76)). Therefore, research of the packing problem is of great significance for technology and social interest.\nThe 2D packing problem is a type of combinatorial optimization problems to locate parts with different shapes compactly in one or more master sheet material to minimize the occupied space or maximize the utilization of the material. The 2D packing problem is currently recognized as a NP problem, which is mainly solved by heuristic algorithms. In recent years, many scholars have conducted research on 2D irregular packing problems with a verity of solutions.\nThere exists a number of review articles on packing and cutting problems. We have summarized the main review literature in the field of 2D packing and cutting as shown in[Table 1](#T1). Brown ([Brown, 1971](#B17)) introduced an optimum packing and depletion problem with optimization of space and resource usage. Harvey ([Salkin and De Kluyver, 1975](#B116)) surveyed the application of mathematical optimization models such as linear programming to the knapsack problem. Bruce ([Golden, 1976](#B50)) surveyed various approaches to the cutting stock problem. Hinxman ([Hinxman, 1980](#B65)) surveyed the trim-loss and assortment problems, this research paid more attention to cutting and packaging problems in practical applications, and did not mention much about theoretical methods. Garey and Coffman ([Garey and Johnson, 1981](#B47);[Coffman et al., 1984](#B27)) surveyed the approximation algorithms for bin packing problems. Israni ([Israni and Sanders, 1982](#B72)) reviewed the 2D cutting stock problem including almost all 2D packaging problems. The author also proposed a rectangular layout method. Sarin ([Sarin, 1983](#B118)) reviewed methodologies and literature to solve 2D stock cutting problems and introduced an interactive optimization procedure for a general 2D stock cutting problem. Dyckhoff ([Dyckhoff et al., 1985](#B38)) described a trim loss and related problems and categorized them briefly. Dudzi&#x00144;ski ([Dudzi&#x00144;ski and Walukiewicz, 1987](#B36)) summarized the exact methods for knapsack problems, such as linear programming. Matthias ([Rode and Rosenberg, 1987](#B114)) analyzed the algorithm for the trim-loss problems. Haessler ([Haessler and Sweeney, 1991](#B59)) reviewed the solution process of cutting stock problems, including placement algorithm and sequence optimization algorithm. Dowsland ([Dowsland and Dowsland, 1992](#B34)) reviewed the application of operations research methods to the packing problem and summarized some exact heuristics. Sweeney ([Sweeney and Paternoster, 1992](#B128)) categorized cutting and packing problems and made application-oriented research records. Cheng ([Cheng et al., 1994](#B22)) discussed 2D cutting stock problems and their application cases including the pallet loading problem and VLSI placement problem. With the gradual deepening of research on 2D layout problems, typology becomes a common research topic. 2D regular and irregular layout problems are clearly distinguished in practical applications and theoretical methods. Dowsland ([Dowsland and Dowsland, 1995](#B29)) gave a special review of the 2D irregular nesting problem for the first time. Mavridou ([Mavridou and Pardalos, 1997](#B98)) summarized applications of the genetic algorithm and simulated annealing algorithm in the optimization of facility layout problems. Dyckhoff ([Dyckhoff, 1990](#B37)) made a typology of the cutting and packing problems in detail, and W&#x000e4;scher ([W&#x000e4;scher et al., 2007](#B135)) improved the typology later. Hopper ([Hopper and Turton, 1999](#B67);[Hopper and Turton, 2001a](#B68);[Hopper and Turton, 2001b](#B69)) investigated the application of meta-heuristic and heuristic algorithms in 2D and 3D packing problems. Lodi ([Lodi et al., 2002a](#B90);[Lodi et al., 2002b](#B91)) reviewed algorithms proposed in the 1990s of 2D packing problems. Bennell et al. ([Bennell and Oliveira, 2008](#B10);[Bennell and Oliveira, 2009](#B9)) discussed 2D irregular packing problems and related geometric problems. Leao ([Leao et al., 2020](#B81)) introduced the mathematical models in the 2D irregular packing problem.\nTABLE 1\n[![www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/966691/fmech-08-966691-HTML/image_m/fmech-08-966691-t001.jpg)](https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/966691/fmech-08-966691-HTML/image_m/fmech-08-966691-t001.jpg)\n**TABLE 1**. Review literature in the field of cutting and packing problems.\nThe scope of these reviews is broad, mainly for all 2D packing problems including rectangular packing and other regular packing problems. These review papers are out of date with missed innovative algorithms of 2D irregular packing. Since 2010, only Leao ([Leao et al., 2020](#B81)) reviewed 2D irregular packing problems.

The problem consists of placing a set of pieces represented as 2D polygons in rectangular bins with different dimensions such that the total area of bins used is minimized. Most packing algorithms available in the literature for 2D irregular bin packing consider single size bins only. However, for many industries the material can be supplied in a number of standard size sheets, for example, metal, foam, plastic and timber sheets. For this problem, the cut plans must decide the set of standard size stock sheets as well as which pieces to cut from each bin and how to arrange them in order to minimise waste material. Moreover, the literature constrains the orientation of pieces to a single or finite set of angles. This is often an artificial constraint that makes the solution space easier to navigate. In this paper we do not restrict the orientation of the pieces. We show that the local search heuristic and the genetic algorithm can address all of these decisions and obtain good solutions, with the local search performing better. We also discuss the affect of different groups of stock sheet sizes.\n\nThis is a preview of subscription content, [log in via an institution](https://wayf.springernature.com?redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Fchapter%2F10.1007%2F978-3-319-68496-3_37%3Ferror%3Dcookies_not_supported%26code%3D6c4d7962-9a74-4c0e-ac70-bc76101d9408) to check access.\n\n## Access this chapter\n\n[Log in via an institution](https://wayf.springernature.com?redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Fchapter%2F10.1007%2F978-3-319-68496-3_37%3Ferror%3Dcookies_not_supported%26code%3D6c4d7962-9a74-4c0e-ac70-bc76101d9408)\n\nChapter\n\nUSD\u00a029.95\n\nPrice excludes VAT (USA)\n\n- Available as PDF\n- Read on any device\n- Instant download\n- Own it forever\n\nBuy Chapter\n\neBookUSD\u00a039.99Price excludes VAT (USA)\n\n- Available as PDF\n- Read on any device\n- Instant download\n- Own it forever\n\nBuy eBook\n\nSoftcover BookUSD\u00a054.99Price excludes VAT (USA)\n\n- Compact, lightweight edition\n- Dispatched in 3 to 5 business days\n- Free shipping worldwide - [see info](https://support.springernature.com/en/support/solutions/articles/6000233448-coronavirus-disease-covid-19-delivery-information)\n\nBuy Softcover Book\n\nTax calculation will be finalised at checkout\n\nPurchases are for personal use only\n\n[Institutional subscriptions](https://www.springernature.com/gp/librarians/licensing/agc/ebooks)\n\n## Preview\n\nUnable to display preview.\u00a0[Download preview\\\nPDF.](https://page-one.springer.com/pdf/preview/10.1007/978-3-319-68496-3_37)\n\nUnable to display preview.\u00a0[Download preview\\\nPDF.](https://page-one.springer.com/pdf/preview/10.1007/978-3-319-68496-3_37)\n\n## References\n\n01.

At its core is an innovative mixed integer programme model that places irregular pieces and defines guillotine cuts. The two-dimensional irregular shape bin [packing problem](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/packing-problem) with guillotine constraints arises in the glass cutting industry, for example, the cutting of glass for conservatories. Almost all cutting and packing problems that include guillotine cuts deal with rectangles only, where all cuts are orthogonal to the edges of the stock sheet and a maximum of two [angles of rotation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/angles-of-rotation) are permitted. The literature tackling packing problems with irregular shapes largely focuses on strip packing i.e. minimizing the length of a single fixed width stock sheet, and does not consider guillotine cuts. Hence, this problem combines the challenges of tackling the complexity of packing irregular pieces with free rotation, guaranteeing guillotine cuts that are not always orthogonal to the edges of the stock sheet, and allocating pieces to bins. To our knowledge only one other recent paper tackles this problem. We present a hybrid algorithm that is a constructive heuristic that determines the relative position of pieces in the bin and guillotine constraints via a mixed integer programme model. We investigate two approaches for allocating guillotine cuts at the same time as determining the placement of the piece, and a two phase approach that delays the allocation of cuts to provide flexibility in space usage. Finally we describe an improvement procedure that is applied to each bin before it is closed. This approach improves on the results of the only other publication on this problem, and gives competitive results for the classic rectangle bin packing problem with guillotine constraints.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe paper focuses on the two-dimensional bin packing problem (BBP) with irregular convex pieces and guillotine cuts. Guillotine cuts arise due to the cutting process of certain materials, where cuts are restricted to extend from one edge of the stock-sheet to another. This is commonly found in the glass cutting industry and research has almost exclusively focused on the cutting of rectangles where the cuts are orthogonal to the edges of the stock sheet. The problem tackled here is a generalized version of the rectangle single size stock sheet bin packing problem with guillotine constraints, where the pieces to be cut are irregular convex polygons and the guillotine cuts are not constrained to be orthogonal to the edges of the bin. We present a number of constructive heuristics that exploit a mixed integer programming (MIP) model for placing the pieces in the bin while satisfying all the geometric constraints and the guillotine cuts and provide comprehensive results for benchmark instances for this problem and the rectangular bin packing problem with guillotine cuts. The results are compared with the best in the literature and new lower bound is presented.\n\nThe motivation for tackling this problems arises in the cutting of glass sheets, for example, the glass panes for conservatories. Glass is cut by scoring and snapping the material. Each cut divides the sheet in two and is called a guillotine cut. As a result, only convex pieces can be cut directly. Since the properties of the material are homogeneous, pieces can be cut at any angle of rotation, and in some cases reflected. Typically, cutting plans involve multiple stock sheets. An example solution to this problem is given in Fig. 1. Note that the pieces must be removed by the guillotine cuts (in bold) in a specific order so that each cut begins and ends at the edge of the complete or divided stock sheet.\n\nThe requirement for guillotine cuts arise in many industries such as glass, wood boards or fibre glass for printed circuit boards. Each industrial setting implies a particular class of cutting and packing problem. For example, Malaguti et al. \\[15\\] consider a cutting stock problem with multiple stocksheets found in the wood industry, while Cui \\[8\\] tackles the cutting of metal of coils where a stock sheet is considered to have unrestricted length.\n\nThe literature tackling packing problems with irregular shapes largely focuses on strip packing i.e. minimizing the length of a single fixed width stock sheet, see \\[3\\], and does not consider guillotine cuts. Further, almost all cutting and packing problems that include guillotine cuts deal with rectangles only, where all cuts are orthogonal to the edges of the stock sheet and a maximum of two angles of rotation of the pieces are permitted. Hence, this problem combines the challenges of tackling the complexity of packing irregular pieces with free rotation, guaranteeing guillotine cuts that may or may not be orthogonal to the edges of the stock sheet, and allocating pieces to bins or stock sheets. To our knowledge, Han et al. \\[13\\] is the only other paper that tackles this problem. They propose two different construction heuristics. The first heuristic, they call a one-stage algorithm, constructs multiple parallel clusters of pieces by iteratively joining two blocks, where a block is either a piece or the convex hull of a cluster of pieces. Blocks are combined by matching pairs of edges and selecting the best match according to a dynamic solution evaluation function. Since each accepted match, starting with two individual pieces, is transformed into its convex block by taking the convex hull, the guillotine cut structure is always satisfied. The approach uses threshold parameters to control the number of blocks generated and as a result the computational time. The second constructive heuristic, a two-stage algorithm, combines pairs of p...",

To be worthwhile, such a combination should outperform the single heuristics. This article presents a GA-based method that produces general hyper-heuristics that solve two-dimensional regular (rectangular) and irregular (convex polygonal) bin-packing problems. A hyper-heuristic is used to define a high-level heuristic that controls low-level heuristics. The hyper-heuristic should decide when and where to apply each single low-level heuristic, depending on the given problem state. In this investigation two kinds of heuristics were considered: for selecting the figures (pieces) and objects (bins), and for placing the figures into the objects. Some of the heuristics were taken from the literature, others were adapted, and some other variations developed by us. We chose the most representative heuristics of their type, considering their individual performance in various studies and also in an initial experimentation on a collection of benchmark problems. The GA included in the proposed model uses a variable-length representation, which evolves combinations of condition-action rules producing hyper-heuristics after going through a learning process which includes training and testing phases. Such hyper-heuristics, when tested with a large set of benchmark problems, produce outstanding results for most of the cases. The testbed is composed of problems used in other similar studies in the literature. Some additional instances for the testbed were randomly generated.
