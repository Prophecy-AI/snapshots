## What I Understood

The junior researcher implemented simulated annealing (SA) from scratch in Python to optimize the Zaburo row-based solution (87.99) toward the target (68.89). The SA was run on N=2-10 only, achieving a modest improvement of 0.18 points (87.99 → 87.81). The approach correctly maintains the no-overlap constraint and uses proper temperature scheduling. This is the right strategic direction - building optimization capability on top of a guaranteed-valid starting point.

The experiment shows the SA is working (N=2: 0.72→0.66, N=3: 0.65→0.58, N=4: 0.77→0.72) but the improvement is limited because:
1. Only N=2-10 were optimized (9 out of 200 N values)
2. N=5-10 showed no improvement despite many accepted moves
3. The SA parameters may not be optimal for this problem

## Technical Execution Assessment

**Validation**: Sound. The implementation correctly validates all 200 N values for overlaps using Shapely's intersects/touches methods. The final submission shows 0 overlapping N values.

**Leakage Risk**: N/A - this is an optimization problem, not a prediction problem.

**Score Integrity**: Verified. The metrics.json shows:
- Initial score: 87.991248 (matches exp_005)
- Final score: 87.811181
- Improvement: 0.180067
- Per-N scores are correctly computed

**Code Quality**: Good. The implementation:
- Uses proper Decimal precision and scale_factor=1e15
- Sets random seeds for reproducibility (42)
- Correctly clones trees before modification
- Has proper temperature scheduling (T0=1.0, T_min=0.00001, alpha=0.9995)

**Concern**: The SA only ran on N=2-10 due to time constraints. Medium/large N values (11-200) were skipped entirely.

Verdict: **TRUSTWORTHY** - The experiment is correctly implemented and the results are reliable.

## Strategic Assessment

**Approach Fit**: CORRECT DIRECTION. The researcher is following the proven path:
1. ✅ Established valid baseline (Zaburo, 87.99)
2. ✅ Implemented SA optimization
3. ⚠️ Only partial optimization (N=2-10)

**Effort Allocation**: SUBOPTIMAL. The SA only optimized 9 out of 200 N values. The gap analysis from evolver_loop6_lb_feedback.ipynb shows:
- N=5 has the largest gap (0.38 points) but showed NO improvement
- N=4 has 0.35 point gap, improved by only 0.04
- N=2-10 together have ~2.5 point gap potential, but only 0.18 was captured

**Assumptions Being Made**:
1. SA with current parameters can close the gap - PARTIALLY VALIDATED (works for N=2-4, fails for N=5-10)
2. Small N values are the priority - CORRECT but incomplete
3. Python SA is fast enough - QUESTIONABLE (only 10K iterations per N)

**Blind Spots - CRITICAL**:

1. **N=5-10 showed NO improvement despite many accepted moves**
   - This suggests the SA is exploring but not finding better configurations
   - The move sizes (±0.1 translation, ±10° rotation) may be too large
   - The top kernels use MUCH finer moves (0.001 to 0.00001 step sizes)

2. **Fractional translation refinement is missing**
   - Jonathan Chan's kernel uses `fractional_translation()` with step sizes: 0.001, 0.0005, 0.0002, 0.0001, 0.00005, 0.00002, 0.00001
   - This micro-adjustment in 8 directions is crucial for final optimization
   - Current SA uses 0.1 max translation - 100x too coarse for fine-tuning

3. **No ensemble approach**
   - Top kernels collect best per-N solutions from MULTIPLE sources
   - The researcher is only using Zaburo as starting point
   - Could potentially use valid N values from pre-optimized baselines

4. **Backward propagation not implemented**
   - Chistyakov's technique: Start from large N, remove trees touching bbox, use for smaller N
   - This is a "free" improvement that doesn't require complex optimization
   - Should be implemented as post-processing

5. **exp_006 NOT YET SUBMITTED**
   - The 87.81 score has not been verified on Kaggle LB
   - Should submit to confirm the SA improvements are valid

**Trajectory**: PROMISING BUT SLOW. The SA is working but:
- 0.18 improvement in one experiment is too slow
- At this rate, closing 19-point gap would take 100+ experiments
- Need to accelerate: more N values, finer moves, longer runs

## What's Working

1. **SA implementation is correct**: The temperature scheduling, move generation, and overlap checking all work properly
2. **N=2-4 improvements are real**: 0.72→0.66 (N=2), 0.65→0.58 (N=3), 0.77→0.72 (N=4)
3. **No overlaps**: The submission is guaranteed valid
4. **Strategic direction is correct**: Building optimization on valid baseline

## Key Concerns

### 1. CRITICAL: SA Move Sizes Are Too Coarse
- **Observation**: N=5-10 showed NO improvement despite 9000+ accepted moves each
- **Why it matters**: The SA is exploring but not finding better configurations. Top kernels use moves 100-10000x smaller.
- **Suggestion**: Add fractional translation refinement with step sizes [0.001, 0.0005, 0.0002, 0.0001, 0.00005, 0.00002, 0.00001]. Apply after SA as a local search phase.

### 2. CRITICAL: Only 9/200 N Values Optimized
- **Observation**: SA only ran on N=2-10, skipping 191 N values
- **Why it matters**: The gap analysis shows significant improvement potential across ALL N values, not just small ones
- **Suggestion**: Run SA on ALL N values. Use parallel processing or batch processing. Even 1000 iterations per N would help.

### 3. HIGH: Missing Ensemble Strategy
- **Observation**: Only using Zaburo as starting point
- **Why it matters**: Pre-optimized baselines have better per-N scores for MANY N values (just with some overlapping ones)
- **Suggestion**: Create hybrid solution: Use pre-optimized baseline for N values where it's valid, Zaburo for N values where baseline has overlaps. Then apply SA.

### 4. MEDIUM: Backward Propagation Not Implemented
- **Observation**: Chistyakov's technique is mentioned but not used
- **Why it matters**: This is a "free" improvement - removes trees touching bbox from N to get better N-1
- **Suggestion**: Implement as post-processing after SA optimization

### 5. MEDIUM: exp_006 Not Submitted
- **Observation**: The 87.81 score has not been verified on Kaggle
- **Why it matters**: Need to confirm SA improvements are valid before investing more time
- **Suggestion**: Submit exp_006 to verify LB score matches CV

## CV-LB Relationship Analysis

We have 4 successful submissions:
- exp_002: CV=769.92, LB=769.92 (wide-spacing)
- exp_003: CV=169.46, LB=169.46 (greedy)
- exp_005: CV=87.99, LB=87.99 (Zaburo)

CV = LB exactly for all submissions. This is expected for a deterministic optimization problem - there's no distribution shift. The challenge is purely optimization quality.

## Top Priority for Next Experiment

**IMPLEMENT FRACTIONAL TRANSLATION REFINEMENT + RUN SA ON ALL N VALUES**

The current SA is too coarse and too limited. The next experiment should:

1. **Add fractional translation refinement** (from Jonathan Chan's kernel):
   ```python
   frac_steps = [0.001, 0.0005, 0.0002, 0.0001, 0.00005, 0.00002, 0.00001]
   directions = [(0,1), (0,-1), (1,0), (-1,0), (1,1), (1,-1), (-1,1), (-1,-1)]
   for step in frac_steps:
       for dx, dy in directions:
           # Try micro-adjustment
           # Accept if improves score and no overlap
   ```

2. **Run SA on ALL 200 N values**, not just N=2-10

3. **Use hybrid starting point**:
   - Load pre-optimized baseline
   - Check which N values have overlaps
   - Use baseline for valid N values, Zaburo for overlapping ones
   - This gives a better starting point than pure Zaburo

4. **Submit exp_006** to verify current progress

Expected improvement: 5-10 points with proper fractional translation on all N values.

The target of 68.887226 IS reachable. The path is:
- Current: 87.81
- With fractional translation on all N: ~75-80
- With hybrid starting point + SA: ~72-75
- With backward propagation: ~70-72
- With continued optimization: → 68.89

The gap is large but the techniques are proven. Keep pushing!
