The goal is to pack Christmas tree shapes (15-vertex polygons) into the smallest possible square bounding box for each configuration of N trees (N=1 to 200).\n\n**Scoring:** score = \u03a3(s_n\u00b2 / n) for n=1 to 200, where s_n is the side length of the bounding square for n trees. **Lower is better.**\n\n**Target Score:** Beat 68.888293\n\n## Available Pre-Optimized Solutions\n\nThere are 115+ pre-optimized submissions in `/home/nonroot/snapshots/santa-2025/*/submission/submission.csv`. These are already at local optima (~70.6). Use them as starting points but don't expect binaries to improve them.\n\n## \u26d4 ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN (EXPERIMENT WILL BE REJECTED)\n\nThe following are PERMANENTLY FORBIDDEN after baseline:\n- bbox3 - FORBIDDEN (pre-compiled binary)\n- sa_fast_v2 - FORBIDDEN\n- eazy_optimizer - FORBIDDEN\n- tree_packer - FORBIDDEN (pre-compiled binary)\n- shake_public - FORBIDDEN (pre-compiled binary)\n- subprocess.run() with binaries - FORBIDDEN\n- os.system() with binaries - FORBIDDEN\n- ANY pre-compiled binary or executable - FORBIDDEN\n- \"Optimizing\" existing CSV files with any binary tool - FORBIDDEN\n- Running \"more iterations\" on any binary optimizer - FORBIDDEN\n\nIf your experiment runs ANY binary, it will produce ~70.6.\nThe target is 68.888293. BINARIES CANNOT GET THERE.\n\n**WHY THIS MATTERS:** The pre-optimized solutions from public kernels are already at local optima (~70.6). Running binaries on them finds NO improvements. You MUST implement novel algorithms in Python to beat the target.\n\n## \u2705 MANDATORY FIRST TASK: SOLVE N=1-10 OPTIMALLY\n\nBEFORE any other work, implement exhaustive search for small N:\n\n**For N=1 (contributes ~0.66 to score - HIGHEST!):**\n- Test EVERY rotation angle from 0\u00b0 to 360\u00b0 in 0.01\u00b0 increments\n- Find the angle that minimizes bounding box\n- The tree has 15 vertices - optimal angle is around 45\u00b0 (diagonal orientation)\n- This alone can improve score by 0.05-0.1 points\n\n**For N=2-10:**\n- Implement branch-and-bound or exhaustive placement search\n- These contribute ~2.5 points total - worth optimizing!\n- Try all combinations of angles (0\u00b0, 90\u00b0, 180\u00b0, 270\u00b0) for each tree\n- Use grid search for positions with fine granularity\n\n## \u2705 MANDATORY: PER-N SOLUTION TRACKING\n\nTrack best solution for EACH N value separately:\n1. Load baseline per-N scores from existing submission\n2. After your algorithm runs, compare per-N scores\n3. SAVE any N where you improved (even if total is worse)\n4. Accumulate improvements across experiments\n\n```python\n# Example per-N tracking\ndef calculate_per_n_scores(submission_df):\n    scores = {}\n    for n in range(1, 201):\n        trees = load_trees_for_n(submission_df, n)\n        side = calculate_bounding_box_side(trees)\n        scores[n] = side**2 / n\n    return scores\n```\n\n## \u2705 REQUIRED: IMPLEMENT ALGORITHM IN PYTHON\n\nWrite YOUR OWN code. Choose ONE approach:\n\n### 1. Bottom-Left Constructive Heuristic (Easiest)\n```python\ndef bottom_left_placement(trees, new_tree):\n    \"\"\"Place new_tree at bottom-left feasible position\"\"\"\n    # Start from far away, move toward center\n    # Find first position with no overlap\n    # Use STRtree for efficient collision detection\n```\n\n### 2. Simulated Annealing (Medium)\n```python\ndef simulated_annealing(config, T_start=1.0, T_end=0.001, iterations=10000):\n    \"\"\"SA with moves: translate, rotate, swap\"\"\"\n    # Move types: small translation, rotation, swap two trees\n    # Accept worse moves with probability exp(-delta/T)\n    # Cool temperature gradually\n```\n\n### 3. Genetic Algorithm with Custom Operators (Medium)\n```python\ndef genetic_algorithm(population_size=50, generations=100):\n    \"\"\"GA with crossover and mutation for tree configurations\"\"\"\n    # Chromosome: list of (x, y, angle) for each tree\n    # Crossover: swap subsets of trees between parents\n    # Mutation: perturb position/angle of random tree\n```\n\n### 4. Lattice-Based Approach for Large N (Advanced)\n```python\ndef lattice_packing(n, base_config):\n    \"\"\"Generate grid-based packing for large N\"\"\"\n    # Start with 2 trees in optimal configuration\n    # Translate in x and y to create grid pattern\n    # Optimize base configuration and translation vectors\n```\n\n## Tree Geometry (CRITICAL)\n\nEach Christmas tree is a 15-vertex polygon:\n```python\nTX = [0, 0.125, 0.0625, 0.2, 0.1, 0.35, 0.075, 0.075, -0.075, -0.075, -0.35, -0.1, -0.2, -0.0625, -0.125]\nTY = [0.8, 0.5, 0.5, 0.25, 0.25, 0, 0, -0.2, -0.2, 0, 0, 0.25, 0.25, 0.5, 0.5]\n```\n- Trunk: width 0.15, height 0.2\n- Base tier: width 0.7\n- Middle tier: width 0.4\n- Top tier: width 0.25\n- Tip at y=0.8\n- Total height: 1.0 (from trunk bottom at -0.2 to tip at 0.8)\n\n## Insights from Discussions (MANDATORY)\n\n### Discussion \"Why the winning solutions will be Asymmetric\" (39 votes):\n- **Key insight:** Asymmetric configurations outperform symmetric ones\n- For large N, don't assume grid symmetry is optimal\n- Allow trees to have different angles and positions\n\n### Discussion \"Expected Leaderboard Progression\" (20 votes):\n- Top solutions use extensive compute time (hours, not minutes)\n- Multiple optimization passes are essential\n- Lattice-like patterns emerge in well-optimized configurations\n\n### Discussion \"Where do these high-scoring CSVs originate from?\" (13 votes):\n- Best public CSVs come from running optimizers for many hours\n- The santa-2025.csv dataset is already highly optimized\n- To beat it, you need novel algorithmic approaches\n\n## What Discussions Say DOESN'T Work\n- Short optimization runs (minutes) - local optima too tight\n- Simple ensemble of existing CSVs - one source dominates all N values\n- Running binaries on pre-optimized submissions - no improvements found\n\n## Unexplored Ideas from Research\n\n### 1. No-Fit Polygon (NFP) Precomputation\nAcademic literature suggests precomputing NFPs for O(1) overlap checks:\n```python\ndef compute_nfp(polygon_a, polygon_b):\n    \"\"\"Compute no-fit polygon for two shapes\"\"\"\n    # NFP defines all positions where B overlaps A\n    # Placement is valid if B's reference point is outside NFP\n```\n\n### 2. Collision-Free Region (CFR) Algorithm\n```python\ndef compute_cfr(placed_trees, new_tree):\n    \"\"\"Compute region where new_tree can be placed without overlap\"\"\"\n    # Use Minkowski sums or direct geometric computation\n    # Find degenerated vertices/edges for maximum compaction\n```\n\n### 3. Backward Propagation (Already in kernels but can be improved)\n```python\ndef backward_propagation(configs):\n    \"\"\"Improve smaller N by removing trees from larger N configs\"\"\"\n    for n in range(200, 1, -1):\n        for tree_idx in get_boundary_trees(configs[n]):\n            candidate = remove_tree(configs[n], tree_idx)\n            if score(candidate) < score(configs[n-1]):\n                configs[n-1] = candidate\n```\n\n## Recommended Experiment Pipeline\n\n### Phase 1: Establish Baseline\n1. Load best pre-optimized submission from `/home/nonroot/snapshots/santa-2025/*/submission/submission.csv`\n2. Calculate per-N scores\n3. Identify worst-performing N values\n\n### Phase 2: Optimize Small N (N=1-10)\n1. Implement exhaustive angle search for N=1\n2. Implement grid search for N=2-5\n3. Use local search for N=6-10\n\n### Phase 3: Implement Novel Algorithm\n1. Choose one approach (SA, GA, or lattice)\n2. Implement in pure Python\n3. Test on small N first (N=10-20)\n4. Scale to larger N if successful\n\n### Phase 4: Combine and Validate\n1. Merge improvements from all phases\n2. Validate no overlaps\n3. Submit and compare to target\n\n## Key Implementation Details\n\n### ChristmasTree Class\n```python\nfrom decimal import Decimal, getcontext\nfrom shapely import affinity\nfrom shapely.geometry import Polygon\n\ngetcontext().prec = 25\n\nTX = [0, 0.125, 0.0625, 0.2, 0.1, 0.35, 0.075, 0.075, -0.075, -0.075, -0.35, -0.1, -0.2, -0.0625, -0.125]\nTY = [0.8, 0.5, 0.5, 0.25, 0.25, 0, 0, -0.2, -0.2, 0, 0, 0.25, 0.25, 0.5, 0.5]\n\nclass ChristmasTree:\n    def __init__(self, center_x='0', center_y='0', angle='0'):\n        self.center_x = Decimal(center_x)\n        self.center_y = Decimal(center_y)\n        self.angle = Decimal(angle)\n        \n        # Build polygon with high precision\n        initial_polygon = Polygon(list(zip(TX, TY)))\n        rotated = affinity.rotate(initial_polygon, float(self.angle), origin=(0, 0))\n        self.polygon = affinity.translate(rotated, \n                                          xoff=float(self.center_x),\n                                          yoff=float(self.center_y))\n```\n\n### Overlap Detection\n```python\nfrom shapely.strtree import STRtree\n\ndef has_overlap(trees):\n    if len(trees) <= 1:\n        return False\n    polygons = [t.polygon for t in trees]\n    tree_index = STRtree(polygons)\n    \n    for i, poly in enumerate(polygons):\n        indices = tree_index.query(poly)\n        for idx in indices:\n            if idx != i and poly.intersects(polygons[idx]) and not poly.touches(polygons[idx]):\n                return True\n    return False\n```\n\n### Bounding Box Calculation\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef calculate_side(trees):\n    all_points = []\n    for tree in trees:\n        all_points.extend(list(tree.polygon.exterior.coords))\n    points = np.array(all_points)\n    min_xy = points.min(axis=0)\n    max_xy = points.max(axis=0)\n    return max(max_xy[0] - min_xy[0], max_xy[1] - min_xy[1])\n```\n\n### Fix Direction Post-Processing\n```python\nfrom scipy.spatial import ConvexHull\nfrom scipy.optimize import minimize_scalar\n\ndef optimize_rotation(trees):\n    \"\"\"Rotate entire configuration to minimize bounding box\"\"\"\n    all_points = []\n    for tree in trees:\n        all_points.extend(list(tree.polygon.exterior.coords))\n    points_np = np.array(all_points)\n    hull_points = points_np[ConvexHull(points_np).vertices]\n    \n    def bbox_at_angle(angle_deg):\n        angle_rad = np.radians(angle_deg)\n        c, s = np.cos(angle_rad), np.sin(angle_rad)\n        rot_matrix = np.array([[c, s], [-s, c]])\n        rotated = hull_points.dot(rot_matrix)\n        return max(rotated.max(0) - rotated.min(0))\n    \n    res = minimize_scalar(bbox_at_angle, bounds=(0, 90), method='bounded')\n    return res.x, res.fun\n```\n\n## Submission Format\n```csv\nid,x,y,deg\n001_0,s0.0,s0.0,s90.0\n002_0,s0.0,s0.0,s90.0\n002_1,s0.202736,s-0.511271,s90.0\n...\n```\n- id: `{n:03d}_{tree_index}` (e.g., 001_0, 002_0, 002_1)\n- x, y, deg: prefixed with 's' to preserve precision\n- Total rows: 20100 (1+2+3+...+200)\n\n## Validation Checklist\n1.

Values prefixed with 's' in submission\n\n## Score Contribution Analysis\n\nN=1 contributes the most to score (~0.66). Small N values (1-10) have lowest packing efficiency:\n- N=1: side\u22480.813, contributes 0.66\n- N=2: side\u22480.950, contributes 0.45\n- N=3-10: combined contribution ~2.5\n\nFocus optimization effort on:\n1. Small N (1-10) - highest per-tree contribution\n2. N values where current solution has poor efficiency\n3. Boundary trees that define the bounding box\n\n## Strategy to Beat Target (68.888293)\n\n1. **Start with best snapshot** - Load pre-optimized solution (~70.6) from `/home/nonroot/snapshots/santa-2025/`\n2. **Optimize N=1 exhaustively** - Find optimal rotation angle\n3. **Implement pure Python SA** - For N=2-50\n4. **Use lattice approach** - For N>50\n5. **Apply backward propagation** - Improve smaller N from larger\n6. **Fine-tune boundary trees** - Micro-adjustments to reduce bounding box\n7. **Validate and submit** - Check for overlaps before each submission\n\nThe gap from 70.6 to 68.89 is ~1.7 points (2.4%). This requires:\n- Average side reduction of ~0.05 units across all N\n- OR significant improvements on worst-performing N values\n- OR novel algorithmic approach that escapes local optima\n\n## Reference Notebooks\n\n- `../research/kernels/inversion_santa-2025-getting-started/` - Basic greedy algorithm, ChristmasTree class\n- `../research/kernels/jazivxt_why-not/` - bbox3.cpp optimizer (DO NOT USE BINARY, study algorithm only)\n- `../research/kernels/smartmanoj_santa-claude/` - tree_packer_v21.cpp, backward propagation\n- `../research/kernels/saspav_santa-submission/` - fix_direction post-processing\n\n**Remember:** The winning solutions came from researchers who thought from first principles, not from running existing binaries longer.

No overlapping trees (use has_overlap function)\n2. All coordinates within [-100, 100]\n3. All 200 configurations present (20100 rows)\n4. Values prefixed with 's' in submission\n\n## Score Contribution Analysis\n\nN=1 contributes the most to score (~0.66). Small N values (1-10) have lowest packing efficiency:\n- N=1: side\u22480.813, contributes 0.66\n- N=2: side\u22480.950, contributes 0.45\n- N=3-10: combined contribution ~2.5\n\nFocus optimization effort on:\n1. Small N (1-10) - highest per-tree contribution\n2. N values where current solution has poor efficiency\n3. Boundary trees that define the bounding box\n\n## Strategy to Beat Target (68.888293)\n\n1. **Start with best snapshot** - Load pre-optimized solution (~70.6) from `/home/nonroot/snapshots/santa-2025/`\n2. **Optimize N=1 exhaustively** - Find optimal rotation angle\n3. **Implement pure Python SA** - For N=2-50\n4. **Use lattice approach** - For N>50\n5. **Apply backward propagation** - Improve smaller N from larger\n6. **Fine-tune boundary trees** - Micro-adjustments to reduce bounding box\n7. **Validate and submit** - Check for overlaps before each submission\n\nThe gap from 70.6 to 68.89 is ~1.7 points (2.4%). This requires:\n- Average side reduction of ~0.05 units across all N\n- OR significant improvements on worst-performing N values\n- OR novel algorithmic approach that escapes local optima\n\n## Reference Notebooks\n\n- `../research/kernels/inversion_santa-2025-getting-started/` - Basic greedy algorithm, ChristmasTree class\n- `../research/kernels/jazivxt_why-not/` - bbox3.cpp optimizer (DO NOT USE BINARY, study algorithm only)\n- `../research/kernels/smartmanoj_santa-claude/` - tree_packer_v21.cpp, backward propagation\n- `../research/kernels/saspav_santa-submission/` - fix_direction post-processing\n\n**Remember:** The winning solutions came from researchers who thought from first principles, not from running existing binaries longer.
