      "finding": "Two\u2011dimensional polygon\u2011packing problems are notoriously multimodal; a na\u00efve local search quickly becomes trapped in sub\u2011optimal layouts.  Modern approaches therefore combine a strong constructive heuristic with diversification mechanisms that deliberately \u201cshake\u201d the current solution and allow the algorithm to explore distant regions of the search space.  A widely used example is the **four\u2011corners (FC) heuristic** embedded in a self\u2011adaptive evolutionary algorithm, which repeatedly re\u2011positions items at the four extreme corners of the bin to generate diverse offspring and to break out of stagnation\u202f([ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0377221706003018)).  Similar diversification is achieved by **fast neighbourhood search**, which defines a rich set of elementary moves (swap, rotate, slide) and applies them in a steep\u2011descent\u2011plus\u2011random\u2011restart fashion, enabling rapid escape from shallow basins\u202f([ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/",
