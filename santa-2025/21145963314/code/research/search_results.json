      "title": "ANSWER",
      "text": "The\u202fSanta\u202f2025\u202f\u201cChristmas\u2011Tree\u2011Packing\u201d competition is an optimization task in which the score is the summed normalized area of the smallest square that can contain a given set of trees.  The few participants who have managed to push the leaderboard below the\u202f69\u2011point\u202fthreshold all point to **asymmetric packing** as the decisive ingredient.  In the discussion thread dated\u202f9\u202fJan\u202f2026 a top coder writes that \u201casymmetric solutions are actually superior to the symmetric \u2026 The difference is clear: asymmetry yields better scores\u201d\u202f([kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/santa-2025/discussion/666880)).  By contrast, a separate post from\u202f28\u202fDec\u202f2025 lists a handful of **symmetric** configurations that are \u201capparently optimal\u201d for specific numbers of trees (e.g.,\u202fN=14,\u202f18,\u202f20,\u202f22)\u202f([kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/santa-2025/discussion/664824)).  \n\nThe **asymmetric vs. symmetric debate** therefore hinges on two competing design philosophies:  \n\n* **Symmetric solutions** enforce a mirror\u2011image or rotational symmetry in the placement of trees.  This constraint simplifies the search space and can produce analytically \u201coptimal\u201d packings for certain small\u2011N instances, but it also limits the ability to exploit irregular gaps that arise in larger configurations.  \n\n* **Asymmetric solutions** drop the symmetry requirement, allowing each tree to be positioned independently.  This larger search space lets competitors apply custom heuristics (e.g., greedy placement, local\u2011search refinements, or branch\u2011and\u2011bound explorations) that can squeeze the trees tighter together, thereby reducing the side length\u202f\\(s_n\\)\u202fand the overall score.  Empirical evidence from the competition\u2019s discussion threads shows that the best\u2011performing teams (those achieving\u202f<\u202f69\u202fpoints) rely on such unrestricted layouts.  \n\nBecause the publicly available discussion posts do not detail the exact algorithms (e.g., simulated\u2011annealing, integer\u2011programming, or reinforcement\u2011learning approaches) used by the sub\u201169 scorers, the precise technical pipeline cannot be extracted from the current search results.  What is clear, however, is that **asymmetry** is the key strategic choice that separates the highest\u2011scoring solutions from symmetric\u2011only approaches.  ",

The final solution is evaluated by an ensemble score that combines all cases.\n**Notebook Link**:[Santa 2025 - Christmas Tree Packing Challenge V1](https://www.kaggle.com/code/adityapawar327/santa-2025-christmas-tree-packing-challenge-v1)\n**Public Score**: 85.92\n## Table of Contents\n[](#table-of-contents)\n* Library Imports and Environment Setup\n* Global Configuration and Precision Settings\n* ChristmasTree Class Definition\n* Utility Functions (Scoring/Collision)\n* Simulated Annealing Algorithm (N &lt; 20)\n* Grid Search Algorithm (N &gt;= 20)\n* Hybrid &amp; Ensemble Solvers\n* Main Computation Loop (N = 1 to 200)\n* Submission Formatting and Export\n## Methodology\n[](#methodology)\n* **Small N (&lt; 20):**Uses Simulated Annealing for efficient search in small configuration spaces.\n* **Large N (&gt;= 20):**Uses a tailored Grid Search for tractable solution space exploration.\n* **Hybrid/Ensemble:**Runs multiple seeds and chooses the best solution for each N.\n* **Collision Detection:**Employs Shapely geometry operations to prevent tree overlap.\n* **Performance:**Code leverages parallelization (`ProcessPoolExecutor`) and high-precision (Decimal) arithmetic.\n## Usage\n[](#usage)\n1. Install dependencies:\n* `shapely`,`numpy`,`pandas`,`matplotlib`,`tqdm`\n* Run the notebook or script sequentially to output results and save a`submission.csv`.\n* Check the score on important N cases (e.g., 1, 10, 25, 50, 100, 150, 200).\n## Output\n[](#output)\n* The notebook prints key logs during computation.\n* A`submission.csv`is generated with columns:`id`,`x`,`y`,`deg`(example row:`001\\_0, s-9.146226, s-0.12832, s-224.999647`).\n## License\n[](#license)\nThis project is released under the[Apache 2.0 License](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).\n## Author\n[](#author)\nAditya Pawar ([Kaggle Profile](https://www.kaggle.com/adityapawar327))\nFor questions or collaboration, feel free to reach out via Kaggle discussions or connect on[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adityapawar327).\n## About\nIn this re-defined optimization problem, help Santa fit Christmas tree toys into the smallest (2-dimension) parcel size possible so that ...",
