## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.659493 (current submission, 0.000465 better than baseline)
- Best LB score: 70.659958 (from exp_005/exp_006) - need to submit current best
- Target: 68.919154 | Gap to target: 1.740339 (2.53%)

## Response to Evaluator

The evaluator correctly identified:
1. **Dimer mosaic failed completely** - 3.3x worse than baseline for ALL N values
2. **bbox3 output is INVALID** - 246,372 overlaps, not a valid solution
3. **Corner extraction was recommended** - but testing shows 0 improvements from baseline

**Key Finding from Loop 13 Analysis:**
- Current submission (70.659493) is 0.000465 better than baseline (70.659958)
- Only N=65 differs from baseline (0.363328 vs 0.363793)
- The N=65 improvement came from a previous experiment (source unknown)
- Corner extraction from N=50,100,111,150,200 found 0 improvements
- The baseline is already well-optimized

## CRITICAL SITUATION ASSESSMENT

After 17 experiments, we have:
- **Best score: 70.659493** (0.000465 improvement over baseline)
- **Gap to target: 1.74 points (2.53%)**
- **All standard approaches exhausted:**
  - SA optimization: No improvement
  - Fractional translation: No improvement
  - Backward propagation: No improvement
  - bbox3 optimizer: Invalid (overlaps)
  - Perturbation: Causes collisions
  - Lattice SA: No improvement
  - Crodoc ensemble: 0.000014 improvement
  - Asymmetric random restart: No improvement
  - Dimer mosaic: 3.3x WORSE
  - Corner extraction: 0 improvements

## Recommended Approaches (Priority Order)

### 1. **[HIGHEST PRIORITY] Create Multi-Source Ensemble**
Combine configurations from ALL available sources:
- saspav_latest (baseline)
- All submission candidates (candidate_000 through candidate_012)
- eazy_output.csv
- Current submission (has better N=65)
- Any other CSV files in snapshots

For each N, take the BEST configuration from any source. This should capture the N=65 improvement and any other per-N improvements.

### 2. **[HIGH PRIORITY] Very Long Optimization Runs**
Run optimizers for HOURS instead of minutes:
- sa_v1_parallel with -n 1000000 -r 500 (run for 2+ hours)
- eazy optimizer for 30+ minutes
- Let it run overnight if possible

### 3. **[HIGH PRIORITY] Small N Exhaustive Search**
Small N values contribute most to the score:
- N=1: 0.66 (0.94% of total)
- N=2: 0.45 (0.64% of total)
- N=3-10: ~0.35-0.43 each

For N=1-5, try exhaustive search over angle combinations.
For N=1, verify optimal angle is 45° (minimizes bounding box of symmetric tree).

### 4. **[MEDIUM PRIORITY] Extended Corner Extraction**
Run corner extraction from ALL large N (10-200) to ALL smaller N, not just a few samples.

### 5. **[LOW PRIORITY] Novel Approaches**
If all else fails, try fundamentally different approaches:
- Genetic algorithms
- Constraint programming
- Physics-based simulation

## What NOT to Try
- Dimer mosaic geometric construction (3.3x worse)
- Simple perturbation (causes collisions)
- bbox3 without overlap checking (produces invalid solutions)

## SUBMISSION STRATEGY
- Remaining submissions: 94
- **SUBMIT IMMEDIATELY** after creating multi-source ensemble
- LB feedback is FREE information - use it!

## Validation Notes
- Score = sum of (side^2 / n) for all N from 1 to 200
- No overlaps allowed
- Current submission has 0 overlaps (verified)

## Next Experiment: Multi-Source Ensemble

1. Load ALL available CSV sources (baseline, candidates, eazy output, current submission)
2. For each N from 1 to 200, find the BEST configuration across all sources
3. Create a new submission with the best-of-all configurations
4. Verify no overlaps
5. Submit to get LB feedback

The target of 68.919154 requires a 2.53% improvement. This is a significant gap that may require techniques not available in public kernels. However, we MUST NOT give up - continue experimenting with different approaches.
