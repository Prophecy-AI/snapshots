## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.659493 from corner extraction (exp_018 - not yet logged)
- Best LB score: 70.659958 (from exp_005/exp_006)
- Target: 68.919154 | Gap to target: 1.740339 (2.53%)

## CRITICAL DISCOVERY: Corner Extraction Works!

The corner extraction approach found an improvement:
- N=65 from N=101: 0.363793 -> 0.363328 (improvement: 0.000466)
- New best score: 70.659493 (improvement of 0.000466 over baseline)

This is the FIRST approach that has found ANY improvement over the baseline!

## Response to Evaluator

The evaluator correctly identified:
1. **Dimer mosaic failed completely** - 3.3x worse than baseline for ALL N values
2. **bbox3 output is INVALID** - 246,372 overlaps, not a valid solution
3. **Corner extraction is promising** - Found 1 improvement

I agree with the evaluator's recommendation to:
1. Implement corner extraction more extensively
2. Focus on small N values (N=1,2,3,4,5 contribute most to score)
3. Try multi-source corner extraction

## What Has Been Tried (All Failed Except Corner Extraction)

| Approach | Result |
|----------|--------|
| SA optimization (sa_v1_parallel) | No improvement |
| Fractional translation | No improvement |
| Backward propagation | No improvement |
| bbox3 optimizer | Invalid (overlaps) |
| Perturbation + re-optimization | Causes collisions |
| Lattice SA (jiweiliu) | No improvement |
| Crodoc ensemble | 0.000014 improvement |
| Asymmetric random restart | No improvement |
| Dimer mosaic geometric | 3.3x WORSE |
| **Corner extraction** | **0.000466 improvement** ✓ |

## Key Insight

The baseline configurations are at an EXTREMELY tight local optimum:
- Even tiny perturbations (0.01 position, 5° angle) cause collisions
- Standard optimization techniques cannot improve them
- Only STRUCTURAL changes (like corner extraction) can find improvements

## Recommended Approaches (Priority Order)

### 1. **[HIGHEST PRIORITY] Extended Corner Extraction**
The corner extraction only found 1 improvement. We should:
- Run corner extraction from ALL large N (10-200) to ALL smaller N
- Use multiple baseline sources (saspav, crodoc, etc.)
- Try different corner selection strategies (not just 4 corners)
- Run recursively: after finding improvements, run again on improved configs

### 2. **[HIGH PRIORITY] Small N Exhaustive Optimization**
Small N values contribute most to the score:
- N=1: contributes 0.66 (highest single contribution!)
- N=2: contributes 0.45
- N=3-5: contribute ~0.35 each

For N=1, the optimal angle should be exactly 45° (minimizes bounding box).
For N=2-5, try exhaustive search over angle combinations.

### 3. **[HIGH PRIORITY] Multi-Source Ensemble**
Combine configurations from multiple sources:
- saspav_latest (current best)
- crodoc ensemble output
- Corner extraction output
- eazy optimizer output (if valid)

For each N, take the best configuration from any source.

### 4. **[MEDIUM PRIORITY] Very Long Optimization Runs**
Run optimizers for hours instead of minutes:
- sa_v1_parallel with -n 500000 -r 1000
- bbox3 with -n 500000 -r 500
- Let it run for 2+ hours

### 5. **[MEDIUM PRIORITY] Different Initial Configurations**
Instead of optimizing existing configs, try:
- Generate random valid configurations
- Apply SA to find local optima
- Compare with baseline

## What NOT to Try
- Dimer mosaic geometric construction (3.3x worse)
- Simple perturbation (causes collisions)
- bbox3 without overlap checking (produces invalid solutions)
- Any approach that starts from scratch without using baseline

## SUBMISSION STRATEGY
- Remaining submissions: 94 (100 - 6 used)
- **SUBMIT the corner extraction result!** It's our best score (70.659493)
- Submit after every experiment that shows improvement

## Validation Notes
- Score is calculated as sum of (side^2 / n) for all N from 1 to 200
- No overlaps allowed (trees cannot intersect)
- Current submission has 0 overlaps (verified)

## Next Experiment: Extended Corner Extraction

1. Load ALL available baseline sources
2. For each source, run corner extraction from ALL large N to ALL smaller N
3. Keep track of best configuration for each N across all sources
4. Save the best-of-all ensemble
5. Submit if improved
