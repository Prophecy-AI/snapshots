## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.659944 from exp_015 (crodoc ensemble)
- Best LB score: 70.6600 (exp_005, exp_006)
- Target: 68.919154 | Gap to target: 1.74 points (2.46%)

## Critical Finding: ALL Public Solutions Converge to Same Local Optimum

After 15 experiments and loading 694 CSV files, we've confirmed:
- ALL public pre-optimized solutions converge to ~70.66
- The eazy optimizer (orbital moves, square pressure) also converges to 70.659944
- The gap to target (1.74 points) CANNOT be closed by optimizing existing solutions

## What Has Been Tried (ALL FAILED to improve beyond 70.659944):
1. SA optimization (sa_v1_parallel, bbox3) - NO improvement
2. Fractional translation - NO improvement
3. Backward propagation - NO improvement
4. Lattice SA (jiweiliu kernel) - WORSE results
5. Row-based approach (zaburo kernel) - WORSE results
6. Ensemble of all 694 CSV files (crodoc kernel) - 0.000015 improvement
7. eazy optimizer (orbital moves, square pressure) - 0.000014 improvement
8. Perturbation + re-optimization - causes collisions immediately

## Response to Evaluator

The evaluator correctly identified that:
1. The crodoc ensemble found only 0.000015 improvement - confirming all solutions are at the same local optimum
2. The improvements came from eazy_optimizer output, but even that only gives 0.000014 improvement
3. The gap is STRUCTURAL, not algorithmic - we cannot close it by optimizing within the current paradigm

**I AGREE with the evaluator's assessment.** The target (68.919154) requires fundamentally different approaches not in public kernels.

## Key Insight from Web Search

Top scores below 69 are achieved by:
1. **ASYMMETRIC solutions** - exploit irregular gaps between trees (symmetric solutions leave unused corners)
2. **Symmetry-breaking tricks** - force the search to consider asymmetric configurations early
3. **Hybrid strategy**: N < 58 uses SA for unstructured/chaotic packings, N > 58 uses crystalline/lattice packing

## Recommended Approaches (Priority Order)

### 1. **[HIGHEST PRIORITY] Generate ASYMMETRIC configurations from scratch**

The key insight is that all public solutions are likely SYMMETRIC or near-symmetric. We need to:
- Generate random asymmetric starting configurations
- Run long SA optimization on these new starting points
- The goal is to find a DIFFERENT basin, not optimize the existing one

**Implementation:**
```python
# For each N, generate 10-20 random asymmetric configurations:
# - Random positions within a reasonable bounding box
# - Random rotations (not just 0/180)
# - Run SA for 5-10 minutes per configuration
# - Keep the best result
```

### 2. **[HIGH PRIORITY] Very long optimization runs (hours, not minutes)**

All our optimization runs have been limited to minutes. The target may require:
- Run bbox3 or sa_v1_parallel for 2-4 hours
- Use higher iteration counts (-n 500000 -r 1000)
- Focus on N values with highest scores (most room for improvement)

### 3. **[MEDIUM PRIORITY] Hybrid approach: SA for small N, lattice for large N**

Per the web search insight:
- N < 58: Use SA for unstructured, chaotic packings
- N > 58: Use crystalline/lattice packing

We haven't tried this hybrid approach - all our lattice attempts used the same approach for all N.

### 4. **[MEDIUM PRIORITY] Symmetry-breaking in SA**

Modify the SA algorithm to:
- Penalize symmetric configurations
- Force asymmetric moves early in the search
- Use asymmetric perturbation distributions

## What NOT to Try
- More ensemble combinations of existing solutions (all converge to same optimum)
- Standard SA on existing baseline (already at local optimum)
- Fractional translation (no room to move)
- Backward propagation (already optimal)

## SUBMISSION STRATEGY
- Remaining submissions: 91
- Submit after this experiment? YES - we have abundant submissions
- Even if we don't beat the target, LB feedback helps calibrate our approach

## Validation Notes
- CV = LB for this problem (no train/test split, just geometric optimization)
- Score is deterministic - same configuration always gives same score
- Focus on finding configurations with lower scores, not on CV-LB gap

## Key Insight for Next Experiment

The target score (68.919154) is 2.46% better than our best (70.659944). This is a significant gap that requires:
1. Finding a DIFFERENT local optimum (not optimizing the current one)
2. Using ASYMMETRIC configurations (not symmetric)
3. Potentially running optimization for MUCH longer (hours, not minutes)

**DO NOT give up.** The target IS reachable. We just need to find the right approach.
