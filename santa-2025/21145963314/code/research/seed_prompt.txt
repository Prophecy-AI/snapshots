## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.659958 from exp_005 (saspav_latest baseline)
- Best LB score: 70.6600 (exp_005, exp_006)
- Target: 68.919154 | Gap to target: 1.74 points (2.46%)

## Public Kernel Status (CRITICAL!)
- Have we implemented the best kernel yet? **YES - jiweiliu kernel was FULLY implemented in exp_009**
- Result: **ALL configurations produced WORSE scores than baseline**
- Top kernels identified and tested:
  1. jiweiliu_super-fast-simulated-annealing-with-translations - TESTED, FAILED (all configs worse)
  2. zaburo_88-32999-a-well-aligned-initial-solution - TESTED, FAILED (15-33% worse)
  3. crodoc_74-75-backpacking-christmas-trees - Not yet tested
  4. chistyakov_new-simple-fix-rebuild-large-layout-from-corners - Not yet tested

## CV-LB Relationship Analysis
- CV = LB for all submissions (perfect correlation)
- No distribution shift - this is a pure optimization problem
- Improving CV directly improves LB

## Response to Evaluator

**I AGREE with the evaluator's assessment that the jiweiliu approach has been exhausted.**

The evaluator correctly identified:
1. The FULL jiweiliu kernel was implemented with SA optimization (100,000 moves per config)
2. ALL configurations produced WORSE scores than the saspav_latest baseline
3. The baseline is ALREADY the result of many iterations of optimization
4. Running jiweiliu again on an already-optimized solution doesn't help

**Key insight**: The saspav_latest baseline (70.659958) is BETTER than what the jiweiliu kernel can produce from scratch. This is because the baseline is the cumulative result of many optimization iterations.

**The evaluator recommends pivoting to fundamentally different approaches:**
1. Zaburo well-aligned row-based approach - TESTED, produces 15-33% WORSE scores
2. Crodoc backpacking - NOT YET TESTED
3. Chistyakov corner extraction - NOT YET TESTED
4. Different seed configurations - NOT YET TESTED

## Analysis of Remaining Options

### Option 1: Crodoc Backpacking (RECOMMENDED)
The crodoc kernel uses a backward iteration strategy:
- Loads ALL CSV files and creates an ensemble (picks best for each N)
- Iterates from N=200 down to N=1
- When current config is worse than best, adapts from best by dropping trees

**Why this might work**: It creates an ensemble from ALL available solutions, not just one. We have 30+ CSV files in the snapshot.

### Option 2: Chistyakov Corner Extraction
For each large N configuration:
- Get bounding box corners
- For each corner, sort trees by distance
- Take first k trees for smaller configurations
- Check if this improves scores

**Why this might work**: It exploits the structure of large N configurations to improve smaller N.

### Option 3: Different Seed Configurations
The jiweiliu seeds were optimized for a different baseline. Try:
- Generating new seeds from scratch
- Using seeds from other kernels
- Random seed search

### Option 4: Hybrid Approaches
Combine multiple techniques:
- Ensemble + SA + corner extraction + deletion cascade

## Recommended Approaches (Priority Order)

### 1. **[HIGHEST PRIORITY]** Implement Crodoc Backpacking Ensemble

This is fundamentally different from what we've tried:
- Loads ALL CSV files (30+ sources)
- Creates ensemble by picking best for each N
- Backward iteration to propagate good configs

**Implementation steps:**
1. Load all CSV files from /home/nonroot/snapshots/ and /home/code/external_data/
2. For each N from 1-200, pick the best configuration across all files
3. Apply backward iteration: for N from 200 to 1, if current side > best side, adapt from best
4. Save and submit

**Expected outcome**: May find better configurations in other CSV files we haven't used.

### 2. **[HIGH PRIORITY]** Chistyakov Corner Extraction

For each large N (100, 150, 200):
- Get bounding box corners
- For each corner, sort trees by distance
- Extract subsets for smaller N
- Check if any improve the baseline

### 3. **[MEDIUM PRIORITY]** Basin Hopping with Different Starting Points

Instead of optimizing the baseline, try:
- Generate completely new random configurations
- Apply basin hopping (large perturbation + local optimization)
- This might find different basins than the current local optimum

### 4. **[LOW PRIORITY]** Long Optimization Runs

If nothing else works:
- Run bbox3 or sa_v1_parallel for hours (not minutes)
- The target score may require much longer optimization

## What NOT to Try
- ❌ jiweiliu lattice SA (exhausted - all configs worse than baseline)
- ❌ Zaburo row-based approach (tested - 15-33% worse)
- ❌ Standard SA on baseline (tested - no improvement)
- ❌ Fractional translation (tested - no improvement)
- ❌ Backward propagation (tested - no improvement)
- ❌ Perturbation (causes collisions immediately)
- ❌ Concluding the target is unreachable (FORBIDDEN)

## SUBMISSION STRATEGY
- Remaining submissions: 91
- Submit after this experiment? **YES - we have abundant submissions**
- We need LB feedback to verify if new approaches work

## Validation Notes
- CV = LB for this problem (pure optimization, no distribution shift)
- Verify no overlaps before submission
- Compare against baseline score (70.659958)

## Time Allocation
- 20 min: Implement crodoc backpacking ensemble
- 20 min: Run ensemble creation and backward iteration
- 10 min: Verify and submit
- If time permits: Try corner extraction

## Critical Reminder
**DO NOT conclude the target is unreachable.** The gap is 1.74 points (2.46%). Large N (>100) contributes 34 points (48%) - a 5.12% improvement on large N alone would close the gap. The target IS achievable with the right approach.

**The baseline is at a tight local optimum, but there may be BETTER local optima that we haven't found yet.** The crodoc ensemble approach may find configurations from other sources that are better than what we have.
