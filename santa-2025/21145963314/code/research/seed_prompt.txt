## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.659493 from exp_018 (corner extraction)
- Best LB score: 70.6600 (from exp_005, exp_006)
- Target: 68.919154 | Gap to target: 1.740339 (2.46%)

## Public Kernel Status (CRITICAL!)
- Have we implemented the best kernel yet? YES - saspav_latest (70.659958)
- Top kernels identified: saspav (70.66), crodoc ensemble (70.66), jiweiliu lattice (failed)
- Kernels we've implemented: saspav, crodoc, jiweiliu, zaburo, hardikmakhija dimer, chistyakov corner
- Kernels still to implement: None with better scores

## Ensemble Strategy
- Models available for ensemble: saspav_latest (70.659958), corner_extraction (70.659493)
- Current best score: 70.659493 (corner extraction)
- Next ensemble to try: Combine corner extraction with other optimization approaches

## CV-LB Relationship Analysis
- All submissions have CV ≈ LB (70.66)
- The problem is deterministic - CV = LB exactly
- Gap to target is 1.74 points (2.46%)

## Response to Evaluator
The evaluator correctly identified that:
1. The dimer mosaic approach failed completely (3.3x worse than baseline)
2. bbox3 produces invalid solutions with overlaps
3. The chistyakov corner extraction approach is worth trying

I implemented the corner extraction approach and found:
- 1 improvement: N=65 from N=101 (improvement of 0.000466)
- New total score: 70.659493 (vs baseline 70.659958)

This is a small but real improvement. The corner extraction approach works but only found 1 improvement out of 200 configurations. This suggests:
1. The baseline is already highly optimized
2. Most configurations are already at or near optimal
3. The remaining gap (1.74 points) requires fundamentally different approaches

## Key Insights from 18 Experiments
1. **All standard optimization approaches have failed**: SA, fractional translation, backward propagation, bbox3, perturbation
2. **The baseline is at an EXTREMELY tight local optimum**: Even tiny perturbations cause collisions
3. **Geometric construction approaches fail**: Dimer mosaic produces 3.3x worse scores
4. **Corner extraction works but limited**: Only 1 improvement found out of 200 configurations
5. **The gap to target (1.74 points) likely requires proprietary techniques not in public kernels**

## Recommended Approaches (Priority Order)
1. **[HIGH PRIORITY] Submit current best (70.659493)** - Get LB feedback on corner extraction improvement
2. **[HIGH PRIORITY] Try more aggressive corner extraction** - Check ALL pairs of (large_n, small_n), not just corners
3. **[MEDIUM PRIORITY] Try small N exhaustive optimization** - N=1,2,3 contribute disproportionately to score
4. **[MEDIUM PRIORITY] Run very long optimization (hours)** - The just-luck kernel runs for 10+ minutes with continuous improvement

**SUBMISSION STRATEGY:**
- Remaining submissions: 94
- Submit after this experiment? YES - we have abundant subs and found an improvement

## What NOT to Try
- Dimer mosaic geometric construction (3.3x worse)
- bbox3 optimizer (produces invalid overlapping solutions)
- Simple lattice from scratch (much worse than baseline)
- Perturbation + re-optimization (causes collisions immediately)

## Validation Notes
- CV = LB for this problem (deterministic)
- Score is sum of (side^2 / n) for all N from 1 to 200
- No overlaps allowed - must verify before submission

## CRITICAL: The Target May Require Proprietary Techniques
After 18 experiments, all public kernel approaches have been exhausted:
- saspav_latest: 70.659958
- Corner extraction: 70.659493 (0.000466 improvement)
- All other approaches: No improvement or much worse

The gap to target (68.919154) of 1.74 points (2.46%) likely requires:
1. Proprietary algorithms not shared publicly
2. Much longer optimization runs (days, not hours)
3. Different initial configurations discovered through extensive search
4. Techniques that top competitors have not shared

**DO NOT GIVE UP.** The target IS reachable. Continue exploring:
- More aggressive subset extraction (not just corners)
- Exhaustive search for small N
- Very long optimization runs
- Novel algorithmic approaches
