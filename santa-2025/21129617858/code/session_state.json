      "finding": "This is a 2D geometric packing optimization problem: Pack 1-200 Christmas tree shapes into minimum square bounding boxes. Score = sum of (side\u00b2/n) for each configuration. Trees are 15-vertex polygons with specific shape (trunk + 3-tier branches). Key approaches: 1) Greedy placement with collision detection using Shapely, 2) bbox3 C++ optimizer with simulated annealing, 3) Rotation optimization to minimize bounding box, 4) Squeeze/compaction moves, 5) Local search with position/angle perturbations.",
