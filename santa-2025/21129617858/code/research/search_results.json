An efficient 2D irregular packing algorithm can effectively improve material utilization and reduce processing costs. The reduction in material consumption will also have a beneficial impact on the environment ([Ke et al., 2020](#B76)). Therefore, research of the packing problem is of great significance for technology and social interest.\nThe 2D packing problem is a type of combinatorial optimization problems to locate parts with different shapes compactly in one or more master sheet material to minimize the occupied space or maximize the utilization of the material. The 2D packing problem is currently recognized as a NP problem, which is mainly solved by heuristic algorithms. In recent years, many scholars have conducted research on 2D irregular packing problems with a verity of solutions.\nThere exists a number of review articles on packing and cutting problems. We have summarized the main review literature in the field of 2D packing and cutting as shown in[Table 1](#T1). Brown ([Brown, 1971](#B17)) introduced an optimum packing and depletion problem with optimization of space and resource usage. Harvey ([Salkin and De Kluyver, 1975](#B116)) surveyed the application of mathematical optimization models such as linear programming to the knapsack problem. Bruce ([Golden, 1976](#B50)) surveyed various approaches to the cutting stock problem. Hinxman ([Hinxman, 1980](#B65)) surveyed the trim-loss and assortment problems, this research paid more attention to cutting and packaging problems in practical applications, and did not mention much about theoretical methods. Garey and Coffman ([Garey and Johnson, 1981](#B47);[Coffman et al., 1984](#B27)) surveyed the approximation algorithms for bin packing problems. Israni ([Israni and Sanders, 1982](#B72)) reviewed the 2D cutting stock problem including almost all 2D packaging problems. The author also proposed a rectangular layout method. Sarin ([Sarin, 1983](#B118)) reviewed methodologies and literature to solve 2D stock cutting problems and introduced an interactive optimization procedure for a general 2D stock cutting problem. Dyckhoff ([Dyckhoff et al., 1985](#B38)) described a trim loss and related problems and categorized them briefly. Dudzi&#x00144;ski ([Dudzi&#x00144;ski and Walukiewicz, 1987](#B36)) summarized the exact methods for knapsack problems, such as linear programming. Matthias ([Rode and Rosenberg, 1987](#B114)) analyzed the algorithm for the trim-loss problems. Haessler ([Haessler and Sweeney, 1991](#B59)) reviewed the solution process of cutting stock problems, including placement algorithm and sequence optimization algorithm. Dowsland ([Dowsland and Dowsland, 1992](#B34)) reviewed the application of operations research methods to the packing problem and summarized some exact heuristics. Sweeney ([Sweeney and Paternoster, 1992](#B128)) categorized cutting and packing problems and made application-oriented research records. Cheng ([Cheng et al., 1994](#B22)) discussed 2D cutting stock problems and their application cases including the pallet loading problem and VLSI placement problem. With the gradual deepening of research on 2D layout problems, typology becomes a common research topic. 2D regular and irregular layout problems are clearly distinguished in practical applications and theoretical methods. Dowsland ([Dowsland and Dowsland, 1995](#B29)) gave a special review of the 2D irregular nesting problem for the first time. Mavridou ([Mavridou and Pardalos, 1997](#B98)) summarized applications of the genetic algorithm and simulated annealing algorithm in the optimization of facility layout problems. Dyckhoff ([Dyckhoff, 1990](#B37)) made a typology of the cutting and packing problems in detail, and W&#x000e4;scher ([W&#x000e4;scher et al., 2007](#B135)) improved the typology later. Hopper ([Hopper and Turton, 1999](#B67);[Hopper and Turton, 2001a](#B68);[Hopper and Turton, 2001b](#B69)) investigated the application of meta-heuristic and heuristic algorithms in 2D and 3D packing problems. Lodi ([Lodi et al., 2002a](#B90);[Lodi et al., 2002b](#B91)) reviewed algorithms proposed in the 1990s of 2D packing problems. Bennell et al. ([Bennell and Oliveira, 2008](#B10);[Bennell and Oliveira, 2009](#B9)) discussed 2D irregular packing problems and related geometric problems. Leao ([Leao et al., 2020](#B81)) introduced the mathematical models in the 2D irregular packing problem.\nTABLE 1\n[![www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/966691/fmech-08-966691-HTML/image_m/fmech-08-966691-t001.jpg)](https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/966691/fmech-08-966691-HTML/image_m/fmech-08-966691-t001.jpg)\n**TABLE 1**.

It adopts two neighborhoods, swapping two given polygons in a placement and placing one polygon into a new position. The local search algorithm is used to minimize the overlap on the basis of the neighborhoods mentioned above and the unconstrained[nonlinear programming](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/nonlinear-programming)model is adopted to further minimize the overlap during the search process. Moreover, the[tabu](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/tabu)search algorithm is used to avoid[local minima](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/local-minimum), and a compact algorithm is presented to improve the result. The results of standard test instances indicate that when compared with other existing algorithms, the presented algorithm does not only show some signs of competitive power but also updates several best known results.\n## Introduction\nThe irregular strip packing problem, also known as the nesting problem, has a wide area of applications. Given a set of irregular shapes and a rectangular strip with a fixed width and an arbitrary length, the target of the two-dimensional irregular strip packing problem is to place all shapes within the strip such that the length of the strip is minimized and the irregular shapes do not overlap. A classic example application is clothing industry. Several pieces of clothes will be cut from a roll of fabric and the objective is to minimize the waste of fabric. The fabric has a fixed width and its length can be generally assumed infinite; so the problem is to minimize the length required for producing the specified number of irregular shapes.\nThe irregular strip packing problem is a NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem [1]. Numerous papers on nesting problem have been published since the first paper by Art [2]. Meta-heuristics are often used to solve this problem. Hopper and Turton [3] reviewed these methods, and a summary of geometric methods was published by Bennell and Oliveira [4]. As research progressed, further breakthroughs in algorithms for this problem have achieved in recent years. When compared with the previous years, these solutions have markedly improved the effect and speed of nesting results. The typical methods include Burke et al. [5], Gomes and Oliveira [6], Egeblad et al. [7], Imamichi et al. [8], etc.\nAlbano and Sapuppo [9] proposed an algorithm that places each shape at the bottom-left position, and the sequence of places is obtained by tree search. Jakobs [10] proposed a two-stage solution which first generates the rectangular enclosure of each irregular shape, and then finds the placement for these enclosures through a genetic algorithm. Secondly, a shrinking algorithm moves the shapes to another one as close as possible using the idea of the bottom-left heuristic. Gomes and Oliveira [11] based on bottom-left heuristic and find a good placement by exchanging two shapes in the layout. Dowsland et al. [12] developed a compact algorithm to improve the bottom-left heuristic algorithm. The algorithm first gets the initial placement by the bottom-left heuristic, and then uses a shaking process to compact the placement. Burke et al. [5] presented a new bottom-left heuristic algorithm based on discretization, and combination with hill climbing or tabu search to get a high quality solution. This algorithm can also pack the shapes with circular arcs and holes. Egeblad et al. [7] proposed an efficient fast local search method whose neighborhood is any horizontal or vertical translation of a given shape. They also formulated a polynomial time algorithm to find a translation with minimum overlap area between the given polygon and the other polygons in the current placement. Gomes and Oliveira [6] presented a separation algorithm to locally optimize the placement based on linear programming models, and used simulated annealing to guide the search. A new separation algorithm based on unconstrained nonlinear programming is proposed by Imamichi et al. [8]. They also designed an algorithm that swaps two polygons in a placement, and then the algorithms are combined as a component into an iterated local search algorithm for the overlap minimization problem. This method yielded several best known results on the standard test instances. Our algorithm is based on a separation algorithm presented by Imamichi et al. [8], and local search is adopted to guide the search. Moreover, a tabu search algorithm is used to avoid local minima and a compacted algorithm is used to improve the packing results.\n## Section snippets\n## Formulation\nIn this section, some fundamental elements of geometry are first defined, before formulation of the irregular strip packing problem algorithm is given.\n**Definition 1 (point)**\nA point*p*in two-dimensional space is represented by a pair:p=(px,py)\u2208R2.\n**Definition 2 (line segment)**\nA line segment*s*is a point set defined by two endpoints*p**a*and*p**b*:s={p\u2208R2,t\u2208[0,1]|p=pa+t(pb\u2212pa)}.\n**Definition 3 (polygon)**\nA polygon is a plane figure bounded by a closed path composes of a finite sequence of line segments denoted by*S*.

The container has a fixed width, while its length can change so that all items are placed in it. The objective is to find a layout of the set of polygons that minimizes the length of the container. The proposed algorithm constructively creates layouts from an ordered list of items and a placement heuristic. The placement determines the collision free region (represents the set of translations to create a feasible layout) for the item to be placed. It is shown that the collision free region must be calculated using non-regularized Boolean operations, as contours of no-fit polygons should be ignored. The proposed algorithm to solve the placement problem has two levels, in the internal level the container has fixed dimensions, and the external level reduces or increases the variable dimension. The placement heuristic searches for degenerated vertices and edges as they represent local maximum compaction. Computational comparisons on benchmark problems show that the proposed algorithm generated highly competitive solutions. Moreover, our algorithm updated some best known results.\n...Read more\n## Key takeaways\n![sparkles](https://a.academia-assets.com/images/icons/sparkle.svg)\nAI\n1. The proposed two-level algorithm effectively minimizes container length for irregular polygon packing.\n2. Collision free regions (CFRs) are determined using non-regularized Boolean operations to avoid contour interference.\n3. Placement heuristic prioritizes degenerated edges and vertices for optimal item fitting and compaction.\n4. Benchmark tests with 13 datasets demonstrated competitive results, achieving 100% density in some cases.\n5. Simulated annealing (SA) is integrated for sequence and position control of item placements.\n## Related papers\n[Rotational Placement of Irregular Polygons over Containers with Fixed Dimensions using Simulated Annealing and No-Fit Polygons](https://www.academia.edu/58884840/Rotational_Placement_of_Irregular_Polygons_over_Containers_with_Fixed_Dimensions_using_Simulated_Annealing_and_No_Fit_Polygons)\n[Thiago de Castro Martins](https://independent.academia.edu/ThiagodeCastroMartins)\nJournal of the Brazilian Society of Mechanical Sciences and Engineering, 2008\nThis work deals with the problem of minimizing the waste of space that occurs on a rotational placement of a set of irregular bi-dimensional small items inside a bidimensional large object. This problem is approached with an heuristic based on simulated annealing. Traditional &quot;external penalization&quot; techniques are avoided through the application of the no-fit polygon, that determinates the collision-free region for each small item before its placement. The simulated annealing controls: the rotation applied and the placement of the small item. For each non-placed small item, a limited depth binary search is performed to find a scale factor that when applied to the small item, would allow it to be fitted in the large object. Three possibilities to define the sequence on which the small items are placed are studied: larger-first, random permutation and weight sorted. The proposed algorithm is suited for non-convex small items and large objects.\ndownloadDownload free PDF[View PDFchevron\\_right](https://www.academia.edu/58884840/Rotational_Placement_of_Irregular_Polygons_over_Containers_with_Fixed_Dimensions_using_Simulated_Annealing_and_No_Fit_Polygons)\n[An effective heuristic for the two-dimensional irregular bin packing problem](https://www.academia.edu/69875946/An_effective_heuristic_for_the_two_dimensional_irregular_bin_packing_problem)\n[Gabriela Ochoa](https://independent.academia.edu/GabrielaOchoa10)\nAnnals of Operations Research, 2013\nThis paper proposes an adaptation, to the two-dimensional irregular bin packing problem of the Djang and Finch heuristic (DJD), originally designed for the one-dimensional bin packing problem.

As packing tasks arecombinatorial problems with very large searchspaces, the recent literature encourages theuse of meta-heuristic search methods, inparticular genetic algorithms. The objective ofthis paper is to present and categorise thesolution approaches in the literature for 2Dregular and irregular strip packing problems.The focus is hereby on the analysis of themethods involving genetic algorithms. Anoverview of the methods applying othermeta-heuristic algorithms including simulatedannealing, tabu search, and artificial neuralnetworks is also given.\n\nThis is a preview of subscription content, [log in via an institution](https://wayf.springernature.com?redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1023%2FA%3A1012590107280%3Ferror%3Dcookies_not_supported%26code%3D60bc48b4-b7d2-4520-acdb-8666b5b6d1b2) to check access.\n\n## Access this article\n\n[Log in via an institution](https://wayf.springernature.com?redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1023%2FA%3A1012590107280%3Ferror%3Dcookies_not_supported%26code%3D60bc48b4-b7d2-4520-acdb-8666b5b6d1b2)\n\nBuy article PDF USD 39.95\n\nPrice excludes VAT (USA)\n\nTax calculation will be finalised during checkout.\n\nInstant access to the full article PDF.\n\nRent this article via DeepDyve\n\n[Institutional subscriptions](https://www.springernature.com/gp/librarians/licensing/agc/journals)\n\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n\n![](https://media.springernature.com/w215h120/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10479-021-04226-6/MediaObjects/10479_2021_4226_Fig1_HTML.png)\n\n### [A hybrid metaheuristic for the two-dimensional strip packing problem](https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10479-021-04226-6?fromPaywallRec=true)\n\nArticle24 August 2021\n\n![](https://media.springernature.com/w92h120/springer-static/cover-hires/book/978-3-662-44739-0?as=webp)\n\n### [An Analogy between Bin Packing Problem and Permutation Problem: A New Encoding Scheme](https://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-662-44739-0_70?fromPaywallRec=true)\n\nChapter\u00a9 2014\n\n![](https://media.springernature.com/w92h120/springer-static/cover-hires/book/978-3-319-22635-4?as=webp)\n\n### [Hybrid Heuristic Algorithms for the Multiobjective Load Balancing of 2D Bin Packing Problems](https://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-319-22635-4_19?fromPaywallRec=true)\n\nChapter\u00a9 2016\n\n## References\n\n- Adamowicz, M. & Albano, A.

Irregular shape packing is one of the most recent variants to be widely researched and its history extends over 40 years. The evolution of solution approaches to this problem can be attributed to increased computer power and advances in geometric techniques as well as more sophisticated and insightful algorithm design. In this paper we will focus on the latter. Our aim is not to give a chronological account or an exhaustive review, but to draw on the literature to describe and evaluate the core approaches. Irregular packing is combinatorial and as a result solution methods are heuristic, save a few notable exceptions. We will explore different ways of representing the problem and mechanisms for moving between solutions. We will also propose where we see the future challenges for researchers in this area.\n\n## Suggested Citation\n\nJ A Bennell & J F Oliveira, 2009.\n\" **[A tutorial in irregular shape packing problems](https://ideas.repec.org/a/pal/jorsoc/v60y2009i1d10.1057_jors.2008.169.html)**,\"\n[Journal of the Operational Research Society](https://ideas.repec.org/s/pal/jorsoc.html), Palgrave Macmillan;The OR Society, vol. 60(1), pages 93-105, May.\nHandle: _RePEc:pal:jorsoc:v:60:y:2009:i:1:d:10.1057\\_jors.2008.169_\n\nDOI: 10.1057/jors.2008.169\n\nas\n\nHTMLHTML with abstractplain textplain text with abstractBibTeXRIS (EndNote, RefMan, ProCite)ReDIFJSON\n\n## Download full text from publisher\n\n**File URL:** http://link.springer.com/10.1057/jors.2008.169\n\n**File Function:** Abstract\n\n**Download Restriction:** Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.\n\n* * *\n\n**File URL:** https://libkey.io/10.1057/jors.2008.169?utm\\_source=ideas\n\n**LibKey link**: if access is restricted and if your library uses this service, LibKey will redirect you to where you can use your library subscription to access this item\n\n---><---\n\nAs the access to this document is restricted, you may want to [search](https://ideas.repec.org/cgi-bin/htsearch2?q=%22A+tutorial+in+irregular+shape+packing+problems%22) for a different version of it.\n\n## References listed on IDEAS\n\nas\n\nHTMLHTML with abstractplain textplain text with abstractBibTeXRIS (EndNote, RefMan, ProCite)ReDIFJSON\n\n01.
