## What I Understood

The junior researcher completed a **snapshot ensemble experiment** (exp_001) that combined the best configurations from multiple pre-optimized submissions. They found that `best_snapshot.csv` scores 70.624381, which is better than the baseline `submission.csv` (70.647327). The ensemble achieves a 0.023 point improvement by taking the best configuration for each N value - best_snapshot dominates 197 of 200 N values, with the baseline only contributing 3 N values.

This is a packing optimization competition where the goal is to pack Christmas tree-shaped polygons into the smallest bounding box for N=1 to N=200 trees. The score is Σ(side²/N) for all N values, lower is better. The target is 68.894234, and the current best is 70.624381 - a gap of ~1.73 points (2.5%).

## Technical Execution Assessment

**Validation**: Sound. The scoring is deterministic (CV-LB gap is exactly 0.0000 as verified in exp_000). The ensemble correctly takes the minimum score for each N value across sources.

**Leakage Risk**: None. This is a pure optimization problem with no train/test split - the score is deterministic based on tree placements.

**Score Integrity**: Verified. The improvement from 70.647327 to 70.624381 (0.023 points) is correctly computed. The source breakdown (197 vs 3 N values) is logged.

**Code Quality**: Good. The ensemble logic is straightforward - compare scores per N and keep the better configuration.

Verdict: **TRUSTWORTHY**

## Strategic Assessment

**Approach Fit**: The ensemble approach is a valid first step - it combines the best available configurations. However, this is a **low-leverage approach** at this stage. The ensemble only improved by 0.023 points when the gap to target is 1.73 points. This means 98.7% of the gap remains.

**Effort Allocation**: CONCERN. The researcher is doing "easy" work (ensembling existing solutions) rather than the hard work needed to close the gap. The strategy notes correctly identify that:
- Standard optimization approaches have hit a local optimum
- The pre-optimized submission already dominates all N values in the original ensemble
- Need fundamentally different approaches (lattice packing, asymmetric layouts, extended SA runs)

**Assumptions**: The implicit assumption is that better solutions exist in the snapshot files. This is partially validated (best_snapshot is better), but the improvement is marginal. The bigger assumption - that ensembling will close the 1.73 point gap - is clearly false.

**Blind Spots - CRITICAL**:

1. **bbox3 optimizer is available but UNUSED**: There's a compiled binary at `/home/code/preoptimized/bbox3` that can run extended optimization. The kernel `yongsukprasertsuk_santa-2025-best-keeping-bbox3-runner` shows a 3-hour optimization strategy with phases A/B/C. This is the primary tool used by top competitors.

2. **100 snapshots available but not systematically explored**: There are ~100 snapshot folders in `/home/nonroot/snapshots/santa-2025/`. Some may contain better solutions. A systematic scan would be valuable.

3. **No actual optimization has been attempted**: Both experiments so far (baseline verification, snapshot ensemble) are just combining existing solutions. No new optimization runs have been executed.

4. **Small N values are high-leverage but not specifically targeted**: N=1-10 contribute 6.1% of the score. The analysis shows N=1 already uses 45° rotation (optimal), but N=2-10 could potentially be improved with exhaustive angle search.

5. **The 1.73 point gap requires fundamentally different approaches**:
   - Asymmetric layouts for large N (38-vote discussion supports this)
   - Lattice/tessellation patterns for N≥58
   - Extended SA runs (hours, not minutes)
   - Per-N specialized optimization

**Trajectory**: The current trajectory is **not promising** for closing the gap. Two experiments have been completed:
- exp_000: Baseline verification (70.647327)
- exp_001: Snapshot ensemble (70.624381, +0.023 improvement)

At this rate (0.023 points per experiment), it would take ~75 experiments to reach the target. This is clearly unsustainable. The approach needs to pivot from "combining existing solutions" to "running actual optimization."

## What's Working

1. **Solid baseline established** - Score verified, CV-LB alignment confirmed
2. **Ensemble logic is correct** - Taking best per-N configuration is valid
3. **Good analysis** - Per-N score breakdown identifies high-leverage targets
4. **Infrastructure in place** - Scoring function, submission format, candidate tracking all working

## Key Concerns

1. **Observation**: No actual optimization has been run - only combining existing solutions.
   **Why it matters**: The gap to target is 1.73 points. Ensembling gave 0.023 points (1.3% of gap). At this rate, the target is unreachable.
   **Suggestion**: Run the bbox3 optimizer immediately. Start with short runs (2-5 minutes) to verify it works, then scale to longer runs (hours).

2. **Observation**: The bbox3 binary is available but unused.
   **Why it matters**: This is the primary optimization tool used by top competitors. The kernel shows a 3-hour strategy with phases A/B/C that systematically improves scores.
   **Suggestion**: 
   ```bash
   chmod +x /home/code/preoptimized/bbox3
   cp /home/code/submission_candidates/candidate_001.csv submission.csv
   ./bbox3 -n 2000 -r 60
   ```
   Then apply fix_direction (rotation tightening) and validate.

3. **Observation**: 100 snapshots exist but haven't been systematically scanned.
   **Why it matters**: Some snapshots may contain better solutions for specific N values.
   **Suggestion**: Write a script to scan all snapshots, score each, and build an ensemble from the best per-N configurations across ALL sources.

4. **Observation**: The strategy correctly identifies the need for "fundamentally different approaches" but the experiments aren't pursuing them.
   **Why it matters**: The strategy notes mention lattice packing, asymmetric layouts, and extended SA runs - none of which have been attempted.
   **Suggestion**: After running bbox3, try lattice/grid-based approaches for large N (N≥58) as mentioned in the strategy.

## Top Priority for Next Experiment

**RUN THE BBOX3 OPTIMIZER.** This is the single most important thing to do next.

The immediate steps should be:
1. Make bbox3 executable: `chmod +x /home/code/preoptimized/bbox3`
2. Copy the best candidate to working directory: `cp /home/code/submission_candidates/candidate_001.csv submission.csv`
3. Run bbox3 with moderate parameters: `./bbox3 -n 2000 -r 60` (start with ~5-10 minute runs)
4. Apply rotation tightening (fix_direction from the kernel) to the output
5. Validate no overlaps and score the result
6. If improved, save as new candidate
7. Scale up to longer runs (30 min, 1 hour, 3 hours)

The kernel `yongsukprasertsuk_santa-2025-best-keeping-bbox3-runner` provides a complete template. The key insight is that optimization needs HOURS of compute time, not minutes. The current approach of combining existing solutions has hit diminishing returns after just 2 experiments.

**Secondary priority**: Systematically scan all 100 snapshots to find the best per-N configurations. This is lower effort and may yield quick wins.

The target of 68.894234 requires ~2.5% improvement from current best. This IS achievable with sustained optimization effort, but requires actually running optimizers - not just analyzing and combining existing solutions.
