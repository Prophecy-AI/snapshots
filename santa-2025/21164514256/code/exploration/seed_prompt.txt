# Santa 2025 - Christmas Tree Packing Optimization

## Problem Overview
Pack N Christmas trees (N=1 to 200) into the smallest possible square bounding box.
- Score = Σ(side_n² / n) for n=1 to 200 (lower is better)
- Target score: 68.919154
- Best achieved: 70.659437 (gap: 1.74 points, 2.5%)
- Tree shape: 15-vertex polygon with trunk, 3 tiers, and tip (height 1.0, width 0.7)

## Current Status
- Best public kernels achieve ~70.66
- Pre-optimized submissions available in snapshots
- CV = LB exactly (pure optimization, no distribution shift)
- The gap of 1.74 points requires NOVEL approaches beyond public kernels

## Score Breakdown by N Range
```
N=  1- 10:  4.33 ( 6.1%) - LOWEST EFFICIENCY (1.51-2.60)
N= 11- 20:  3.73 ( 5.3%)
N= 21- 50: 10.98 (15.5%)
N= 51-100: 17.63 (25.0%)
N=101-150: 17.14 (24.3%)
N=151-200: 16.85 (23.8%) - HIGHEST EFFICIENCY (~2.96)
```

**Key insight**: Small N values (1-20) have the worst efficiency and most room for improvement!

## Pre-Optimized Solutions Available
Copy the best submission from snapshots:
```bash
cp /home/nonroot/snapshots/santa-2025/21156851249/submission/submission.csv ./submission.csv
```

## Key Approaches from Public Kernels

### 1. Simulated Annealing (SA) - Primary Approach
From `tree_packer_v21.cpp` and `bbox3`:
- Temperature schedule with exponential cooling
- Move operators: translate, rotate, swap positions
- Accept worse solutions with probability exp(-delta/T)
- Run with high iterations: -n 50000+ -r 128+
- Use OpenMP for parallelization (26 threads available)

Key SA parameters:
```cpp
// Temperature schedule
T_start = 0.1 * initial_side
T_end = 1e-8
cooling_rate = 0.9999

// Move sizes (adaptive)
translate_step = 0.01 to 0.0001
rotate_step = 5.0 to 0.1 degrees
```

### 2. Backward Propagation (BP)
Transfer solutions from N to N-1:
- For each N from 200 down to 2
- Try removing each tree that touches the bounding box
- Keep if resulting (N-1) config is better than stored
- Iterate: SA → BP → SA → BP

```python
for n in range(200, 1, -1):
    for tree_to_remove in get_bbox_touching_trees(config[n]):
        candidate = remove_tree(config[n], tree_to_remove)
        if score(candidate) < score(config[n-1]):
            config[n-1] = candidate
```

### 3. Squeeze and Compaction
- **Squeeze**: Scale all trees towards center until overlap
- **Compaction**: Move individual trees towards center
- **Local search**: 8-directional moves + rotation adjustments

### 4. Fix Direction (Rotation Tightening)
- Rotate entire configuration to minimize bounding box
- Use scipy.optimize.minimize_scalar on convex hull
- Apply after SA optimization

### 5. Advanced bbox3 Features
- Complex number vector coordination for moves
- Fluid dynamics simulation for tree flow
- Hinge pivot moves for boundary trees
- Density gradient flow towards center
- Global boundary tension
- Aggressive overlap repair with separation vectors

## Critical Insights from Discussions

### Small N Values (1-20) Have Most Room for Improvement
- N=1 contributes 0.66 to score (highest single contribution)
- N=1 efficiency: 1.51 (worst), N=200 efficiency: 2.96 (best)
- Focus optimization effort on small N
- For N=1: optimal angle is 45° (minimizes bounding box)

### Asymmetric Solutions Outperform Symmetric
- Top teams use asymmetric configurations
- Don't assume symmetry is optimal
- Try random perturbations to break symmetry

### Tessellations/Lattice for Large N
- For N > 100, consider grid-based placement
- Start with 2 base trees, translate in x/y directions
- Can achieve tighter bounds than random optimization

## Recommended Experiment Strategy

### Experiment 1: Baseline from Best Snapshot
1. Copy best pre-optimized submission
2. Verify score matches 70.659437
3. Visualize a few N values to understand current state

### Experiment 2: Extended SA Optimization
1. Compile tree_packer_v21.cpp with OpenMP
2. Run with high parameters: -n 100000 -r 256
3. Use all 26 threads: `export OMP_NUM_THREADS=26`
4. Run for several hours (4-8 hours)
5. Apply fix_direction after each major improvement

### Experiment 3: Focus on Small N (1-20)
1. Extract N=1-20 configurations
2. Run exhaustive angle search for N=1 (0° to 360° in 0.001° steps)
3. For N=2-5: try all angle combinations in 1° increments
4. Apply much longer SA runs specifically for N=1-20
5. Use constraint programming (OR-Tools) for N=2-5

### Experiment 4: Lattice Approach for Large N
1. For N=100, 144, 196, 200 try grid-based placement
2. Optimize base configuration and translation vectors
3. Compare with SA results
4. Hybrid: use lattice as starting point, then SA

### Experiment 5: Novel Approaches
- **Tabu search**: Maintain list of recently visited solutions to force exploration
- **Differential evolution**: Population-based optimization
- **Genetic algorithm**: Crossover of tree positions/angles between good solutions
- **Basin hopping**: Random perturbation + local optimization

## Technical Implementation Notes

### C++ Compilation
```bash
g++ -O3 -march=native -std=c++17 -fopenmp -o tree_packer tree_packer.cpp
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=26
./tree_packer -n 100000 -r 256
```

### Submission Format
- Values prefixed with 's': `s0.123456789012345678`
- Columns: id, x, y, deg
- id format: `NNN_T` where NNN is tree count (001-200), T is tree index

### Tree Geometry (15 vertices)
```python
TX = [0, 0.125, 0.0625, 0.2, 0.1, 0.35, 0.075, 0.075, -0.075, -0.075, -0.35, -0.1, -0.2, -0.0625, -0.125]
TY = [0.8, 0.5, 0.5, 0.25, 0.25, 0, 0, -0.2, -0.2, 0, 0, 0.25, 0.25, 0.5, 0.5]
```

### Overlap Detection
- Use Shapely for Python, custom polygon intersection for C++
- Check both point-in-polygon and edge intersection
- Bounding box pre-filter for efficiency
- Use STRtree for O(n log n) overlap checking

### Precision
- Use Decimal or long double for coordinates
- Scale factor: 1e15 for Decimal operations
- Round to 15+ decimal places
- Avoid floating-point accumulation errors

### Overlap Repair
When overlaps detected after optimization:
```python
def repair_overlaps(submission, donor_file):
    for n in range(1, 201):
        if has_overlap(submission, n):
            replace_config(submission, donor_file, n)
```

## What NOT to Try
- Short optimization runs (< 1 hour) - won't escape local optima
- Simple ensemble of existing solutions - one source dominates
- Micro-optimizing already-optimized submissions with same algorithm
- Assuming symmetry is optimal
- Python-based optimization (too slow, use C++)

## Validation
- Calculate score locally before submission
- Check for overlaps using Shapely
- Verify all 200 N values are present
- Ensure coordinates within [-100, 100]

## Gap Analysis
To close the 1.74 point gap (2.5%):
- Required uniform score reduction: 2.46%
- Required uniform side reduction: 1.24%
- Alternative: 21.6% reduction in N=1-20 only
- Or: 9.14% reduction in N=1-50 only

**Focus on small N values for maximum impact!**
