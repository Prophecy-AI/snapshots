    "1. **Current score**: 70.675510, gap to target is 1.75 points\n",
    "2. **Worst N values**: N=1, N=2, N=3 contribute most to the score\n",
    "3. **jiweiliu kernel techniques**:\n",
    "   - Grid-based initialization generates NOVEL configurations\n",
    "   - Deletion cascade propagates good large configs to smaller sizes\n",
    "   - Claims ~0.15 improvement in under 2 minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recommended Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **IMPLEMENT jiweiliu deletion cascade** - This is the highest priority\n",
    "2. **IMPLEMENT grid-based initialization with SA** - Generates novel solutions\n",
    "3. **IMPLEMENT guided refinement from sacuscreed** - Iterative improvement\n",
    "\n",
    "The target of 68.92 is BELOW the current #1 on the leaderboard (71.19). This means we need to GENERATE fundamentally new solutions, not just optimize existing ones."
