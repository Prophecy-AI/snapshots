In this context, we introduce the Python package High-Throughput Organic Crystal Structure Prediction (HTOCSP), which enables the prediction and screening of crystal packing for small organic molecules in an automated, high-throughput manner. Specifically, we describe the workflow, which encompasses molecular analysis, force field generation, and crystal generation and sampling, all within customized constraints based on user input. We demonstrate the application of HTOCSP by systematically screening organic crystals for 100 molecules using different sampling strategies and force field options. Furthermore, we analyze the benchmark results to understand the underlying factors that may influence the complexity of the crystal energy landscape. Finally, we discuss the current limitations of the package and potential future extensions.\n## I. Introduction\nMolecular solids, referring to substances consisting of discrete molecules that are held together by relatively weak intermolecular forces, have been extensively used in chemical,[1\u20134](#cit1)pharmaceutical[5](#cit5)and semiconductor industries.[6\u20138](#cit6)In these fields, the development of new organic materials with targeted properties relies heavily on understanding and controlling intermolecular interactions within the crystal structure.\nNowadays, data-driven computer simulation has been playing an increasingly important role in materials development.[9](#cit9)Specifically, computational high-throughput screening of the existing organic crystals has become popular for the design of new materials with improved physical properties.[10\u201315](#cit10)However, most of the screening work has been limited by the availability of experimentally resolved structures. It has been found that crystal polymorphism can effectively modify the physical properties.[16,17](#cit16)Nevertheless, to experimentally synthesize new polymorphs and characterize their structural properties is rather time-demanding and expensive. From a practical standpoint, having the capability to screen likely organic crystal formations before laboratory synthesis and characterization would be highly valuable.[18](#cit18)\nIn the past decade, there has been rapid development in the community of crystal structure prediction (CSP) for small organic molecules.[19\u201324](#cit19)The idea of CSP is to predict a short list of stable or metastable crystal packings that are likely to be observed in the experiment through powerful structure exploratory algorithms.[25\u201328](#cit25)Practically speaking, conducting a successful organic crystal prediction requires the integration of several different computational pipelines including force field generation, structure sampling and post-process energy ranking. Most practitioners rely on subscriptions to commercial licenses to run simulations and analyze the results. Due to the license restriction, it is often hard to reproduce previously published results, even for an experienced researcher.\nIn the field of CSP for inorganic materials, there have been plenty of code choices (e.g., USPEX,[29](#cit29)AIRSS,[30](#cit30)CALYPSO,[31](#cit31)XtalOpt,[32](#cit32)and GASP[33](#cit33)) that are either completely open source or free for academic researchers. The availability of these tools has enabled significant progress in the field, allowing researchers to explore complex systems and improve their understanding of inorganic material behavior at a fundamental level.[25](#cit25)While the field of CSP has been progressing rapidly, the code choices[29,34,35](#cit29)for the prediction of organic materials are still limited. More importantly, to the best of our knowledge, there is currently no open-source CSP code specifically designed for the high-throughput prediction of organic crystals. As organic crystals are increasingly relevant in fields like pharmaceuticals, organic electronics, and molecular materials, the development of such tools is becoming ever more critical to support the growing demand for rapid and accurate crystal structure prediction.\nTo promote the open-source activity in organic CSP, we have developed an open source code High-Throughput Organic Crystal Structure Prediction (HTOCSP) that allows the automated prediction of organic crystal structures with a minimal input, by leveraging several existing open-source infrastructures[36\u201340](#cit36)in molecular modeling. In the following section, we will begin by detailing the workflow, covering molecular analysis, force field generation, and crystal sampling. This will be followed by a benchmark study on 100 molecules, utilizing different sampling strategies and force field options. Finally, we will analyze the test results and conclude with a discussion of the current limitations and potential future extensions.\n## II. The HTOCSP workflow\nIn practical crystal structure prediction, the most common objective is to generate a shortlist of plausible crystal packings for a given molecular system. To address this challenge, multiple computational pipelines are often required to manage the system at both the molecular and crystal levels. In HTOCSP, we divide the entire crystal structure prediction process into six sequential tasks, as illustrated in[Fig. 1](#imgfig1).\n[![image file: d4dd00264d-f1.tif](https://pubs.rsc.org/image/article/2025/DD/d4dd00264d/d4dd00264d-f1.gif)](https://pubs.rsc.org/image/article/2025/DD/d4dd00264d/d4dd00264d-f1_hi-res.gif)|\n|**Fig. 1**The overview of the HTOCSP workflow.||\n### A Molecular analyzer\nIn organic chemistry, the most common way to represent a molecule is by using the SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) string. SMILES strings use standard ASCII characters to denote atoms and bonds in a molecule. In HTOCSP, we utilize the RDKit library[38](#cit38)to convert a SMILES string into 3D coordinates and analyze the flexible dihedral angles in the input molecule. For multicom...",

      "text": "- How PyXtal Works\n- [View page source](https://pyxtal.readthedocs.io/_sources/Algorithm.rst.txt)\n\n# How PyXtal Works [\uf0c1](https://pyxtal.readthedocs.io/pyxtal.readthedocs.io\\#how-pyxtal-works)\n\nPyXtal is a free, open source Python package intended to aid with crystal structure prediction and other purposes of crystal symmetry analysis. It is our aim to make our tools and theory freely available, in order to expand the knowledge and utilization of crystallographic symmetry. To this end, we outline the basic algorithms used by PyXtal. For more general information about crystallography, see the [Background and Theory](https://pyxtal.readthedocs.io/Background.html) page.\n\n## Overview [\uf0c1](https://pyxtal.readthedocs.io/pyxtal.readthedocs.io\\#overview)\n\nIn order to generate random symmetrical crystals, PyXtal uses space groups and their Wyckoff positions as templates, then **inserts atoms (or molecules) one Wyckoff position at a time, until the desired stoichiometry is reached**. This ensures that the correct symmetry will be obtained, without the need to adjust atomic positions. Along the way, it checks that the atoms are sufficiently far apart. To generate a single random crystal, PyXtal performs roughly seven steps:\n\nPyXtal Structure Generation Flowchart. [\uf0c1](https://pyxtal.readthedocs.io/pyxtal.readthedocs.io#id3)\n\n1. Get the input parameters from the user.\n\n2. Check the compatibility of the stoichiometry with the space group.\n\n\n1. Generate a random lattice consistent with the space group.\n\n\n1. Begin placing atoms into Wyckoff positions, one atomic specie at a time.\n\n\n1. Check that the atoms in the single Wyckoff position are not too close together. If the minimum distance is smaller than some tolerance (based on the atomic species), then we merge the Wyckoff position into a smaller special position.\n\n\n1. Check the inter-atomic distance between the newly generated Wyckoff position and the previously generated positions. If the distances are too close, we choose a new generating point within the same original Wyckoff position. For molecular crystals, we also attempt to reorient the molecule, so as to reduce the distance between atoms.\n\n2. Continue to place Wyckoff positions and species into the crystal, until the proper stoichiometry is reached. If any step between 3-6 fails, we repeat it, up to a pre-determined maximum number of attempts.\n\n\nIf the generation succeeds, the resulting crystal can be (energetically) optimized and compared with other possible structures. After many attempts, the lowest-energy structure will be the one most likely to exist at the specified conditions. This can be used, for example, to determine the phase diagram of a solid without the need to perform any experiments.\n\nNext, we explain the steps listed above in greater detail.\n\n## User Input [\uf0c1](https://pyxtal.readthedocs.io/pyxtal.readthedocs.io\\#user-input)\n\nThis includes the crystal\u2019s stoichiometry, space group, and volume factor. Optionally, the desired lattice and allowed inter-atomic distances can also be defined (which is useful for testing at higher pressures). Otherwise, these parameters will be chosen automatically.\n\n## Checking Compatibility [\uf0c1](https://pyxtal.readthedocs.io/pyxtal.readthedocs.io\\#checking-compatibility)\n\nBefore attempting to generate a structure, PyXtal must make sure it is possible to do so. The WP\u2019s in different space groups have different multiplicities. As a result, not every number of atoms is compatible with every space group. For example, consider the space group `Pn-3n (222)`.\n\n```\n$ pyxtal_symmetry -s 222\n\n-- Space group # 222 (Pn-3n)--\n48i site symm: 1\n...\n...\n...\n6b site symm: 42 . 2\n  3/4, 1/4, 1/4\n  1/4, 3/4, 1/4\n  1/4, 1/4, 3/4\n  1/4, 3/4, 3/4\n  3/4, 1/4, 3/4\n  3/4, 3/4, 1/4\n2a site symm: 4 3 2\n  1/4, 1/4, 1/4\n  3/4, 3/4, 3/4\n\n```\n\nThe smallest Wyckoff position is `2a`, with the next smallest being `6b`. It is impossible to create a crystal with 4 atoms in the unit cell for this symmetry group, because no combination of Wyckoff positions adds up to 4. The position `2a` cannot be repeated, because it falls on the exact coordinates `(1/4, 1/4, 1/4)` and `(3/4, 3/4, 3/4)`. A second set of atoms in the 2a position would overlap the atoms in the first position, but this is not physically possible.\n\nThus, it is necessary to check the input stoichiometry against the Wyckoff positions of the desired space group. To accomplish this, PyXtal iterates through all possible Wyckoff position combinations within the confines of the stoichiometry. As soon as one valid combination is found, the check returns `True`. If no valid combination is found, the check returns `False`, and the generation attempt fails with a warning.\n\nSome space groups allow valid combinations of WP\u2019s, but may not give many degrees of freedom for generation. It may also be the case that the allowed combinations result in atoms which are too close together. In these cases, PyXtal will attempt generation as usual: until the maximum limit is reached, or until a successful generation occurs. If generation repeatedly fails for a given combination of space group and stoichiometry, the user should make note and avoid the combination going forward.\n\n## Lattice Generation [\uf0c1](https://pyxtal.readthedocs.io/pyxtal.readthedocs.io\\#lattice-generation)\n\nThe first step in PyXtal\u2019s structure generation is the choice of unit cell. Depending on the symmetry group, a specific type of lattice must be generated. For all crystals, the conventional cell choice is used to avoid ambiguity. The most general case is the triclinic cell, from which other cell types can be obtained by applying various constraints.\n\nTo generate a triclinic cell, 3 real numbers are randomly chosen (using a Gaussian distribution centered at 0) as the off-diagonal values for a 3x3 shear matrix. Treating this matrix as a cell matrix, one obtains 3 lattice angles. For the lattice vector lengths, a random 3-vector between (0, 0, 0) and (1, 1, 1) is chosen (using a Gaussian distribution centered at (0.5, 0.5, 0.5)). The relative values of the x, y, and z coordinates are used for a, b, and c respectively, and scaled based on the required volume.\n\nFor other cell types, any free parameters are obtained using the same methods as for the triclinic case, along with any necessary constraints. In the tetragonal case, for example, all angles must be 90 degrees. Thus, only a random vector is needed to generate the lattice constants.\n\nFor molecular crystals, the issue of generating the lattice is also dependent on molecular orientation. Thus, the lattice must be checked for every molecule in the crystal. To do this, the atoms in the original molecule are checked against the atoms in periodically translated copies of the molecule. Here, standard atom-atom distance checking is used.\n\n## Generation of Wyckoff Positions [\uf0c1](https://pyxtal.readthedocs.io/pyxtal.readthedocs.io\\#generation-of-wyckoff-positions)\n\nThe central building block for crystals in PyXtal is the Wyckoff position (WP). Once a space group and lattice are chosen, WP\u2019s are inserted one at a time to add structure.\n\nPyXtal starts with the largest available WP, which is the general position of the space group. If the number of atoms required is equal to or greater than the size of the general position, the algorithm proceeds. If fewer atoms are needed, the next largest WP (or set of WP\u2019s) is chosen, in order of descending multiplicity. This is done to ensure that larger positions are preferred over smaller ones; this reflects the greater prevalence of larger multiplicities both statistically and in nature.\n\n## Checking Inter-atomic Distances [\uf0c1](https://pyxtal.readthedocs.io/pyxtal.readthedocs.io\\#checking-inter-atomic-distances)\n\nTo produce structures with realistic bonds and bond lengths, the generated atoms should not be too close together. In PyXtal this means that by default, two atoms should be no closer than the covalent bond length between them. However, for a given applicat...",

Efficiently solving this problem has implications ranging from pharmaceuticals to organic semiconductors, as crystal packing directly governs the physical and chemical properties of organic solids. In this paper, we introduce $\\\\textrm{OXtal}$, a large-scale $100\\\\textrm{M}$ parameter all-atom diffusion model that directly learns the conditional joint distribution over intramolecular conformations and periodic packing. To efficiently scale $\\\\textrm{OXtal}$, we abandon explicit equivariant architectures imposing inductive bias arising from crystal symmetries in favor of data augmentation strategies. We further propose a novel crystallization-inspired lattice-free training scheme, $\\\\textit{Stoichiometric Stochastic Shell Sampling}$ ($S^4$), that efficiently captures long-range interactions while sidestepping explicit lattice parametrization---thus enabling more scalable architectural choices at all-atom resolution. Trained on $600 \\\\text{K}$ experimentally validated crystal structures (including rigid and flexible molecules, co-crystals, and solvates), $\\\\textrm{OXtal}$ achieves orders-of-magnitude improvements over prior $\\\\textit{ab-initio}$ ML CSP methods, which remaining orders of magnitude cheaper than traditional quantum-chemical approaches. Specifically, $\\\\textrm{OXtal}$\nreproduces experimental structures with conformer $\\\\mathrm{RMSD}\\_1&lt;&lt;0.5$ \u00c5and attains\nover 80\\\\% lattice-match success, demonstrating its ability to model both thermodynamic and kinetic regularities of molecular crystallization.\n**Primary Area:**applications to physical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, etc.)\n**Submission Number:**17588\nLoading\n[OpenReview](https://openreview.net/about)is a long-term project to advance science through improved peer review with legal nonprofit status.

It is a fundamental concept in general chemistry and materials science, playing a crucial role in determining the physical and chemical properties of materials. Understanding packing efficiency is essential for predicting and optimizing material properties, such as density, strength, and conductivity.\nOverview of Different Packing Types: FCC, BCC, and More\nThere are several types of packing arrangements, each with its unique characteristics and packing efficiency. The most common packing types are:\n * Face-Centered Cubic (FCC): In this arrangement, each atom is located at the corner of a cube and one atom is at the center of each face. The packing efficiency of FCC is approximately 74%.\n * Body-Centered Cubic (BCC): In this arrangement, each atom is located at the corner of a cube and one atom is at the center of the cube. The packing efficiency of BCC is approximately 68%.\n * Hexagonal Close-Packed (HCP): In this arrangement, each atom is surrounded by six neighboring atoms in a hexagonal pattern. The packing efficiency of HCP is approximately 74%.\nThe following diagram illustrates the different packing types:\ngraph LR;\n A[\"FCC\"] -->|\"74%\"| B[\"Packing Efficiency\"];\n C[\"BCC\"] -->|\"68%\"| B;\n D[\"HCP\"] -->|\"74%\"| B;\nFactors Influencing Packing Efficiency\nSeveral factors can influence packing efficiency, including:\n * Atomic radius: The size of the atoms or molecules affects the packing efficiency.\n * Crystal structure: The arrangement of atoms or molecules in the crystal lattice determines the packing efficiency.\n * Temperature and pressure: Changes in temperature and pressure can alter the packing efficiency.\n * Impurities: The presence of impurities can disrupt the packing arrangement and affect the packing efficiency.\nPacking Efficiency Calculations\nDetailed Steps for Calculating Packing Efficiency\nTo calculate packing efficiency, follow these steps:\n 1. Determine the number of atoms per unit cell.\n 2. Calculate the volume of the atoms in the unit cell.\n 3. Calculate the volume of the unit cell.\n 4. Divide the volume of the atoms by the volume of the unit cell to obtain the packing efficiency.\nThe packing efficiency can be calculated using the following formula:\n\\[ \\text{Packing Efficiency} = \\frac{\\text{Volume of atoms in unit cell}}{\\text{Volume of unit cell}} \\times 100% \\]\nExamples of Packing Efficiency Calculations for Various Crystal Structures\nLet's consider a few examples:\n * For an FCC structure with a lattice parameter $a$, the packing efficiency is calculated as follows:\n 1. Number of atoms per unit cell = 4.\n 2. Volume of atoms = _USD_4 \\times \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$, where $r$ is the atomic radius.\n 3. Volume of unit cell = $a^3 = (2\\sqrt{2}r)^3$.\n 4. Packing efficiency = $\\frac{4 \\times \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3}{(2\\sqrt{2}r)^3} \\times 100% \\approx 74%$.\n * For a BCC structure with a lattice parameter $a$, the packing efficiency is calculated as follows:\n 1. Number of atoms per unit cell = 2.\n 2. Volume of atoms = _USD_2 \\times \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$.\n 3. Volume of unit cell = $a^3 = (\\frac{4r}{\\sqrt{3}})^3$.\n 4. Packing efficiency = $\\frac{2 \\times \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3}{(\\frac{4r}{\\sqrt{3}})^3} \\times 100% \\approx 68%$.\nTips for Avoiding Common Errors in Packing Efficiency Calculations\nTo ensure accurate packing efficiency calculations, be aware of the following common pitfalls:\n * Incorrectly determining the number of atoms per unit cell.\n * Using incorrect atomic radius or lattice parameter values.\n * Failing to account for the correct crystal structure.\nAdvanced Topics in Packing Efficiency\nThe Role of Packing Efficiency in Material Properties\nPacking efficiency plays a significant role in determining various material properties, such as:\n * Density: Higher packing efficiency typically results in higher density.\n * Strength: Materials with higher packing efficiency tend to be stronger.\n * Conductivity: Packing efficiency can affect the electrical and thermal conductivity of materials.\nFor instance, materials with high packing efficiency, such as diamond, exhibit exceptional hardness and thermal conductivity due to their tightly packed crystal structure.\n\"The packing efficiency of a material is a critical factor in determining its properties and behavior.\" - [1]\nEmerging Trends and Research Directions in Packing Efficiency\nResearch in packing efficiency is ongoing, with a focus on:\n * Developing new materials with optimized packing efficiency for specific applications.\n * Investigating the effects of nano-scale packing efficiency on material properties.\n * Exploring the relationship between packing efficiency and material behavior under extreme conditions.\nThe study of packing efficiency continues to evolve, driving advancements in materials science and technology.\nReferences\n 1.

We expect a fun puzzle. We get a nightmare of Combinatorial Optimization.\nThis year\u2019s edition,**\u201cSanta 2025: The Christmas Tree Packing Challenge,\u201d**is no exception. The goal? Pack $N$ irregular \u201cTree Polygons\u201d into the smallest possible square bounding box for $N=1$ to $200$.\nIf you checked the leaderboard today (Dec 21), you noticed a trend:**Reinforcement Learning (RL) is getting crushed.**\nDespite the massive hype around \u201cReasoning Models\u201d and PPO agents this year, the top 100 teams aren\u2019t using neural networks. They are using 1980s physics simulations. Here is why the \u201cOld School\u201d is winning, and how the pros are using LLMs to cheat the system.\n## The Problem: Why RL Hates \u201cPacking\u201d\nOn paper, this looks like a game.*Place a tree, check for overlap, repeat.*Perfect for a DQN agent, right?\nWrong. The geometry kills the gradient.\n1. **Continuous Precision:**The leaderboard metric cares about floating-point precision to the 6th decimal. RL agents (which output discrete actions or probability distributions) struggle to make the \u201cmicro-adjustments\u201d needed to squeeze a tree into a 0.001mm gap.\n2. **The \u201cCollision\u201d Cliff:**In packing, a move is either valid (reward = 1) or it overlaps by a pixel (reward = -100). This sparse, binary feedback loop makes it nearly impossible for an agent to \u201clearn\u201d a gradient. It doesn\u2019t know*how*to fix the overlap, just that it failed.## The Solution: Simulated Annealing (on Steroids)\nThe \u201cSecret Sauce\u201d currently dominating the leaderboard is**Simulated Annealing (SA)**combined with**Lattice Generation**.\nInstead of training a model to*predict*the position, teams are writing physics engines that*shake*the box.\n* **High Temperature:**Randomly spin and throw trees into the box (Explorer Phase).\n* **Low Temperature:**Jiggle the trees by microscopic amounts to resolve collisions (Exploiter Phase).\nThe best solutions right now use a \u201cHybrid\u201d strategy:\n* **N &lt; 58:**Use Simulated Annealing to find unstructured, chaotic packings.\n* **N &gt; 58:**Switch to \u201cCrystalline Packing\u201d (regular geometric lattices) which is mathematically superior for large numbers.## The Twist: How LLMs are Actually Helping\nIf RL is dead, where is the AI?\nTop competitors aren\u2019t using LLMs to*solve*the puzzle; they are using LLMs to**write the solver**.\nPython is too slow for 10 billion annealing steps. The meta this year is to prompt Gemini 3 or Claude to:\n\u201cRewrite this Python overlap-check function in Rust/C++ with AVX2 vectorization.\u201d\nWe are seeing \u201cHybrid\u201d workflows where the**Human**defines the heuristics, the**LLM**writes the highly optimized C++ kernels, and**Simulated Annealing**does the heavy lifting.\n## The Starter Code: A Simple Annealer\nIf you want to jump in before the January deadline, don\u2019t start with PyTorch. Start here.\nHere is a conceptual snippet for a \u201cPerturbation\u201d mover \u2014the heart of any good annealing solution.\n```\nimport numpy as np\nimport math\ndef anneal(layout, max\\_temps=10000):\n# layout: Array of [x, y, rotation] for N trees\ncurrent\\_score = calculate\\_area(layout)\ntemperature = 1.0\ncooling\\_rate = 0.9995\nfor i in range(max\\_temps):\n# 1.

From energy storage and conversion to electronics and catalysis, progress in these areas relies on materials with well-designed properties. A key step in this process is the computational design and characterization of stable or metastable crystal structures, which can then be prioritized for experimental synthesis and testing. This principle, called materials screening, is central in today\u2019s materials discovery.\nOne of the earliest problems in this context is enumerating plausible crystal structures for a given chemical formula. Traditionally, this task\u2014known as crystal structure prediction (CSP)\u2014used methods to explore the potential energy surface to identify global low-energy configurations. Techniques such as genetic algorithms (USPEX[4](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-025-01881-2#ref-CR4),[5](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-025-01881-2#ref-CR5), random search[6](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-025-01881-2#ref-CR6)), particle swarm optimization (CALYPSO[7](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-025-01881-2#ref-CR7)), and minima hopping[8](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-025-01881-2#ref-CR8)have been widely used to navigate this complex landscape, iteratively refining candidate structures by evaluating their energies. These approaches mimic natural processes and have successfully enabled the design of novel materials[9](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-025-01881-2#ref-CR9),[10](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-025-01881-2#ref-CR10).\nHowever, CSP methods should be distinguished from fully generative approaches. The former traditionally start from a predefined chemical composition and often a specified number of atoms per unit cell. Moreover, they are typically based on an iterative screening process where each candidate structure must undergo an explicit energy calculation. This step is computationally expensive, particularly with high-accuracy methods. Furthermore, the search space in CSP grows exponentially with system size, posing a significant combinatorial challenge.\nIn contrast, generative methods from artificial intelligence learn the underlying data distribution and chemical rules from large crystal structure databases. Consequently, they can directly suggest novel and plausible crystal structures without a priori constraints on chemistry or stoichiometry. This bypasses the computationally intensive search and initial energy evaluation steps inherent to CSP. Moreover, many generative models can be conditioned on specific target properties, enabling a more direct and efficient path to discovering materials with desired characteristics.\nThis represents a paradigm shift for materials discovery and design. Historically, discovery was driven by empirical trial-and-error methods, as illustrated by Edison\u2019s search for light bulb filaments. Over time, the field has evolved from heuristic approaches to theory-guided synthesis and high-throughput computational screening. Today, generative AI enables proactive material generation, prioritizing candidates in silico before experimental validation.\nA number of recent reviews and perspectives have surveyed the broader landscape of inverse and generative design methods in materials science[11](#ref-CR11),[12](#ref-CR12),[13](#ref-CR13),[14](#ref-CR14),[15](#ref-CR15),[16](#ref-CR16),[17](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-025-01881-2#ref-CR17). This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of recent developments in generative models for inorganic crystalline materials. We focus on the design and architecture of these models, their representations, and their ability to incorporate constraints through conditioning. We emphasize that this review is limited to in silico approaches for generating crystal structures, suc...",
