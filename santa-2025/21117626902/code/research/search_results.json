One particular category of these packing problems is\ntwo-dimensional packing, which is encountered in everyday scenarios like arranging items\non a shelf and in industrial applications such as cutting cookies from rolled-out dough\nor manufacturing sets of tiles from standard-sized panels made of wood, glass, or metal.\nAnother intriguing example involves cutting fabric pieces for clothing production. In this\ncase, the pieces often cannot be rotated freely, as they must adhere to a desired pattern\nin the final product, which is tailored of multiple elements. The widespread applicability\nof two-dimensional packing problems has led to a surge of interest in designing efficient\nalgorithms to address them. In this paper, we follow the line of research and study the\nproblem of packing convex polygons without rotations in various settings depending on the\ntype of containers used.\nPast research focusing on theoretical considerations of two-dimensional packings mainly\nconcentrates on the scenario when all objects are axis-parallel rectangles. In this paper, we\nwill discuss packing without rotations, in which only translations are permitted. There are\ntwo main classes of the problem depending on whether the size of the container is fixed and\nwe want to minimize the number of containers used or whether we want to minimize the\ncontainer\u2019s size with respect to some objective function.\nA seminal example of the first class is the Geometric Bin Packing problem in which\na number of unit size squared bins to pack is to be minimized. The problem is arguably\nthe most natural generalization of the regular (1D) Bin Packing to two dimensions, and\nits absolute approximability has been fully understood. Unless P = N P, the best possible\nefficient constant factor approximation is 2 [15], and such an algorithm is known [10].\nIn the second class, there are several variants to be considered. An example is the\nStrip Packing Problem which is concerned with packing objects into a strip of width\n1 and infinite height in such a way that the maximum of all the heights of the placed\nobjects is minimized. Like Geometric Bin Packing, Strip Packing generalizes (1D)\nBin Packing. The best known efficient constant factor approximation for Strip Packing\nhas approximation factor (5/3 + \u03f5) [9]. It is known that there can not exist a polynomial\ntime algorithm with an approximation ratio of (3/2 \u2212 \u03f5) for any \u03f5 > 0 unless P = N P, which\nfollows directly from the approximation hardness of (1D) Bin Packing. Both classes of\nproblems have been also considered in the asymptotic setting, see e.g. [11, 5, 12].\nIn younger time, there was also an increase of interest in cases where the objects in\nquestion are general convex polygons. Alt, de Berg and Knauer [2, 3] considered the problem\nof packing an instance consisting of a number of convex polygons of the form p \u2282 [0, 1]2into\na minimum area axis-parallel rectangular container. We refer to this problem as Polygon\nArea Minimization throughout this paper. In the special case where the instance consists\nof rectangles only, the problem is known to admit a PTAS [4]. They proved the existence of\nthe following efficient algorithm:\nA 23.78-approximation for Polygon Area Minimization.\nRecently, Aamand, Abrahamsen, Beretta and Kleist [1] showed that the algorithm of Alt,\nde Berg and Knauer can be leveraged to obtain also efficient approximation algorithms of\nfurther problems:\nA 7-approximation for Polygon Perimeter Minimization.\nA 51-approximation for Polygon Strip Packing.\nAn 11-approximation for Polygon Bin Packing for polygons with diameter at most 1\n10 .\nA. Kurpisz and S. Suter 3\n1.1 Our results\nThe results of Alt, de Berg and Knauer [2, 3] and Aamand et al. [1] are heavily based on\nso-called shelf packing algorithms. In shelf packing algorithms, the objects are first placed\non the shelves, possibly ordered by height, which are later stacked on one another to build\na final solution. Compared to axis-parallel rectangles, the main challenge in designing an\napproximation algorithm for polygon packing problems is that objects cannot be sorted by\nheight and orientation simultaneously. As a result, the algorithm and its analysis in [2, 3]\nhave such a large approximation guarantee. In this paper, we provide new insight into how\nshelf packing algorithms should be applied to polygon packing problems. We introduce a\nsequence of transformations of the objects that allow us first to sort them by height and later\nby orientation to build a solution of a much better approximation guarantee. More precisely,\nwe design polynomial-time algorithms with the following factors:\nA 9.45-approximation for Polygon Area Minimization.\nUsing this algorithm as a subroutine, we build upon the methods from Aamand et al. [1] to\nobtain the following efficient approximation algorithms:\nA (3.75 + \u03f5)-approximation for Polygon Perimeter Minimization.\nA 21.89-approximation for Polygon Strip Packing.\nA 5.09-approximation for Polygon Bin Packing for polygons which have their diameter\nbounded by 1\n10 .\nThe results are proved in Sections 4, 5, 6, and 7 respectively. Furthermore, in Section 8\nwe show the following results, which make progress towards solving an open question of a\nO(1)-approximation algorithm for Polygon Bin Packing for arbitrary polygons.\nThere is an efficient O(\n1\n\u03b4\n)-approximation algorithm for Polygon Bin Packing for\ninstances where each polygon has width or height at most 1 \u2212 \u03b4.\nThere is an efficient O(1)-approximation algorithm for Polygon Bin Packing for\ninstances with the property that all polygons share a spine (up to translation) with height\nat least 3\n4\n.\n2 Preliminaries\nWe start out considerations by recalling a classical and well-known problem in theoretical\ncomputer science, the Bin Packing problem: Given a list of numbers s1, . . . , sn \u2208 (0, 1] \u2229 Q,\nrepresenting the sizes of n objects, the goal is to find the minimum number of bins of size 1,\nso that we can pac...",

In*two-dimensional bin packing problems*these units are finite rectangles, and the objective is to pack all the items into the minimum number of units, while in*two-dimensional strip packing problems*there is a single standardized unit of given width, and the objective is to pack all the items within the minimum height. We discuss mathematical models, and survey lower bounds, classical approximation algorithms, recent heuristic and metaheuristic methods and exact enumerative approaches. The relevant special cases where the items have to be packed into rows forming levels are also discussed in detail.\n## Introduction\nIn several industrial applications one is required to allocate a set of rectangular items to larger rectangular standardized stock units by minimizing the waste. In wood or glass industries, rectangular components have to be cut from large sheets of material. In warehousing contexts, goods have to be placed on shelves. In newspapers paging, articles and advertisements have to be arranged in pages. In these applications, the standardized stock units are rectangles, and a common objective function is to pack all the requested items into the minimum number of units: the resulting optimization problems are known in the literature as two-dimensional bin packing problems. In other contexts, such as paper or cloth industries, we have instead a single standardized unit (a roll of material), and the objective is to obtain the items by using the minimum roll length: the problems are then referred to as two-dimensional strip packing problems. As we will see in the following, the two problems have a strict relation in almost all algorithmic approaches to their solution.\nMost of the contributions in the literature are devoted to the case where the items to be packed have a fixed orientation with respect to the stock unit(s), i.e., one is not allowed to rotate them. This case, which is the object of the present article, reflects a number of practical contexts, such as the cutting of corrugated or decorated material (wood, glass, cloth industries), or the newspapers paging. For variants allowing rotations (usually by 90\u00b0) and/or constraints on the items placement (such as the \u201cguillotine cuts\u201d), the reader is referred to Lodi et al. [41], [42], where a three-field classification of the area is also introduced. General surveys on cutting and packing problems can be found in Dyckhoff and Finke [17], Dowsland and Dowsland [16] and Dyckhoff et al. [18]. Results on the probabilistic analysis of packing algorithms can be found in Coffman and Shor [12] and Coffman and Lueker [11].\nLet us introduce the problems in a more formal way. We are given a set of*n*rectangular*items**j*\u2208*J*={1,\u2026,*n*}, each defined by a*width*,*w**j*, and a*height*,*h**j*:\n* (i)\nin the*Two-Dimensional Bin Packing Problem*(2BP), we are further given an unlimited number of identical rectangular*bins*of width*W*and height*H*, and the objective is to allocate all the items to the minimum number of bins;\n* (ii)\nin the*Two-Dimensional Strip Packing Problem*(2SP), we are further given a bin of width*W*and infinite height (hereafter called*strip*), and the objective is to allocate all the items to the strip by minimizing the height to which the strip is used.\nIn both cases, the items have to be packed with their*w*-edges parallel to the*W*-edge of the bins (or strip). We will assume, with no loss of generality, that all input data are positive integers, and that*w**j*\u2a7d*W*and*h**j*\u2a7d*H*(*j*=1,\u2026,*n*).\nBoth problems are strongly NP-hard, as is easily seen by transformation from the strongly NP-hard (one-dimensional)*Bin Packing Problem*(1BP), in which*n*items, each having an associated size*h**j*, have to be partitioned into the minimum number of subsets so that the sum of the sizes in each subset does not exceed a given capacity*H*.\nA third relevant case of rectangle packing is the following. Each item*j*has an associated profit*p**j*&gt;0, and the problem is to select a subset of items, to be packed in a single finite bin, which maximizes the total selected profit. This problem is usually denoted as (*Two-Dimensional*)*Cutting Stock*, although it had been introduced by Gilmore and Gomory [29] as (*Two-Dimensional*)*Cutting Knapsack*.\nIn this survey we concentrate on two-dimensional problems in which all items have to be packed, i.e., on 2SP and 2BP. The reader is referred to Dyckhoff et al. [18, Section 5] for an annotated bibliography on two-dimensional cutting stock problems. For both 2SP and 2BP, we also consider the special case where the items have to be packed into rows forming levels.\nIn Section 2 we discuss mathematical models for the various problems introduced above. In Section 3 we survey classical approximation algorithms as well as more recent heuristic and metaheuristic methods. In Section 4 we introduce lower bounding techniques, while in Section 5 we describe exact enumerative approaches.\n## Section snippets\n## Modeling two-dimensional problems\nThe first attempt to model two-dimensional packing problems was made by Gilmore and Gomory [29], through an extension of their approach to 1BP (see [27], [28]). They proposed a column generation approach (see [53] for a recent survey) based on the enumeration of all subsets of items (*patterns*) that can be packed into a single bin. Let*A**j*be a binary column vector of*n*elements*a**ij*(*i*=1,\u2026,*n*) taking the value 1 if item*i*belongs to the*j*th pattern, and the value 0 otherwise.

      "text": "New Improvements in Optimal Rectangle Packing\nEric Huang and Richard E. Korf\nComputer Science Department\nUniversity of California, Los Angeles\nLos Angeles, CA 90095\nehuang@cs.ucla.edu, korf@cs.ucla.edu\nAbstract\nThe rectangle packing problem consists of find\u0002ing an enclosing rectangle of smallest area that can\ncontain a given set of rectangles without overlap.\nOur algorithm picks the x-coordinates of all the\nrectangles before picking any of the y-coordinates.\nFor the x-coordinates, we present a dynamic vari\u0002able ordering heuristic and an adaptation of a prun\u0002ing algorithm used in previous solvers. We then\ntransform the rectangle packing problem into a per\u0002fect packing problem that has no empty space, and\npresent inference rules to reduce the instance size.\nFor the y-coordinates we search a space that models\nempty positions as variables and rectangles as val\u0002ues. Our solver is over 19 times faster than the pre\u0002vious state-of-the-art on the largest problem solved\nto date, allowing us to extend the known solutions\nfor a consecutive-square packing benchmark from\nN=27 to N=32.\n1 Introduction\nGiven a set of rectangles, our problem is to find all enclosing\nrectangles of minimum area that will contain them without\noverlap. We refer to an enclosing rectangle as a bounding\nbox. The optimization problem is NP-hard, while the prob\u0002lem of deciding whether a set of rectangles can be packed in\na given bounding box is NP-complete, via a reduction from\nbin-packing [Korf, 2003]. The consecutive-square packing\nbenchmark is a simple set of increasingly difficult bench\u0002marks for this problem, where the task is to find the bounding\nboxes of minimum area that contain a set of squares of sizes\n1x1, 2x2, ..., up to NxN [Korf, 2003]. For example, Figure 1\nis an optimal solution for N=32. We use this benchmark here\nbut none of the techniques introduced in this paper are spe\u0002cific to packing squares as opposed to rectangles.\nRectangle packing has many practical applications. It ap\u0002pears when loading a set of rectangular objects on a pallet\nwithout stacking them, and also in VLSI design where rect\u0002angular circuit components must be packed onto a rectangu\u0002lar chip. Various other cutting stock and layout problems also\nhave rectangle packing at their core.\nFigure 1: An optimal solution for N=32 with a bounding box\nof 85x135.\n511\n(a) Compulsory part of a 5x2 at\nx=[0,2]\n(b) Assigning a 4x2 to [0,2].\nFigure 2: Examples of compulsory parts and intervals.\n2 Previous Work\nKorf [2003] divided the rectangle packing problem into two\nsubproblems: the minimal bounding box problem and the\ncontainment problem. The former finds a bounding box of\nleast area that can contain a given set of rectangles, while the\nlatter tries to pack the given rectangles in a given bounding\nbox. The algorithm that solves the minimal bounding box\nproblem calls the algorithm that solves the containment prob\u0002lem as a subroutine.\n2.1 Minimal Bounding Box Problem\nA simple way to solve the minimal bounding box problem\nis to find the minimum and maximum areas that describe\nthe set of feasible and potentially optimal bounding boxes.\nBounding boxes of all dimensions can be generated with ar\u0002eas within this range, and then tested in non-decreasing order\nof area until all feasible solutions of smallest area are found.\nThe minimum area is the sum of the areas of the given rectan\u0002gles. The maximum area is determined by the bounding box\nof a greedy solution found by setting the bounding box height\nto that of the tallest rectangle, and then placing the rectangles\nin the first available position when scanning from left to right,\nand for each column scanning from bottom to top.\n2.2 Containment Problem\nKorf\u2019s [2003] absolute placement approach modeled rectan\u0002gles as variables and empty locations in the bounding box\nas values. Moffitt and Pollack\u2019s [2006] relative placement ap\u0002proach used a variable for every pair of rectangles to represent\nthe relations above, below, left, and right. Absolute place\u0002ment was faster than relative placement [Korf et al., 2009],\nwhich in turn was faster than the methods of Clautiaux et al.\n[2007] and Beldiceanu et al. [2008].\nSimonis and O\u2019Sullivan [2008] used Clautiaux et al.\u2019s\n[2007] variable order with additional constraints from\nBeldiceanu et al. [2008] to greatly outperform Korf et al.\u2019s\nsolver [2009]. They used Prolog\u2019s backtracking engine to\nsolve a set of constraints which they specified prior to the\nsearch effort. They first assigned the x-coordinates of all\nthe rectangles before any of the y-coordinates. Since we use\nsome of these ideas, we review them here.\nSimonis and O\u2019Sullivan [2008] used two sets of redundant\nvariables for the x-coordinates. The first set of N variables\ncorrespond to \u201cintervals\u201d where a rectangle is assigned an\ninterval of x-coordinates. Interval sizes are hand-picked for\neach rectangle prior to search, and they induce a smaller rect\u0002angle representing the common intersecting area of placing\nthe rectangle in any location in the interval [Beldiceanu et\nal., 2008]. Larger intervals result in weaker constraint prop\u0002agation (less pruning) but a smaller branching factor, while\nsmaller intervals result in stronger constraint propagation but\na larger branching factor.\nAs shown in Figure 2b, a 4x2 rectangle assigned an x\u0002interval of [0,2] consumes 2 units of area at each x-coordinate\nin [2,3], represented by the doubly-hatched area. This \u201ccom\u0002pulsory profile\u201d [Beldiceanu et al., 2008] is a constraint com\u0002mon to all positions x \u2208 [0, 2] of the original 4x2 rectan\u0002gle. If there were no feasible set of interval assignments, then\nthe constraint would save us from having to try individual x\u0002values. However, if we do find a set of interval assignments,\nthen we must search for a set of single x-coordinate val\u0002ues. Simonis and O\u2019Sullivan [2008] used a total of 4N vari\u0002ables, assigning (in order) x-intervals, single x-coordinates,\ny-intervals, and finally single y-coordinates.\n3 Overall Search Strategy\nWe separate the containment problem from the minimal\nbounding box problem, and use Korf et al.\u2019s [2009] al\u0002gorithm to solve the latter problem. Like Simonis and\nO\u2019Sullivan [2008], we assign all x-coordinates prior to any y\u0002coordinates, and use interval variables for the x-coordinates.\nWe set a rectangle\u2019s interval size to 0.35 times its width,\nwhich gave us the best performance. Finally, we do not use\ninterval variables for the y-coordinates. All of the remaining\nideas presented in this paper are our contributions.\nAlthough we use some ideas used by Simonis and\nO\u2019Sullivan [2008], we do not take a constraint programming\napproach in which all constraints are specified to a general\npurpose solver like Prolog, prior to the search effort. Instead,\nwe have implemented our program from scratch in C++, al\u0002lowing us to easily choose which constraints and inferences to\nuse at what time, and giving us more flexibility during search.\nFor example, as we will explain later, we make different in\u0002ferences depending on the partial solution.\nWe implemented a chronological backtracking algorithm\nwith dynamic variable ordering and forward checking. Our\nalgorithm works in three stages as it goes from the root of the\nsearch tree down to the leaves:\n1. It first works on the x-coordinates in a model where\nvariables are rectangles and values are x-coordinate lo\u0002cations, using dynamic variable ordering by area and a\nconstraint that detects infeasible subtrees.\n2. For each x-coordinate solution found, it conducts a per\u0002fect packing transformation, applies inference rules to\nreduce the transformed problem size, and derives conti\u0002guity constraints between rectangles.\n3. It then searches for a set of y-coordinates in a model\nwhere variables are empty corners and values are rect\u0002angles.\n4 Assigning X-Coordinates\nFor the x-coordinates, we propose a dynamic variable order\nand a constraint adapted from Korf\u2019s [2003] wasted-space\npruning heuristic. For a bounding box of size WxH we use\n512\nan array of size W representing the...",

Our approach is rather general, and many of our\ntechniques can be applied to packing non-rectangular shapes\nin non-rectangular enclosing regions, and higher-dimensional\npacking problems as well.\nIntroduction and Overview\nConsider the following very simple scheduling problem: We\nhave a set of independent jobs, each of which requires a cer\u0002tain number of workers for a certain amount of time. We as\u0002sume that the jobs are indivisible, meaning they can\u2019t be bro\u0002ken down into smaller subtasks. If they can be decomposed,\nwe break them down into their indivisible components, and\nthen consider the components as jobs. All workers work the\nsame hours, and are paid for their whole shift, whether they\nare busy or idle. We can adjust the number of workers, and\nthe total amount of time. We\u2019d like to minimize the total\nlabor cost to complete all the jobs, which is proportional to\nthe number of workers times the number of hours they are\nat work. Alternatively, we may want to complete all jobs as\nquickly as possible, using as many workers as necessary. As\nanother alternative, we may want to minimize the number of\nworkers, and complete all the jobs as soon as possible given\nthat number of workers. A closely related problem is how to\nschedule a set of tasks that require a certain resource level,\nsuch as electric power on a spacecraft, for a given amount\nCopyright \u0001c 2003, American Association for Artificial Intelli\u0002gence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved.\nof time, so that all tasks are completed as soon as possible\nwithout exceeding a maximum resource capacity.\nWe can model these problems as rectangle-packing prob\u0002lems. Each job is represented by a rectangle, where one\ndimension is the number of workers needed, and the other\nis the amount of time required. The total number of work\u0002ers is the height of an enclosing rectangle, and the length\nof time is the width. All the job rectangles must be packed\ninto the enclosing rectangle, with no overlap. Minimizing\nthe total labor cost amounts to finding the enclosing rect\u0002angle of minimum area that contains all the job rectangles.\nTo minimize the number of workers, we want an enclosing\nrectangle of minimum width, whose height is the maximum\nnumber of workers needed for any job. Similarly, to mini\u0002mize the amount of time, we want an enclosing rectangle of\nminimum height, whose width is the amount of time needed\nfor the longest job.\nOf course, in reality there will be other constraints on the\njobs, such as precedence constraints between jobs. Such\nconstraints can be easily added to our solution algorithm, re\u0002sulting in the pruning of partial solutions that don\u2019t satisify\nthe constraints. This pruning will make it easier to deter\u0002mine that a particular enclosing rectangle can\u2019t contain all\nthe job rectangles, but potentially more difficult to find a\nfeasible solution within a particular enclosing rectangle. For\nsimplicity, we consider the unconstrained case here, which\nis a subproblem of the more general case.\nRectangle packing has other applications as well. In the\ndesign of VLSI chips, circuit blocks such as processors,\nmemory, and I/O drivers must be assigned to physical re\u0002gions of the chip. Another application is cutting a set of\nrectangles out of a single piece of stock material. A re\u0002lated problem is loading a set of rectangular objects onto a\ncargo pallet. An important difference between the schedul\u0002ing problem described above and these other applications\nis that in the scheduling problem the orientation of the job\nrectangles is fixed, since workers and time are often not in\u0002terchangeable. In VLSI design or cutting-stock problems,\nhowever, we can rotate our rectangles by ninety degrees. In\nthis paper, we consider the fixed-orientation problem, and\nonly briefly discuss the extension to unoriented rectangles.\nWe focus here on optimal solutions, but develop an any\u0002time algorithm. In other words, our algorithm finds an ap\u0002proximate solution immediately, and as it continues to run it\nICAPS 2003 287 \nFrom: ICAPS-03 Proceedings. Copyright \u00a9 2003, AAAI (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved. \nfinds better solutions, until it eventually finds and verifies an\noptimal solution. This eliminates solution quality as a vari\u0002able in comparisons with other work. Furthermore, finding\noptimal solutions allows us to characterize the quality of ap\u0002proximate solutions. For example, we evaluate the quality\nof slicing solutions in our experiments.\nWe first show that rectangle-packing problem is NP\u0002complete, and then briefly consider related work. We then\nconsider how to pack a set of rectangles into an enclosing\nrectangle of fixed dimensions, using a branch-and-bound al\u0002gorithm. In particular, we introduce a lower-bound on the\namount of wasted space in a partial solution, based on a\nrelaxation of the problem to one-dimensional bin packing.\nWe also introduce a dominance condition that allows us to\nprune parts of the search space. We then show how to ef\u0002ficiently search the two-dimensional space of different en\u0002closing rectangles to find one with the smallest area that will\ncontain all the given rectangles. To test our algorithm, we we\nfind the enclosing rectangle of smallest area that will con\u0002tain a 1x1, 2x2, 3x3, etc., up to n \u00d7 n square. We choose\nthe special case of square packing because we can specify\na set of increasingly difficult problem instances with just a\nsingle parameter n, making it easier for other researchers to\ncompare their results to ours. Our algorithms, however, do\nnot take advantage of the fact that our rectangles are squares,\nwith one minor exception. We present optimal solutions for\nall problems up to size n = 22, and also the best of a class\nof approximate solutions. Finally, we conclude with further\nideas to improve the performance of our algorithms and gen\u0002eralize our techniques.\nRectangle Packing is NP-Complete\nThe specific decision problem we consider in this section is\ngiven a set of rectangles with fixed orientation, and a specific\nenclosing rectangle, can all the given rectangles fit within the\nboundaries of the enclosing rectangle without any overlap?\nWe show that this problem is NP-complete, by showing that\nthe problem is in NP, and that it is NP-hard.\nIt is clear that this problem can be solved in non\u0002deterministic polynomial time. Given an assignment of the\nrectangles to positions within the enclosing rectangle, it is\neasy to check in polynomial time that no rectangle extends\nbeyond the boundary of the enclosing rectangle, and that no\ntwo rectangles overlap.\nTo show that rectangle packing is NP-hard, we demon\u0002strate that bin packing can be reduced in polynomial time to\nrectangle packing. In other words, if rectangle packing can\nbe solved in polynomial time, then so can bin packing. An\ninstance of the bin-packing decision problem consists of a\nset of numbers, along with a fixed set of bins, each with the\nsame fi...",

      "text": "Optimal Rectangle Packing: New Results\nRichard E. Korf\nComputer Science Department\nUniversity of California, Los Angeles\nLos Angeles, CA 90095\nkorf@cs.ucla.edu\nAbstract\nWe present new results on the problem of finding an enclos\u0002ing rectangle of minimum area that will contain a given a set\nof rectangles. Many simple scheduling tasks can be mod\u0002elled by this NP-complete problem. We present a new lower\nbound on the amount of wasted space in a partial solution, a\nnew dominance condition that prunes many partial solutions,\nand extend our algorithms to packing unoriented rectangles.\nFor our experiments, we consider the set of squares of size\n1x1, 2x2,...,NxN, and find the smallest rectangle that can con\u0002tain them for a given value of N. While previously we solved\nthis problem up to N=22, we extend this to N=25. Overall,\nour new program is over an order of magnitude faster than\nour previous program running on the same machine. We also\nshow that for the larger problems, our optimal algorithm is\nfaster than one that finds the best slicing solution, a popular\napproximation algorithm. In addition, we solve an open prob\u0002lem dating to 1966, concerning packing the set of consecutive\nsquares up to 24x24 in a square of size 70x70.\nIntroduction\nAn Open Square-Packing Problem\nIf we take a 1x1 square, a 2x2 square, etc. up to a 24x24\nsquare, the sum of the areas of these squares is 4900, which\nis 702. This is the only nontrivial sum of consecutive\nsquares starting with one which is a perfect square(Wat\u0002son 1918). (Bitner & Reingold 1975) showed by a com\u0002puter search that these 24 squares cannot all be packed into\na 70x70 square with no overlap. In his Sept. 1966 Scien\u0002tific American Mathematical Games column (Gardner 1966;\n1975), Martin Gardner asked his readers what is the largest\narea of the 70x70 square that can be covered by these\nsquares, a problem he attributes to Richard B. Britton.\nTwenty-seven readers sent in very similar solutions that left\n49 square units uncovered, leaving out the 7x7 square. We\nshow here for the first time that this is the best one can do.\nRectangle Packing\nConsider the following simple scheduling problem: We have\na set of independent and indivisible jobs, each requiring a\ncertain number of workers for a certain time. All workers\nCopyright \rc 2004, American Association for Artificial Intelli\u0002gence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved.\nwork the same hours, and are paid for the total time, whether\nthey are busy or idle. We can adjust the number of workers,\nand the total time, to minimize the total labor cost, which\nis proportional to the product of the number of workers and\nthe total time. Alternatively, we may want to complete all\njobs as quickly as possible, using as many workers as nec\u0002essary, or minimize the number of workers, taking as much\ntime as needed. A closely-related problem is scheduling a\nset of tasks that require a certain resource, such as electric\npower on a spacecraft, for a given amount of time, so that all\ntasks are completed as soon as possible without exceeding\nthe maximum resource capacity.\nWe can model these problems as rectangle-packing prob\u0002lems. Each job is represented by a rectangle, whose height is\nthe amount of resource needed, and whose width is the time\nrequired. The total amount of resource is the height of an en\u0002closing rectangle, and the total time is the width. All the job\nrectangles must be packed into the enclosing rectangle, with\nno overlap. To minimize the total cost, we want an enclosing\nrectangle of minimum area. To minimize the amount of re\u0002source, we want an enclosing rectangle of minimum width,\nwhose height is the maximum amount of resource needed\nfor any job. Similarly, to minimize the time, we want an\nenclosing rectangle of minimum height, whose width is the\ntime needed for the longest job.\nIn practice there may be other considerations, such as\nprecedence constraints between jobs. These can be added to\nour solution algorithm, pruning partial solutions that don\u2019t\nsatisfy the constraints. This will make it easier to determine\nthat a particular enclosing rectangle can\u2019t contain all the job\nrectangles, but more difficult to find a feasible solution with\na particular enclosing rectangle. For simplicity, we consider\nthe unconstrained case here.\nRectangle packing has other applications as well. One\nis loading a set of rectangular objects onto a cargo pallet,\nwithout stacking objects. In the design of VLSI chips, cir\u0002cuit blocks must be assigned to physical regions of the chip.\nAnother application is cutting a set of rectangles out of a\nrectangular piece of stock material.\nIn scheduling, the orientation of job rectangles is fixed,\nsince resources and time are rarely interchangeable. In VLSI\ndesign, however, we can usually rotate the rectangles ninety\ndegrees. Cargo-loading also involves unoriented rectangles,\nwhile in cutting-stock problems the rectangles may be ori\u0002142 ICAPS 2004 \nFrom: ICAPS-04 Proceedings.

We consider both cases here.\nRelated Work\nMost work on rectangle packing deals with approximate\nrather than optimal solutions. Our previous paper on this\nsubject (Korf 2003) represents the current state of the art,\nand contains comparisons to prior work. We showed that\noptimal rectangle-packing is NP-complete. We also intro\u0002duced the benchmark of finding the enclosing rectangle of\nsmallest area that will contain the 1x1, 2x2,...,NxN square,\nand solved the problem for N up to 22.\nOverview\nWe first consider packing a set of rectangles into a fixed en\u0002closing rectangle, and then describe how to search the space\nof enclosing rectangles for one of minimum area. We then\nconsider slicing solutions, a popular approximation method.\nWe describe our experimental results, and present further\nwork and conclusions. This paper repeats some of the mate\u0002rial from (Korf 2003), in order to make it self-contained.\nThe three main contributions of this paper are a new lower\nbound on the space wasted in any partial solution, an ad\u0002ditional dominance condition that allows us to prune more\npartial solutions, and the extension to unoriented rectangles.\nWe extend the set of problems we can solve optimally from\nN=22 to N=25, and solve the open problem proposed by\nGardner. Our new program is over an order of magnitude\nfaster than our previous program. It is also faster than our\nprogram for finding slicing solutions, which is only an ap\u0002proximation algorithm.\nAll our experiments involve packing squares, which pro\u0002vides an infinite number of increasingly difficult problem in\u0002stances, each characterized by a single parameter. However,\nour techniques are applicable to the more general rectangle\u0002packing problem as well. Where we take advantage of the\nsymmetry of squares, we also explain the generalization to\nrectangles. We also explain some additional details omitted\nfrom our previous paper, and correct several errors.\nRectangle Packing as a Binary CSP\nFirst we consider the problem of given a fixed enclosing\nrectangle, can we pack a given set of oriented rectangles into\nit? The enclosing rectangle must be at least as wide as the\nmaximum width of any rectangle, and at least as tall as the\nmaximum height of any rectangle. Furthermore, the area of\nthe enclosing rectangle must equal or exceed the sum of the\nareas of the given rectangles.\nThis can be modelled as a binary constraint-satisfaction\nproblem. There is a variable for each rectangle, whose legal\nvalues are the positions it could occupy without exceeding\nthe boundaries of the enclosing rectangle. There is a binary\nconstraint between each pair of rectangles that they cannot\noverlap. This suggests a backtracking algorithm.\nWe place the rectangles in decreasing order of size, in\norder to avoid rearranging smaller rectangles if there is no\nlegal position for the largest unplaced rectangle. We can\ndefine the size of a rectangle by its area, or its maximum di\u0002mension. The latter definition may be better...",

Introduction\nThe two-dimensional (2D) rectangular packing problem is an optimization problem of allocating a set of\nrectangular items to larger containers with the objective of minimizing the waste. The 2D rectangular packing\nproblem has been widely studied in recent decades, as it has numerous applications in the cutting and packing\nindustry, e.g. wood, glass and cloth industries, newspapers paging, VLSI floor planning and so on, with dif\u0002ferent applications incorporating different constraints and objectives (Chan & Markov, 2004; Hifi & Ouafi,\n1998; Lee & Sewell, 1999; Lesh, Marks, & Mcmahon, 2004; Lodi, Martello, & Monaci, 2002). The 2D rect\u0002angular packing problem belongs to a subset of classical cutting and packing problems and has been shown to\nbe an NP hard problem (Hochbaum & Maass, 1985). Therefore, various approximation or heuristic algo\u0002rithms have been proposed for approaching the problem.\nIn rectangle packing, one of the earliest approaches is the so-called bottom-left (BL) heuristic (Baker, Coff\u0002man, & Rivest, 1980). In BL, the rectangles to be placed are, starting from the top-right corner of the con\u0002tainer, first slide vertically downward as far as possible, followed by sliding horizontally as far as possible\nto the left, so as to reduce the number of possible packing patterns. One improved variant of BL is the\n0360-8352/$ - see front matter \u0002 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Both BL and BLF are later used in meta-heuristic based algorithms. Hybrid algorithms\ncombining genetic algorithm (GA) and deterministic methods were proposed by Jakobs (1996), Liu and Teng\n(1999), and Dagli and Poshyanonda (1997). An empirical investigation of the result of different combinations\nof simulated annealing (SA) and GA with various heuristics such as BL or BLF was given by Hopper and\nTurton (2001).\nInspired by enhancing some working experience of professional masons in their everyday work, a Less\nFlexibility First (LFF) packing principle was proposed in Tam et al. (1998); Wu, Huang, and Lau (2002)\nfor solving the rectangular packing problem. Recently, by introducing a tightness measure to represent the\ndegree of fitting between rectangles and placement locations, an enhanced version of LFF, called LFFT,\nwas proposed in Wu, Chan, and SAGA (2005). More recently, a fast heuristic recursive (HR) algorithm based\non divide-and-conquer and greedy strategies was proposed in Zhang, Kang, and Deng (2006), and an effective\nGA, called SPGAL, was proposed in Bortfeldt (2006) for the four subtypes of the 2D strip packing problem.\nBased on the previous studies (Huang, Li, Akeb, & Li, 2005; Tam et al., 1998; Wu et al., 2002), we will\npropose a quite different class of efficient heuristic for the 2D rectangular packing problem in this paper. Dif\u0002ferent from the stochastic search methods where the researches are mainly focused on finding the efficient data\nstructures for presenting packing results so that the search space and the processing time of the underling\nsearch engine can be minimized, our algorithm is a deterministic algorithm and no data structure is needed.\nSimilar to LFF, our algorithm packs the rectangles into the container one by one and each rectangle should be\npacked at a position occupying an empty corner in the container. The computational results of our proposed\nalgorithm is very encouraging in terms of both packing density and running time.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 gives the problem definition. Section 3 describes the\ndetails of the algorithm. Section 4 presents our experimental results for two sets of test instances. We draw our\nconclusions in Section 5.\n2. Problem definition\nWe consider the following rectangular packing problem: given a rectangular empty container with fixed\nwidth and infinite height and a set of rectangles with various sizes, the rectangle packing problem is to pack\neach rectangle into the container such that no two rectangles overlap and the used height of the container is\nminimized. From this optimization problem, an associated decision problem can be formally stated as follows:\nGiven a rectangular board with given width W and given height H, and n rectangles with length li and width\nwi, 1 6 i 6 n, take the origin of the two-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system at the bottom-left corner of\nthe container (see Fig. 1). The aim of this problem is to determine if there exist a solution composed of n sets of\nFig. 1. Cartesian coordinate system.\n124 M. Chen, W. Huang / Computers & Industrial Engineering 53 (2007) 123\u2013136\nquadruples {x11, y11, x12, y12},..., {xn1, yn1, xn2, yn2}, where (xi1, yi1) denotes the bottom-left corner coordi\u0002nates of rectangle i, and (xi2, yi2) denotes the top-right corner coordinates of rectangle i. For all 1 6 i 6 n, the\ncoordinates of rectangle i satisfy the following conditions:\n(1) xi2 \u0002 xi1 = li ^ yi2 \u0002 yi1 = wi or xi2 \u0002 xi1 = wi ^ yi2 \u0002 yi1 = li;\n(2) For all 1 6 i, j 6 n, j5i, rectangle i and j cannot overlap, i.e., one of the following conditions should be\nmet: xi1 P xj2 or xj1 P xi2 or yi1 P yj2 or yj1 P yi2;\n(3) 0 6 xi1, xi2 6 W and 0 6 yi1, yi2 6 H.\nIn our packing process, each rectangle is free to rotate and its orientation h can be 0 (for \u2018\u2018not rotated\u2019\u2019) or 1\n(for \u2018\u2018rotated by p/2\u2019\u2019). It is noted that the orthogonal rectangular packing problems denote that the packing\nprocess has to ensure the edges of each rectangle are parallel to the x- and y-axis, respectively.\nObviously, if we can find an efficient algorithm to solve this decision problem, we can then solve the original\noptimization problem by using some search strategies. For example, we first apply dichotomous search to rap\u0002idly get a \u2018\u2018good enough\u2019\u2019 upper bound for the height, then from this upper bound we gradually reduce it until\nthe algorithm no longer finds a successful solution. The final upper bound is then taken as the minimal height\nof the container obtained by the algorithm.

      "text": "Optimal Rectangle Packing: A Meta-CSP Approach\nMichael D. Moffitt and Martha E. Pollack\nDepartment of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science\nUniversity of Michigan\nAnn Arbor, MI 48109, USA\n{mmoffitt, pollackm}@eecs.umich.edu\nAbstract\nWe present a new approach to optimal rectangle packing, an\nNP-complete problem that can be used to model many sim\u0002ple scheduling tasks. Recent attempts at incorporating artifi\u0002cial intelligence search techniques to the problem of rectangle\npacking have focused on a CSP formulation, in which partial\nassignments are defined to be the fixed placement of a sub\u0002set of rectangles. Our technique takes a significant departure\nfrom this search space, as we instead view partial assignments\nas subsets of relative pairwise relationships between rectan\u0002gles. This approach recalls the meta-CSP commonly con\u0002structed in constraint-based temporal reasoning, and is thus a\ncandidate for several pruning techniques that have been de\u0002veloped in that field. We apply these to the domain of rect\u0002angle packing, and develop a suite of new techniques that ex\u0002ploit both the symmetry and geometry present in this partic\u0002ular domain. We then provide experimental results demon\u0002strating that our approach performs competitively compared\nto the previous state-of-the-art on a series of benchmarks,\nmatching or surpassing it in speed on nearly all instances.\nFinally, we conjecture that our technique is particularly ap\u0002propriate for problems containing large rectangles, which are\ndifficult for the fixed-placement formulation to handle effi\u0002ciently.\nIntroduction\nThe problem of rectangle packing is one that has drawn at\u0002tention from several diverse fields of computer science. For\ninstance, in the context of scheduling, it can be used to rep\u0002resent scenarios where jobs require a fixed amount of time\nand resources, which compose the two dimensions of a sin\u0002gle rectangle. The task of packing many such rectangles into\nan enclosing space, so as to minimize the width, height, or\narea of this space, allows for the minimization of makespan,\nresources needed, or total wasted resource. In VLSI design,\nrectangles represent actual physical modules that need to be\nplaced in a spatial arrangement such that no two modules\noverlap.\nOne of the more recent approaches (Korf 2003) has cast\noptimal rectangle packing as a constraint satisfaction prob\u0002lem (CSP). In this formulation, a variable is created for each\nrectangle, whose legal values are the positions that rectan\u0002gle could occupy without exceeding the boundaries of the\nenclosing space. In addition, there is a binary constraint\nbetween each pair of rectangles, requiring that they do not\nCopyright \u0001c 2006, American Association for Artificial Intelli\u0002gence (www.aaai.org).

By obtaining\nlower bounds on the amount of wasted space at each node in\nthe search, an efficient algorithm is constructed, which was\nlater refined (Korf 2004) into the fastest known algorithm\nfor optimal rectangle packing.\nIn this paper, we present a new approach to rectangle\npacking. Specifically, we cast the problem of optimally\npacking a set of rectangles with fixed orientations as a meta\u0002CSP. In this formulation, we create a meta-variable for each\npair of rectangles, whose values are the four pairwise re\u0002lationships (i.e., above, below, left of, right of) that pre\u0002vent that pair from overlapping. As such, commitment to\nthe exact placement of any rectangle is not established un\u0002til a consistent solution has been generated. In this regard,\nour approach resembles graph-based methods for optimal\nrectangle packing (Onodera, Taniguchi, & Tamaru 1991),\nwhich have previously been unable to cope with more than a\nsmall handful of rectangles. The key difference in our meta\u0002CSP formulation is the introduction of modern artificial\u0002intelligence search techniques that greatly increase the effi\u0002ciency of exploring this alternative space. Some of these are\ndrawn from literature on constraint-based temporal reason\u0002ing (Dechter, Meiri, & Pearl 1991; Stergiou & Koubarakis\n1998; Tsamardinos & Pollack 2003), while others are en\u0002tirely new techniques that exploit the symmetry and geom\u0002etry present in this particular domain. We combine these\nmethods to create the BLUEBLOCKER solver, and provide ex\u0002perimental results demonstrating that our approach performs\ncompetitively compared to the previous state-of-the-art on a\nseries of benchmarks. Finally, we conjecture that our tech\u0002nique is particularly appropriate for problems containing\nlarge rectangles, which are difficult for the fixed-placement\nformulation to handle efficiently.\nBackground\nRectangle Packing\nConsider the following problem: we are given a set of N\njobs, where each job j requires a specific number of workers\n(or machines) mj and a specific amount of uninterrupted\nprocessing time pj . Assuming that all workers are paid the\nsame salary and work the same hours, one may wish to find\na schedule that minimizes the total cost of labor (which is\nproportional to the product of number of workers and the\ntotal hours worked).\n93\nThis problem can be approximated as a rectangle pack\u0002ing problem.1 Specifically, each job can be represented by a\nrectangle, with width wj being equal to the time required pj ,\nand height hj being equal to the required number of work\u0002ers mj . Minimizing the total labor cost is then equivalent to\nfinding an enclosing rectangle of dimensions W \u00d7 H whose\ntotal area is minimal. We refer to this as the Minimal Bound\u0002ing Box Problem. The decision variant of this, where the di\u0002mensions of the enclosing space are specified, we refer to as\nthe Containment Problem.\nPrevious work on rectangle packing has primarily focused\non generating approximate or suboptimal solutions, using\ntechniques such as genetic algorithms and simulated anneal\u0002ing. To facilitate these approaches, a number of data struc\u0002tures have been developed to represent a layout of rectangles\nincluding sequence pairs (Murata et al. 1995), BSG struc\u0002tures (Nakatake et al. 1996), and O-Trees (Guo, Cheng, &\nYoshimura 1999). We omit the details of such structures, as\nthey are largely unrelated to our formulation.\nThe first line of research to consider optimal two\u0002dimensional compactions of rectangles (Onodera,\nTaniguchi, & Tamaru 1991) applied a branch-and-bound\napproach, using a graph algorithm to maintain consistency\nat each step of the backtracking search. Extensions of\nthis method have been largely avoided, as it was shown to\nhandle no more than six rectangles tractably. More recently,\nan algorithm using the O-Tree representation was able\nto surpass this record by efficiently handling up to nine\nrectangles (Chan & Markov 2004).\nRectangle Packing as a CSP\nOne of the more distinctive approaches to rectangle packing\n(Korf 2003) applied artificial intelligence search techniques\nwith great success. In this work, rectangle packing is mod\u0002eled as a binary constraint satisfaction problem. There is a\nvariable for each rectangle, whose legal values are the po\u0002sitions it could occupy without exceeding the boundaries of\nthe enclosing space. In addition, there is a binary constraint\nbetween each pair of rectangles that they cannot overlap.\nTo solve this CSP, a backtracking algorithm is used. At\neach node in the search, a rectangle is given a fixed posi\u0002tion within the enclosing space. This is accomplished by\n\u201cdrawing\u201d the rectangle (or an outline of the rectangle) onto\na bitmap representing the entire area. For example, one such\npartial assignment is depicted in Figure 1. Here, two rect\u0002angles (in fact, squares) have been given assignments. The\nupper-left corner of the 6\u00d76 square has been placed at (0, 0),\nand the upper-left corner of the 5\u00d75 square has been placed\nat (6, 0). Suppose we have four more squares remaining,\nwith dimensions 4\u00d74, 3\u00d73, 2\u00d72, and 1\u00d71; by visual in\u0002spection...",
