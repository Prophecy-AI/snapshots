## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.676092 from 003_ensemble
- Best LB score: 70.743774 (exp_000 baseline)
- Target: 68.922808 | Gap to target: 1.75 points (2.5% reduction needed)

## CRITICAL: Previous Submission Failed - NOW FIXED
- exp_002 (003_ensemble) failed with "Overlapping trees in group 020"
- Root cause: Data corruption during ensemble creation
- **FIX APPLIED**: New ensemble created with overlap checking - VERIFIED NO OVERLAPS
- The submission at /home/submission/submission.csv is ready (score: 70.676092)

## Public Kernel Status
- Have we implemented the best kernel yet? PARTIALLY
- Top kernels: jonathanchan (sa_v1_parallel), jazivxt (bbox3), crodoc (backpacking)
- **NEXT STEP**: Extract and run sa_v1_parallel.cpp from jonathanchan kernel

## Available Datasets (13 sources downloaded)
Best single source: santa-2025.csv at 70.676102
Ensemble achieves: 70.676092 (slightly better by combining best per-N)

## Response to Evaluator
Evaluator correctly identified:
1. Ensemble approach is sound but needs more sources ✓ Downloaded
2. C++ optimizer (sa_v1_parallel) needs to run ✓ Will implement
3. Overlap checking needed ✓ Implemented and verified

## Recommended Approaches (Priority Order)

### 1. **[IMMEDIATE]** Submit the verified ensemble
The new ensemble has NO OVERLAPS (verified). Submit to get LB feedback.
- File: /home/submission/submission.csv
- Score: 70.676092

### 2. **[HIGH PRIORITY]** Extract and run sa_v1_parallel.cpp
From jonathanchan kernel at:
/home/code/research/kernels/jonathanchan_santa25-ensemble-sa-fractional-translation/santa25-ensemble-sa-fractional-translation.ipynb

The C++ code is embedded in cell 4. It implements:
- `sa_v3` - simulated annealing with perturb/restart
- `ls_v3` - local search with translation/rotation
- `fractional_translation` - fine-grained translation [0.001, 0.0005, 0.0002, 0.0001, 0.00005, 0.00002, 0.00001]

```bash
# Extract C++ code from notebook cell 4
# Compile: g++ -O3 -march=native -std=c++17 -fopenmp -o sa_v1_parallel sa_v1_parallel.cpp
# Run: ./sa_v1_parallel -i submission.csv -o submission.csv -n 20000 -r 10
```

### 3. **[MEDIUM]** Backward iteration (backpacking)
From crodoc kernel - start from N=200, iterate backward, propagate good configs.

## What NOT to Try
- bbox3 alone (already tried, no improvement on this optimized ensemble)
- Ensemble without overlap checking (caused failure)

## SUBMISSION STRATEGY
- Remaining submissions: 93 (ABUNDANT)
- **Submit the verified ensemble NOW to get LB feedback**
- Then run sa_v1_parallel optimizer for further improvement
