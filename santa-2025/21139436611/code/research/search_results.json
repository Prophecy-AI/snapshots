      "text": "Simulated\u2011annealing (SA) works best for 2\u2011D polygon packing when it is combined with geometric tools that generate feasible candidate placements and with adaptive search strategies that keep the exploration\u2011exploitation balance tight.  The most widely\u2011used geometric primitive is the **No\u2011Fit Polygon (NFP)**, which describes all relative positions where two polygons would touch without overlapping; by pre\u2011computing NFPs the algorithm can quickly sample legal moves and build rows of pieces on the sheet\u202f([Graham\u202fKendall\u202f1999](https://www.graham-kendall.com/papers/bk1999c.pdf)).  Modern implementations also embed the NFP inside a fast interactive packing engine that uses custom heuristics (e.g., greedy row\u2011building and rotation selection) to produce a good initial layout before SA begins\u202f([Sy\u202f2020](https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/127531/1193030886-MIT.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y)).  \n\nTo improve convergence, researchers employ **adaptive neighbourhoods** that change the size and type of moves (translation, rotation, swapping) as the temperature drops, allowing large\u2011scale rearrangements early on and fine\u2011grained tweaks later\u202f([Bohachevsky\u202fet\u202fal.\u202f2008](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S147466701535549X)).  A further boost comes from **hybrid SA schemes** that embed a deterministic recursive placement routine inside each SA iteration; the recursive step quickly finds a locally optimal insertion for a piece, while SA explores different ordering and orientation choices, yielding higher\u2011quality packings on strip\u2011packing benchmarks\u202f([Dereli\u202f&\u202fDa\u015f\u202f2007](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-71618-1_56)).  Finally, comparative studies show that SA outperforms simple hill\u2011climbing when these enhancements are used, especially for irregular polygons with rotation freedom\u202f([Art\u202fet\u202fal.\u202f2009](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1474667016340186)).  \n\nIn practice, the \u201cbest\u201d SA\u2011based packing pipeline therefore follows three steps: (1) generate NFPs for all polygon pairs, (2) create an initial layout with a fast heuristic/row\u2011building method, and (3) run an adaptive\u2011neighbourhood SA that periodically invokes a recursive placement or local hill\u2011climb to refine the solution.  This combination consistently delivers low waste and high material utilisation across a range of industrial nesting problems.",

The goal of this optimization problem is to place a set of irregular\npolygons onto a material sheet without overlapping and in a way that minimizes wasted\nmaterial.\nIn this thesis, we delve into a fast 2D packing algorithm that automatically arranges\nparts of a user\u2019s design onto their available material sheets to provide live feedback on\nhow much material they have left. To do this, we make use of the concept of the no fit\npolygon to generate candidate placements, and we utilize custom heuristics and performance\noptimization to improve packing quality and runtime .\nOur technical evaluation shows that the implementation is fast enough to work at\ninteractive speeds and produce solutions of similar quality to other tools and algorithms that\nperform automated packing.\nThesis Supervisor: Stefanie Mueller\nTitle: Assistant Professor\n3\n4\nAcknowledgments\nFirst of all, I would like to extend my deepest gratitude to my advisor, Professor Stefanie\nMueller.

      "text": "Applying Simulated Annealing and the No Fit Polygon to the Nesting Problem\nEdmund Burke Graham Kendall\nUniversity of Nottingham University of Nottingham\nUniversity Park University Park\nNottingham, UK Nottingham\nNG7 2RD NG7 2RD\nUK UK\nekb@cs.nott.ac.uk gxk@cs.nott.ac.uk\nAbstract\nThis paper presents a new method to pack convex \npolygons into bins (the nesting problem). To do this \npolygons are placed in rows within bins using a meta\u0002heuristic algorithm (simulated annealing) and by \nutilising the No Fit Polygon. We show that simulated \nannealing out performs hill climbing. The nesting \nalgorithm is described in detail, along with various \naspects that have been incorporated in order to improve \nthe efficiency of the algorithm whilst maintaining \nsolution quality. Computational results are given\n1. Introduction\nIn the nesting problem pieces must be placed onto larger \nshape(s) (which we will refer to as stock sheets). In \ndoing so two constraints must not be violated. The \npieces must not overlap and all the pieces must lie \nwithin the confines of the stock sheet(s). In addition, it \nis usual to minimise the waste. The nesting problem \nonly considers two dimensions, that is, the height and \nwidth of the stock sheet(s). Although it is possible to \nhave a number of stock sheets, in this paper it is \nassumed that there is only a single stock sheet of fixed \nwidth and infinite height. This is common in the real \nworld where a company may be cutting pieces from a \nroll of material. Of course, the roll does have a finite \nlength but for the purposes of cutting the pieces it can \nbe considered to be of infinite length.\nOne of the first references to the nesting problem is \n(Art, 1966). This paper also introduced the No Fit \nPolygon (NFP) (see section 2) which was also used by \n(Adamowicz, 1976) to calculate the minimum enclosing \nrectangle for two irregular shapes before placing the \nrectangle onto the stock sheet. It is the Adamowicz \npaper that is most often cited in the literature.\n(Albano, 1980) used the no fit polygon in a heuristic \nsearch method to place irregular pieces onto stock \nsheets. The search is based on the A* algorithm but, \nbecause an admissible heuristic cannot be calculated, \nthe search does not guarantee an optimal solution. In \naddition, other constraints are placed on the search due \nto the size of the search space. For example the size of \nthe search tree is restricted. The evaluation function, \nf(n), is given by g(n) + h(n) where g(n) is the cost of the \nsolution so far, which is a measure of the waste that \ncannot be used in later placements. h(n) is a heuristic \nmeasure that estimates the amount of waste in the \noptimal solution should the current piece be included in \nthe placement. If it were possible to find suitable values \nfor h(n) then optimal solutions could be found. \n(Oliveira, 1998) also used the no fit polygon to calculate \nthe position of the next piece to be placed on the stock \nsheet. Once the best placement has been found the piece \nis added to the partial solution and the next piece is \nplaced.\nUtilising the no fit polygon makes it unnecessary to \ncheck for overlapping pieces. However, some \nresearchers, while employing meta-heuristics, do allow \noverlaps during the search phase. (Oliveira, 1993) \nallows pieces to overlap and uses simulated annealing to \nmove a single piece to another position. The objective \nfunction considers the length of the layout and combines \nthis with a penalty term that penalises overlap. \n(Blazewicz, 1993) uses tabu search and an approach \nsimilar to (Oliveira, 1993) except that only non\u0002overlapping pieces are moved.\nOther researchers who have applied meta-heuristics \napproaches to the nesting (and related) problem include \n(Jain, 1992) who uses simulated annealing to position \nidentical pieces together that could be \u201cstamped out\u201d \nfrom a length of material. A grid representation is used \nfor the pieces which makes intersection very easy to \ncompute. This approach is compared to (Jannsen, 1983) \nwhich splits the shapes into triangles and calculates the \narea of overlap using these triangles. (Cagan, 1994) \nused shape annealing which is a development of \nsimulated annealing. Shapes are defined by grammars \nwhich dictate permissible orientations of the pieces. The \nshape annealing algorithm is used to determine whether \na randomly selected shape rule should be applied to the \ncurrent configuration. The example presented in the \npaper is to pack as many half hexagons into a \npredefined area. The results are acceptable but not \nprovably optimal.\nHeckmann and Lengauer (Heckmann, 1995) use\nsimulated annealing, with a dynamic cooling schedule. \nAs well as describing the cooling schedule and the type \nof moves allowed, the paper also discusses two different \nways that shapes can be represented. Two models were \ntested and the polygonal model was preferred to the \nraster model because of the improved accuracy given by \nthis representation.\n(Falkenauer, 1998), although not specifically addressing \nthe nesting problem, considers Grouping Problems, \nusing Genetic Algorithms (GA). The GA\u2019s are named \nGrouping Genetic Algorithms (GGA). One of the \nproblems addressed is the bin packing problem. The \nnesting problem can be considered a bin packing \nproblem where the cost associated with each piece is \nequal to its area.\nThe cost function used by Falkenauer is\nMaximize \nWhere N is the number of bins used\nFi is the sum of the sizes of objects in bin i\nC is the bin capacity\nAnd k is a constant, k >1\nThis cost function measures the average \u2018bin efficiency\u2019 \nto the kth power. Falkenauer achieved good results with \nk=2. Our tests have used both this cost function \n(suitably amended and detailed below) as well as a cost \nfunction that simply minimises the bin height.\nThis paper presents a method to produce solutions to the \nnesting problem. We employ a meta-heuristic technique \n(simulated annealing) and compare our results with hill \nclimbing. The method utilises the no fit polygon as a \nway of packing the pieces.\n2. No Fit Polygon\nThe No Fit Polygon (NFP) determines all arrangements \nthat two arbitrary polygons may assume such that the \nshapes touch but so that they cannot be moved closer \ntogether without intersection. The example below shows \nhow to calculate an NFP for two given polygons.\nConsider the two \npolygons in figure 1.\nThe aim is to find all \narrangements such \nthat the two polygons \ntouch but do not \nintersect. If this can \nbe achieved then we know that we cannot move the \npolygons closer together in order to obtain a tighter \npacking.\nIn order to find the placements we proceed as follows\n(see figure 2)\nOne of the polygons (P1) remains stationery. The other \npolygon, P2, obits around P1, staying in contact with it \nbut never intersecting it.\nBoth polygons retain their original orientation. That is, \nthey never rotate.\nAs P2 moves around P1 one of its vertices (the reference \npoint \u2013 shown as a filled circle) traces a line (this \nbecomes the NFP).\nThis figure shows the starting (and finishing) positions \nof P1 and P2 with the NFP being shown as a dashed line. \nThe NFP is slightly enlarged so that it is visible. In fact, \nsome of the edges of the NFP will be identical to some \nof the edges of P1 and P2.\nOnce the NFP has been calculated for a given pair of \npolygons the reference point of P2 can be placed \nanywhere on an edge or vertex of the NFP in the \nknowledge that P2 will touch but not intersect P1.\nIn order to implement an NFP algorithm it is not \nnecessary to emulate one polygon orbiting another. \n(Cunninghame-Green, 1992) presents an algorithm that \nwe use. It works on the assumption that (for convex \npolygons only) the NFP has its number of edges equal \nto the number of edges of P1 and P2. In addition, the \nedges of the NFP are simply copies of the edges of P1\nand P2, suitably ordered. To build the NFP it is a matter \nof taking the edges of P1 and P2, sorting them and \nbuilding the NFP using t...",

This problem is approached with an heuristic based on Simulated Annealing (SA) with adaptive neighborhood. Traditional \u201cexternal penalization\u201d techniques are avoided through the application of the no\u2013fit polygon, that determinates the collision-free area for each polygon before its placement. The SA controls continuous and discrete parameters. The rotation applied and the translation of the polygon are continuous parameters, and the sequence of placement is represented as a set of discrete parameters. For each non\u2013placed item, a limited depth binary search is performed to find a scale factor that when applied to the item, would allow it to be fitted in the container.\n\n- [Previous article in issue](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1474667015355488)\n- [Next article in issue](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1474667015355506)\n\n## Keywords\n\nSimulated Annealing\n\nPlacement Problems\n\nOptimization\n\nProbabilistic Heuristics\n\n[View PDF](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S147466701535549X/pdf?md5=7bca88c33d2daef044751913b4156e2b&pid=1-s2.0-S147466701535549X-main.pdf)\n\nSpecial issue articlesRecommended articles\n\n## References\n\n01.

High material utilization is of particular interest to mass production industries since small improvements of the layout can result in large savings of material and considerably reduce production cost. In this work the Simulated Annealing is combined with deterministic heuristics (larger first (LF), bottom left (BL) and translations only (Tr)) and compared. The rotational generic approach has discrete (sequence of placement) and continuous (angle and position) parameters. It is very important to notice that the cost function (non occupied space) has only discrete values.\n\n- [Previous article in issue](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1474667016340174)\n- [Next article in issue](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1474667016340198)\n\n## Keywords\n\nComputer vision\n\nmatched filter\n\ninvariant mapping\n\n[View PDF](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1474667016340186/pdf?md5=8b357149307a0ecbdb40b0d6add2590e&pid=1-s2.0-S1474667016340186-main.pdf)\n\nSpecial issue articlesRecommended articles\n\n## References\n\n01.

An efficient 2D irregular packing algorithm can effectively\nimprove material utilization and reduce processing costs. The reduction in material\nconsumption will also have a beneficial impact on the environment (Ke et al., 2020).\nTherefore, research of the packing problem is of great significance for technology and\nsocial interest.\nThe 2D packing problem is a type of combinatorial optimization problems to locate\nparts with different shapes compactly in one or more master sheet material to minimize\nthe occupied space or maximize the utilization of the material. The 2D packing problem is\ncurrently recognized as a NP problem, which is mainly solved by heuristic algorithms. In\nrecent years, many scholars have conducted research on 2D irregular packing problems\nwith a verity of solutions.\nThere exists a number of review articles on packing and cutting problems.

This problem is approached with an heuristic based on simulated annealing. Traditional \" external penalization\" techniques are avoided through the application of the no-fit polygon, that determinates the collision-free region for each small item before its placement. The simulated annealing controls: the rotation applied and the placement of the small item. For each non-placed small item, a limited depth binary search is performed to find a scale factor that when applied to the small item, would allow it to be fitted in the large object. Three possibilities to define the sequence on which the small items are placed are studied: larger-first, random permutation and weight sorted. The proposed algorithm is suited for non-convex small items and large objects.\nknapsack problem; cutting and packing; optimization\n**TECHNICAL PAPERS**\n**Rotational placement of irregular polygons over containers with fixed dimensions using simulated annealing and no-fit polygons**\n**Thiago de C.

This problem is approached with an heuristic based on simulated annealing. Traditional \" external penalization\" techniques are avoided through the application of the no-fit polygon, that determinates the collision-free region for each small item before its placement. The simulated annealing controls: the rotation applied and the placement of the small item. For each non-placed small item, a limited depth binary search is performed to find a scale factor that when applied to the small item, would allow it to be fitted in the large object. Three possibilities to define the sequence on which the small items are placed are studied: larger-first, random permutation and weight sorted. The proposed algorithm is suited for non-convex small items and large objects.\n**Keywords:**knapsack problem, cutting and packing, optimization\n**Introduction**\nThe knapsack problem arises in the industry whenever one must place multiple small items inside a large object such that there is no collision between the small items, while either minimizing the size of the large object or maximizing the volume occupied by the small items. High material utilization is of particular interest to mass production industries since small improvements of the layout can result in large savings of material and considerably reduce production cost.\nThe knapsack problem belongs to the more general class of combinatorial problems known as cutting and packing problems. According to Dyckhoff (1990), the cutting and packing problems are mainly characterized by the number of relevant dimensions, the regularity and irregularity of the shapes of the small items and large objects and the problem assignment. Considering assignment, it is possible to identify two situations: output maximization and input minimization. In the input minimization, the set of large objects is sufficient to accommodate all small items, and there is no selection regarding the small items. In the case of output maximization, the set of large objects is not sufficient to accommodate all the small items and a set of small items has to be assigned to a given set of large objects. The survey made by Wascher et al. (2005) improved the typology of cutting and packing problems proposed by Dyckhoff (1990). According to Wascher et al. (2005), the problem studied in this work can be defined as: \" ... the knapsack problem represents a problem category which is characterized by a strongly heteroge-neous assortment of small items which have to be allocated to a given set of large objects. Again, the availability of the large objects is limited such that not all small items can be accommodated. The value of the accommodated small items is to be maximized\" . In this survey, Wascher et al. (2005) identified 294 papers containing material relevant to cutting and packing. Only 5...",
