Exact branch\u2011and\u2011bound or integer\u2011programming formulations can guarantee optimality but quickly become intractable; therefore many researchers rely on **approximation and shelf\u2011packing schemes** that sort polygons by height or area and place them on successive \u201cshelves\u201d inside the container, achieving provable constant\u2011factor bounds for convex polygons\u202f([arXiv](https://export.arxiv.org/pdf/2308.08523v1.pdf)).  For truly irregular shapes, **bottom\u2011left placement** (the Bottom\u2011Left\u2011Fill strategy) remains a simple yet surprisingly effective heuristic, especially when coupled with a good ordering of items\u202f([Taylor\u202f&\u202fFrancis](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.1201/9781351236423-33/practical-algorithms-two-dimensional-packing-general-shape",
