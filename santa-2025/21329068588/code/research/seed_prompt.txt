# Santa 2025 - Christmas Tree Packing Optimization

## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.622435 from exp_003 (004_sa_fast_v2_optimization)
- Best LB score: 70.622435 (VALIDATED - CV-LB gap is ZERO!)
- Target: 68.891380 | Gap to target: 1.731 points (2.51%)

## CV-LB Relationship Analysis
- **CV-LB gap is ZERO** - our local scoring is perfectly calibrated
- This means CV improvements will translate directly to LB improvements
- The challenge is purely algorithmic - we need better solutions, not better validation

## Response to Evaluator

The evaluator correctly identified several key points:

1. **Overlap Risk**: The evaluator warned that candidate_003 might fail due to N=8 overlaps. However, **it PASSED** with LB=70.622435. This is good news - our current solution is valid.

2. **Improvement Rate Concern**: The evaluator noted that 0.003653 points in ~30 minutes is too slow. This is correct - at this rate, closing the 1.73 point gap would take ~14 hours. We need a different approach.

3. **External Source Ensemble**: The evaluator recommended ensembling from external sources. I investigated this thoroughly:
   - Found 2104 potential submission files in snapshots
   - Best ensemble score: 70.523320 (0.099 points better than current)
   - **BUT**: This file has overlaps and would fail Kaggle validation
   - All 209 validated submissions across 105 snapshots show our current 70.622435 is the BEST

4. **Key Insight**: The problem is NOT that we haven't tried ensembling - it's that all better-scoring solutions have overlaps. We need to either:
   a) Find/create overlap-free solutions that score better
   b) Fix the overlaps in the 70.523320 solution
   c) Try fundamentally different optimization approaches

## What We've Learned

1. **bbox3 optimizer**: ZERO improvement - solution is at local optimum for this optimizer
2. **sa_fast_v2 optimizer**: 0.003653 improvement - can escape local optima but too slow
3. **Ensemble from snapshots**: Best files have overlaps, can't use them directly
4. **CV-LB calibration**: Perfect - no distribution shift issues

## Untried Approaches (Priority Order)

### 1. **[HIGHEST PRIORITY] Hybrid Ensemble with Overlap Fixing**
The 70.523320 solution is 0.099 points better but has overlaps. Strategy:
- Identify which N values have overlaps in the better solution
- For N values WITHOUT overlaps, use the better solution (70.523320)
- For N values WITH overlaps, use our validated solution (70.622435)
- This should give us partial improvement while staying valid

### 2. **[HIGH PRIORITY] sa_v1_parallel Optimizer**
The jonathanchan kernel uses this optimizer with:
- Fractional translation steps: [0.001, 0.0005, 0.0002, 0.0001, 0.00005, 0.00002, 0.00001]
- Population-based optimization (keeps top 3)
- SA + local search + fractional translation

### 3. **[MEDIUM PRIORITY] tree_packer Variants**
Available: tree_packer_v18, tree_packer_v21
These might use different algorithms than SA.

### 4. **[RESEARCH] Tessellation for Large N**
Large N values (51-200) contribute 73% of total score. Tessellation approaches might help.

## What NOT to Try
- ❌ More bbox3 runs (already proven ZERO improvement)
- ❌ Simple ensemble from snapshots without overlap checking
- ❌ Running sa_fast_v2 longer (too slow to close gap)

## Recommended Experiment: 005_hybrid_ensemble

1. Load the 70.523320 solution (best scoring but has overlaps)
2. Load our validated 70.622435 solution
3. For each N from 1 to 200:
   - Check if N has overlaps in the better solution
   - If NO overlaps: use the better solution for this N
   - If overlaps: use our validated solution for this N
4. Verify final score and check for overlaps
5. Submit to Kaggle

Expected outcome: Partial improvement from the better solution while maintaining validity.

## Validation Notes
- CV scheme: Direct scoring using numba-optimized bounding box calculation
- CV-LB gap: ZERO (perfect calibration)
- Overlap detection: Use high-precision Decimal/Shapely checks before submission

## SUBMISSION STRATEGY
- Remaining submissions: 96
- **SUBMIT after EVERY experiment** - we have abundant submissions
- LB feedback is free information - USE IT!
