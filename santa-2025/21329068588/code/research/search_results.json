This NP-hard problem requires efficient algorithms to optimize space utilization.\nConventional numerical methods suffer from slow convergence and high computational cost. Existing learning-based methods, such as the score-based diffusion model, also have limitations, such as no rotation support, frequent collisions, and poor adaptability to arbitrary boundaries, and slow inferring.\nThe difficulty of learning from teacher packing is to capture the complex geometric relationships among packing examples, which include the spatial (position, orientation) relationships of objects, their geometric features, and container boundary conditions. Representing these relationships in latent space is challenging.\nWe propose GFPack++, an attention-based gradient field learning approach that addresses this challenge. It consists of two pivotal strategies: _attention-based geometry encoding_ for effective feature encoding and _attention-based relation encoding_ for learning complex relationships.\nWe investigate the utilization distribution between the teacher and inference data and design a weighting function to prioritize tighter teacher data during training, enhancing learning effectiveness.\nOur diffusion model supports continuous rotation and outperforms existing methods on various datasets.\nWe achieve higher space utilization over several widely used baselines, one-order faster than the previous diffusion-based method, and promising generalization for arbitrary boundaries.\nWe plan to release our code and datasets to support further research in this direction.\n\nirregular packing, gradient field, continuous rotation\n\n\u2020\u2020ccs: Computing methodologies\u00a0Shape modeling\u2020\u2020ccs: Computing methodologies\u00a0Neural networks\u2020\u2020ccs: Computing methodologies\u00a0Graphics systems and interfacesFigure 1. The proposed attention-based diffusion model for 2D irregular packing, GFPack++, supports\ncontinuous rotation and accommodating arbitrary boundaries.\n\n## 1\\. Introduction\n\nIrregular shape packing is a classic challenge in operation research, with significant implications for various applications such as texture atlas generation and material utilization in manufacturing\u00a0(Wang et\u00a0al., [2021](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib34)). Its NP-hard nature requires practical and effective packing algorithms to optimize space utilization.\n\nTraditional numerical optimization methods are often slow and costly. Recently, learning-based methods have emerged as a promising alternative for irregular packing, mainly using reinforcement learning\u00a0(Xu et\u00a0al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib37); Yang et\u00a0al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib39)).\nAnother promising approach is the diffusion model, which learns geometric relationships from teacher packing examples and establishes a gradient field for all objects, guiding them to move simultaneously\u00a0(Hosseini et\u00a0al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib11); Xue et\u00a0al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib38)).\nIn particular, the work of (Xue et\u00a0al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib38)), namely GFPack, achieves a notable trade-off between computational cost and space utilization, demonstrating scalability in terms of polygon count and generalizability to rectangular container boundaries.\nHowever, it still faces unresolved issues, notably the lack of support for rotation, a relatively high occurrence of object collisions in results, and limited adaptability to arbitrary boundaries.\n\nThe main idea of the learning-based packing framework is to capture the geometric relationships between shapes, which are essential for the gradient computation.\nSuch relationships in latent space encompass multiple facets: the _spatial (position, orientation) relationship_ of the shapes, the _geometric features relationship_ among them, and the _container boundary conditions_ that constrain them.\nHowever, GFPack falls short in fully representing these relationships.\nIt solely focuses on the positional aspect, neglecting orientation, thus hindering rotational capabilities. Furthermore, it relies on PointNeXt\u00a0(Qian et\u00a0al., [2022](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib24)) for geometric feature extraction, ignoring critical details like polygon edges and resulting in a loss of topological and local features.\nThus, we argue that the full potential of gradient learning has not been thoroughly exploited in GFPack.\n\nIn this study, we introduce two primary strategies to tackle the challenge of learning packing policies.\nFirstly, we use a graph to represent each object and encode it with an _attention-based geometric encoder_, which can capture polygonal geometry information effectively.\nSecondly, we design an _attention-based relation encoding_ mechanism to encode intricate relationships both between polygons and among polygons and boundaries, eliminating the need to explicitly represent the relationships with a graph.\nThis attention-based diffusion model enhances the understanding of how objects interact with each other and the boundaries, resulting in superior performance in both training and inference.\nWe also investigate the utilization distribution between the teacher and inference data and design a weighting function to prioritize tighter teacher data during training, confirmed to be effective.\n\nThis paper makes the following contributions:\n\n1. -\n\n\nWe propose GFPack++, a novel packing framework that employs attention-based learning of gradient fields, supporting continuous rotation and enhancing generalization.\n\n2. -\n\n\nAdvancing beyond GFPack, we encapsulate geometric relationships in an attention-based encoder, incorporating mutual spatial (position, orientation) relationships of objects, their geometric features, and container boundary conditions, and a weighting function to facilitate effective learning policies.\n\n3. -\n\n\nGFPack++ achieves superior irregular packing results, demonstrating higher space utilization over several widely used baselines, one order of magnitude faster than the previous diffusion-based method, coupled with promising generalization for arbitrary boundaries.\n\n\n## 2\\. Related Work\n\n#### Traditional packing approaches\n\nTraditional methods usually involve placement optimization and sequence planning ( _c.f_.surveys\u00a0(Bennell and Oliveira, [2009](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib3); Leao et\u00a0al., [2020](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib18))). Most research focuses on placement optimization with heuristic rules (e.g., BL, BLF), NFP-based search\u00a0(Bennell and Song, [2008](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib4)), or mathematical models\u00a0(Hopper and Turton, [2001](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib10)). Novel approaches include SDF-based placement\u00a0(Pan et\u00a0al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib23)) and spectral domain correlation\u00a0(Cui et\u00a0al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib6)), but they only support limited rotations. Sequence planning combines heuristics\u00a0(Lopez et\u00a0al., [2013](htt...",

We hope that this review could provide guidance for researchers in the field of 2D irregular packing.\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nTwo-dimensional (2D) irregular packing problems are widespread in industries such as machinery manufacturing, aviation, shipbuilding, automobile manufacturing, clothing and furniture manufacturing. An efficient 2D irregular packing algorithm can effectively improve material utilization and reduce processing costs. The reduction in material consumption will also have a beneficial impact on the environment ( [Ke et al., 2020](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B76)). Therefore, research of the packing problem is of great significance for technology and social interest.\n\nThe 2D packing problem is a type of combinatorial optimization problems to locate parts with different shapes compactly in one or more master sheet material to minimize the occupied space or maximize the utilization of the material. The 2D packing problem is currently recognized as a NP problem, which is mainly solved by heuristic algorithms. In recent years, many scholars have conducted research on 2D irregular packing problems with a verity of solutions.\n\nThere exists a number of review articles on packing and cutting problems. We have summarized the main review literature in the field of 2D packing and cutting as shown in [Table 1](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#T1). Brown ( [Brown, 1971](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B17)) introduced an optimum packing and depletion problem with optimization of space and resource usage. Harvey ( [Salkin and De Kluyver, 1975](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B116)) surveyed the application of mathematical optimization models such as linear programming to the knapsack problem. Bruce ( [Golden, 1976](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B50)) surveyed various approaches to the cutting stock problem. Hinxman ( [Hinxman, 1980](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B65)) surveyed the trim-loss and assortment problems, this research paid more attention to cutting and packaging problems in practical applications, and did not mention much about theoretical methods. Garey and Coffman ( [Garey and Johnson, 1981](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B47); [Coffman et al., 1984](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B27)) surveyed the approximation algorithms for bin packing problems. Israni ( [Israni and Sanders, 1982](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B72)) reviewed the 2D cutting stock problem including almost all 2D packaging problems. The author also proposed a rectangular layout method. Sarin ( [Sarin, 1983](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B118)) reviewed methodologies and literature to solve 2D stock cutting problems and introduced an interactive optimization procedure for a general 2D stock cutting problem. Dyckhoff ( [Dyckhoff et al., 1985](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B38)) described a trim loss and related problems and categorized them briefly. Dudzi\u0144ski ( [Dudzi\u0144ski and Walukiewicz, 1987](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B36)) summarized the exact methods for knapsack problems, such as linear programming. Matthias ( [Rode and Rosenberg, 1987](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B114)) analyzed the algorithm for the trim-loss problems. Haessler ( [Haessler and Sweeney, 1991](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B59)) reviewed the solution process of cutting stock problems, including placement algorithm and sequence optimization algorithm. Dowsland ( [Dowsland and Dowsland, 1992](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B34)) reviewed the application of operations research methods to the packing problem and summarized some exact heuristics. Sweeney ( [Sweeney and Paternoster, 1992](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B128)) categorized cutting and packing problems and made application-oriented research records. Cheng ( [Cheng et al., 1994](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B22)) discussed 2D cutting stock problems and their application cases including the pallet loading problem and VLSI placement problem. With the gradual deepening of research on 2D layout problems, typology becomes a common research topic. 2D regular and irregular layout problems are clearly distinguished in practical applications and theoretical methods. Dowsland ( [Dowsland and Dowsland, 1995](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B29)) gave a special review of the 2D irregular nesting problem for the first time. Mavridou ( [Mavridou and Pardalos, 1997](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B98)) summarized applications of the genetic algorithm and simulated annealing algorithm in the optimization of facility layout problems. Dyckhoff ( [Dyckhoff, 1990](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B37)) made a typology of the cutting and packing problems in detail, and W\u00e4scher ( [W\u00e4scher et al., 2007](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B135)) improved the typology later. Hopper ( [Hopper and Turton, 1999](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B67); [Hopper and Turton, 2001a](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B68); [Hopper and Turton, 2001b](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B69)) investigated the application of meta-heuristic and heuristic algorithms in 2D and 3D packing problems. Lodi ( [Lodi et al., 2002a](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B90); [Lodi et al., 2002b](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B91)) reviewed algorithms proposed in the 1990s of 2D packing problems. Bennell et al. ( [Bennell and Oliveira, 2008](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B10); [Bennell and Oliveira, 2009](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B9)) discussed 2D irregular packing problems and related geometric problems.

The goal of this optimization problem is to place a set of irregular\npolygons onto a material sheet without overlapping and in a way that minimizes wasted\nmaterial.\nIn this thesis, we delve into a fast 2D packing algorithm that automatically arranges\nparts of a user\u2019s design onto their available material sheets to provide live feedback on\nhow much material they have left. To do this, we make use of the concept of the no fit\npolygon to generate candidate placements, and we utilize custom heuristics and performance\noptimization to improve packing quality and runtime .\nOur technical evaluation shows that the implementation is fast enough to work at\ninteractive speeds and produce solutions of similar quality to other tools and algorithms that\nperform automated packing.\nThesis Supervisor: Stefanie Mueller\nTitle: Assistant Professor\n3\n4\nAcknowledgments\nFirst of all, I would like to extend my deepest gratitude to my advisor, Professor Stefanie\nMueller. She has been especially supportive during these trying times and has always been\navailable to give guidance and instruction. I would also like to give the hugest of thank yous\nto Ticha Sethapakdi and Daniel Anderson without whom this thesis could not have been\npossible. Ticha was the mastermind of Fabricaide and its user interface, and also somehow\nsimultaneously manages to be one of the coolest and one of the most awkward people I\nknow. Dan was always available to provide guidance and support in wrangling with C++\nand other difficult aspects of the implementation. Even outside the context of working on\nFabricaide, Ticha and Dan have been great friends and role models throughout the time I\ngot to know them. I could not have asked for a better group of mentors and colleagues than\nProfessor Mueller, Ticha and Dan.\nI am extremely grateful to my friends and family both here in the MIT community as\nwell as back home in the Philippines all the way at the other side of the world. I am thankful\nfor all the love and concern I\u2019ve received from them in spite of current circumstances.\nFinally, I would like to thank the rest of the Human Computer Interaction Engineering\nGroup for creative such a fun and welcoming environment. Be it sharing and discussing\nideas during lab meetings or hitting the dance floor with Just Dance for celebrations, I have\nnever had a boring moment with this great group of people.\nLanguage and Figure Note\nThroughout this thesis, I use the word \u201cwe\u201d to signify that this work has been a group effort.\nHowever, the work that is provided in detail is my own. Figures and images were jointly\ncreated by the project team.\n5\n6\nContents\n1 Introduction 13\n2 Related Work 15\n2.1 Preparing Designs for Laser Cutting . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 15\n2.2 Arranging Parts of a 2D Design . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 16\n3 Packing Algorithm 19\n3.1 Preliminaries . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 19\n3.1.1 No Fit Polygons . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 19\n3.1.2 Applying NFPs to the Packing Problem . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 20\n3.1.3 Bin Selection . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 21\n3.2 Overview . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 23\n3.3 Implementation . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 24\n3.3.1 Sheets with Holes . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 24\n3.3.2 Basic Part Placement Algorithm . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 24\n3.3.3 Order and Rotations of Parts . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 25\n3.3.4 Heuristics . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 29\n3.3.5 Placement across Multiple Sheets . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 30\n3.3.6 Partial Packing . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 32\n3.3.7 Complexity Analysis . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 33\n3.4 Implementation Optimizations . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 35\n3.4.1 Caching of NFPs . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 35\n3.4.2 Incremental Heuristic Calculation . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 36\n7\n3.4.3 Shape Dilation and Simplification . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 36\n3.5 Technical Evaluation of Part Placement Algorithm . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 37\n3.5.1 Benchmark Dataset . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 37\n3.5.2 Benchmark Setup . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 38\n3.5.3 Evaluation of Runtime . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 38\n3.5.4 Evaluation of Solution Quality . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 39\n3.5.5 Additional Evaluation for Standard Datasets . . . . . . . . . . . . . 40\n4 Fabricaide System Overview 43\n4.1 Core System Features . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 43\n4.1.1 Drawing Parts and Assigning Materials . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 43\n4.1.2 Live Packing Previews . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 44\n4.1.3 Material Warnings and Suggested Substitutes . . . . . . . . . . . . 46\n4.1.4 Material Utilization . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 47\n4.2 Implementation . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 47\n4.2.1 Splitting a Design into Constituent Materials . . . . . . . . . . . . 47\n4.2.2 Calculating Material Utilization . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 48\n4.3 Qualitative Evaluation of Fabricaide . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 49\n4.3.1 User Study Procedure . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 49\n4.3.2 User Study Findings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 49\n5 Conclusions 53\n8\nList of Figures\n3-1 A fixed-position polygon (black), a polygon to place (gray), and their NFP\n(red).

The classic packing solution is a hybrid algorithm based on heuristic positioning and meta-heuristic sequencing, which has the problems of complex solving rules and high time cost. In this study, the similarity measurement method based on the twin neural network model is used to evaluate the similarity of pieces in the source task and the target task. The reusability evaluation of packing tasks is designed to select appropriate source task knowledge. The transfer operator is used to transfer the piece sequence knowledge from the source task to complete the reuse of packing knowledge in the target task. The bottom-left algorithm is improved to complete the placement of 2D irregular pieces. The computational experiments show that the proposed algorithm for the bin packing problem using knowledge reuse and improved heuristic (KRIH) has good robustness. The KRIH algorithm can obtain 8 equal or better results on 16 instances in a relatively short time compared with some classical heuristic algorithms, which has good application potential.\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n![](https://media.springernature.com/w215h120/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-025-94748-x/MediaObjects/41598_2025_94748_Fig1_HTML.png)\n### [A sampling-based winner determination model and algorithm for logistics service procurement auctions under double uncertainty](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-94748-x?fromPaywallRec=false)\nArticleOpen access08 April 2025\n![](https://media.springernature.com/w215h120/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-023-40974-0/MediaObjects/41598_2023_40974_Fig1_HTML.png)\n### [Predicting elastic and plastic properties of small iron polycrystals by machine learning](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-40974-0?fromPaywallRec=false)\nArticleOpen access26 August 2023\n![](https://media.springernature.com/w215h120/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-025-07730-y/MediaObjects/41598_2025_7730_Fig1_HTML.png)\n### [Research on dimension measurement algorithm for parcel boxes in high-speed sorting system](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-07730-y?fromPaywallRec=false)\nArticleOpen access01 July 2025\n## Introduction\nPacking problems are commonly found in industries such as mechanical manufacturing, aviation, clothing, automotive manufacturing, shipbuilding, and furniture manufacturing. The manufacturing process of typical heavy industry products is shown in Fig.[1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#Fig1). In actual production, efficient packing algorithms can improve the utilization of raw materials and reduce production costs within an acceptable time. In a sense, the reduction of raw material consumption can have a beneficial impact on the environment[1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#ref-CR1). Packing problems, also known as bin packing problems or nesting problems, can be divided into three categories[2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#ref-CR2): the one-dimensional (1D) packing problem (wire cutting stock problem)[3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#ref-CR3),[4](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#ref-CR4), the two-dimensional (2D) packing problem (planar packing problem)[5](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#ref-CR5),[6](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#ref-CR6)and the three-dimensional (3D) packing problem[7](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#ref-CR7). The 2D packing problem is an interesting combinatorial optimization problem, which is used to place pieces of different shapes on one or more plates according to certain rules to minimize the space occupied by pieces or maximize the utilization of raw materials. The pieces here are general terms. In the metal processing industry, it refers to the pieces to be processed. In the garment manufacturing industry, it refers to the sample to be cut. And in the logistics industry, it refers to the goods to be placed. The packing problem has a large solution space and is an NP-complete (NP-C) problem, and the optimal solution cannot be obtained in polynomial time[8](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#ref-CR8). According to the regularity of piece shape, 2D packing problems can be further divided into 2D regular and 2D irregular packing problems. Among them, 2D irregular packing problems have received widespread attention due to their more diverse piece shapes and complex packing operations. Compared with the rectangular packing problem, the 2D irregular piece packing problem is very different in constraint calculation, solution strategy, overlap detection, so it has a larger solution space and more complicated technical operation. The 2D irregular piece packing has more applications in actual production. For 2D irregular packing problems, the existing research focuses on finding the approximate optimal solution or satisfactory solution within an acceptable time. The solving of the 2D irregular packing problem often involves two stages: sequence optimization and position optimization. In the sequence optimization stage, the sequence of pieces arranged on the plate is optimized. In the position optimization stage, the final placement scheme of pieces on the plate is determined.

Is it possible that the polygons you and your users want to tessellate can be characterized more narrowly? Such as sides being parallel, and maybe the polygons look like thickened strokes? Could you perhaps supply some more examples of what you're looking for?\n\n\u2013\u00a0[brainjam](https://stackoverflow.com/users/242848/brainjam)\n\nCommentedJul 23, 2010 at 3:04\n\n- Are there any constraints on the segments making up the polygons? For example, they always have sides oriented at multiples of X degrees, or the corners are aways angles multiple of Y degrees? I'm trying to figure out if we can have an _exact_ algorithm (fixed point operations), that doesn't run into this sort of problems: [flixxy.com/geometric-puzzle-solution-i.jpg](http://www.flixxy.com/geometric-puzzle-solution-i.jpg).\n\n\u2013\u00a0[Mau](https://stackoverflow.com/users/334220/mau)\n\nCommentedJul 23, 2010 at 10:06\n\n\n[Add a comment](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3303689/efficient-packing-algorithm-for-irregular-polygons)\u00a0\\|\n\n## 2 Answers 2\n\nSorted by:\n[Reset to default](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3303689/efficient-packing-algorithm-for-irregular-polygons?answertab=scoredesc#tab-top)\n\nHighest score (default)Trending (recent votes count more)Date modified (newest first)Date created (oldest first)\n\n8\n\nI don't know if this would give the optimal answer, but it would at least give an answer:\n\n1. Compute a Delaunay triangulation for the given polygon. There are standard algorithms to do this which will run very quickly for 100 vertices or fewer (see, for example, [this library here.](http://code.google.com/p/poly2tri/)) Using a Delaunay triangulation should ensure that you don't have too many long, thin triangles.\n2. Divide any non-right triangles into two right triangles by dropping an altitude from the largest angle to the opposite side.\n3. Search for triangles that you can combine into rectangles: any two congruent right triangles (not mirror images) which share a hypotenuse. I suspect there won't be too many of these in the general case unless your irregular polygon had a lot of right angles to begin with.\n\nI realize that's a lot of detail to fill in, but I think starting with a Delaunay triangulation is probably the way to go. Delaunay triangulations in the plane can be computed efficiently and they generally look quite \"natural\".\n\nEDITED TO ADD: since we're in ad-hoc heuristicville, in addition to the greedy algorithms being discussed in other answers you should also consider some kind of divide and conquer strategy. If the shape is non-convex like your example, divide it into convex shapes by repeatedly cutting from a reflex vertex to another vertex in a way that comes as close to bisecting the reflex angle as possible. Once you've divided the shape into convex pieces, I'd consider next dividing the convex pieces into pieces with nice \"bases\", pieces with at least one side having two acute or right angles at its ends. If any piece doesn't have such a \"base\" you should be able to divide it in two along a diameter of the piece, and get two new pieces which each have a \"base\" (I think). This should reduce the problem to dealing with convex polygons which are kinda-sorta trapezoidal, and from there a greedy algorithm should do well. I think this algorithm will subdivide the original shape in a fairly natural way until you get to the kinda-sorta trapezoidal pieces.\n\n[Share](https://stackoverflow.com/a/3313753)\n\n[Improve this answer](https://stackoverflow.com/posts/3313753/edit)\n\nFollow\n\n[edited Jul 23, 2010 at 12:50](https://stackoverflow.com/posts/3313753/revisions)\n\nanswered Jul 22, 2010 at 21:42\n\n[![Peter Milley's user avatar](https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/eb2a346fde4e2c5dc426aa702d181443?s=64&d=identicon&r=PG)](https://stackoverflow.com/users/298736/peter-milley)\n\n[Peter Milley](https://stackoverflow.com/users/298736/peter-milley) Peter Milley\n\n2,7781919 silver badges1818 bronze badges\n\n5\n\n- +1 for a solid breakdown answer. My first go-round that's actually what I did. Unfortunately, because it's not specifically designed to create rectangles, it's unusual (except in super special cases) to find any combination of those triangles that create a rectangle. The users complained that the breakdown seemed too complicated.

The MPP problem involves a\nconvex polygonal container C and a polygon set P = {p1, p2, ..., pN }, where polygon piis\nassociated with a value vi. It seeks for a non-overlapping packing with the maximum total\nvalue. The challenge presents a total of 180 instances whose number of polygons ranges from\n28 to 50,000. The official document [4] gives a detailed description of the challenge.\nOur proposed algorithm employs a general process to solve these instances indiscriminately,\nand the overall framework is presented in Figure 1. We first partition a large-scale problem\ninto multiple small-scale subproblems (Section 2) and then solve each subproblem using\nupper-level polygon ordering (Section 3.1) and lower-level packing optimization techniques\n(Section 3.2). Section 4 presents our experimental results, followed by conclusions.\n1 Corresponding author: Zhouxing Su\n\u00a9 Canhui Luo, Zhouxing Su, and Zhipeng L\u00fc;\nlicensed under Creative Commons License CC-BY 4.0\n40th International Symposium on Computational Geometry (SoCG 2024).\nEditors: Wolfgang Mulzer and Jeff M.

It involves two components: partitioning the container C into\nmultiple regions and assigning polygons to each region.\n2.1 Container Partitioning\nThe container partitioning process consists of two steps, as shown in Figure 2. Initially, we\narrange two-dimensional square grids starting from the bottom-left corner of the bounding\nbox until the entire container is covered. The subregions formed by the intersection of the\ncontainer with all the grids constitute its partition C = C1 \u222a C2 \u222a ... \u222a Cm. Subsequently,\nwe merge the small subregions with adjacent grids, which are difficult to be used effectively.\nThe grid is dimensioned to keep the scale of each subproblem at approximately 300 polygons,\nmaking a trade-off between effectiveness and efficiency of lower-level packing optimization.\n2.2 Polygon Assignment\nWe adopt a simple approach of randomly assigning polygons to each subregion. Specifically, for\neach subregion Ci, we randomly select a polygon pj from P until\nP\nj\narea(pj )\narea(Ci) \u2265\nPN\ni=0\narea(pi)\narea(C)\n.\nThe advantage of random assignment lies in ensuring that the overall characteristics of each\nsubproblem align with the original problem.\nC.

We repeatedly select one remaining polygon with the\nhighest priority (ties are broken by value) and try to insert it into the current solution. If the\ninsertion with lower-level packing optimization fails, we skip the current polygon and turn to\nthe next one. For the majority of instances, the priority is defined as the value-to-area ratio\nof a polygon (we also call it unit value). Polygons with higher unit values are prioritized\nfor putting in the container, which is called the Unit Value First (UVF) strategy. For\nsmall-scale instances (N < 100), we employ the \u03b1\u03b2-random strategy. It randomly selects\n\u03b1% and \u03b2% of the polygons and reassigns their UVF-based priority to the highest and the\nlowest, respectively. These instances are run for multiple times to ensure comprehensive\noptimization, with \u03b1 and \u03b2 set to 10 in our implementation.\n3.2 Lower-Level Packing Optimization\nThe position of a polygon can be represented by the coordinates l = (x, y) of a reference point,\nsuch as the bottom-left corner of the boundary. Then, the translation of a polygon can be\nrepresented by a vector pointing from its original position to its new position. Given a feasible\npacking S and a polygon p to be placed, it is impossible to find a non-overlapping position\nfor p without moving other polygons in most cases. This section introduces the algorithm for\neliminating overlaps for an invalid packing, which involves solving an unconstrained nonlinear\nproblem and heuristic polygon movement.\nS o C G 2 0 2 4\n86:4 A General Heuristic Approach for Maximum Polygon Packing\n3.2.1 Overlap Minimization\nTo determine the appropriate translation for the polygons, we utilized the no-fit polygon\n(NFP) and inner-fit polygon (IFP), which are fundamental in algorithmic approaches to\ngeometric design and optimization challenges. For a fixed polygon pi and a movable polygon\npj , NFP(pi, pj ) describes their non-overlapping positions with boundaries in contact precisely,\nwhich can be utilized to determine the minimum translation for pj to avoid overlap. Similarly,\nIFP(pi, pj ) is employed to determine the minimum translation to place pj inside pi. Figure 3\nillustrates the polygon translations determined using NFP (left) and IFP (right). The readers\nmay refer to Burke et al. [2] for a more detailed description.\nFor a packing S, based on NFP and IFP, we define the overlap between polygons pi\nand pj as fij (S), representing the minimum translation to separate them, and f0i(S) as the\nminimum translation for moving pi to fit into the container. Subsequently, we employ the\nseparation algorithm proposed by Imamichi et al. [7] to minimize the overlap, which involves\nsolving an unconstrained nonlinear programming problem as follows:\nmin\nS\nF(S) = X\n0\u2264i<j\u2264N\nf\n2\nij (S) (1)\nThe model relaxes the non-overlapping constraint but introduces repulsion forces between\nany two overlapped polygons. We use the classic L-BFGS (limited memory BFGS) method\nto solve this problem. It makes the packing S converge to a local optimum but strongly\ndepends on the initial layout. ...",
