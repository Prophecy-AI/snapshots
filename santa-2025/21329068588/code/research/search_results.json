An efficient 2D irregular packing algorithm can effectively improve material utilization and reduce processing costs. The reduction in material consumption will also have a beneficial impact on the environment ( [Ke et al., 2020](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B76)). Therefore, research of the packing problem is of great significance for technology and social interest.\n\nThe 2D packing problem is a type of combinatorial optimization problems to locate parts with different shapes compactly in one or more master sheet material to minimize the occupied space or maximize the utilization of the material. The 2D packing problem is currently recognized as a NP problem, which is mainly solved by heuristic algorithms. In recent years, many scholars have conducted research on 2D irregular packing problems with a verity of solutions.\n\nThere exists a number of review articles on packing and cutting problems. We have summarized the main review literature in the field of 2D packing and cutting as shown in [Table 1](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#T1). Brown ( [Brown, 1971](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B17)) introduced an optimum packing and depletion problem with optimization of space and resource usage. Harvey ( [Salkin and De Kluyver, 1975](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B116)) surveyed the application of mathematical optimization models such as linear programming to the knapsack problem. Bruce ( [Golden, 1976](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B50)) surveyed various approaches to the cutting stock problem. Hinxman ( [Hinxman, 1980](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B65)) surveyed the trim-loss and assortment problems, this research paid more attention to cutting and packaging problems in practical applications, and did not mention much about theoretical methods. Garey and Coffman ( [Garey and Johnson, 1981](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B47); [Coffman et al., 1984](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B27)) surveyed the approximation algorithms for bin packing problems. Israni ( [Israni and Sanders, 1982](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B72)) reviewed the 2D cutting stock problem including almost all 2D packaging problems. The author also proposed a rectangular layout method. Sarin ( [Sarin, 1983](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B118)) reviewed methodologies and literature to solve 2D stock cutting problems and introduced an interactive optimization procedure for a general 2D stock cutting problem. Dyckhoff ( [Dyckhoff et al., 1985](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B38)) described a trim loss and related problems and categorized them briefly. Dudzi\u0144ski ( [Dudzi\u0144ski and Walukiewicz, 1987](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B36)) summarized the exact methods for knapsack problems, such as linear programming. Matthias ( [Rode and Rosenberg, 1987](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B114)) analyzed the algorithm for the trim-loss problems. Haessler ( [Haessler and Sweeney, 1991](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B59)) reviewed the solution process of cutting stock problems, including placement algorithm and sequence optimization algorithm. Dowsland ( [Dowsland and Dowsland, 1992](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B34)) reviewed the application of operations research methods to the packing problem and summarized some exact heuristics. Sweeney ( [Sweeney and Paternoster, 1992](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B128)) categorized cutting and packing problems and made application-oriented research records. Cheng ( [Cheng et al., 1994](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B22)) discussed 2D cutting stock problems and their application cases including the pallet loading problem and VLSI placement problem. With the gradual deepening of research on 2D layout problems, typology becomes a common research topic. 2D regular and irregular layout problems are clearly distinguished in practical applications and theoretical methods. Dowsland ( [Dowsland and Dowsland, 1995](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B29)) gave a special review of the 2D irregular nesting problem for the first time. Mavridou ( [Mavridou and Pardalos, 1997](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B98)) summarized applications of the genetic algorithm and simulated annealing algorithm in the optimization of facility layout problems. Dyckhoff ( [Dyckhoff, 1990](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B37)) made a typology of the cutting and packing problems in detail, and W\u00e4scher ( [W\u00e4scher et al., 2007](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B135)) improved the typology later. Hopper ( [Hopper and Turton, 1999](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B67); [Hopper and Turton, 2001a](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B68); [Hopper and Turton, 2001b](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B69)) investigated the application of meta-heuristic and heuristic algorithms in 2D and 3D packing problems.

The proposed attention-based diffusion model for 2D irregular packing, GFPack++, supports\ncontinuous rotation and accommodating arbitrary boundaries.\n\n## 1\\. Introduction\n\nIrregular shape packing is a classic challenge in operation research, with significant implications for various applications such as texture atlas generation and material utilization in manufacturing\u00a0(Wang et\u00a0al., [2021](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib34)). Its NP-hard nature requires practical and effective packing algorithms to optimize space utilization.\n\nTraditional numerical optimization methods are often slow and costly. Recently, learning-based methods have emerged as a promising alternative for irregular packing, mainly using reinforcement learning\u00a0(Xu et\u00a0al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib37); Yang et\u00a0al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib39)).\nAnother promising approach is the diffusion model, which learns geometric relationships from teacher packing examples and establishes a gradient field for all objects, guiding them to move simultaneously\u00a0(Hosseini et\u00a0al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib11); Xue et\u00a0al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib38)).\nIn particular, the work of (Xue et\u00a0al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib38)), namely GFPack, achieves a notable trade-off between computational cost and space utilization, demonstrating scalability in terms of polygon count and generalizability to rectangular container boundaries.\nHowever, it still faces unresolved issues, notably the lack of support for rotation, a relatively high occurrence of object collisions in results, and limited adaptability to arbitrary boundaries.\n\nThe main idea of the learning-based packing framework is to capture the geometric relationships between shapes, which are essential for the gradient computation.\nSuch relationships in latent space encompass multiple facets: the _spatial (position, orientation) relationship_ of the shapes, the _geometric features relationship_ among them, and the _container boundary conditions_ that constrain them.\nHowever, GFPack falls short in fully representing these relationships.\nIt solely focuses on the positional aspect, neglecting orientation, thus hindering rotational capabilities. Furthermore, it relies on PointNeXt\u00a0(Qian et\u00a0al., [2022](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib24)) for geometric feature extraction, ignoring critical details like polygon edges and resulting in a loss of topological and local features.\nThus, we argue that the full potential of gradient learning has not been thoroughly exploited in GFPack.\n\nIn this study, we introduce two primary strategies to tackle the challenge of learning packing policies.\nFirstly, we use a graph to represent each object and encode it with an _attention-based geometric encoder_, which can capture polygonal geometry information effectively.\nSecondly, we design an _attention-based relation encoding_ mechanism to encode intricate relationships both between polygons and among polygons and boundaries, eliminating the need to explicitly represent the relationships with a graph.\nThis attention-based diffusion model enhances the understanding of how objects interact with each other and the boundaries, resulting in superior performance in both training and inference.\nWe also investigate the utilization distribution between the teacher and inference data and design a weighting function to prioritize tighter teacher data during training, confirmed to be effective.\n\nThis paper makes the following contributions:\n\n1. -\n\n\nWe propose GFPack++, a novel packing framework that employs attention-based learning of gradient fields, supporting continuous rotation and enhancing generalization.\n\n2. -\n\n\nAdvancing beyond GFPack, we encapsulate geometric relationships in an attention-based encoder, incorporating mutual spatial (position, orientation) relationships of objects, their geometric features, and container boundary conditions, and a weighting function to facilitate effective learning policies.\n\n3. -\n\n\nGFPack++ achieves superior irregular packing results, demonstrating higher space utilization over several widely used baselines, one order of magnitude faster than the previous diffusion-based method, coupled with promising generalization for arbitrary boundaries.\n\n\n## 2\\. Related Work\n\n#### Traditional packing approaches\n\nTraditional methods usually involve placement optimization and sequence planning ( _c.f_.surveys\u00a0(Bennell and Oliveira, [2009](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib3); Leao et\u00a0al., [2020](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib18))). Most research focuses on placement optimization with heuristic rules (e.g., BL, BLF), NFP-based search\u00a0(Bennell and Song, [2008](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib4)), or mathematical models\u00a0(Hopper and Turton, [2001](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib10)). Novel approaches include SDF-based placement\u00a0(Pan et\u00a0al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib23)) and spectral domain correlation\u00a0(Cui et\u00a0al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib6)), but they only support limited rotations. Sequence planning combines heuristics\u00a0(Lopez et\u00a0al., [2013](htt...",

Could you perhaps supply some more examples of what you're looking for?\n\n\u2013\u00a0[brainjam](https://stackoverflow.com/users/242848/brainjam)\n\nCommentedJul 23, 2010 at 3:04\n\n- Are there any constraints on the segments making up the polygons? For example, they always have sides oriented at multiples of X degrees, or the corners are aways angles multiple of Y degrees? I'm trying to figure out if we can have an _exact_ algorithm (fixed point operations), that doesn't run into this sort of problems: [flixxy.com/geometric-puzzle-solution-i.jpg](http://www.flixxy.com/geometric-puzzle-solution-i.jpg).\n\n\u2013\u00a0[Mau](https://stackoverflow.com/users/334220/mau)\n\nCommentedJul 23, 2010 at 10:06\n\n\n[Add a comment](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3303689/efficient-packing-algorithm-for-irregular-polygons)\u00a0\\|\n\n## 2 Answers 2\n\nSorted by:\n[Reset to default](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3303689/efficient-packing-algorithm-for-irregular-polygons?answertab=scoredesc#tab-top)\n\nHighest score (default)Trending (recent votes count more)Date modified (newest first)Date created (oldest first)\n\n8\n\nI don't know if this would give the optimal answer, but it would at least give an answer:\n\n1. Compute a Delaunay triangulation for the given polygon. There are standard algorithms to do this which will run very quickly for 100 vertices or fewer (see, for example, [this library here.](http://code.google.com/p/poly2tri/)) Using a Delaunay triangulation should ensure that you don't have too many long, thin triangles.\n2. Divide any non-right triangles into two right triangles by dropping an altitude from the largest angle to the opposite side.\n3. Search for triangles that you can combine into rectangles: any two congruent right triangles (not mirror images) which share a hypotenuse. I suspect there won't be too many of these in the general case unless your irregular polygon had a lot of right angles to begin with.\n\nI realize that's a lot of detail to fill in, but I think starting with a Delaunay triangulation is probably the way to go. Delaunay triangulations in the plane can be computed efficiently and they generally look quite \"natural\".\n\nEDITED TO ADD: since we're in ad-hoc heuristicville, in addition to the greedy algorithms being discussed in other answers you should also consider some kind of divide and conquer strategy. If the shape is non-convex like your example, divide it into convex shapes by repeatedly cutting from a reflex vertex to another vertex in a way that comes as close to bisecting the reflex angle as possible. Once you've divided the shape into convex pieces, I'd consider next dividing the convex pieces into pieces with nice \"bases\", pieces with at least one side having two acute or right angles at its ends. If any piece doesn't have such a \"base\" you should be able to divide it in two along a diameter of the piece, and get two new pieces which each have a \"base\" (I think). This should reduce the problem to dealing with convex polygons which are kinda-sorta trapezoidal, and from there a greedy algorithm should do well. I think this algorithm will subdivide the original shape in a fairly natural way until you get to the kinda-sorta trapezoidal pieces.\n\n[Share](https://stackoverflow.com/a/3313753)\n\n[Improve this answer](https://stackoverflow.com/posts/3313753/edit)\n\nFollow\n\n[edited Jul 23, 2010 at 12:50](https://stackoverflow.com/posts/3313753/revisions)\n\nanswered Jul 22, 2010 at 21:42\n\n[![Peter Milley's user avatar](https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/eb2a346fde4e2c5dc426aa702d181443?s=64&d=identicon&r=PG)](https://stackoverflow.com/users/298736/peter-milley)\n\n[Peter Milley](https://stackoverflow.com/users/298736/peter-milley) Peter Milley\n\n2,7781919 silver badges1818 bronze badges\n\n5\n\n- +1 for a solid breakdown answer. My first go-round that's actually what I did. Unfortunately, because it's not specifically designed to create rectangles, it's unusual (except in super special cases) to find any combination of those triangles that create a rectangle. The users complained that the breakdown seemed too complicated.

In this post we&#x27;ll have a look what goes into collision detection as well as a strategy to pack any arbitrary shape in 2D.\n#### By[Ahmad Moussa](https://www.gorillasun.de/author/ahmad/)\nPublished on July 22, 2022\nLast Updated on August 28, 2024\n21 min read\n![A Simple Solution for Shape Packing in 2D](https://www.gorillasun.de/content/images/size/w1200/2023/03/banner2.jpg)\nThis blog post is about the age-old creative coding problem of shape packing! Even though it might seem like a simple task at first, it is actually quite an involved undertaking. It also usually entails having a broader look at how collision detection algorithms work. In the following sections we'll work our way up to an algorithm with which you can essentially pack any sort of geometric shapes, and combinations thereof.\n![](https://www.gorillasun.de/content/images/2023/03/example1.jpg)\n![](https://www.gorillasun.de/content/images/2023/03/example2.jpg)\nBefore we begin, I want to point out that I had a first encounter with this algo back in February of 2022. I never completed that particular idea, but it led to an interesting packing scheme. You can see some of the artworks my code produced above.\n![](https://www.gorillasun.de/content/images/2023/03/maplands.jpg)\nI also recently learned that a few others have made their own version of this idea. In June I faced a packing problem where I had to draw all sorts of geometric shapes to the canvas. I was left scratching my head at first and it took me quite a while to find a solution. While researching different methods I came across[Amy Goodchild\u2019s](https://twitter.com/amygoodchild?ref=gorillasun.de)[writeup](https://www.amygoodchild.com/blog/maplands?ref=gorillasun.de)on a wonderful sketch of hers called \"Maplands\" where she used a similar strategy to what I ultimately did to implement my idea.\n![](https://www.gorillasun.de/content/images/2023/03/fruitpacking.jpg)\nLater on I also re-discovered[Tarwin Stroh-Spijer's](https://twitter.com/tarwin?ref=gorillasun.de)[fruit salad packing sketch](https://openprocessing.org/sketch/1533577?ref=gorillasun.de), which initially evolved from[Jeff's (aka ippsketch)](https://twitter.com/ippsketch?ref=gorillasun.de)[banana packing sketch](https://ippsketch.com/posts/non-circular-packing/?ref=gorillasun.de). I had a thorough look at Tarwin's beautifully written packing library, and a lot of the code in later sections of this post are based on Tarwin's method.

[Closing Notes](#closing-notes)## Packing Algorithms in Generative Art\n![](https://www.gorillasun.de/content/images/2023/03/tripack.jpg)\nPacking problems come in various flavours, but generally their overarching concern is positioning items as densely as possible within a given area. Despite its deceptive simplicity, bin packing is actually an[NP-Hard problem](https://stackoverflow.com/a/19510170?ref=gorillasun.de), with it's associated decision problem (checking if the items to be packed fit in a certain area), is[NP-Complete](https://gorillasun.de/blog/rectangle-packing-an-incredibly-difficult-problem?ref=gorillasun.de). Understanding this is not necessary for what follows however. I just find it incredibly interesting though, I keep finding myself coming back to this problem thinking: \"Surely this can't be this difficult!\"\nPacking algorithms are useful for a range of real life scenarios, such as packing boxes in a warehouse, or positioning shapes on a sheet of laser cutting material such that the amount of wasted material is minimised. Packing is a heavily researched area of mathematics and fairly advanced algorithms have been developed to solve different variations of it. In generative art the primary goal of packing algorithms is often the creation of visually pleasing and interesting packing patterns. We also often don't start with shapes that have a pre-determined size (usually real life objects have a pre-determined size duh), but make them up on the go.\nHence gen-art packing algorithms vary a little in that regard. I'd like to show off a few artworks that have in one another or another been made with packing algorithms. Here's two stunning artworks from[Caleb Ogg](https://twitter.com/iso_hedron?ref=gorillasun.de):\n![](https://www.gorillasun.de/content/images/2023/03/Colorshift2.jpg)\n![](https://www.gorillasun.de/content/images/2023/03/Lens3.jpg)\nCaleb's pieces[Lens 3](https://superrare.com/0x6125e13fc97f6fc97ea14cf925211e4dc0e99f0f/lens-3-18?ref=gorillasun.de)and[Colorshift 2](https://superrare.com/0x6125e13fc97f6fc97ea14cf925211e4dc0e99f0f/colorshift-2-12?ref=gorillasun.de), part of his ongoing 'Coalesce' series, are some of the most interesting circle packing sketches I've seen in a while. Note that the images shown here (2000x2000px) don't do the originals justice which are absolutely gigantic (16000x16000px). Built on a system of circles and rings, Caleb makes use of an underlying noise field for a nifty creative effect. I especially like how Lens conveys the illusion of multiple overlapping lenses that appear to contort the coloration of the underlying circles, which is done by scaling and multiplying the underlying noise field. Excited to see where this series is heading, always a pleasure when Caleb's sketches bless my timeline.\nA little less recent[example](https://www.infinite.center/2015/08/08/circles-inside-circles/?ref=gorillasun.de)of a circle packing sketch is by none other than Jared Tarbell:\n![](https://www.gorillasun.de/content/images/2023/03/javadpack.jpg)\nAs well as this[beautiful homage](https://www.reddit.com/r/generative/comments/ibk6pf/circle_packing_\u00e0_la_tarbell/?ref=gorillasun.de)to Jared's sketch by prolific creative coder[Dmitri Cherniak](https://twitter.com/dmitricherniak?ref=gorillasun.de):\n![](https://www.gorillasun.de/content/images/2023/03/dimitripack-1.webp)\nIf you like these patterns you should also check out the[Appolonian Gasket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollonian_gasket?ref=gorillasun.de)(alternatively Appolonian circle packing). And for good measure we also need to mention[Yann LeGalle](https://twitter.com/Yann_LeGall?ref=gorillasun.de)who just utterly blows my mind on a regular basis:\nAnd one of the earliest ones that captivated me and initially motivated me to explore circle packing for myself was this sketch by Piter Pasma's:\n> [> > > > > > > > View this post on Instagram\n> > > > > > > > > > > > ](https://www.instagram.com/p/CLEl7WGH6j8/?utm_source=ig_embed&utm_campaign=loading)\n[> A post shared by Piter Pasma (@piterpasma)\n](https://www.instagram.com/p/CLEl7WGH6j8/?utm_source=ig_embed&utm_campaign=loading)\nI really love this one.

The goal of this optimization problem is to place a set of irregular\npolygons onto a material sheet without overlapping and in a way that minimizes wasted\nmaterial.\nIn this thesis, we delve into a fast 2D packing algorithm that automatically arranges\nparts of a user\u2019s design onto their available material sheets to provide live feedback on\nhow much material they have left. To do this, we make use of the concept of the no fit\npolygon to generate candidate placements, and we utilize custom heuristics and performance\noptimization to improve packing quality and runtime .\nOur technical evaluation shows that the implementation is fast enough to work at\ninteractive speeds and produce solutions of similar quality to other tools and algorithms that\nperform automated packing.\nThesis Supervisor: Stefanie Mueller\nTitle: Assistant Professor\n3\n4\nAcknowledgments\nFirst of all, I would like to extend my deepest gratitude to my advisor, Professor Stefanie\nMueller.

It takes a lot of work just to fit as many circles into a square as possible, for example. When the original polygon is complicated--as in the illustration--you need some powerful optimization procedures. The best method I have found for this problem is simulated annealing, but that won't be available in ArcGIS and it would take extremely crafty scripting to script it (ArcGIS is too slow). Could you perhaps relax your requirements a little, such as fitting the smaller polygon a _sufficient_ number of times, rather than as many times as possible?\n\n\u2013\u00a0[whuber](https://gis.stackexchange.com/users/664/whuber)\n\nCommentedJun 12, 2012 at 17:36\n\n- 1\n\n\n\n\n\n@whuber Thanks for editing my post. Yeah, sufficient number of times would work. Or, how about at a given angle orientation. ex. in the image above, I have fit the polygon as many times as i could have at that orientation, had I rotated them 90 degrees you could fit one more...\n\n\u2013\u00a0[Thad](https://gis.stackexchange.com/users/4679/thad)\n\nCommentedJun 12, 2012 at 17:41\n\n- 1\n\n\n\n\n\nYes, but it's also fraught with pitfalls. Some are elementary. For example, the ESRI-authored and -published text, \"Getting to Know ArcView GIS\" (for version 3) included an exercise in which a rectangle representing a soccer field was placed interactively within a polygon. The problem was, the exercise's answer was _wrong_ because the author failed to project the data and the errors in using geographic coordinates were large enough to affect the result. The answer looked good in the GIS, but if anyone had attempted to build that field, they would have found there wasn't enough room for it :-).\n\n\u2013\u00a0[whuber](https://gis.stackexchange.com/users/664/whuber)\n\nCommentedJun 12, 2012 at 18:58\n\n- 6\n\n\n\n\n\n@whuber I guess they thought a \"ball park\" figure was sufficient.\n\n\u2013\u00a0[Kirk Kuykendall](https://gis.stackexchange.com/users/59/kirk-kuykendall)\n\nCommentedJun 14, 2012 at 20:08\n\n- 2\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the general case of irregular polygon within irregular polygon, this is a computationally intractable problem: Finding an optimal solution is not a plausible goal in all cases, and it's likely NP-complete from a technical perspective: Which cases those are cannot be predetermined. If you constrain the problem significantly, some iterative random fitting algorithms are likely to give you _reasonably high_ numbers. My feeling if this is an assignment is that they're not looking for the _correct_ answer, they're looking for creative approaches.\n\n\u2013\u00a0[MappingTomorrow](https://gis.stackexchange.com/users/8027/mappingtomorrow)\n\nCommentedJun 14, 2012 at 23:28\n\n\n\\|\u00a0[Show **9** more comments](https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/27303/packing-polygons-within-polygon-using-arcgis-desktop)\n\n## 3 Answers 3\n\nSorted by:\n[Reset to default](https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/27303/packing-polygons-within-polygon-using-arcgis-desktop?answertab=scoredesc#tab-top)\n\nHighest score (default)Date modified (newest first)Date created (oldest first)\n\n22\n\n+150\n\n**There are many ways to approach this problem.** The raster format of the data suggests a raster-based approach; in reviewing those approaches, a formulation of the problem as a [binary integer linear program](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming#Integer_unknowns) looks promising, because it is very much in the spirit of many GIS site-selection analyses and can readily be adapted to them.\n\nIn this formulation, we enumerate all possible positions and orientations of the filling polygon(s), which I will refer to as \"tiles.\" Associated with each tile is a measure of its \"goodness.\" The objective is to find a collection of non-overlapping tiles whose total goodness is as large as possible. Here, we can take the goodness of each tile to be the area it covers. (In more data-rich and sophisticated decision environments, we may be computing the goodness as a combination of properties of the cells included within each tile, properties perhaps related to visibility, proximity to other things, and so on.)\n\nThe constraints on this problem are simply that no two tiles within a solution may overlap.\n\n**This can be framed a little more abstractly,** in a way conducive to efficient computation, by enumerating the cells in the polygon to be filled (the \"region\") 1, 2, ..., _M_. Any tile placement can be encoded with an _indicator_ vector of zeros and ones, letting the ones correspond to cells covered by the tile and zeros elsewhere. In this encoding, all the information needed about a collection of tiles can be found by _summing_ their indicator vectors (component by component, as usual): the sum will be nonzero exactly where at least one tile covers a cell and the sum will be greater than one anywhere two or more tiles overlap. (The sum effectively counts the amount of overlap.)\n\nOne more little abstraction: the set of possible tile placements can itself be enumerated, say 1, 2, ..., _N_. The selection of any set of tile placements itself corresponds to an indicator vector where the ones designate the tiles to be placed.\n\n**Here's a tiny illustration to fix the ideas**. It is accompanied with the _Mathematica_ code used to do the calculations, so that the programming difficulty (or lack thereof) can be evident.\n\nFirst, we depict a region to be tiled:\n\n```\nregion =  {{0, 0, 1, 1}, {1, 1, 1, 1}, {1, 1, 1, 1}, {1, 1, 1, 1}};\n\n```\n\n![Figure 1: region](https://i.sstatic.net/pMES9.png)\n\nIf we number its cells from left to right, starting at the top, the indicator vector for the region has 16 entries:\n\n```\nFlatten[region]\n\n```\n\n> {0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1}\n\nLet's use the following tile, along with all rotations by multiples of 90 degrees:\n\n```\ntileSet = ...",

An efficient 2D irregular packing algorithm can effectively improve material utilization and reduce processing costs. The reduction in material consumption will also have a beneficial impact on the environment ([Ke et al., 2020](#B76)). Therefore, research of the packing problem is of great significance for technology and social interest.\nThe 2D packing problem is a type of combinatorial optimization problems to locate parts with different shapes compactly in one or more master sheet material to minimize the occupied space or maximize the utilization of the material. The 2D packing problem is currently recognized as a NP problem, which is mainly solved by heuristic algorithms. In recent years, many scholars have conducted research on 2D irregular packing problems with a verity of solutions.\nThere exists a number of review articles on packing and cutting problems. We have summarized the main review literature in the field of 2D packing and cutting as shown in[Table 1](#T1). Brown ([Brown, 1971](#B17)) introduced an optimum packing and depletion problem with optimization of space and resource usage. Harvey ([Salkin and De Kluyver, 1975](#B116)) surveyed the application of mathematical optimization models such as linear programming to the knapsack problem. Bruce ([Golden, 1976](#B50)) surveyed various approaches to the cutting stock problem. Hinxman ([Hinxman, 1980](#B65)) surveyed the trim-loss and assortment problems, this research paid more attention to cutting and packaging problems in practical applications, and did not mention much about theoretical methods. Garey and Coffman ([Garey and Johnson, 1981](#B47);[Coffman et al., 1984](#B27)) surveyed the approximation algorithms for bin packing problems. Israni ([Israni and Sanders, 1982](#B72)) reviewed the 2D cutting stock problem including almost all 2D packaging problems. The author also proposed a rectangular layout method. Sarin ([Sarin, 1983](#B118)) reviewed methodologies and literature to solve 2D stock cutting problems and introduced an interactive optimization procedure for a general 2D stock cutting problem. Dyckhoff ([Dyckhoff et al., 1985](#B38)) described a trim loss and related problems and categorized them briefly. Dudzi&#x00144;ski ([Dudzi&#x00144;ski and Walukiewicz, 1987](#B36)) summarized the exact methods for knapsack problems, such as linear programming. Matthias ([Rode and Rosenberg, 1987](#B114)) analyzed the algorithm for the trim-loss problems. Haessler ([Haessler and Sweeney, 1991](#B59)) reviewed the solution process of cutting stock problems, including placement algorithm and sequence optimization algorithm. Dowsland ([Dowsland and Dowsland, 1992](#B34)) reviewed the application of operations research methods to the packing problem and summarized some exact heuristics. Sweeney ([Sweeney and Paternoster, 1992](#B128)) categorized cutting and packing problems and made application-oriented research records. Cheng ([Cheng et al., 1994](#B22)) discussed 2D cutting stock problems and their application cases including the pallet loading problem and VLSI placement problem. With the gradual deepening of research on 2D layout problems, typology becomes a common research topic. 2D regular and irregular layout problems are clearly distinguished in practical applications and theoretical methods. Dowsland ([Dowsland and Dowsland, 1995](#B29)) gave a special review of the 2D irregular nesting problem for the first time. Mavridou ([Mavridou and Pardalos, 1997](#B98)) summarized applications of the genetic algorithm and simulated annealing algorithm in the optimization of facility layout problems. Dyckhoff ([Dyckhoff, 1990](#B37)) made a typology of the cutting and packing problems in detail, and W&#x000e4;scher ([W&#x000e4;scher et al., 2007](#B135)) improved the typology later. Hopper ([Hopper and Turton, 1999](#B67);[Hopper and Turton, 2001a](#B68);[Hopper and Turton, 2001b](#B69)) investigated the application of meta-heuristic and heuristic algorithms in 2D and 3D packing problems. Lodi ([Lodi et al., 2002a](#B90);[Lodi et al., 2002b](#B91)) reviewed algorithms proposed in the 1990s of 2D packing problems. Bennell et al. ([Bennell and Oliveira, 2008](#B10);[Bennell and Oliveira, 2009](#B9)) discussed 2D irregular packing problems and related geometric problems. Leao ([Leao et al., 2020](#B81)) introduced the mathematical models in the 2D irregular packing problem.\nTABLE 1\n[![www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/966691/fmech-08-966691-HTML/image_m/fmech-08-966691-t001.jpg)](https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/966691/fmech-08-966691-HTML/image_m/fmech-08-966691-t001.jpg)\n**TABLE 1**. Review literature in the field of cutting and packing problems.\nThe scope of these reviews is broad, mainly for all 2D packing problems including rectangular packing and other regular packing problems. These review papers are out of date with missed innovative algorithms of 2D irregular packing. Since 2010, only Leao ([Leao et al., 2020](#B81)) reviewed 2D irregular packing problems. But he only introduced the mathematical models, instead of reviewing 2D irregular packing problems comprehensively. In recent years, there is not ...",
