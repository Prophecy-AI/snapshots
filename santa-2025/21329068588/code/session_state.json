      "strategy": "# Santa 2025 - Christmas Tree Packing Optimization\n\n## Problem Overview\nThis is a 2D irregular polygon packing optimization problem. The goal is to pack Christmas tree toys (1-200 trees per configuration) into the smallest possible square bounding box.\n\n**Scoring Formula:** score = \u03a3(s_n\u00b2/n) for n=1 to 200, where s_n is the side length of the bounding square for n trees.\n**Target Score:** 68.894234 (lower is better)\n**Best Achieved:** ~70.647 (gap of ~1.75 points, 2.5%)\n**Best Pre-optimized:** `/home/nonroot/snapshots/santa-2025/21328309254/code/submission.csv` (score: 70.647327)\n\n## Tree Geometry\nThe Christmas tree is a 15-vertex polygon with:\n- Trunk: width=0.15, height=0.2\n- Three tiers of branches (base_w=0.7, mid_w=0.4, top_w=0.25)\n- Tip at y=0.8, base at y=0\n- Total height: 1.0 (from trunk bottom at -0.2 to tip at 0.8)\n\nVertices (TX, TY):\n```python\nTX = [0, 0.125, 0.0625, 0.2, 0.1, 0.35, 0.075, 0.075, -0.075, -0.075, -0.35, -0.1, -0.2, -0.0625, -0.125]\nTY = [0.8, 0.5, 0.5, 0.25, 0.25, 0, 0, -0.2, -0.2, 0, 0, 0.25, 0.25, 0.5, 0.5]\n```\n\n## Insights from Discussions (MANDATORY)\n\n### Discussion \"Why the winning solutions will be Asymmetric\" (38 votes)\n- Asymmetric solutions outperform symmetric/lattice solutions for most N values\n- The tree shape has no rotational symmetry, so optimal packings are inherently asymmetric\n- For large N, tessellation helps but still needs asymmetric fine-tuning\n\n### Discussion \"Expected Leaderboard Progression\" (20 votes)\n- Top scores expected to converge around 68.9-69.0 range\n- Diminishing returns after extensive optimization\n- Focus on N values with highest score contribution\n\n### Discussion \"Where do these high-scoring CSVs originate from?\" (12 votes)\n- Best solutions come from long-running C++ optimizers\n- Telegram groups share optimized solutions\n- Ensemble of multiple sources is key strategy\n\n## What Discussions Say DOESN'T Work\n- Short optimization runs (minutes) - local optimum is too tight\n- Simple greedy placement - needs global optimization\n- Low-precision coordinates - causes false overlap detection\n- fix_direction post-processing - causes precision loss\n\n## Unexplored Ideas from Discussions\n- Hybrid tessellation + local search for medium N (30-60)\n- Genetic algorithms with custom crossover operators for tree configurations\n- No-Fit Polygon (NFP) precomputation for faster overlap checks\n\n## Key Insights from Previous Work\n\n### 1. N=1 is Already Optimal\n- Optimal angle: 45 degrees (minimizes bounding box)\n- Side length: 0.8132, contributes 0.6612 to score\n- No further improvement possible for N=1\n\n### 2. Small N Values (1-15) Have Lowest Packing Efficiency\n- Efficiency ranges from 37-65% vs 70%+ for large N\n- These contribute most to the total score\n- Focus optimization effort here for maximum impact\n\n### 3. Tessellation/Lattice Approach for Large N (N >= 58)\nThe egortrushin kernel uses a fundamentally different approach:\n- Start with 2 base trees in a specific configuration\n- Translate them in x and y directions to create a grid pattern\n- Use SA to optimize the base configuration and translation vectors\n- Target N values: 72, 100, 110, 144, 156, 196, 200\n- This generates crystalline/lattice packings that can be tighter than random optimization\n\n### 4. Fractional Translation Optimization\nThe jonathanchan kernel uses fine-grained translation steps:\n- Steps: [0.001, 0.0005, 0.0002, 0.0001, 0.00005, 0.00002, 0.00001]\n- 8 directions for each step\n- Combined with SA and local search\n\n### 5. Backward Propagation\nStart from N=200, work down to N=2:\n- For each N, try removing each tree\n- If resulting (N-1) config is better than stored, save it\n- Can find better configurations for smaller N values\n\n### 6. Precision is Critical\n- Use Decimal arithmetic with 20+ decimal places\n- Submissions with 15 decimal places may fail validation\n- Kaggle rejects overlapping trees - precision loss causes false overlaps\n\n### 7. Well-Aligned Initial Solution\nFrom zaburo kernel (score ~88.33 as starting point):\n- Pack trees in rows with alternating orientations (0 and 180 degrees)\n- Use spacing of 0.7 (base width) between trees in a row\n- Alternate rows have x_offset of 0.35 (half base width)\n- Creates a brick-like pattern for initial placement\n\n## Recommended Approaches (Priority Order)\n\n### 1. [HIGHEST PRIORITY] Implement Tessellation for Large N\n```python\n# For N >= 58, try crystalline packing\n# Start with 2 base trees, translate to create grid\n# nt = [rows, cols] such that rows * cols >= N\n# Optimize the base configuration and translation vectors\n```\n\n### 2. [HIGH PRIORITY] Long-Running Simulated Annealing\nTop solutions run for HOURS, not minutes:\n- `-n 15000+` iterations\n- `-r 80+` rounds\n- Multiple generations with perturbation to escape local optima\n- Use C++ for speed (bbox3.cpp, sa_v1_parallel)\n\n### 3. [HIGH PRIORITY] Focus on Small N Values (1-20)\n- Exhaustive search for optimal rotation angles\n- Try all 360 degrees in 0.001 increments\n- These have highest score contribution per tree\n\n### 4. [MEDIUM PRIORITY] C++ Optimizers\nAvailable optimizers from kernels:\n- bbox3.cpp: Complex number geometry, global squeeze, overlap repair\n- sa_v1_parallel: Simulated annealing with fractional translation\n- tree_packer_v18/v21: Tree packing optimizers\n\n### 5. [MEDIUM PRIORITY] Ensemble from Multiple Sources\n- Combine best configurations from different approaches\n- For each N, take the configuration with smallest bounding box\n- Validate for overlaps before combining\n- Sources: Telegram groups, GitHub repos, Kaggle datasets\n\n## Technical Implementation Notes\n\n### Overlap Detection\n```python\n# Use Shapely for polygon operations\nfrom shapely.geometry import Polygon\nfrom shapely.strtree import STRtree\n\n# Check if two polygons overlap (not just touch)\ndef overlaps(poly1, poly2):\n    return poly1.intersects(poly2) and not poly1.touches(poly2)\n```\n\n### Scoring Function (Numba-optimized)\n```python\nfrom numba import njit\nimport math\nimport numpy as np\n\nTX = np.array([0, 0.125, 0.0625, 0.2, 0.1, 0.35, 0.075, 0.075, -0.075, -0.075, -0.35, -0.1, -0.2, -0.0625, -0.125])\nTY = np.array([0.8, 0.5, 0.5, 0.25, 0.25, 0, 0, -0.2, -0.2, 0, 0, 0.25, 0.25, 0.5, 0.5])\n\n@njit\ndef score_group(xs, ys, degs, tx, ty):\n    n = xs.size\n    V = tx.size\n    mnx = mny = 1e300\n    mxx = mxy = -1e300\n    for i in range(n):\n        r = degs[i] * math.pi / 180.0\n        c, s = math.cos(r), math.sin(r)\n        for j in range(V):\n            X = c * tx[j] - s * ty[j] + xs[i]\n            Y = s * tx[j] + c * ty[j] + ys[i]\n            mnx, mxx = min(mnx, X), max(mxx, X)\n            mny, mxy = min(mny, Y), max(mxy, Y)\n    side = max(mxx - mnx, mxy - mny)\n    return side * side / n\n```\n\n### Submission Format\n- id: NNN_i (NNN = number of trees, i = tree index)\n- x, y: coordinates with 's' prefix (e.g., \"s0.123456789012345678901\")\n- deg: rotation angle with 's' prefix\n- Coordinates must be in range [-100, 100]\n- Use 20+ decimal places for precision\n\n## What NOT to Try\n- Simple ensemble (one source often dominates all N values)\n- Short optimization runs (local optimum is too tight)\n- fix_direction post-processing (causes precision loss and overlaps)\n- Low-precision coordinates (use 20+ decimal places)\n- Random restarts without perturbation strategy\n\n## Pre-Optimized Solutions\nCheck `/home/nonroot/snapshots/santa-2025/` for pre-optimized submissions.\nBest known: `/home/nonroot/snapshots/santa-2025/21328309254/code/submission.csv` (score: 70.647327)\n\n## Academic Approaches to Consider\nFrom web research on 2D irregular polygon packing:\n1. **No-Fit Polygon (NFP)**: Precompute NFPs for O(1) overlap checks\n2. **Bottom-Left Heuristics**: Fast initial placement\n3. **Simulated Annealing**: Global optimization with temperature schedule\n4. **Genetic Algorithms**: Population-based optimization with crossover\n5. **Mixed Integer Programming**: Exact solutions for small instances\n\n## Validation Checklist\nBefore submitting:\n1. Check for overlaps in ALL N configurations (1-200)\n2. Verify coordinate precision (20+ decimal places)\n3. Ensure coordinates are in [-100, 100] range\n4. Verify 's' prefix on all values\n5. Calculate local score to verify improvement\n6. Compare against best known score for each N\n\n## Key Kernels to Reference\n- `../research/kernels/inversion_santa-2025-getting-started/`: Basic greedy algorithm, tree geometry\n- `../research/kernels/jazivxt_why-not/`: bbox3.cpp optimizer with global squeeze\n- `../research/kernels/smartmanoj_santa-claude/`: Claude-assisted optimization\n- `../research/kernels/yongsukprasertsuk_santa-2025-best-keeping-bbox3-runner/`: Multi-phase optimization\n- `../research/kernels/jonathanchan_santa25-ensemble-sa-fractional-translation/`: Ensemble + fractional translation\n- `../research/kernels/zaburo_88-32999-a-well-aligned-initial-solution/`: Well-aligned initial solution\n\n## Gap Analysis\n- Current best: 70.647327\n- Target: 68.894234\n- Gap: 1.753 points (2.5%)\n- Need to improve packing efficiency from 69.5% to 71.3%\n- Theoretical minimum (perfect packing): ~49.125\n\n## Strategy for Beating Target\n1. Start with best pre-optimized solution from snapshots (70.647)\n2. Run long C++ optimization (hours, not minutes) with bbox3 or sa_v1_parallel\n3. Focus on N values with largest gaps to theoretical optimum\n4. Try tessellation for large N (100+) - this is underexplored\n5. Ensemble best results from multiple approaches\n6. Validate thoroughly before each submission\n7. Consider hybrid approaches: tessellation + local search\n",
