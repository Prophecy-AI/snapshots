      "text": "Tessellation patterns play a significant role in 2D polygon packing optimization, especially for irregular shapes, by facilitating more efficient space utilization and reducing waste. These patterns involve dividing a surface into smaller, often repetitive, geometric units that can be arranged to fit together with minimal gaps. In the context of irregular shape packing, tessellation helps by creating a structured approach to decomposing complex shapes into simpler, manageable components, such as rectangles or triangles, which can be more easily arranged within a given space ([Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3303689/efficient-packing-algorithm-for-irregular-polygons)). \n\nMoreover, tessellation patterns can serve as a foundation for algorithms that group or cluster irregular patches into near-rectangular super patches, effectively reducing the packing problem to a bin-packing scenario. This approach simplifies the decision-making process and enhances packing density ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.10329)). Additionally, some advanced methods employ continuous and combinatorial optimization techniques, using tessellation as a step toward optimizing the arrangement of irregular tiles or patches on surfaces, such as in mosaic synthesis or surface decoration ([IEEE](https://haopan.github.io/papers/surface_mosaic.pdf)). Overall, tessellation patterns contribute to more systematic, scalable, and effective solutions for polygon packing problems involving irregular shapes.",

Being a joint, combinatorial decision-making problem involving all patch positions and orientations, this problem has well-known NP-hard complexity. Prior solutions either assume a heuristic packing order or modify the upstream mesh cut and UV mapping to simplify the problem, which either limits the packing ratio or incurs robustness or generality issues. Instead, we introduce a learning-assisted 2D irregular shape packing method that achieves a high packing quality with minimal requirements from the input. Our method iteratively selects and groups subsets of UV patches into near-rectangular super patches, essentially reducing the problem to bin-packing, based on which a joint optimization is employed to further improve the packing ratio. In order to efficiently deal with large problem instances with hundreds of patches, we train deep neural policies to predict nearly rectangular patch subsets and determine their relative poses, leading to linear time scaling with the number of patches. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on three datasets for UV packing, where our method achieves a higher packing ratio over several widely used baselines with competitive computational speed.\ngeometry processing, deep reinforcement learning, combinatorial optimization\n\u2020\u2020price:15.00\u2020\u2020copyright:acmlicensed\u2020\u2020journal:TOG\u2020\u2020journalyear:2023\u2020\u2020journalvolume:42\u2020\u2020journalnumber:6\u2020\u2020publicationmonth:12\u2020\u2020price:15.00\u2020\u2020doi:10.1145/3618348\u2020\u2020ccs:Computing methodologies\u00a0Computer graphics\u2020\u2020ccs:Computing methodologies\u00a0Machine learning\n![Refer to caption](extracted/5118135/fig/fig1/part_model.jpg)|![Refer to caption](extracted/5118135/fig/fig1/part_xatlas_0.698.jpg)|![Refer to caption](extracted/5118135/fig/fig1/part_ours_0.774.jpg)|![Refer to caption](extracted/5118135/fig/fig1/chinsehouse_model.jpg)|![Refer to caption](extracted/5118135/fig/fig1/chinsehouse_xatlas_0.662.jpg)|![Refer to caption](extracted/5118135/fig/fig1/chinsehouse_ours_0.764.jpg)|![Refer to caption](extracted/5118135/fig/fig1/tigerhead_model.jpg)|![Refer to caption](extracted/5118135/fig/fig1/tigerhead_xatlas_0.610.jpg)|![Refer to caption](extracted/5118135/fig/fig1/tigerhead_ours_0.729.jpg)|\n|XAtlas pr: 69.8%|Ours pr: 77.4%||XAtlas pr: 66.2%|Ours pr: 76.4%||XAtlas pr: 61.0%|Ours pr: 72.9%|\nFigure 1.Three UV-packing results generated using XAtlas and our learning-assisted method.\n## 1.Introduction\n2D irregular shape packing lies the theoretical foundation for a wide spectrum of applications across various industrial areas, e.g. material parts assembly> [Keet\u00a0al\n> .\n> , [> 2020\n](#bib.bib22)> ]\n, VLSI module placements> [Chenget\u00a0al\n> .\n> , [> 2005\n](#bib.bib8)> ]\n, and 2D shelf arrangements in automatic warehouses> [\u00d6n\u00fct et\u00a0al\n> .\n> , [> 2008\n](#bib.bib28)> ]\n. The most prominent packing application in computer graphics is UV chart packing, where a set of 2D shapes corresponding to patches of 3D models are packed together into a single texture atlas for mapping various appearance details onto the 3D surface for downstream rendering. In the realm of digital games where many 3D models are rendered in the virtual world, improving the UV packing ratio could significantly save the graphical memory, improve the loading speed, and reduce rendering overhead. This problem was recognized decades ago, e.g., by> Soucyet\u00a0al\n> .\n> [\n[> 1996\n](#bib.bib39)> ]\nand> Sanderet\u00a0al\n> .\n> [\n[> 2001\n](#bib.bib33)> ]\n, which has recently revived as an active area of graphic research> [Limperet\u00a0al\n> .\n> , [> 2018\n](#bib.bib24)> ; Liuet\u00a0al\n> .\n> , [> 2019\n](#bib.bib25)> ; Zhanget\u00a0al\n> .\n> , [> 2020\n](#bib.bib47)> ]\n.\nAn packing algorithm needs to search for both the position and orientation of each patch. Due to its combinatorial nature, finding optimal 2D shape packing has been well-understood as being NP-complete and APX-hard. Prior research efforts are focused on heuristic or genetic algorithms to determine the order of objects to be packed, and then search for the pose of each shape, e.g., using no-fit polygon (NFP) and the \u201cTetris\u201d algorithm. However, the sub-optimality gap of these heuristics can be substantial. On the other hand, when the problem size is small, globally optimal stochastic optimization algorithms have been proposed to search for the near-optimal packing orders. Although these techniques can scale to tens of 2D shapes, UV unwrapping approaches and commercial 3D modeling software can oftentimes generate hundreds of patches for one 3D model, which is far beyond the capabilities of the global search algorithms.\nWe propose a learning-assisted 2D packing pipeline for general irregular-shaped patches. The design of our approach is based on two observations: 1) Prior works generate sub-optimal solutions by assuming objects are packed sequentially. 2) Prior works try all possible poses and orientations for each to-be-packed object to find the best solution, leading to slow computation. To tackle these issues, we propose to hierarchically group patches into nearly rectangular super-patches, allowing a larger search space for patch combination and a smaller optimality gap. Instead of exhaustively trying all possible combinations, we train a high-level group selector network (HSN) to efficiently predict how likely a candidate patch subset can be grouped into a rectangular super-patch. Given an identified patch subset, we use the sequential ordering technique, similar to prior works. Specifically, we use a low-level sorter network (LSN) to determine the suitable order of packing within the subset. Next, a low-level pose network (LPN) infers the rough initial pose of each patch. The ultimate pose of these patches is determined by local numerical optimization. These two networks are trained using reinforcement learning to efficiently infer near optimal sequential packing policies.\nWe have evaluated our method on 3 datasets, containing highly irregular UV patches generated from both organic and man-made 3D models. We show the effectiveness of our approach by comparing against widely used algorithm baselines, including piecewise linear NFP, XAtlas> [Young, [> 2023\n](#bib.bib46)> ]\n, and> [Sander et\u00a0al\n> .\n> , [> 2003\n](#bib.bib34)> ]\n, where we achieve a5%\u221210%percent5percent105\\\\%-10\\\\%5 % - 10 %packing ratio improvement across all the tested datasets. We further highlight the generality of our learned policies, by training them on one dataset and evaluating them on all three datasets. We find our method still outperforming baselines on unseen datasets, proving that our method does not need to be retrained for each problem domain. We include the full datasets and results with statistics in the supplementary material.\n![Refer to caption](x1.png)Figure 2.The overall pipeline of our learning-assisted packing approach.\n## 2.Related Work\nWe discuss representative related works on UV-atlas generation, irregular shape packing, and learning-based packing algorithms.\n### 2.1.UV-atlas Generati...",

      "text": "Surface Mosaic Synthesis with Irregular Tiles\nWenchao Hu, Zhonggui Chen, Hao Pan, Yizhou Yu, Eitan Grinspun,\nand Wenping Wang, Member, IEEE\nAbstract\u2014Mosaics are widely used for surface decoration to produce appealing visual effects. We present a method for synthesizing\ndigital surface mosaics with irregularly shaped tiles, which are a type of tiles often used for mosaics design. Our method employs both\ncontinuous optimization and combinatorial optimization to improve tile arrangement. In the continuous optimization step, we iteratively\npartition the base surface into approximate Voronoi regions of the tiles and optimize the positions and orientations of the tiles to achieve\na tight fit. Combination optimization performs tile permutation and replacement to further increase surface coverage and diversify tile\nselection. The alternative applications of these two optimization steps lead to rich combination of tiles and high surface coverage. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our solution with extensive experiments and comparisons.\nIndex Terms\u2014Simulated mosaics, irregular packing, polygon containment, surface tessellation\n\u00c7\n1 INTRODUCTION\nMOSAICS represent a popular method for decorating\nsurfaces and can often be seen in churches, parks, or\non sidewalks. Because of their appealing visual effects,\nmosaic patterns are regarded as a popular form of folk art.\nSince tiles, called tesserae, used in mosaics are often broken\npieces of crockery, ceramics, or glass, they may come with a\nwide range of shapes and colors. There are many different\nways to make mosaic patterns, such as Opus Regulatum,\nOpus Tessellatum, Opus Vermiculatum, and Opus Palladia\u0002num [1]. We are particularly interested in Opus Palladianum,\nalso known as \u201ccrazy paving\u201d, which makes use of irregu\u0002larly shaped tiles to form a pattern. Manually generating\naesthetic mosaic patterns in Opus Palladianum, especially in\nlarge scale, is a demanding task. A rule of thumb used by\nartists is that adjacent tiles should have complementary\nshapes which fit each other.\nWe shall propose an effective method for synthesizing\nmosaics with irregularly shaped tiles, with the aim of deco\u0002rating virtual objects and scenes for special visual effects in\nthe entertainment industry. There are two important goals.\nFirst, the developed technique should be able to work well\nwith any set of input tiles. Second, the synthetically gener\u0002ated mosaics should be visually pleasant, meanwhile the\nsynthetic approach should be more efficient than manual\nwork when similar results are obtained. Irregularly shaped\ntiles, especially concave ones, make it harder to achieve these\ngoals. Given a collection of input tiles, a mosaic synthesis\nalgorithm needs to determine a subset of tiles that not only\nfit each other well in shape but are also diverse enough to\navoid undesirable repetitive layout of similar tiles. Further\u0002more, an aesthetic mosaic pattern should have a tight cover\u0002age of the base surface, without any overlap among the tiles.\nOur solution is optimization-based. It alternates between\ncontinuous tile configuration optimization and combinato\u0002rial tile selection optimization. Here, the title configuration\nrefers to the position and orientation of a tile in a mosaic.\nMore specifically, the configurations of individual tiles are\noptimized continuously, and the mosaic tiles are selected\nwith combinatorial optimization. Because a large number of\nvariables are used to represent the configurations of the\ntiles, we need to solve an optimization problem with a large\nnumber of unknowns. To make the problem tractable, we\ndecouple interactions among different tiles by partitioning\nthe base surface into approximate Voronoi regions of the\ntiles. This partition is dynamically computed while the tile\nconfigurations are updated. With such a partition, increas\u0002ing surface coverage by the tiles becomes the problem of\nincreasing the coverage of individual regions by their corre\u0002sponding tiles. Finally, combinatorial tile selection optimi\u0002zation is used to further reduce the uncovered area of the\nsurface by tile permutation and tile replacements so that the\nnew tiles better fit their neighboring tiles in shape to reduce\nthe gaps between neighboring tiles.\n2 RELATED WORK\n2.1 Irregular Packing\nThe problem of packing irregularly shaped objects into a\ngiven region or volume (called a container) is widely studied\nin industrial applications, including garment manufactur\u0002ing, furniture making, and metal sheet cutting. The problem\nis to find the tightest non-overlapping spatial arrangement\nof a set of irregularly shaped objects in the container. The\npacking problem is NP-hard [2]. Hence, heuristics are usu\u0002ally used to obtain suboptimal solutions with reasonable\ntime complexity. A comprehensive review of the work on\n2D irregular packing can be found in [3], [4].

Sin\u0002gle polygon containment with translation only has been\ninvestigated by Baker et al [5], and rotations are considered\nin [6], [7], [8], [9].

A relatively recent survey of mosaics on\nimages and planar surfaces can be found in [14] and [15].\nMuch research has focused on adding mosaic-like effects to\na source image. Here we only focus on the method catego\u0002rized as ancient mosaics by [14] which simulates mosaics by\narranging tile images in a container image.

Compute a Delaunay triangulation for the given polygon. There are standard algorithms to do this which will run very quickly for 100 vertices or fewer (see, for example, [this library here.](http://code.google.com/p/poly2tri/)) Using a Delaunay triangulation should ensure that you don't have too many long, thin triangles.\n2. Divide any non-right triangles into two right triangles by dropping an altitude from the largest angle to the opposite side.\n3. Search for triangles that you can combine into rectangles: any two congruent right triangles (not mirror images) which share a hypotenuse. I suspect there won't be too many of these in the general case unless your irregular polygon had a lot of right angles to begin with.\n\nI realize that's a lot of detail to fill in, but I think starting with a Delaunay triangulation is probably the way to go. Delaunay triangulations in the plane can be computed efficiently and they generally look quite \"natural\".\n\nEDITED TO ADD: since we're in ad-hoc heuristicville, in addition to the greedy algorithms being discussed in other answers you should also consider some kind of divide and conquer strategy. If the shape is non-convex like your example, divide it into convex shapes by repeatedly cutting from a reflex vertex to another vertex in a way that comes as close to bisecting the reflex angle as possible. Once you've divided the shape into convex pieces, I'd consider next dividing the convex pieces into pieces with nice \"bases\", pieces with at least one side having two acute or right angles at its ends. If any piece doesn't have such a \"base\" you should be able to divide it in two along a diameter of the piece, and get two new pieces which each have a \"base\" (I think). This should reduce the problem to dealing with convex polygons which are kinda-sorta trapezoidal, and from there a greedy algorithm should do well. I think this algorithm will subdivide the original shape in a fairly natural way until you get to the kinda-sorta trapezoidal pieces.\n\n[Share](https://stackoverflow.com/a/3313753)\n\n[Improve this answer](https://stackoverflow.com/posts/3313753/edit)\n\nFollow\n\n[edited Jul 23, 2010 at 12:50](https://stackoverflow.com/posts/3313753/revisions)\n\nanswered Jul 22, 2010 at 21:42\n\n[![Peter Milley's user avatar](https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/eb2a346fde4e2c5dc426aa702d181443?s=64&d=identicon&r=PG)](https://stackoverflow.com/users/298736/peter-milley)\n\n[Peter Milley](https://stackoverflow.com/users/298736/peter-milley) Peter Milley\n\n2,7781919 silver badges1818 bronze badges\n\n5\n\n- +1 for a solid breakdown answer.

These\ngradient fields encode the correlations between constraint satisfac\u0002tion and the spatial relationships of polygons, learned from teacher\nexamples. During the testing phase, packing solutions are gener\u0002ated using a coarse-to-fine refinement mechanism guided by the\nlearned gradient fields. To enhance packing feasibility and optimal\u0002ity, we introduce two key architectural designs: multi-scale feature\nextraction and coarse-to-fine relation extraction. We conduct ex\u0002periments on two typical industrial packing domains, considering\ntranslations only.

It is also known as cutting or\nnesting problem, which involves arranging a collection of irregu\u0002larly shaped pieces onto one or multiple boards. The objective is to\nposition each piece entirely within the board(s) without overlaps,\nall while minimizing the waste material produced.\narXiv:2310.19814v1 [cs.LG] 18 Oct 2023\nTianyang Xue, Mingdong Wu, Lin Lu, Haoxuan Wang, Hao Dong, and Baoquan Chen\nOne of the key applications of irregular packing is manufacturing.\nIn these scenarios, packing problems take on different forms, such\nas packing parts to be cut from a larger piece of material in order\nto minimize waste and save costs in traditional manufacturing\nindustries like garment manufacturing, furniture making, metal\nsheet cutting, or arranging multiple models within the build volume\nfor simultaneous 3D printing to increase model production while\nminimizing material waste, and reducing print time.\nIn manufacturing applications, a fast, scalable, and generalizable\npacking algorithm is crucial for real-world deployment.\n\u2022 Efficient algorithms streamline decision-making, simplify\u0002ing deployment for end-users.\n\u2022 The size and aspect ratio of the container may vary depend\u0002ing on the raw material or machines used.\n\u2022 Packed objects may have similar shapes with slight devia\u0002tions due to customization and personalization preferences.\nThese objectives motivate us to propose a learning-based method\nto understand the relationships and similarities among the well\u0002packed examples from a dataset with limited size, instead of solving\nthe packing case individually without considering any priors.\nAs a classic NP-hard problem [Milenkovic 1999], the irregular\npacking problem is typically tackled using heuristic algorithms and\nglobal optimization strategies [Guo et al. 2022], which can be very\ntime-consuming. In recent years, machine learning approaches have\nemerged as potential solutions to address the challenging problem\nof packing optimization. The success of employing reinforcement\nlearning to address the bin packing problem [Verma et al. 2020; Zhao\net al. 2022] underscores its potential for aiding in the sequential\noptimization of packing. While researchers have strived to enhance\nthe initialization [Wo\u0142czyk 2018] or packing sequence [Fang et al.\n2023] for irregular packing, a trade-off between computational time\nand utilization rate persists.\nTo realize a fast, scalable, and generalizable packing algorithm,\nour key insight is to reframe the packing problem into modeling\nthe data distribution of sub-optimal packing examples. These ex\u0002amples can be generated by arbitrary packing algorithms, which\nwe refer to as the teacher algorithms. Specifically, such a learning\napproach should learn the correlations between the packing opti\u0002mality and the spatial relationships of polygons from the examples.\nBy modeling the local and global correlations together, the learned\nknowledge can generalize to unseen shapes, varying quantities,\nand diverse rectangular containers, which enables scalable and\ngeneralizable in-distribution packing.\nDuring testing, a solution can be generated via several neural\nnetwork inferences, without further online exploration or exhaus\u0002tive optimization, which enables a fast packing process. Thanks to\nthe inherent parallelism of deep learning, we can generate multiple\nsolution candidates in parallel and preserve the best one, which\nfurther improves the time efficiency of the packing process.\nInspired by [Wu et al. 2022], which proposes a score-based frame\u0002work that estimates a target gradient field (TarGF) to guide object\nrearrangement, we aim to develop a score-based approach for mod\u0002eling the teacher data. However, adapting this technique to the\nirregular packing problem is non-trivial due to the hard constraints\non the validity of packed objects, i.e., non-overlapping. As a result,\nsolving the irregular packing requires a coarse-to-fine refinement\nprocess guided by multiple levels of gradient fields, rather than a\nsingle gradient update (TarGF).\nTo achieve this goal, we introduce two key designs for the score\nnetwork: multi-scale feature extraction and coarse-to-fine relation\nextraction. The former incorporates a multi-scale feature extraction\nnetwork that encodes the geometric features of polygons at different\nscales. The latter employs a multi-layered coarse-to-fine graph\nconvolutional network (GCN) with varying neighbor ranges for\neffective message-passing. By combining these two key designs, our\napproach tailors the score network to effectively support the coarse\u0002to-fine refinement process, resulting in improved generalization\nand scalability for solving the 2D irregular packing problem.\nWe evaluate our method in two industrial packing domains,\nconsidering only translations. Empirical results demonstrate our\nmethod achieves spatial utilization rates that are either similar to or\nexceed those of teacher packing examples. Furthermore, our method\nscales with polygon count and generalizes to diverse container\nconstraints and polygon shapes within the training distribution.\nIn summary, our contributions are listed as follows:\n\u2022 We propose a score-based generative modeling approach to\ntackle th...",

The build orientation of the parts is assumed fixed and is decided prior to layout optimization, according to part-specific quality and cost requirements. Three placement schemes, appropriately adapted to the problem, are considered for the parts nesting and fabrication layout definition. The algorithms and placement schemes developed are evaluated in several test cases/benchmarks involving parts with both simple and complex geometries. The computational results included in the paper indicate that the proposed methodology can lead to satisfactory layout/packing\u2013nesting arrangements in a time efficient manner, leading, therefore, to substantial improvement of stereolithography machine utilization.\n* ### [Simulated annealing applied to the irregular rotational placement of shapes over containers with fixed dimensions](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417409006575)\n2010, Expert Systems with Applications\nShow abstract\nThis work deals with the problem of minimizing the waste of space that occurs on a rotational placement of a set of irregular two dimensional polygons inside a two dimensional container. This problem is approached with an heuristic based on simulated annealing. Traditional \u201cexternal penalization\u201d techniques are avoided through the application of the no-fit polygon, that determinates the collision free area for each polygon before its placement. The simulated annealing controls: the rotation applied, the placement and the sequence of placement of the polygons. For each non placed polygon, a limited depth binary search is performed to find a scale factor that when applied to the polygon, would allow it to be fitted in the container. It is proposed a crystallization heuristic, in order to increase the number of accepted solutions. The bottom left and larger first deterministic heuristics were also studied. The proposed process is suited for non convex polygons and containers, the containers can have holes inside.\n* ### [An algorithm for polygon placement using a bottom-left strategy](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377221702001315)\n2002, European Journal of Operational Research\nShow abstract\nThis paper describes a fast and efficient implementation of a bottom-left (BL) placement algorithm for polygon packing.

A particular case of the nesting problem occurs when congruent copies of one single shape have to fill, as much as possible, a limited sheet. Traditional approaches to the nesting problem have difficulty to tackle with high number of pieces to place. Additionally, if the orientation of the given shape is not a constraint, the general nesting approaches are not particularly successful. This problem arises in practice in several industrial contexts such as footwear, metalware and furniture. A possible approach is the periodic placement of the shapes, in a lattice way. In this paper, we propose three heuristic approaches to solve this particular case of nesting problems. Experimental results are compared with published results in literature and additional results obtained from new instances are also provided.\n## Introduction\nNesting has been widely studied (Dowsland and Dowsland, 1992), as it is a common problem in several industrial production processes (textile, garment, footwear, metalware, furniture, etc.). Most of the published papers impose orientation constraints: the shape can only be rotated a predetermined number of fixed angles (the most common is 180\u00b0 and, less commonly, 90\u00b0) or it cannot be rotated at all. However, in certain particular cases, orientation constraints do not arise. Additionally, some industries frequently need to cut big quantities of each type of shape. In these two situations, the periodic packing of the shapes (lattice packing) proved to be a very competitive approach, because:\n* \u2013good cutting patterns, with very small waste, can be obtained;\n* \u2013the automatic cutting process is more efficient when a periodic placement is considered;\n* \u2013reduced computational time (when compared with general nesting approaches, where each piece has to be treated individually), which allows to tackle problems of greater dimension.\nIn this section, we start by describing the problem and refer to related works in a brief review. In Section 2, we point out the geometric considerations necessary to understand this work. Section 3 describes the underlying rules and criteria used to build the three heuristic approaches, which are proposed in the fourth section. In Section 5, the instances used to evaluate the quality of the proposed approaches are defined and the results obtained with all the three heuristics are presented and compared. Finally, in the last section, we draw conclusions and make some comments about future work.\nThe periodic placement of congruent copies of one shape can be found in literature under the keywords \u201cperiodic packing\u201d, \u201cregular packing\u201d or \u201clattice packing\u201d. The lattice packing may be defined over an infinite plane or a limited sheet. If it is the plane, the main objective is to regularly place the shapes so that the density obtained is maximised. When lattice packing on a limited stock sheet, the goal is to maximise the percentage of stock sheet utilisation, which is equivalent to maximise the number of shapes placed inside the plate. As will be shown later, these two \u201capparently\u201d similar objectives are not quite equivalent. However, the definition of a lattice is identical in the two situations. A lattice is generated by two linearly independent vectors,*v*0and*v*1, whose linear combinations will produce a grid that guarantees that pieces do not overlap. The shapes are located in each node of the grid.\nThe problem we propose to solve does not considerer orientation constraints, so, any rotation of the given shape can be allowed. However, after a specific orientation is chosen, all the shapes must follow the same orientation (*Single-Lattice*\u2013 Fig. 1a) or be alternately rotated 180\u00b0 (*Double-Lattice*\u2013 Fig. 1b). According to the typology by W\u00e4scher et al. (2007), the problem described in this paper is a 2-dimensional irregular IIPP (Identical Item Packing Problem).\nThe orientation of the shapes is not relevant when lattice packing on the plane, as maximum density remains unchanged. However, when stock sheet borders need to be taken into account, the orientation of the shapes may be extremely important as will be shown in the following sections.\nIn this work, we propose to solve the problem of Periodic Packing of Irregular Shapes (PPIS) on a limited stock sheet (a rectangle) by heuristic methods.\nThere are references in the literature to the Lattice Packing Problem since the fifties, the first results concerning only theoretical aspects of the lattice packing of a single convex polygon on the plane (Rogers, 1951). However, only a few publications during the next 30 years can be found, and some of them are just marginally related to lattice packing. O\u2019Rourke et al. (1986) have considered the problem of finding minimal enclosing triangles and Dori and Ben Bassat (1983) have dealt with the problem of finding minimal enclosing convex polygons with fewer sides. Those approaches can be seen as a pre-processing to lattice packing, as regular convex polygons can be easily packed than the original ones.\nBetween 1990 and 2000, essentially theoretical results on lattice lacking have been published, mostly considering unlimited sheets and convex shapes (Mount and Silverman, 1990, Mount, 1991, Kuperberg and Kuperberg, 1990, Stoyan and Patsuk, 2000).\nMore recently, results concerning real industrial problems, with limited sheets, irregular shapes and no orientation constraints, have been published. Prasad et al. (1995) describe a nesting problem of irregular shaped metal blanks and propose a heuristic search, considering the variation in the or...",

Irregular shape packing is one of the most recent variants to be widely researched and its history extends over 40 years. The evolution of solution approaches to this problem can be attributed to increased computer power and advances in geometric techniques as well as more sophisticated and insightful algorithm design. In this paper we will focus on the latter. Our aim is not to give a chronological account or an exhaustive review, but to draw on the literature to describe and evaluate the core approaches. Irregular packing is combinatorial and as a result solution methods are heuristic, save a few notable exceptions. We will explore different ways of representing the problem and mechanisms for moving between solutions. We will also propose where we see the future challenges for researchers in this area.\n## Suggested Citation\n* J A Bennell & J F Oliveira, 2009.\n\"**[A tutorial in irregular shape packing problems](https://ideas.repec.org/a/pal/jorsoc/v60y2009i1d10.1057_jors.2008.169.html)**,\"[Journal of the Operational Research Society](https://ideas.repec.org/s/pal/jorsoc.html), Palgrave Macmillan;The OR Society, vol. 60(1), pages 93-105, May.Handle:*RePEc:pal:jorsoc:v:60:y:2009:i:1:d:10.1057\\_jors.2008.169*\nDOI: 10.1057/jors.2008.169\nas\nHTMLHTML with abstractplain textplain text with abstractBibTeXRIS (EndNote, RefMan, ProCite)ReDIFJSON\n## Download full text from publisher\n**File URL:**http://link.springer.com/10.1057/jors.2008.169\n**File Function:**Abstract\n**Download Restriction:**Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.\n**File URL:**https://libkey.io/10.1057/jors.2008.169?utm\\_source=ideas\n**LibKey link**: if access is restricted and if your library uses this service, LibKey will redirect you to where you can use your library subscription to access this item\n---\\>\\<---\nAs the access to this document is restricted, you may want tosearchfor a different version of it.\n## References listed on IDEAS\nas\nHTMLHTML with abstractplain textplain text with abstractBibTeXRIS (EndNote, RefMan, ProCite)ReDIFJSON\n1.

Despite its relevance to industry, research publications are relatively low when compared to other cutting\nand packing problems. One explanation offered is the perceived difficulty and substantial time investment of developing a\ngeometric tool box to assess computer generated solutions. In this paper we set out to provide a tutorial covering the core\ngeometric methodologies currently employed by researchers in cutting and packing of irregular shapes. The paper is not\ndesigned to be an exhaustive survey of the literature but instead will draw on the literature to illustrate the theory and\nimplementation of the approaches. We aim to provide a sufficiently instructive description to equip new and current\nresearchers in the area to select the most appropriate methodology for their needs.\n\u0002 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Introduction\nCutting and packing problems involving irregu\u0002lar shapes arise in a wide variety of industries\nincluding; garment manufacturing, sheet metal cut\u0002ting, furniture making and shoe manufacturing.\nAn example of a layout from the garment manufac\u0002turing industry is provided in Fig. 1. As a result the\nrange of problem variants involving irregular\nshapes, referred to here as nesting problems, is a\ncore area of research in the field of cutting and\npacking. The problem is NP-complete and as a\nresult solution methodologies predominantly utilise\nheuristics. A further defining characteristic of nest\u0002ing problems is the requirement to develop power\u0002ful geometric tools to handle the wide variety and\ncomplexity of shapes that need to be packed. In\nthis paper we propose to provide detailed explana\u0002tions of the most popular techniques for handling\nthe geometry when solving nesting problems and\nprovide guidance on their implementation, strengths\nand weaknesses.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized in six\nsections. In the next section the nesting problem is\ndefined more precisely and the key differences\n0377-2217/$ - see front matter \u0002 2007 Elsevier B.V.

In particular,\nthe importance of the geometry is explained. In Sec\u0002tion 3 geometric approaches based on pixel or raster\nrepresentations are introduced. In Section 4 the con\u0002cept of the D function is presented including algo\u0002rithms to handle geometric tasks that use this\nfunction. In the following section, the nofit polygon\nis introduced and two different algorithms for its\ngeneration are described, one based on the sliding\nanalogy and another using Minkowski sums. Poly\u0002gon decomposition is also discussed in this section.\nIn Section 6 the concept of Phi function is presented\nwith illustrative examples.\n2. Problem definition\nNesting problems are one of many terms used to\nidentify the group of problems that will be dis\u0002cussed. A discussion of nomenclature is beyond\nthe scope of this paper, however, it is helpful to\nidentify the other names under which these prob\u0002lems are referenced. Some commonly used terms\nare irregular shape stock cutting, irregular packing,\npolygon placement, marker making, non-convex\ncutting stock, 2-D packing problems or some com\u0002bination of any of these terms. The term nesting\nproblems is adopted in this paper and can be defined\nas follows:\nwhere more than one piece of irregular shape must\nbe place in a configuration with the other piece(s)\nin order to optimise an objective\nIrregular shapes are defined as simple polygons,\nand in some cases, polygons that may contain holes.\nWhen pieces include curved edges, it is common to\napproximate them by an enclosing polygon, where\na series of tangents to the curve form the polygonal\nedges. Recently new research has emerged that per\u0002mit the curved edges to be retained in their original\nform. It is appropriate at this point to consider\nwhether shapes such as circles or triangles would\nbe classified as nesting problems. There is no clear\nconclusion that can be drawn from the literature.\nHowever, we suggest that problems that involve\nnon-trivial handling of the geometry would be clas\u0002sified as a nesting problem. Hence circles are not,\nsince overlap can be detected simply by evaluating\nthe distance between the centres of two candidate\ncircles.\nThe above definition is clearly very general and\nwithin it many variants of the problem can be\ndefined. These can be identified through a number\nof key characteristics; homogeneity/heterogeneity\nof the data; stock sheet size, shape, number and\nquality (with respect to the homogeneity of the\nstock sheet surface); and single or multi objective.\nDyckhoff (1990) proposed a useful classification\nof cutting and packing problems. His classification\npartitioned the problems by four fundamental crite\u0002ria; dimensionality, objective of the assignment,\nlarge objects and small items. Dimensionality is\ndivided by one-dimensional, two-dimensional,\nthree-dimensional and n-dimensional, where n is\ngreat than 3. The type of assignment was parti\u0002tioned into: those problems that require all the\npieces to be arranged hence minimising waste and\nthose that select and arrange a subset of pieces\nhence maximising the profit gained from those\npieces. The large objects are the stock sheets and\nmay either be single, multiple and identical, or mul\u0002tiple and different. Finally, the small items are the\npieces that are partition according to the number\nand level of homogeneity. Dyckhoff\u2019s typology has\nsince been revised by Waescher et al. (2005) in order\nto remove some ambiguity that has arisen since its\nFig. 1. An example layout from garment manufacturing.\n398 J.A. Bennell, J.F. Oliveira / European Journal of Operational Research 184 (2008) 397\u2013415\npublication and provide a more intuitive classifica\u0002tion of problem variants. Their typology retains\nthe first two detailed by Dyckhoff; dimensionality\nand objective of the assignment. The categories for\nlarge object and small objects are redefined, and a\nnew characteristic is identified; shape of the small\nitems. Using Waescher, Hauber and Schumann\u2019s\ntypology, nesting problems, in general, would be\nplaced in the open-dimension problem category, with\nthe refinement of being two-dimensional and irregu\u0002lar. The new typology provides a useful progression\ntowards a consistent nomenclature for cutting and\npacking problems.\n2.1. How is nesting different from other cutting and\npacking problems?\nA comparison of the physical attributes of cut\u0002ting and packing problems in order to group them\nhas already been addressed through the discussion\nof the typology. Here we are interested in the two\u0002dimensional problems, which can be further parti\u0002tioned into regular packing and irregular packing.\nThese differences are tangible and observable; per\u0002haps the more important question is how these dif\u0002ferences influence the approaches we might take to\nsolve the problem. The paper will discuss the\nincreased complexity of ensuring pieces are allo\u0002cated to feasible placement position when they are\nirregular. However, ...",
