## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.315537 from exp_029 (final_ensemble_v2)
- Best LB score: 70.3157 (exp_028)
- Target: 68.873342 | Gap to target: 1.44 points (2.09%)

## ⚠️ CRITICAL SITUATION ASSESSMENT

**THE GAP IS 1.44 POINTS. THIS IS HUGE.**

After 30 experiments:
- Last 8 experiments found only 0.0008 points improvement TOTAL
- All algorithmic approaches (SA, B&B, NFP, genetic, lattice, jostle, BLF) converge to same score
- All external data sources are WORSE than our current best (best external: 70.319731)
- The solution is at an EXTREMELY strong local optimum

**TOP TEAM "Jingle bins" has score 68.873342 - exactly our target.**
They are 1.44 points ahead. They likely:
1. Run optimization for 24-72 HOURS (not minutes)
2. Use 24+ CPUs in parallel
3. Have 900+ submissions to iterate

## Response to Evaluator

The evaluator correctly identifies that:
1. ✅ Extended C++ optimization (8-24 hours) is the ONLY viable path
2. ✅ All algorithmic variations have been exhausted
3. ✅ External data mining continues to yield tiny results but cannot close the gap
4. ✅ We have 26 CPUs available but haven't used them for extended runs

**I AGREE with the evaluator's assessment.** The only path forward is:
- Run bbox3 for 8-24 HOURS with all 26 CPUs
- Use maximum iterations and restarts
- Focus on N=2-50 (highest individual scores)

## Submission Log
| Exp | Approach | CV | LB | Notes |
|-----|----------|----|----|-------|
| 028 | final_ensemble | 70.3157 | 70.3157 | Found 1 improvement (N=124) |
| 029 | final_ensemble_v2 | 70.3155 | pending | Found 1 improvement (N=31) |

## What We've Learned
- All algorithmic approaches converge to ~70.31-70.32
- External data mining yields tiny improvements (0.0001-0.001 per experiment)
- The baseline is at an extremely strong local optimum
- Short optimization runs (minutes) find ZERO improvement
- Extended optimization (hours) is required to escape local optima

## ⛔ FORBIDDEN (WILL BE REJECTED)
- More ensemble variations with existing data (exhausted)
- More algorithmic implementations (all converge to same score)
- Short optimization runs (proven ineffective)
- Any approach that gave < 0.01 improvement in last 8 experiments

## ✅ NEXT EXPERIMENT: EXTENDED C++ OPTIMIZATION (8+ HOURS)

**THIS IS THE ONLY PATH FORWARD.**

The evaluator and I agree: run bbox3 for 8-24 hours with all available resources.

### Implementation:
```bash
# Use all 26 CPUs
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=26

# Run bbox3 with maximum settings
# -n 100000: 100K iterations per restart
# -r 500: 500 restarts
# Focus on N=2-50 (highest individual scores)

for n in $(seq 2 50); do
    ./bbox3 -n 100000 -r 500 -t 28800 input_n${n}.csv output_n${n}.csv &
done
wait
```

### Expected outcome:
- If bbox3 can find improvements, extended runs will find them
- If no improvements after 8 hours, the solution is truly optimal
- This is the ONLY approach that hasn't been fully explored

### Why this might work:
- Top competitors mention running for 24-72 hours
- The optimizer shows 0.0000% improvements in quick runs, but this doesn't mean improvements don't exist
- Extended search can escape local optima that short runs cannot

## What NOT to Try
- ❌ More ensemble variations (exhausted)
- ❌ More algorithmic implementations (all converge to same score)
- ❌ Short optimization runs (proven ineffective)
- ❌ External data mining (all sources worse than current best)

## SUBMIT THIS EXPERIMENT
Even if the improvement is small, submit to get LB feedback.
We have 94 submissions remaining - USE THEM.
