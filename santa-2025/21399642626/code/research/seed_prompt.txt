## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.315653 from exp_028 (final_ensemble)
- Best LB score: 70.3165 (exp_022)
- Target: 68.874108 | Gap to target: 1.44 points (2.09%)

## CRITICAL FINDING: WE ARE AT THE PUBLIC CEILING

**Our score (70.315653) is BETTER than ALL external sources:**
- Best external: 70.319731 (kernel_outputs/bbox3-ensemble-update)
- saspav_latest_v2: 70.329958
- All other public kernels: 70.33+

**This means:**
1. We have exhausted ALL public data sources
2. Further ensemble improvements from public data are IMPOSSIBLE
3. The remaining 1.44 point gap requires NOVEL approaches

## Response to Evaluator

The evaluator correctly identified that:
1. We found the FIRST improvement after 8 consecutive experiments with zero improvement
2. The improvement is tiny (0.0008 points) but confirms external data mining works
3. The gap (1.44 points) is too large for the current approach

**I AGREE with the evaluator's assessment:**
- Extended C++ optimization (8+ hours) is one viable path
- New external data sources is another viable path
- Current micro-optimization approach will NOT reach the target

**HOWEVER, I note a critical constraint:**
- Running binaries (bbox3, sa_fast) is FORBIDDEN by the rules
- We must implement algorithms in pure Python

## THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM

The target (68.874108) represents a 2.09% improvement over our current best.
- Top competitors achieved sub-68 scores (67.x mentioned in discussions)
- They used: 900+ submissions, 24 CPUs running for days, private solutions
- We have: 95 submissions remaining, limited compute, no private solutions

**The gap CANNOT be closed by:**
- Running more ensembles (we've exhausted public data)
- Running bbox3/sa_fast (forbidden + already at local optimum)
- Small optimizations (0.0008 per experiment = 1800 experiments needed)

## STRATEGIC OPTIONS

### Option A: Accept Current Score as Best Achievable
- Submit exp_028 (70.3157) as final
- This is BETTER than all public kernels
- Gap to target is 2.09% - significant but we've exhausted public approaches

### Option B: Implement Novel Algorithm from Scratch
- Write custom optimization in pure Python
- Focus on small N values (N=2-10) where improvements have highest impact
- Use branch-and-bound or constraint programming
- Risk: May not find improvements, time-consuming

### Option C: Search for NEW External Data Sources
- Check Kaggle discussions for newly shared solutions
- Search GitHub for new repositories
- Monitor saspav dataset for updates
- Risk: May not find anything better than current

## RECOMMENDED NEXT EXPERIMENT

**SUBMIT exp_028 FIRST** - We need LB confirmation of our best score.

Then, implement a focused optimization for N=2-10:

```python
# Focus on small N values where improvements have highest impact
# N=2: 0.450779 (second highest contributor)
# N=3: 0.434745
# N=4: 0.416545
# N=5: 0.416850

# For each small N, try:
# 1. Exhaustive angle search (0.01 degree increments)
# 2. Fine position grid search around current best
# 3. Branch-and-bound for exact optimal placement
```

## ⛔ FORBIDDEN (WILL BE REJECTED)
- bbox3, sa_fast, eazy_optimizer, tree_packer - FORBIDDEN
- subprocess.run() or os.system() - FORBIDDEN
- Running ANY binary or executable - FORBIDDEN

## ✅ REQUIRED: SUBMIT exp_028

Before any new experiments, SUBMIT exp_028 to get LB feedback:
- CV score: 70.315653
- This is our best score ever
- We need LB confirmation

## What NOT to Try
- More ensemble variations (public data exhausted)
- Running bbox3/sa_fast with more iterations (forbidden + at local optimum)
- Backward propagation (already tried, no improvement)
- Random restarts (already tried, no improvement)

## Key Insight

The target (68.874108) may require approaches that are:
1. Not publicly available
2. Require massive compute (24 CPUs for days)
3. Based on private/proprietary solutions

Our current score (70.3157) is the BEST achievable from public sources.
The remaining 1.44 point gap represents the "private solution advantage."
