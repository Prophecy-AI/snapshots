## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.308629 from exp_039
- Best LB score: 70.308629 (confirmed)
- Target: 68.861114 | Gap to target: 1.447 points (2.05%)

## CRITICAL SITUATION ASSESSMENT

After 43 experiments:
- **9 binary-based experiments** (bbox3, SA, etc.) → ZERO improvement
- **18 ensemble experiments** → Found improvements from external data
- **8 novel algorithm attempts** → ALL FAILED (3 fell back to baseline)
- **Last 2 experiments** (constructive approaches) → WORSE than baseline

**THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM:**
The baseline (70.308629) was created by top competitors running:
- 24+ CPUs for 24-72 HOURS (not 2 hours)
- 953+ submissions over WEEKS (not 20)
- Team merges combining 17+ solution sources

We cannot replicate this with our compute budget.

| 010 | safe_ensemble | 70.3651 | 70.3651 | External data mining |
| 019 | ensemble | 70.3434 | 70.3434 | More external data |
| 029 | ensemble | 70.3155 | 70.3155 | Exhausted external sources |

## Response to Evaluator

The evaluator correctly identifies that:
1. **Row-based constructive FAILED** - produces 0.64-0.73 vs baseline 0.37 for small N
2. **Baseline uses sophisticated per-tree optimization** - not simple patterns
3. **The gap represents COMPUTE TIME, not algorithmic innovation**

I AGREE with the evaluator's assessment that:
- All algorithmic approaches have been exhausted
- The baseline is at a strong local optimum for our compute budget
- The only remaining options are: (1) more compute, (2) external solutions, (3) team merge

HOWEVER, I CANNOT GIVE UP. The target IS reachable.

## STRATEGIC PIVOT: SUBSET EXTRACTION FROM LARGE N

The kernel "new-simple-fix-rebuild-large-layout-check-on-all" reveals a technique we haven't tried:

**IDEA:** For each large N solution (N=100-200), extract subsets of trees that form better solutions for smaller N values.

**HOW IT WORKS:**
1. Take N=200 solution (200 trees)
2. For each corner of the bounding box, sort trees by distance from corner
3. Take first K trees → this is a candidate for N=K
4. If this candidate has smaller bounding box than current N=K solution → IMPROVEMENT!

**WHY THIS MIGHT WORK:**
- Large N solutions are highly optimized
- Subsets of well-packed trees may pack better than independently optimized small N
- This is a NOVEL approach we haven't tried

## Next Experiment: 043_subset_extraction

**APPROACH:** Extract subsets from large N solutions to improve small N

```python
# For each large N (100-200):
for large_n in range(100, 201):
    large_solution = load_solution(large_n)
    bounds = get_bounding_box(large_solution)
    
    # For each corner:
    for corner in [(bounds.minx, bounds.miny), (bounds.minx, bounds.maxy), 
                   (bounds.maxx, bounds.miny), (bounds.maxx, bounds.maxy)]:
        # Sort trees by distance from corner
        sorted_trees = sort_by_distance(large_solution, corner)
        
        # Extract subsets for smaller N
        for small_n in range(1, large_n):
            subset = sorted_trees[:small_n]
            subset_score = compute_score(subset, small_n)
            
            if subset_score < baseline_scores[small_n]:
                print(f"IMPROVEMENT: N={small_n} from N={large_n} corner")
                improvements[small_n] = subset
```

**EXPECTED OUTCOME:**
- May find improvements for some N values
- Even small improvements accumulate
- This is a DIFFERENT paradigm than local search

## What NOT to Try
- ❌ bbox3 with more iterations (proven: ZERO improvement)
- ❌ SA with different parameters (proven: ZERO improvement)
- ❌ Row-based constructive (proven: WORSE than baseline)
- ❌ Simple lattice patterns (proven: WORSE than baseline)
- ❌ Random multi-start (proven: cannot even generate valid configs)

## FALLBACK PLAN

If subset extraction fails:
1. **Check for NEW kernels/datasets** published in last 24 hours
2. **Run bbox3 for 24+ hours** as final compute-intensive attempt
3. **Accept current position** (70.308629) if nothing works

## CRITICAL REMINDER

The target (68.861114) IS achievable - top teams have done it.
But they did it with:
- 953+ submissions over WEEKS
- 24+ CPUs running for DAYS
- Team merges combining 17+ sources

We have 80 submissions remaining and limited compute.
The subset extraction approach is our best remaining novel idea.

## SUBMIT AFTER EXPERIMENT

YES - submit exp_043 regardless of outcome. We need LB feedback.
Even if no improvement, we learn whether this approach has potential.
