## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.315401 from exp_032
- Best valid LB score: 70.315537 from exp_029
- Target: 68.872047 | Gap to target: 1.44 points (2.05%)

## ⛔⛔⛔ CRITICAL: COMPLETE PLATEAU DETECTED ⛔⛔⛔

**The last 12 experiments (exp_021-032) found only 0.001 points total improvement.**
**At this rate, closing the 1.44 point gap would require ~18,000 experiments.**

**WHAT HAS BEEN EXHAUSTED:**
1. ❌ bbox3 optimization - 53 min run found 0.0000003 improvement
2. ❌ External data mining - all sources (saspav, kumaran, hvanphucs, chistyakov) exhausted
3. ❌ Ensemble optimization - already at best-per-N from all sources
4. ❌ SA, B&B, NFP, lattice, interlock, jostle, BLF - all converge to same score

## Response to Evaluator

The evaluator is CORRECT:
1. **Complete plateau confirmed** - 12 experiments, 0.001 total improvement
2. **Extended optimization failed** - 53 min bbox3 found essentially nothing
3. **N=187 overlap issue** - Fixed by using exp_029's known-good configuration
4. **Math doesn't work** - Current rate requires 18,000 experiments to reach target

**The evaluator's key insight**: Top competitors run for 24-72 HOURS with 24+ CPUs.
Our 53-minute run is 1/27th of 24 hours. This is like trying to boil water for 2 minutes.

## ⚠️ STRATEGIC DECISION REQUIRED ⚠️

**Option A: DRAMATICALLY LONGER COMPUTE TIME**
- Run bbox3 for 8+ HOURS (not 53 minutes)
- Use all 26 CPUs for parallel optimization
- This is what top competitors do

**Option B: FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT ALGORITHM**
- Implement constructive heuristic from scratch
- Build solutions bottom-up instead of local search
- Try tessellation/lattice patterns for large N

**Option C: WAIT FOR NEW EXTERNAL DATA**
- Monitor Kaggle for new kernels/datasets
- Top team "Jingle bins" may share solutions after competition

## Next Experiment: SUBMIT exp_032 FIRST

**CRITICAL**: exp_032 has NOT been submitted yet. Submit it to verify the N=187 fix works.

If exp_032 passes Kaggle validation:
- We have a valid 70.315401 submission
- Continue with Option A (extended optimization)

If exp_032 fails:
- The overlap validation is still broken
- Need to investigate further

## After Submission: Extended Optimization (8+ hours)

If we have time remaining, run bbox3 for as long as possible:

```bash
# Run for 8 hours with maximum iterations
timeout 28800 ./bbox3 -i submission.csv -o submission_optimized.csv -n 500000 -r 2000
```

This is 16x longer than exp_032 and may find improvements that shorter runs missed.

## What NOT to Try
- ❌ More short bbox3 runs (< 1 hour) - proven ineffective
- ❌ More external data mining - all sources exhausted
- ❌ SA/B&B/NFP variations - all converge to same score
- ❌ Ensemble variations - already at best-per-N

## Key Insight from Competition

The target (68.872047) IS reachable:
- Top team "Jingle bins" achieved it with 953+ submissions
- They ran optimization for WEEKS, not hours
- The gap is 2.05% - significant but not impossible

The ONLY viable paths forward are:
1. **MUCH LONGER COMPUTE TIME** (8-24+ hours)
2. **NEW EXTERNAL DATA** (if available)
3. **NOVEL ALGORITHMS** (constructive, not local search)

## IMMEDIATE ACTION: SUBMIT exp_032

Submit exp_032 to verify the N=187 fix works. This is the highest priority.
