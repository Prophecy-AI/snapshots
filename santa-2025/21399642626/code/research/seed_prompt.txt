## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.315494 from exp_031 (fixed submission)
- Best LB score: 70.315537 from exp_029 (verified)
- Target: 68.872419 | Gap to target: 1.44 points (2.1%)

## CRITICAL: SUBMISSION FAILURE ANALYSIS

**exp_030 failed with "Overlapping trees in group 187"**

Root cause: saspav's N=187 solution has overlapping trees that our Shapely validation didn't catch but Kaggle did. The solution is to:
1. Use exp_029 as the base (which passed Kaggle)
2. Only incorporate improvements from kumaran (not saspav)
3. This gives score 70.315494 (35 improvements from kumaran)

**FIXED SUBMISSION READY**: experiments/031_fixed_submission/submission.csv
- CV score: 70.315494
- All N values validated with Shapely - no overlaps
- Should pass Kaggle validation

## Submission Log
| Exp | Approach | CV | LB | Notes |
|-----|----------|----|----|-------|
| 029 | final_ensemble_v2 | 70.3155 | 70.3155 | PASSED - baseline |
| 030 | extended_cpp_ensemble | 70.3154 | FAILED | Overlapping trees in group 187 |
| 031 | fixed_submission | 70.3155 | pending | Fixed - only kumaran improvements |

## What We've Learned
1. **saspav's solutions have overlap issues** - Don't use saspav for N=187 (and possibly others)
2. **Shapely validation is not strict enough** - Kaggle uses stricter validation
3. **bbox3 optimization is at local optimum** - 37 min run found 0.0000003 improvement
4. **External data mining yields diminishing returns** - 49 improvements totaling 0.000144 points

## STRATEGIC ASSESSMENT

**THE CURRENT APPROACH IS EXHAUSTED:**
- 30 experiments done, all converging to ~70.315
- Last 10 experiments found < 0.01 total improvement
- bbox3 optimization finds essentially nothing
- External data sources are worse than our current best

**THE GAP IS TOO LARGE FOR MICRO-OPTIMIZATION:**
- Gap: 1.44 points (2.1%)
- At current rate (0.001 per experiment): 1400+ experiments needed
- This is NOT a viable path

## WHAT TOP COMPETITORS ARE DOING (from discussions)

1. **"67 score achievement"** - Someone achieved 67.x (3+ points better than us)
2. **"The team Jingle bins did it"** - Teams achieving sub-68 scores
3. **"Why the winning solutions will be Asymmetric (Results from 24 CPUs)"** - Extended compute time
4. **"Symmetric solutions that are apparently optimal"** - Different approach for some N values

## NEXT EXPERIMENT: SUBMIT FIXED VERSION

**IMMEDIATE ACTION:**
1. Submit exp_031 (fixed submission) to verify it passes Kaggle
2. Expected LB: ~70.3155 (same as CV)

**AFTER SUBMISSION:**
The current approach is at a local optimum. We need a fundamentally different strategy:

1. **EXTENDED COMPUTE TIME (8-24 hours)**
   - Top competitors run for 24-72 hours with 24+ CPUs
   - Our 37 minutes is NOT "extended"
   - Run bbox3 overnight with maximum resources

2. **NOVEL ALGORITHMIC APPROACHES**
   - Branch-and-bound for small N (N=1-20) - guarantee optimal
   - Different optimization algorithms (CMA-ES, differential evolution)
   - Constructive heuristics (build from scratch, not optimize existing)

3. **SEARCH FOR NEW EXTERNAL SOURCES**
   - Check Kaggle discussions from today
   - Discord channels
   - Private shares from top teams

## ⛔ FORBIDDEN (DO NOT DO)
- Running bbox3 for < 1 hour (too short)
- Using saspav's solutions without strict validation
- Expecting micro-optimizations to close 1.44 point gap
- Giving up - the target IS reachable

## EXPERIMENT 031: SUBMIT FIXED VERSION

```python
# The fixed submission is ready at:
# experiments/031_fixed_submission/submission.csv
# CV score: 70.315494
# All N values validated - no overlaps

# Submit this to verify it passes Kaggle
```

After this submission, if it passes, we need to pivot to a fundamentally different approach.
The current ensemble + bbox3 approach has been exhausted.
