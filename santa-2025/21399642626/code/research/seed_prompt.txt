## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.315537 from exp_029 (LAST VALID ON KAGGLE)
- Best LB score: 70.315537 (exp_029 - CV = LB exactly for this problem)
- Target: 68.870973 | Gap to target: 1.44 points (2.10%)

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: LAST 3 SUBMISSIONS FAILED ⚠️
- exp_030, exp_031, exp_032 ALL FAILED on Kaggle with "Overlapping trees in group 187"
- The N=187 solution from saspav external data has overlaps that Kaggle detects
- ALWAYS use exp_029 as the base - it's the LAST KNOWN-GOOD submission

## Response to Evaluator

The evaluator correctly identified that bbox3 is EXHAUSTED and we need a fundamentally different approach. I AGREE.

However, the evaluator suggests trying 8-hour optimization. While I'm skeptical (53 min found nothing), let's try it ONCE to definitively rule it out.

## ⛔ FORBIDDEN (WILL BE REJECTED)
- External data from saspav N=187 - CAUSES KAGGLE FAILURES
- Any ensemble that includes N=187 from external sources
- Submitting without validating against exp_029 base

## ✅ NEXT EXPERIMENT: 8-HOUR OPTIMIZATION (exp_034)

Try the evaluator's suggestion ONCE to definitively rule it out:

```bash
# Create experiment directory
cd /home/code/experiments
mkdir -p 034_8hr_optimization
cp /home/code/experiments/029_final_ensemble_v2/submission.csv 034_8hr_optimization/input.csv

# Run bbox3 for 8 hours (28800 seconds) with high iterations
timeout 28800 ./bbox3 -n 1000000 -r 5000 -i 034_8hr_optimization/input.csv -o 034_8hr_optimization/output.csv 2>&1 | tee 034_8hr_optimization/log.txt
```

**CRITICAL**:
1. Use exp_029 as base (last valid on Kaggle)
2. Monitor progress - if no improvement after 2 hours, consider stopping
3. Validate NO overlaps before submitting
4. Only submit if improvement > 0.001

**Expected outcome**: 
- Best case: Find 0.1-0.5 points improvement
- Likely case: Find essentially zero improvement (confirming local optimum)

## IF 8-HOUR OPTIMIZATION FAILS

If the 8-hour run finds nothing, we have PROVEN that bbox3 cannot escape the local optimum.

**Then try CONSTRUCTIVE ALGORITHMS** - build solutions from scratch:
1. Bottom-left-fill algorithm
2. Genetic algorithm with crossover
3. Tessellation-based initial placement

## SUBMIT STRATEGY
- SUBMIT exp_034 if it shows ANY improvement (even 0.001)
- If no improvement, DON'T submit (it's the same as exp_029)
- We have 82 submissions remaining

## CRITICAL REMINDER
The target score (68.870973) IS achievable - top teams have done it with 953+ submissions.
We need to find a breakthrough, not incremental improvements.
