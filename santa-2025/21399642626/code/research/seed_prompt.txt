## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.315537 from exp_029
- Best LB score: 70.315537 (exp_029 - VERIFIED on Kaggle)
- Target: 68.870973 (Jingle bins) | Gap to target: 1.44 points (2.10%)

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: SUBMISSION FAILED - FIX REQUIRED

**exp_032 FAILED with "Overlapping trees in group 187"**

The last submission failed due to overlaps in N=187. This is the THIRD consecutive failure (exp_030, exp_031, exp_032 all failed with N=187 overlaps).

**ROOT CAUSE:** The N=187 configuration from external sources (saspav) has overlaps that our Shapely validation doesn't catch but Kaggle does.

**IMMEDIATE FIX:** Use exp_029 submission directly - it's the last VALID submission that passed Kaggle.

## What We've Learned

### 1. bbox3 Extended Optimization is EXHAUSTED
- 53 minutes with 100K iterations and 300 restarts found 0.0000003 improvement
- The optimizer is at its absolute limit
- Running longer will NOT help

### 2. External Data Mining is EXHAUSTED
- ALL public kernels (saspav, hvanphucs, kumaran) are WORSE than our current best
- saspav latest: 70.318 (worse by 0.003)
- hvanphucs latest: 70.319 (worse by 0.003)
- kumaran latest: 70.319 (worse by 0.003)
- No more improvements to be found from external sources

### 3. The Gap is Too Large for Micro-Optimization
- Current: 70.315537
- Target: 68.870973
- Gap: 1.44 points (2.10%)
- Last 12 experiments found 0.001 points total
- At this rate, need ~18,000 experiments to close the gap

## Response to Evaluator

The evaluator correctly identified that:
1. **53 minutes is NOT "extended"** - Top teams run for 24-72 HOURS with 24+ CPUs
2. **The N=187 overlap issue** is causing submission failures
3. **The math doesn't work** - 0.001 improvement per 12 experiments = 18,000 experiments needed

I agree with the evaluator's assessment. The current approach is COMPLETELY EXHAUSTED.

## ⛔ WHAT NOT TO DO (PROVEN FAILURES)

1. ❌ Run bbox3 with more iterations - Found 0.0000003 improvement in 53 minutes
2. ❌ Mine external data - ALL sources are worse than our current best
3. ❌ Ensemble from same sources - Already done, no more improvements
4. ❌ Use N=187 from saspav - Causes Kaggle overlap failures

## ✅ NEXT EXPERIMENT: FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT APPROACH

### Option A: MUCH LONGER COMPUTE TIME (8-24 hours)
```bash
# Run bbox3 for 8 hours overnight
nohup timeout 28800 ./bbox3 -n 500000 -r 2000 -i submission.csv -o submission_8hr.csv &
```
This is 16x longer than our 53-minute run. May find improvements that shorter runs miss.

### Option B: TRY DIFFERENT OPTIMIZER (shake_public)
The shake_public binary exists but has library compatibility issues.
Try to resolve them or find an alternative.

### Option C: IMPLEMENT NOVEL ALGORITHM FROM SCRATCH
Focus on high-impact N values (N=1-50 contribute 27% of score):
1. **N=1**: Already optimal at 0.6612
2. **N=2-10**: Try exhaustive search with finer angle resolution
3. **N=11-50**: Implement constructive heuristic (bottom-left placement)

### Option D: ANALYZE TOP SOLUTIONS
The top teams (68.8-69.3) are 1+ points better. What are they doing differently?
- Asymmetric solutions?
- Per-N specialization?
- Different algorithm entirely?

## MANDATORY: FIX SUBMISSION BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE

Before any new experiment:
1. Copy exp_029 submission to /home/submission/submission.csv
2. Verify it passes local overlap validation
3. This is the LAST VALID submission

```bash
cp /home/code/experiments/029_final_ensemble_v2/submission.csv /home/submission/submission.csv
```

## KEY INSIGHT

The gap of 1.44 points (2.10%) is NOT achievable through:
- Running bbox3 longer (diminishing returns)
- Mining external data (all sources exhausted)
- Micro-optimizations (0.001 per 12 experiments)

We need a FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT approach:
1. Novel algorithm implementation
2. Per-N specialization for high-impact N values
3. Asymmetric solutions that break symmetry
4. Much longer compute time (8-24 hours, not 53 minutes)

The target IS achievable - top teams have done it. But not with our current approach.
