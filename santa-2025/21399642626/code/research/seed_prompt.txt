## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.265730 (exp_007 ensemble - but has overlap issues)
- Best valid LB score: 70.315537 (exp_029)
- Target: 68.866853 | Gap to target: 1.45 points (2.1%)
- Experiments: 38 total (17 consecutive with ~0 improvement)

## Response to Evaluator

The evaluator correctly identifies that we've hit a COMPLETE PLATEAU. After 17 experiments (exp_021-037), we've found only ~0.001 points of improvement total. The evaluator's analysis is spot-on:

1. **Compute time is inadequate**: Our longest bbox3 run was 53 minutes on 1 CPU. Top competitors run for 24-72 HOURS with 24+ CPUs. That's 1/655 to 1/1964 of their compute.

2. **All local search methods have failed**: SA, exhaustive search, NFP, backward propagation, multi-start, lattice, interlock, jostle, BLF, Numba SA, shake, GA - ALL converge to the same score.

3. **The baseline is at an extremely strong local optimum**: The solutions we have are the result of extended optimization by top competitors over DAYS.

## What We've Learned (from 38 experiments)

| Approach | Experiments | Best Score | Status |
|----------|-------------|------------|--------|
| Ensemble | 13 | 70.265730 | ⚠️ Best but has overlap issues |
| Local Search | 11 | 70.315389 | ❌ Exhausted |
| Constructive | 5 | 70.315537 | ❌ 50-200% worse than baseline |
| Extended Opt | 4 | 70.315389 | ⚠️ Only 53 min max - NOT ENOUGH |
| Population | 3 | 70.315537 | ❌ GA found nothing |
| Baseline | 2 | 70.523320 | ✅ Starting point |

## ⛔ CRITICAL: WHAT DOES NOT WORK (PROVEN)

- ❌ Running bbox3 for < 1 hour → SAME SCORE
- ❌ SA/local search from baseline → SAME SCORE  
- ❌ Constructive algorithms (lattice, BLF) → 50-200% WORSE
- ❌ Population-based search (GA) → SAME SCORE
- ❌ External data mining → ALL SOURCES EXHAUSTED

## ✅ ONLY UNTRIED APPROACH: EXTENDED OPTIMIZATION (8-24+ HOURS)

The evaluator is RIGHT. The ONLY approach that top teams use that we haven't tried at scale is:

**RUN BBOX3 FOR 8-24 HOURS IN BACKGROUND**

```bash
# Start 24-hour bbox3 optimization in background
cd /home/code/experiments
nohup timeout 86400 ./bbox3 -n 1000000 -r 5000 -i submission.csv -o submission_24hr.csv > bbox3_24hr.log 2>&1 &

# Monitor progress periodically
tail -f bbox3_24hr.log
```

## Next Experiment: 038_extended_24hr_optimization

### REQUIRED STEPS:

1. **Start bbox3 in background for 8+ hours**
   - Use nohup to keep it running
   - Use high iteration count (1M+)
   - Use many restarts (5000+)
   - Monitor progress periodically

2. **While waiting, try to find NEW external data sources**
   - Check if there are newer kernels with better solutions
   - Download "Team Optimization Blend" kernel output
   - Look for any CSV files we haven't tried

3. **Analyze per-N contributions**
   - Which N values contribute most to the gap?
   - Can we focus optimization on specific N ranges?

4. **If bbox3 finds improvements after 8+ hours**
   - Validate no overlaps
   - Submit to get LB feedback

### EXPECTED OUTCOME:

If top competitors get to 68.89 with 24-72 hours of optimization, and we're at 70.31 with 53 minutes, then:
- 8 hours = 9x our current compute → might find 0.1-0.5 points
- 24 hours = 27x our current compute → might find 0.5-1.0 points

This is the ONLY path forward that hasn't been tried.

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: DO NOT DO THESE

- ❌ DO NOT run more short optimization experiments (< 1 hour)
- ❌ DO NOT try more novel algorithms (SA, GA, lattice, etc.)
- ❌ DO NOT mine more external data without verification
- ❌ DO NOT submit experiments that are identical to previous ones

## SUBMISSION STRATEGY

- We have 82 submissions remaining
- SUBMIT any experiment that shows > 0.001 improvement
- Even if CV is slightly worse, submit to verify LB behavior
- Track what we learn from each submission

## CRITICAL REMINDER

The target (68.866853) IS reachable - it's the current leaderboard position. Top teams achieved sub-68 scores through extended optimization (24-72 hours). The gap is 1.45 points (2.1%) - significant but achievable with sufficient compute time.

**THE ONLY UNTRIED APPROACH IS DRAMATICALLY MORE COMPUTE TIME. TRY IT.**
