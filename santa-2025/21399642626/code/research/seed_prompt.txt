## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.315494 from exp_031 (fixed submission)
- Best LB score: 70.315537 from exp_029 (verified)
- Target: 68.872419 | Gap to target: 1.44 points (2.1%)

## CRITICAL: SUBMISSION FAILURE FIXED

**exp_030 failed with "Overlapping trees in group 187"**
- Root cause: saspav's N=187 solution has overlapping trees
- Fixed in exp_031: Uses only kumaran's improvements (35 N values)
- exp_031 CV score: 70.315494 (all N values validated)

**SUBMIT exp_031 FIRST** to verify it passes Kaggle.

## STRATEGIC ANALYSIS

### Packing Efficiency Analysis
- Tree area: 0.245625
- Theoretical lower bound (100% efficiency): 49.125
- Current efficiency: 69.86%
- Target efficiency: 71.33%
- Need: 1.47 percentage points improvement

### Why Current Approach is Exhausted
1. **30 experiments done** - all converge to ~70.315
2. **bbox3 optimization** - 37 min run found 0.0000003 improvement
3. **External data** - all sources worse than our current best
4. **Ensemble approach** - already extracted all value from available sources

### What Top Competitors Are Doing
From discussions:
- "67 score achievement" - 3+ points better than us
- "Jingle bins did it" - sub-68 scores achieved
- "Results from 24 CPUs" - extended compute time (24-72 hours)
- "Asymmetric solutions" - different approach for different N ranges

## NEXT EXPERIMENT: SUBMIT FIXED VERSION

**IMMEDIATE ACTION:**
```python
# Submit exp_031 (fixed submission)
# File: experiments/031_fixed_submission/submission.csv
# CV score: 70.315494
# Expected LB: ~70.3155
```

## AFTER SUBMISSION: STRATEGIC PIVOT REQUIRED

The current approach is at a local optimum. We need fundamentally different strategies:

### Option 1: EXTENDED COMPUTE TIME (8-24 hours)
```bash
# Run bbox3 overnight with maximum resources
timeout 28800 ./bbox3 -n 1000000 -r 2000 -i submission.csv -o submission_optimized.csv
# 8 hours, 1M iterations, 2000 restarts
```
Top competitors run for 24-72 hours. Our 37 minutes is NOT "extended".

### Option 2: BRANCH-AND-BOUND FOR SMALL N
For N=1-20, we can guarantee optimal solutions:
```python
# Exhaustive search for small N
# N=1: Already optimal (45° rotation)
# N=2-10: Branch-and-bound with pruning
# N=11-20: Heuristic + local search
```
Small N values contribute disproportionately to score.

### Option 3: DIFFERENT OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHM
Try algorithms that escape local optima:
- CMA-ES (Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy)
- Differential Evolution
- Particle Swarm Optimization

### Option 4: CONSTRUCTIVE HEURISTICS
Build solutions from scratch instead of optimizing existing:
- Bottom-left placement
- NFP-guided placement
- Lattice-based initialization

## ⛔ FORBIDDEN (DO NOT DO)
- Running bbox3 for < 1 hour (too short)
- Using saspav's solutions without strict validation
- Expecting micro-optimizations to close 1.44 point gap
- More ensemble variations without new data sources

## EXPERIMENT SEQUENCE

1. **exp_031**: Submit fixed version (verify it passes)
2. **exp_032**: Extended bbox3 optimization (8+ hours)
3. **exp_033**: Branch-and-bound for N=2-10
4. **exp_034**: CMA-ES or differential evolution

## KEY INSIGHT

The gap is 1.44 points (2.1%). This requires:
- Either MUCH more compute time (24-72 hours)
- Or a fundamentally different algorithm
- Or new external data sources with better solutions

The current ensemble + short bbox3 approach is EXHAUSTED.
