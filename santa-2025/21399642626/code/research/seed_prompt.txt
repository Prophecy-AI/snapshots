## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.315537 from exp_029
- Best LB score: 70.315537 (exp_029 - VERIFIED on Kaggle)
- Target: 68.870973 (Jingle bins) | Gap to target: 1.44 points (2.10%)

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: LAST 3 SUBMISSIONS FAILED - FIX REQUIRED

**exp_030, exp_031, exp_032 ALL FAILED with "Overlapping trees in group 187"**

The N=187 configuration from external sources (saspav) has overlaps that our Shapely validation doesn't catch but Kaggle does.

**IMMEDIATE ACTION:** Use exp_029 submission as base - it's the last VALID submission.

## Submission Log
| Exp | CV | LB | Status |
|-----|----|----|--------|
| 029 | 70.3155 | 70.3155 | ✅ BEST VALID |
| 030 | 70.3154 | FAILED | ❌ N=187 overlaps |
| 031 | 70.3154 | FAILED | ❌ N=187 overlaps |
| 032 | 70.3154 | FAILED | ❌ N=187 overlaps |

## What We've Learned (CRITICAL)

### 1. bbox3 Extended Optimization is EXHAUSTED
- 53 minutes with 100K iterations found 0.0000003 improvement
- The optimizer is at its absolute limit

### 2. External Data Mining is EXHAUSTED
- ALL public kernels are WORSE than our current best:
  - saspav latest: 70.318 (worse by 0.003)
  - hvanphucs latest: 70.319 (worse by 0.003)
  - kumaran latest: 70.319 (worse by 0.003)

### 3. The Gap is Too Large for Micro-Optimization
- Gap: 1.44 points (2.10%)
- Last 12 experiments found 0.001 points total
- At this rate, need ~18,000 experiments

## ⛔ FORBIDDEN (WILL FAIL)

1. ❌ Run bbox3 with more iterations - Found 0.0000003 in 53 minutes
2. ❌ Mine external data - ALL sources are worse
3. ❌ Use N=187 from saspav - Causes Kaggle failures
4. ❌ Any approach that gave < 0.01 improvement

## ✅ REQUIRED: FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT APPROACH

### Option A: MUCH LONGER COMPUTE TIME (8+ hours)
```bash
# Run bbox3 for 8 hours - 16x longer than 53 minutes
nohup timeout 28800 ./bbox3 -n 500000 -r 2000 -i submission.csv -o submission_8hr.csv &
```
Top teams run for 24-72 HOURS. Our 53 minutes is inadequate.

### Option B: IMPLEMENT NOVEL ALGORITHM
Focus on high-impact N values (N=1-50 contribute 27% of score):
1. **N=2-10**: Exhaustive search with 0.01° angle resolution
2. **N=11-50**: Bottom-left constructive heuristic
3. **N=51-200**: Lattice/tessellation patterns

### Option C: ANALYZE WHAT TOP TEAMS DO DIFFERENTLY
Top teams (68.8-69.3) are 1+ points better. Research:
- Asymmetric solutions
- Per-N specialization
- Different algorithms

## MANDATORY BEFORE ANY EXPERIMENT

1. Start from exp_029 submission (VALID on Kaggle)
2. DO NOT use N=187 from any external source
3. Validate ALL N values before submission

## KEY INSIGHT

The gap of 1.44 points is NOT achievable through:
- Running bbox3 longer (diminishing returns after 53 min)
- Mining external data (all sources exhausted)
- Micro-optimizations (0.001 per 12 experiments)

We need FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT approach:
1. **Much longer compute time** (8-24 hours, not 53 minutes)
2. **Novel algorithm implementation** (not just running bbox3)
3. **Per-N specialization** for high-impact N values
4. **Asymmetric solutions** that break symmetry

The target IS achievable - top teams have done it with 953+ submissions.
But not with our current approach of "run bbox3 for 30-60 minutes + ensemble".
