## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.315389 from exp_031
- Best LB score: 70.3155 (exp_029)
- Target: 68.872419 | Gap: 1.44 points (2.1%)

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: PLATEAU DETECTED - 11 EXPERIMENTS WITH 0.001 TOTAL IMPROVEMENT ⚠️

The last 11 experiments (exp_021 to exp_031) have found only 0.001 points of improvement total.
At this rate, closing the 1.44 point gap would require ~14,000 experiments.

**THE CURRENT APPROACH HAS COMPLETELY FAILED. MICRO-OPTIMIZATION IS BLOCKED.**

## Response to Evaluator

The evaluator is CORRECT:
1. ✅ "Complete plateau for 11 experiments" - TRUE, only 0.001 total improvement
2. ✅ "Optimization time is inadequate" - TRUE, 37 min bbox3 found nothing
3. ✅ "External data sources exhausted" - TRUE, 0.000148 per experiment
4. ✅ "No novel algorithmic approaches" - TRUE, all recent experiments are ensemble variations

**HOWEVER, I DISAGREE with the recommendation to run bbox3 for 8-24 hours:**
- The environment has time limits that prevent 8+ hour runs
- Even if we could run longer, the evidence shows bbox3 is at a local optimum
- Top competitors achieved 68.87 through DIFFERENT APPROACHES, not just longer runs

## What We Know About Top Competitors

From leaderboard analysis:
- **Jingle bins: 68.872046** (target)
- **shr: 68.901909**
- **bowwowplusa: 68.915927**

These teams are 1.4+ points better than us. They achieved this through:
1. **Extended compute time** (24-72 hours with 24+ CPUs) - NOT feasible in our environment
2. **Novel algorithms** - This IS feasible
3. **Per-N specialization** - This IS feasible
4. **Accumulation over 900+ submissions** - We have 93 submissions left

## ⛔ BLOCKED APPROACHES (DO NOT DO) ⛔

1. ❌ Running bbox3/sa_fast with "more iterations" - PROVEN INEFFECTIVE
2. ❌ Ensemble variations from same sources - EXHAUSTED
3. ❌ External data mining - DIMINISHING RETURNS (0.000148/experiment)
4. ❌ Any approach that gave < 0.01 improvement in last 5 experiments

## ✅ REQUIRED: FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT APPROACH

### Option 1: EXTENDED OPTIMIZATION WITH PARALLEL PROCESSING

Since we can't run for 8+ hours, we need to be SMARTER about optimization:

```python
# Run bbox3 in parallel on different N ranges
import subprocess
import multiprocessing

def optimize_n_range(start_n, end_n, iterations=50000):
    """Optimize a specific N range with bbox3"""
    # Extract N values from current best
    # Run bbox3 with high iterations
    # Return improved solutions
    pass

# Run in parallel
with multiprocessing.Pool(4) as pool:
    results = pool.starmap(optimize_n_range, [
        (1, 50, 100000),    # Small N - more iterations
        (51, 100, 50000),   # Medium N
        (101, 150, 30000),  # Large N
        (151, 200, 20000),  # Very large N
    ])
```

### Option 2: FOCUS ON HIGH-IMPACT N VALUES

Analysis shows N=1-50 contribute ~24% of total score but may have more room for improvement.

```python
# For each N in 1-50:
# 1. Extract current solution
# 2. Run exhaustive search around current position
# 3. Try multiple random restarts
# 4. Keep best solution

for n in range(1, 51):
    current_score = get_score_for_n(n)
    
    # Exhaustive local search
    for dx in np.linspace(-0.1, 0.1, 21):
        for dy in np.linspace(-0.1, 0.1, 21):
            for dtheta in np.linspace(-5, 5, 21):
                # Try perturbation
                new_score = evaluate_perturbation(n, dx, dy, dtheta)
                if new_score < current_score:
                    save_improvement(n, new_score)
```

### Option 3: CONSTRUCTIVE ALGORITHM FROM SCRATCH

Instead of optimizing existing solutions, BUILD new ones:

```python
def build_solution_from_scratch(n):
    """Build a solution for N trees using bottom-left-fill"""
    trees = []
    
    # Place first tree at origin
    trees.append({'x': 0, 'y': 0, 'deg': 0})
    
    for i in range(1, n):
        # Find best position for next tree
        best_pos = None
        best_score = float('inf')
        
        # Try many candidate positions
        for angle in range(0, 360, 5):
            for r in np.linspace(0.5, 5, 20):
                x = r * np.cos(np.radians(angle))
                y = r * np.sin(np.radians(angle))
                
                # Check if valid (no overlaps)
                if is_valid_placement(trees, x, y, 0):
                    score = calculate_bbox_score(trees + [{'x': x, 'y': y, 'deg': 0}])
                    if score < best_score:
                        best_score = score
                        best_pos = (x, y, 0)
        
        if best_pos:
            trees.append({'x': best_pos[0], 'y': best_pos[1], 'deg': best_pos[2]})
    
    return trees
```

## EXPERIMENT 032: PARALLEL INTENSIVE OPTIMIZATION

**Objective**: Run bbox3 optimization in parallel on different N ranges with maximum iterations

**Steps**:
1. Split N=1-200 into 4 ranges
2. Run bbox3 on each range in parallel with 50000+ iterations
3. Combine results with current best
4. Validate for overlaps
5. Submit to get LB feedback

**Expected improvement**: 0.01-0.1 points (if any improvement is possible with bbox3)

**CRITICAL**: If this experiment shows < 0.001 improvement, we MUST pivot to constructive algorithms.

## ALTERNATIVE: SUBMIT CURRENT BEST AND ANALYZE

Since exp_031 has CV=70.315389 and we haven't submitted it yet:
1. Submit exp_031 to get LB feedback
2. If LB matches CV, our validation is correct
3. Use remaining 92 submissions for more aggressive experimentation

## SUBMIT STRATEGY

**SUBMIT exp_031 NOW** to verify LB score matches CV.

Then continue with parallel optimization experiment.

## What NOT to Try

1. ❌ More ensemble variations from same sources
2. ❌ Short bbox3 runs (< 30 min)
3. ❌ External data mining (exhausted)
4. ❌ Any approach that doesn't fundamentally change the optimization strategy
