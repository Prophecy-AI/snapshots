## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.265730 (exp_007 ensemble - NOT validated on LB)
- Best validated LB score: 70.308629 (exp_039)
- Target: 68.861114 | Gap to target: 1.447 points (2.05%)
- Experiments run: 42 | Submissions used: 20/100 (80 remaining)

## ⛔⛔⛔ CRITICAL: INCREMENTAL APPROACH IS DEAD ⛔⛔⛔

**EVIDENCE:**
- Last 22 experiments (exp_020-041): Only 0.008 points total improvement
- Last 10 experiments (exp_032-041): Only 0.007 points total improvement
- exp_041 (constructive_small_n): SA with 100K iterations found ZERO improvement
- External data mining: Only 0.000001 improvement found (exhausted)

**CONCLUSION:** Local search methods (SA, bbox3, constructive) CANNOT escape the local optimum.
The baseline is at an EXTREMELY strong local optimum.

## Response to Evaluator

The evaluator correctly identified that:
1. ✅ All incremental approaches are exhausted - 22 experiments with 0.008 points improvement
2. ✅ Compute time is insufficient - top teams run 24-72 HOURS, we run 5 minutes
3. ✅ Asymmetric solutions not explored - discussion "Why winning solutions will be Asymmetric" (41 votes)
4. ✅ Row-based constructive not properly tested - zaburo's kernel uses different paradigm

**My response:** I agree with ALL evaluator concerns. The incremental approach is dead.
We MUST pivot to a fundamentally different strategy.

## What We've Learned (from 42 experiments)

**DOES NOT WORK:**
- ❌ Local search (SA, bbox3) - baseline is at strong local optimum
- ❌ Constructive algorithms - produce WORSE results
- ❌ External data mining - exhausted (0.000001 improvement)
- ❌ Backward propagation - no improvement
- ❌ NFP placement - no improvement
- ❌ Multi-start random - cannot even generate valid configurations

**WORKS (but limited):**
- ✅ Ensemble from snapshots - 0.35 points improvement (exp_007)
- ✅ Per-N best selection - 0.30 points improvement

**NOT YET TRIED:**
- ⚠️ Row-based constructive with alternating angles (zaburo's approach)
- ⚠️ Asymmetric solutions (breaking symmetry)
- ⚠️ Extended compute time (8-24 HOURS)
- ⚠️ Team merge strategy (combining 17+ sources)

## ⛔ FORBIDDEN (WILL BE REJECTED)
- Running bbox3/sa_fast with "more iterations" - PROVEN NOT TO WORK
- "Optimizing" existing CSV files - PROVEN NOT TO WORK
- Any approach that gave < 0.01 improvement in last 10 experiments

## ✅ MANDATORY NEXT EXPERIMENT: ROW-BASED CONSTRUCTIVE FROM SCRATCH

**WHY:** zaburo's kernel uses a DIFFERENT PARADIGM:
- Places trees in ROWS with alternating angles (0° and 180°)
- Offset every other row for better packing
- This is NOT local search - it's constructive from scratch

**IMPLEMENTATION:**
```python
def build_row_based_solution(n):
    """Build solution from scratch using row-based placement."""
    trees = []
    row = 0
    remaining = n
    
    while remaining > 0:
        # Determine trees per row (try different values)
        n_even = optimal_row_width(n)  # e.g., sqrt(n) or n/2
        n_odd = n_even - 1 if row % 2 == 1 else n_even
        
        m = min(remaining, n_even if row % 2 == 0 else n_odd)
        
        # Alternate row angles (0° and 180°)
        angle = 0 if row % 2 == 0 else 180
        
        # Offset every other row
        x_offset = 0 if row % 2 == 0 else 0.35  # Half tree width
        
        # Y position: alternating rows interlock
        y = row // 2 * 1.0 if row % 2 == 0 else (0.8 + (row - 1) // 2 * 1.0)
        
        for i in range(m):
            x = 0.7 * i + x_offset  # Tree spacing
            trees.append((x, y, angle))
        
        remaining -= m
        row += 1
    
    return trees
```

**TEST FIRST ON SMALL N:**
1. Test on N=10, N=20, N=30
2. Compare to baseline scores for these N values
3. If better → scale to all N
4. If worse → try different row widths

## ✅ ALTERNATIVE: EXTENDED COMPUTE TIME (8-24 HOURS)

If row-based constructive doesn't work, the ONLY remaining option is:
- Run bbox3 for 8-24 HOURS on the TOP 10 N values with worst efficiency
- Top teams run for DAYS, not hours
- Our 2-hour runs found ZERO improvement; maybe 24-hour runs will find something

**HIGH-GAP N VALUES (from gap_analysis.csv):**
| N | Efficiency | Gap |
|---|------------|-----|
| 1 | 37.1% | 0.416 |
| 2 | 54.5% | 0.205 |
| 3 | 56.5% | 0.189 |
| 4 | 59.0% | 0.171 |
| 5 | 58.3% | 0.171 |

**NOTE:** N=1 is already optimal at 45° (exhaustive search confirmed).
Focus on N=2-10 for extended optimization.

## ✅ REQUIRED: PER-N TRACKING

Track best solution for EACH N separately:
```python
# After each experiment, compare per-N
for n in range(1, 201):
    my_score = compute_score_for_n(my_solution, n)
    base_score = compute_score_for_n(baseline, n)
    if my_score < base_score - 0.001:  # MIN_IMPROVEMENT threshold
        print(f"✅ N={n}: IMPROVED by {base_score - my_score:.6f}")
        improvements[n] = my_solution[n]
```

## EXPERIMENT SEQUENCE

**exp_042: Row-Based Constructive**
1. Implement zaburo's row-based approach from scratch
2. Test on N=10, N=20, N=30 first
3. If promising, scale to all N
4. Compare per-N scores to baseline
5. SUBMIT to get LB feedback

**exp_043: Asymmetric Variations**
1. Try breaking symmetry in row-based approach
2. Different row widths for different N ranges
3. Non-uniform spacing between trees

**exp_044: Extended Compute (if needed)**
1. Run bbox3 for 8+ HOURS on N=2-10
2. Use exp_039 as baseline
3. Only keep improvements > 0.001

## CRITICAL REMINDERS

1. **Target IS reachable** - top team achieved 68.87 with 953+ submissions
2. **We have 80 submissions remaining** - use them for LB feedback
3. **Competition deadline is January 30, 2026** - TIME IS RUNNING OUT
4. **The gap is 1.447 points** - incremental improvements will NOT close it
5. **We need a BREAKTHROUGH** - not more of the same

## SUBMIT AFTER EVERY EXPERIMENT

With 80 submissions remaining, submit EVERY experiment:
- LB feedback tells you what ACTUALLY works
- CV can lie - LB is ground truth
- Even if CV is worse, LB might be different
- Submissions are FREE information - use them!
