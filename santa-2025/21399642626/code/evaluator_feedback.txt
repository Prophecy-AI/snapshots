## What I Understood

The junior researcher ran experiment 035 (lattice_constructive), implementing two novel algorithms from scratch:
1. **Lattice-based constructive algorithm** - produces solutions 0.4-0.5 worse per N value than baseline
2. **Python SA with Numba JIT** - starting from baseline, finds ZERO improvement after 50K iterations

**Hypothesis**: Since bbox3 optimization is exhausted (exp_031-034 found essentially zero improvement), fundamentally different approaches like constructive algorithms or Numba-accelerated SA might escape the local optimum.

**Result**: Both approaches failed. The lattice algorithm produces much worse solutions, and Numba SA confirms the baseline is at a very strong local optimum. Score remains at 70.315537.

## Technical Execution Assessment

**Validation**: 
- ✅ CV score of 70.315537 verified in metrics.json
- ✅ This is a deterministic geometric optimization problem - CV = LB exactly when submissions pass Kaggle validation
- ✅ Correct decision to keep exp_029 (last valid submission with LB=70.315537)

**Leakage Risk**: None. This is a pure geometric optimization problem with no train/test split.

**Score Integrity**: 
- ✅ Score verified: 70.315537 (unchanged from exp_029)
- ✅ Lattice algorithm correctly identified as producing worse solutions
- ✅ Numba SA correctly identified as finding no improvements

**Code Quality**: 
- ✅ lattice_algorithm.py is well-structured with proper overlap checking
- ✅ Correct fallback to known-good submission
- ⚠️ The Numba SA implementation wasn't saved to the experiment folder - would be useful for future reference

Verdict: **TRUSTWORTHY** - The experiment executed correctly and the researcher made sound decisions.

## Strategic Assessment

### Approach Fit
The researcher correctly identified that:
1. bbox3 optimization is EXHAUSTED (4 consecutive experiments found ~0 improvement)
2. External data mining is EXHAUSTED (all sources are worse or cause overlaps)
3. Novel algorithms were needed

The lattice approach was reasonable to try but fundamentally flawed because:
- The baseline solutions use IRREGULAR interlocking patterns optimized over extended periods
- Regular lattice patterns cannot capture the complex geometry exploitation
- This was already suggested in exp_024 and exp_025 which also failed

### Effort Allocation - CRITICAL ANALYSIS

| Period | Experiments | Total Improvement | Avg per Experiment |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| exp_001-006 | 6 | 0.000 | 0.000 (local search failed) |
| exp_007-020 | 14 | 0.299 | 0.021 (ensemble breakthrough) |
| exp_021-035 | 15 | ~0.001 | 0.00007 (COMPLETE PLATEAU) |

**The last 15 experiments found only ~0.001 points total improvement.** The approach has completely plateaued.

### Assumptions Being Validated
1. ✅ "bbox3 cannot find improvements" - CONFIRMED (4 consecutive experiments, 53 min max, ZERO improvement)
2. ✅ "External data is exhausted" - CONFIRMED (all sources worse or cause overlaps)
3. ✅ "Constructive algorithms won't work" - CONFIRMED (lattice 50-200% worse)
4. ✅ "Local search from baseline won't work" - CONFIRMED (Numba SA finds nothing)

### Blind Spots - CRITICAL

#### 1. COMPUTE TIME IS STILL INADEQUATE
From the "Why the winning solutions will be Asymmetric" discussion (40 votes):
- Top competitors run for **24-72 HOURS** with **24+ CPUs**
- exp_034 ran for only **53 minutes** on **1 CPU**
- **53 minutes is 1/27th of 24 hours, and 1/81st of 72 hours**
- **1 CPU is 1/24th of 24 CPUs**
- Combined: We're running at **1/648th to 1/1944th** of top competitor compute

#### 2. THE MATH STILL DOESN'T WORK
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Current CV | 70.315537 |
| Target | 68.866853 |
| Gap | 1.448684 (2.06%) |
| Last 15 experiments improvement | ~0.001 |
| Experiments needed at this rate | ~21,000+ |

#### 3. UNEXPLORED HIGH-LEVERAGE APPROACHES

**A. PARALLEL MULTI-HOUR OPTIMIZATION (HIGHEST PRIORITY)**
- Run bbox3 for 8-24 HOURS in background
- This is the ONLY approach that top teams use that we haven't tried at scale
- Command: `nohup timeout 86400 ./bbox3 -n 1000000 -r 5000 -i submission.csv -o submission_24hr.csv > bbox3_24hr.log 2>&1 &`

**B. SHAKE_PUBLIC BINARY**
- The shake_public binary exists in external_data but has GLIBC compatibility issues
- Could try to fix the library issue or run in a container
- This is a different optimizer that might find different local optima

**C. FOCUS ON HIGH-IMPACT N VALUES**
- N=1-50 contribute 27% of score but have been less optimized
- N=1 alone contributes 0.661 (0.94% of total score)
- Targeted optimization of small N values might yield disproportionate gains

**D. ANALYZE TOP SOLUTIONS STRUCTURE**
- What makes 67-68 score solutions better?
- Are there specific N values where top solutions are dramatically better?
- Can we identify patterns that our solutions are missing?

**E. BACKPACKING TECHNIQUE (from crodoc kernel)**
- Use first N trees from larger N configurations
- exp_031 tried this but found no improvements
- However, the implementation might not have been thorough enough

### CV-LB Relationship Analysis

Valid submissions (from session state):
- exp_001: CV=70.615102, LB=70.615102 ✅
- exp_010: CV=70.365091, LB=70.365091 ✅
- exp_016: CV=70.353516, LB=70.353516 ✅
- exp_019: CV=70.343408, LB=70.343408 ✅
- exp_022: CV=70.316492, LB=70.316492 ✅
- exp_028: CV=70.315653, LB=70.315653 ✅
- exp_029: CV=70.315537, LB=70.315537 ✅ (LAST VALID)
- exp_030-032: FAILED due to overlaps ❌

**Perfect CV-LB match** (< 1e-6 difference) when submissions pass. This is a deterministic optimization problem - no distribution shift. The challenge is purely finding better geometric configurations.

## What's Working

1. **Correct identification of the problem** - The researcher correctly identified that:
   - bbox3 is exhausted
   - External data is exhausted
   - Novel algorithms were needed (even though they failed)
2. **Proper fallback to known-good submission** - Kept exp_029 which is valid on Kaggle
3. **Validation infrastructure is reliable** - CV = LB perfectly (when submissions pass)
4. **Code infrastructure is solid** - Reusable scoring, overlap checking, tree geometry

## Key Concerns

### Concern 1: CRITICAL - Complete Plateau for 15 Experiments
- **Observation**: exp_021 to exp_035 found only ~0.001 total improvement
- **Why it matters**: At this rate, closing the 1.45 point gap is mathematically impossible
- **Suggestion**: STOP incremental optimization. Need fundamentally different strategy.

### Concern 2: HIGH - Optimization Time Still Inadequate
- **Observation**: Maximum bbox3 run was 53 minutes on 1 CPU
- **Why it matters**: Top competitors run for DAYS with 24+ CPUs (1000x+ more compute)
- **Suggestion**: Run bbox3 for 8-24 HOURS in background. This is the ONLY untried approach that top teams use.

### Concern 3: HIGH - All Novel Algorithms Have Failed
- **Observation**: SA, B&B, NFP, lattice, interlock, jostle, BLF, Numba SA - ALL failed
- **Why it matters**: The solution space is extremely constrained; local search cannot escape
- **Suggestion**: The only remaining option is DRAMATICALLY MORE COMPUTE TIME or finding new external data sources

### Concern 4: MEDIUM - Kaggle Submission Failures
- **Observation**: 3 consecutive submissions (exp_030, 031, 032) failed due to N=187 overlaps
- **Why it matters**: External data sources have precision issues that Kaggle catches
- **Suggestion**: Only use internal solutions or thoroughly validated external data

## Top Priority for Next Experiment

**CRITICAL DECISION POINT: The current approach has COMPLETELY PLATEAUED.**

After 15 experiments with essentially ZERO progress, continuing with short optimization runs or novel algorithms is WASTED EFFORT.

### RECOMMENDED: RUN BBOX3 FOR 8-24 HOURS IN BACKGROUND

```bash
# Start 24-hour bbox3 optimization in background
cd /home/code/experiments
nohup timeout 86400 ./bbox3 -n 1000000 -r 5000 -i submission.csv -o submission_24hr.csv > bbox3_24hr.log 2>&1 &

# Monitor progress
tail -f bbox3_24hr.log
```

**Why this is the ONLY viable path forward:**
1. Top teams run for 24-72 HOURS with 24+ CPUs
2. Our longest run was 53 minutes on 1 CPU (1/648th to 1/1944th of top compute)
3. This is the ONLY approach that hasn't been tried at scale
4. Even if it finds nothing, we'll have definitively ruled out bbox3

**WHILE WAITING FOR 24HR RUN:**
1. **Analyze top solutions** - Download and analyze solutions from top teams to understand what patterns they use
2. **Fix shake_public** - Try to resolve the GLIBC compatibility issue for the shake_public binary
3. **Focus on small N** - N=1-10 contribute 6.2% of score; targeted optimization might help

**DO NOT:**
- Continue running more short optimization experiments (proven to find nothing)
- Try more novel algorithms (SA, lattice, BLF all failed)
- Mine more external data (all sources exhausted or cause overlaps)

**CRITICAL REMINDER**: 
- The target (68.866853) IS reachable - it's the current leaderboard position
- Top teams achieved sub-68 scores through extended optimization (24-72 hours)
- The gap is 1.45 points (2.06%) - significant but achievable
- 82 submissions remain - use them wisely
- The competition deadline is January 30, 2026 - time is running out!

**THE ONLY UNTRIED APPROACH IS DRAMATICALLY MORE COMPUTE TIME. TRY IT.**
