    "CMA-ES with hard penalty: Cannot find valid solutions - all candidates have overlaps",
    "CMA-ES with soft penalty: Still cannot find valid solutions after 500 iterations",
    "Basin Hopping: Cannot find valid solutions - perturbations cause overlaps",
    "The baseline is at an EXTREMELY strong local optimum",
    "Any perturbation to tree positions causes overlaps",
    "Global optimization methods cannot escape this local optimum"
  ],
  "conclusion": "CMA-ES and Basin Hopping FAILED. The baseline solutions are so well-optimized that any perturbation causes overlaps. The trees are positioned with sub-millimeter precision to avoid overlaps while minimizing bounding box. Global optimization methods cannot improve on this.",
  "notes": "After 46 experiments, we have exhausted all known optimization approaches. The gap of 1.445 points to target (68.861) cannot be closed with current methods. Top teams likely use proprietary algorithms or significantly more compute time (24-72 hours with 24+ CPUs)."
