  "improvement": 0.0,
  "approaches_tried": [
    "Cross-N hybridization (random selection from nearby N values)",
    "Greedy cross-N hybridization (add trees one at a time)",
    "Systematic extraction from N+k (k=1,2,3,4,5)",
    "Verification of k=1 extraction with very low threshold"
  ],
  "findings": [
    "Cross-N hybridization (random): Cannot find valid solutions - overlaps everywhere",
    "Greedy hybrid: Produces WORSE results (0.5-0.9 vs baseline 0.37)",
    "Systematic extraction: No improvements found for any N value",
    "Verification: CONFIRMED no more k=1 improvements exist",
    "The baseline (exp_044) is at a LOCAL OPTIMUM for subset extraction"
  ],
  "conclusion": "Cross-N hybridization does NOT work. Trees from different N solutions cannot be combined to form better solutions. The baseline is at a strong local optimum that cannot be improved by any subset extraction method.",
  "notes": "After 45 experiments, we have exhausted all known approaches. The gap of 1.445 points to target (68.861) cannot be closed with current methods. Top teams likely use fundamentally different approaches or significantly more compute time (24-72 hours with 24+ CPUs)."
