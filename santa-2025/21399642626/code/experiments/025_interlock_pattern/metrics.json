  "notes": "Interlock pattern analysis and 2-tree unit cell optimization. Analyzed current best solution: for N=100-200, ~80-85% of trees have nearest neighbors with OPPOSITE orientation (180 degree angle difference). Implemented sawtooth pattern with alternating up/down trees. Found NO improvements - only 1 valid configuration per N value (most have overlaps). The baseline configurations are highly optimized irregular packings that cannot be replicated by regular patterns."
