    "All tessellation patterns produce SIGNIFICANTLY WORSE results than baseline",
    "N=10: tessellation scores 0.77-1.69 vs baseline 0.377",
    "N=20: tessellation scores 0.81-1.36 vs baseline 0.372",
    "N=30: tessellation scores 0.77-1.33 vs baseline 0.361",
    "The baseline uses sophisticated per-tree optimization",
    "Simple tessellation patterns cannot match this level of optimization"
  ],
  "conclusion": "Tessellation-based packing FAILED. The baseline solutions are the result of extensive per-tree optimization that simple repeating patterns cannot match. The gap of 1.445 points to target (68.861) cannot be closed with tessellation approaches.",
  "notes": "After 48 experiments, we have exhausted all known approaches. The baseline is at an EXTREMELY strong local optimum achieved through extensive optimization by top competitors."
