    "Row-based constructive produces WORSE results than baseline (0.64-0.73 vs 0.37)",
    "Baseline uses MANY different angles (not just 0° and 180°)",
    "Baseline angles are optimized per-tree for minimum bounding box",
    "Simple constructive approaches cannot match the baseline's sophisticated packing",
    "The baseline is at a strong local optimum achieved through extensive optimization"

    "N=2": "Uses angles 23.6° and 203.6° (not 0° and 180°)",

  "notes": "Row-based constructive approach FAILED. The baseline uses sophisticated per-tree angle optimization that simple constructive approaches cannot match. Falling back to exp_039 submission."
