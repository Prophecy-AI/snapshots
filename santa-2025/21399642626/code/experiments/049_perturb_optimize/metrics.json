    "Perturb-and-optimize with 20 random restarts",

  "findings": [
    "Perturb-and-optimize found NO improvements on N=5,10,15,20",
    "Perturbation causes overlaps - most perturbed solutions are invalid",
    "Local search cannot escape the strong local optimum",
    "The baseline is at an EXTREMELY strong local optimum"
  ],
  "conclusion": "Perturb-and-optimize FAILED. The baseline solutions are so tightly packed that any perturbation causes overlaps. The local optimum is so strong that even random restarts cannot escape it. The gap of 1.445 points to target (68.861) cannot be closed with perturbation-based approaches.",
  "notes": "After 49 experiments, we have exhausted all known algorithmic approaches. The baseline is at an EXTREMELY strong local optimum achieved through extensive optimization by top competitors."
