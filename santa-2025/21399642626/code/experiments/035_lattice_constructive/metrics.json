  "notes": "Implemented two novel algorithms from scratch: (1) Lattice-based constructive algorithm - produces solutions 0.4-0.5 worse per N value. (2) Python SA with Numba JIT - finds no improvement, confirming solutions are at strong local optima. Both approaches confirm that the baseline solutions are highly optimized and cannot be improved by local search or simple constructive methods."
