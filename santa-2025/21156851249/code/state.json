In practice the most effective approaches combine **exact search methods** for small\u2011to\u2011moderate instances with **approximation or heuristic schemes** for larger collections, and they usually exploit two ideas: (1) a clever ordering of the pieces (by height, width or orientation) and (2) tight lower\u2011bound calculations that prune the search space.\n\n*Exact methods.*  The state\u2011of\u2011the\u2011art exact solvers use a **branch\u2011and\u2011bound** framework that first fixes all\u202fx\u2011coordinates (or all\u202fy\u2011coordinates) and then searches the remaining dimension, turning the problem into a *perfect\u2011packing* instance with no empty space\u202f([Korf\u202f2003](https://cdn.aaai.org/ICAPS/2003/ICAPS03-029.pdf)).
