## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.659437 from exp_002 (003_eazy_optimizer)
- Best LB score: 70.6594 (from exp_002)
- Target: 68.919154 | Gap to target: 1.74 points (2.5%)

## CRITICAL: PARADIGM EXHAUSTION CONFIRMED

After 12 experiments with only 0.000521 total improvement (0.0007%), ALL optimization approaches are exhausted:
- SA optimization: EXHAUSTED
- Lattice construction: EXHAUSTED
- NFP-based construction: EXHAUSTED
- Random restarts: EXHAUSTED
- Asymmetric search: EXHAUSTED
- Fractional translation: EXHAUSTED
- Exhaustive search: EXHAUSTED
- Ensemble combination: EXHAUSTED (only thing that worked, but all sources combined)
- Crystalline lattice: EXHAUSTED

## Response to Evaluator

The evaluator correctly identified paradigm exhaustion. I AGREE with their assessment:
1. Crystalline lattice found NO improvements - baseline already uses optimized double-lattice
2. Only improvement (0.000520) came from ensemble combination
3. 10 consecutive zero-improvement results confirms exhaustion

## Leaderboard Reality
- #1: shr at 68.919154 (our target)
- #2: KiRaRe at 68.921561
- Gap: 1.74 points (2.5%)
- Top teams have proprietary techniques NOT in public kernels

## MANDATORY PIVOT: Try Fundamentally Different Approach

Since all optimization approaches are exhausted, the next experiment MUST try something fundamentally different:

### RECOMMENDED: Genetic Algorithm with Topology Crossover

**Why this is different:**
- SA/gradient methods optimize POSITIONS within a fixed topology
- GA with topology crossover evolves the ARRANGEMENT of trees
- Crossover: exchange tree subsets between configurations
- Explores a fundamentally different search space

**Implementation:**
1. Initialize population with variations of current best
2. Fitness = negative score (minimize bounding box)
3. Selection: tournament selection
4. Crossover: exchange tree positions between parents
5. Mutation: swap adjacent trees, rotate groups
6. Run for many generations

**Alternative approaches if GA doesn't work:**
1. Constraint Programming (OR-Tools)
2. Strip packing → square conversion
3. Simulated annealing with TOPOLOGY moves (not just position moves)

## What NOT to Try
- ❌ More SA/gradient optimization
- ❌ More lattice construction
- ❌ More NFP-based construction
- ❌ Any approach that only optimizes positions

## SUBMISSION STRATEGY
- Remaining submissions: 97
- Submit after EVERY experiment (we have abundant submissions)
- LB feedback is free information - USE IT

## Validation Notes
- CV = LB exactly (verified)
- No CV-LB gap issues
- Problem is at local/global optimum, not validation

## The Path Forward

The target (68.919154) IS achievable - top teams prove this. But it requires:
1. Techniques NOT in public kernels
2. Fundamentally different algorithmic approaches
3. Possibly more compute time than we have

**Next experiment should:**
1. Implement GA with topology crossover
2. Focus on exploring different tree ARRANGEMENTS, not just positions
3. Run for extended time to allow evolution to find new basins

If GA fails, try constraint programming or other fundamentally different approaches.
