## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.659437 from exp_002 (003_eazy_optimizer)
- Best LB score: 70.6594 (from 3 submissions, all within 0.0006 of each other)
- Target: 68.919154 | Gap to target: 1.740283 (2.53%)
- Submissions used: 3/100 (97 remaining)

## CV-LB Relationship Analysis
- CV = LB exactly (perfect alignment, no distribution shift)
- This is a deterministic optimization problem, not ML prediction
- The gap is NOT due to CV-LB mismatch - it's due to suboptimal solutions

## Response to Evaluator

The evaluator correctly identified that after 12 experiments with only 0.0007% improvement, we are STUCK at a local optimum. Key insights:

1. **Lattice construction found NO improvements** - The baseline already uses optimized double-lattice structures
2. **Only improvement came from ensemble combination** - Combining different sources found 0.000520 improvement
3. **All optimization paradigms exhausted** - SA, gradient, random restart, NFP, lattice all failed

**I AGREE with the evaluator's assessment that we need a PARADIGM SHIFT, not more optimization.**

## Critical Analysis from Loop 12

### Score Distribution Analysis
- N=1-10 have LOWEST efficiency (60-80%) - most room for improvement
- N=1 is already optimal at 45° (0.813173 side)
- To reach target, need ~85% average efficiency (currently ~80%)
- Uniform 1.24% side reduction needed across ALL N values

### What We Know Works
- Double-lattice packing (180° rotation pairs)
- Ensemble combination of different sources
- The baseline is at a VERY tight local optimum

### What We Know Doesn't Work
- More SA/gradient optimization (12 experiments, 0.0007% improvement)
- Random restarts (converge to same solutions)
- Lattice construction from scratch (baseline already optimal)
- NFP-based construction (worse than baseline)
- Asymmetric search for N=22, N=24 (no improvement found)

## PARADIGM SHIFT REQUIRED

The evaluator is right - we need fundamentally different approaches. Here are the options:

### Option 1: CONSTRAINT PROGRAMMING for Small N (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
- N=1-10 have lowest efficiency (60-80%)
- These contribute disproportionately to the score
- Use exact methods (MIP, CP) to find provably optimal solutions
- Even small improvements here have big impact

### Option 2: GENETIC ALGORITHM with TOPOLOGY CROSSOVER
- Current approaches only optimize positions/angles
- GA can exchange TREE ARRANGEMENTS between solutions
- Crossover: Take tree positions from parent A, angles from parent B
- Mutation: Swap two trees, rotate subset, etc.

### Option 3: STRIP PACKING → SQUARE CONVERSION
- Pack trees into a strip (minimize height for fixed width)
- Then convert strip to square by rearranging
- Different optimization landscape may find new solutions

### Option 4: DEEP ANALYSIS of TOP LB SOLUTIONS
- Top teams have scores ~68.9 (our target)
- They must have techniques not in public kernels
- Study any shared solutions or hints in discussions

### Option 5: TARGETED N-VALUE OPTIMIZATION
- Focus computational resources on N values with lowest efficiency
- N=2 has 73.8% efficiency - significant room for improvement
- N=3-10 all have <80% efficiency

## Recommended Approach for Next Experiment

**EXPERIMENT 013: CONSTRAINT PROGRAMMING FOR SMALL N**

1. Use OR-Tools or similar CP solver
2. For N=2-10, formulate as constraint satisfaction problem:
   - Variables: x, y, angle for each tree
   - Constraints: No overlap between any pair
   - Objective: Minimize bounding box side
3. Use discretization if needed (e.g., 0.01 grid, 1° angle steps)
4. This is EXACT optimization, not heuristic

**Why this approach:**
- Small N values contribute most to score
- CP can find PROVABLY OPTIMAL solutions
- If current solutions are optimal, CP will confirm it
- If not, we get guaranteed improvements

## What NOT to Try
- ❌ More SA/gradient optimization
- ❌ More random restarts
- ❌ More lattice construction
- ❌ Any approach that treats all N values equally
- ❌ Any approach that starts from the baseline and optimizes

## Validation Notes
- CV = LB exactly (deterministic problem)
- Score is sum of (side²/N) for N=1 to 200
- No overlaps allowed (hard constraint)
- Tree polygon has 15 vertices (not 7!)

## SUBMISSION STRATEGY
- We have 97 submissions remaining - ABUNDANT!
- Submit after EVERY experiment to get LB feedback
- The next experiment should produce a valid submission.csv
