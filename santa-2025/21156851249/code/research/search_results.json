The feasible solution region is contained in the set of pairs of points of the _\u03a6_-function 0-level surface of the polygon. The region is partitioned into a finite number of subregions corresponding to pairs of linear segments of the _\u03a6_-function 0-level surface. The frontiers of the subregions are generated by the conditions of non-overlapping of polygons. Only four such conditions imply non-overlapping of each pair of polygons in a lattice packing. The solution can be attained only in a finite number of points on the frontiers of these subregions. Hence, it is possible to use an organized sorting of such points with discarding of subregions whose objective function upper bound is lower than the record.\n\n## Introduction\n\nIt is necessary to find such a lattice 6, 22, 10 packing of congruent similarly oriented non-overlapping non-convex bounded polygons in the plane so that the density of packing \\[22\\] of the plane with these polygons be the greatest.\n\nThe problems of lattice packing of geometric objects were considered in the works of Refs. 20, 6, 22, 23, 27, 7, 9. Packings being exact coverings and their connection with Fyodorov's crystallographic groups 10, 11 were investigated in the works of Ref. \\[12\\]. Optimization problems of regular (single-row, multirow and lattice \\[22\\]) packing of geometric objects were investigated in the works of Refs. 24, 27, 23, 7, 9. For convex polygons the optimal lattice packing problem was investigated in Ref. \\[21\\]. The lower bounds for double lattice packings of centrally symmetric convex bodies were obtained by Kuperberg and Kuperberg \\[16\\].\n\nThe concept of _\u03a6_-functions \\[28\\] made it possible to represent various cutting and packing problems in terms of mathematical programming. _\u03a6_-function is a function on the set of placement parameters of objects positive when the objects are non-overlapping and negative if their interiorities intersect. 0-level surface of the _\u03a6_-function is the hodograph of the dense placement function \\[25\\] or the frontier of the non-fit polygon \\[19\\].\n\nIn the frames of the typology of cutting and packing problems proposed by Dyckhoff \\[4\\] our problem may be classified as two-dimensional \\`Beladeproblem' with one object (infinite plane) and congruent items (polygons) (abbreviation 2/B/O/C).\n\nThe approach adopted in this work for solving the problem in consideration is based on the use of the _\u03a6_-function properties \\[28\\] as well as on the concept of decomposition of the problem proposed in Refs. 7, 9 and on the properties of lattice packings investigated in Refs. 7, 9.\n\nWe give here proofs of the results justifying the approach proposed in Refs. 7, 9, select the set of pairs of the _\u03a6_-function 0-level surface vertices on which extremum can be attained. Algorithmic realization involves treating singularity cases and estimations reducing the region of feasible solutions.\n\nMethods of construction of 0-level surface of the _\u03a6_-function proposed in Refs. 14, 17, 1, 19 were used when obtaining optimal lattice packings.\n\nIn the present paper we describe in Section 2some properties of _\u03a6_-function and its 0-level surface used for formalization of conditions of mutual non-overlapping of polygons.\n\nIn Section 3some properties of lattices used when simplifying the mathematical model of the problem are described.\n\nIn Section 4the mathematical model of the problem is formulated. The number of conditions describing the region of feasible solutions is reduced by means of applying some properties of densest lattice packings. Namely, it is shown that for finding a densest lattice packing only lattice packings in which a polygon touches two ones obtained by translations by the basis lattice vectors may be taken into account. It is also shown that when a lattice packing is dense all the conditions of mutual non-overlapping are implied by only four ones written for the combinations _a_ 1, _a_ 2, _a_ 1+ _a_ 2, \u2212 _a_ 1+ _a_ 2 of basis lattice vectors _a_ 1 and _a_ 2. Thus, the ends of basis lattice vectors _a_ 1 and _a_ 2 lie on the piecewise linear _\u03a6_-function 0-level surface and satisfy a structure \\[18\\] of linear equations.\n\nIn Section 5the feasible solution region is decomposed into subsets represented parametrically as subsets of \\[0,1\\]\u00d7\\[0,1\\] with a piecewise linear frontier. The objective function in our problem has no extrema in the interiors of such subregions. Since each segment of their frontier has a unique extremum a sorting of such extrema allows to solve the problem.\n\n## Section snippets\n\n## Formalization of conditions of mutual non-overlapping of polygons\n\nIn order to construct a mathematical model of the problem it is necessary to present the objective function and the constraints describing the region of feasible solutions in the analytical form. The conditions of mutual non-overlapping of the polygons are such constraints.\n\nWe designate the interior of _S_ as intS, the closure of _S_ as clS and the frontier of _S_ as frS.\n\nLet there be a polygon _S_ _i_. Its position in _R_ 2 is well known to be fully characterized by three parameters _x_ _i_, _y_ _i_, _\u03b8_ _i_ where ( _x_ _i_, _y_ _i_)= _v_ _i_\n\n## Lattices and lattice packing\n\nIf _a_ 1, _a_ 2\u2208 _R_ 2 are linearly independent, a set of vectors \\[22\\]r=na1+ma2,n,m\u2208Z,is called a lattice with the basis _a_ 1, _a_ 2 and is denoted by _L_ = _\u039b_( _a_ 1, _a_ 2) where Z={0,\u00b11,\u00b12,\u2026} is the set of integers, _\u039b_ is an operator mapping a set of pairs of vectors onto a set of families of the form (6)....",

A particular case of the nesting problem occurs when congruent copies of one single shape have to fill, as much as possible, a limited sheet. Traditional approaches to the nesting problem have difficulty to tackle with high number of pieces to place. Additionally, if the orientation of the given shape is not a constraint, the general nesting approaches are not particularly successful. This problem arises in practice in several industrial contexts such as footwear, metalware and furniture. A possible approach is the periodic placement of the shapes, in a lattice way. In this paper, we propose three heuristic approaches to solve this particular case of nesting problems. Experimental results are compared with published results in literature and additional results obtained from new instances are also provided.\n## Introduction\nNesting has been widely studied (Dowsland and Dowsland, 1992), as it is a common problem in several industrial production processes (textile, garment, footwear, metalware, furniture, etc.). Most of the published papers impose orientation constraints: the shape can only be rotated a predetermined number of fixed angles (the most common is 180\u00b0 and, less commonly, 90\u00b0) or it cannot be rotated at all. However, in certain particular cases, orientation constraints do not arise. Additionally, some industries frequently need to cut big quantities of each type of shape. In these two situations, the periodic packing of the shapes (lattice packing) proved to be a very competitive approach, because:\n* \u2013good cutting patterns, with very small waste, can be obtained;\n* \u2013the automatic cutting process is more efficient when a periodic placement is considered;\n* \u2013reduced computational time (when compared with general nesting approaches, where each piece has to be treated individually), which allows to tackle problems of greater dimension.\nIn this section, we start by describing the problem and refer to related works in a brief review. In Section 2, we point out the geometric considerations necessary to understand this work. Section 3 describes the underlying rules and criteria used to build the three heuristic approaches, which are proposed in the fourth section. In Section 5, the instances used to evaluate the quality of the proposed approaches are defined and the results obtained with all the three heuristics are presented and compared. Finally, in the last section, we draw conclusions and make some comments about future work.\nThe periodic placement of congruent copies of one shape can be found in literature under the keywords \u201cperiodic packing\u201d, \u201cregular packing\u201d or \u201clattice packing\u201d. The lattice packing may be defined over an infinite plane or a limited sheet. If it is the plane, the main objective is to regularly place the shapes so that the density obtained is maximised. When lattice packing on a limited stock sheet, the goal is to maximise the percentage of stock sheet utilisation, which is equivalent to maximise the number of shapes placed inside the plate. As will be shown later, these two \u201capparently\u201d similar objectives are not quite equivalent. However, the definition of a lattice is identical in the two situations. A lattice is generated by two linearly independent vectors,*v*0and*v*1, whose linear combinations will produce a grid that guarantees that pieces do not overlap. The shapes are located in each node of the grid.\nThe problem we propose to solve does not considerer orientation constraints, so, any rotation of the given shape can be allowed. However, after a specific orientation is chosen, all the shapes must follow the same orientation (*Single-Lattice*\u2013 Fig. 1a) or be alternately rotated 180\u00b0 (*Double-Lattice*\u2013 Fig. 1b). According to the typology by W\u00e4scher et al. (2007), the problem described in this paper is a 2-dimensional irregular IIPP (Identical Item Packing Problem).\nThe orientation of the shapes is not relevant when lattice packing on the plane, as maximum density remains unchanged. However, when stock sheet borders need to be taken into account, the orientation of the shapes may be extremely important as will be shown in the following sections.\nIn this work, we propose to solve the problem of Periodic Packing of Irregular Shapes (PPIS) on a limited stock sheet (a rectangle) by heuristic methods.\nThere are references in the literature to the Lattice Packing Problem since the fifties, the first results concerning only theoretical aspects of the lattice packing of a single convex polygon on the plane (Rogers, 1951). However, only a few publications during the next 30 years can be found, and some of them are just marginally related to lattice packing. O\u2019Rourke et al. (1986) have considered the problem of finding minimal enclosing triangles and Dori and Ben Bassat (1983) have dealt with the problem of finding minimal enclosing convex polygons with fewer sides. Those approaches can be seen as a pre-processing to lattice packing, as regular convex polygons can be easily packed than the original ones.\nBetween 1990 and 2000, essentially theoretical results on lattice lacking have been published, mostly considering unlimited sheets and convex shapes (Mount and Silverman, 1990, Mount, 1991, Kuperberg and Kuperberg, 1990, Stoyan and Patsuk, 2000).\nMore recently, results concerning real industrial problems, with limited sheets, irregular shapes and no orientation constraints, have been published. Prasad et al. (1995) describe a nesting problem of irregular shaped metal blanks and propose a heuristic search, considering the variation in the or...",

The goal is to either pack a single container as[densely](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packing_density)as possible or pack all objects using as few containers as possible. Many of these problems can be related to real-life[packaging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packaging), storage and transportation issues. Each packing problem has a dual[covering problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covering_problem), which asks how many of the same objects are required to completely cover every region of the container, where objects are allowed to overlap.\nIn a[bin packing problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bin_packing_problem), people are given:\n* A*container*, usually a two- or three-dimensional[convex region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_region), possibly of infinite size. Multiple containers may be given depending on the problem.\n* A set of*objects*, some or all of which must be packed into one or more containers. The set may contain different objects with their sizes specified, or a single object of a fixed dimension that can be used repeatedly.\nUsually the packing must be without overlaps between goods and other goods or the container walls. In some variants, the aim is to find the configuration that packs a single container with the maximal[packing density](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packing_density). More commonly, the aim is to pack all the objects into as few containers as possible.[&#91;1&#93;](#cite_note-1)In some variants the overlapping (of objects with each other and/or with the boundary of the container) is allowed but should be minimized.\n## Packing in infinite space\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Packing_problems&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1)]\nMany of these problems, when the container size is increased in all directions, become equivalent to the problem of packing objects as densely as pos...",

The optimal packing of identical objects has been often invoked to understand the nature of low-temperature phases of matter. In celebrated work, Kepler conjectured that the densest packing of spheres is realized by stacking variants of the face-centered-cubic lattice and has a packing fraction of \u03c0/(32)\u223c0.7405. Much more recently, an unusually high-density packing of \u22480.770732 was achieved for congruent ellipsoids. Such studies are relevant for understanding the structure of crystals, glasses, the storage and jamming of granular materials, ceramics, and the assembly of viral capsid structures. Here, we carry out analytical studies of the stacking of close-packed planar layers of systems made up of truncated cones possessing uniaxial symmetry. We present examples of high-density packing whose order is characterized by a broken symmetry arising from the shape of the constituent objects. We find a biaxial arrangement of solid cones with a packing fraction of \u03c0/4. For truncated cones, there are two distinct regimes, characterized by different packing arrangements, depending on the ratio _c_ of the base radii of the truncated cones with a transition at c\\*=2\u22121.\n\n**Keywords:** biaxial order, packing, truncated cones\n\n* * *\n\nMany natural forms ( [1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2148265/#B1)), such as the DNA double helix ( [2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2148265/#B2), [3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2148265/#B3)) and seed arrays on sunflowers ( [4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2148265/#B4)), arise from simple geometrical principles rather than from complex interactions. Symmetry considerations often play a key role in determining the nature of order of a system ( [5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2148265/#B5), [6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2148265/#B6)). [\u2021\u2021](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2148265/#FN1) The simplest model of matter, a collection of isotropic objects (spheres), exhibits both the isotropic fluid and the crystalline phases with a phase transition between them upon varying the packing fraction or density ( [7](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2148265/#B7)). Dense packing can result from either the maximization of the packing fraction ( [7](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2148265/#B7)) or the minimization of the area exposed ( [8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2148265/#B8), [9](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2148265/#B9)) to probe objects such as water molecules. Efficient packing of a system of rods ( [10](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2148265/#B10)) leads again to an isotropic fluid phase or to uniaxial order with the orientation of the axis of one of the rods dictating the preferred alignment of nearby rods. Liquid crystalline phases ( [5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2148265/#B5)) exist between a liquid with no translational order and a crystal with translational order in all three directions. This is accomplished by employing constituent particles that are anisotropic\u2014the molecules of liquid crystals are not spherical and can form phases with translational order in fewer than three dimensions and/or orientational order. Recent work has shown that an unusually high-density packing of \u22480.770732 is achieved for congruent ell...",

      "text": "Predictive crystallography at scale: mapping,\nvalidating, and learning from 1,000 crystal\nenergy landscapes\nChristopher R. Taylor, Patrick W. V. Butler, Graeme M. Day1,\n1School of Chemistry, University of Southampton, Southampton, SO17 1BJ, United Kingdom\nComputational crystal structure prediction (CSP) is an increas\u0002ingly powerful technique in materials discovery, due to its abil\u0002ity to reveal trends and permit insight across the possibility\nspace of crystal structures of a candidate molecule, beyond sim\u0002ply the observed structure(s). In this work, we demonstrate the\nreliability and scalability of CSP methods for small, rigid or\u0002ganic molecules by performing in-depth CSP investigations for\nover 1000 such compounds, the largest survey of its kind to\u0002date. We show that this highly-efficient force-field-based CSP\napproach is superbly predictive, locating 99.4% of observed ex\u0002perimental structures, and ranking a large majority of these\n(74%) as among the most stable possible structures (to within\nuncertainty due to thermal effects). We present two examples of\ninsights such large predicted datasets can permit, examining the\nspace group preferences of organic molecular crystals and ratio\u0002nalising empirical rules concerning the spontaneous resolution\nof chiral molecules. Finally, we exploit this large and diverse\ndataset for developing transferable machine-learned energy po\u0002tentials for the organic solid state, training a neural network\nlattice energy correction to force field energies that offers sub\u0002stantial improvements to the already impressive energy rank\u0002ings, and a MACE equivariant message-passing neural network\nfor crystal structure reoptimisation. We conclude that the ex\u0002cellent performance and reliability of the CSP workflow enables\nthe creation of very large datasets of broad utility and explana\u0002tory power in materials design.\nCorrespondence: G.M.Day@soton.ac.uk\nIntroduction\nThe discovery of new materials is important for addressing\nmany critical societal needs, including energy production and\nstorage, pollution remediation and healthcare. Research en\u0002deavours aimed at improving the success and efficiency of\nfunctional materials discovery, based on traditional efforts\ndeveloping our understanding of the rules of crystal packing\nand, more recently, applications of machine learning, have\nbenefited greatly from the availability of databases of stable\ncrystal structures.\nA major resource for such efforts has been the growth of ac\u0002cessible, curated databases of crystal structures and (some\nof) their properties. The most general and widely-used in\u0002clude the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) (1) for or\u0002ganic and organometallic systems, and the Inorganic Crystal\nStructure Database (2). These resources are unparalleled in\ntheir volume of experimental crystal structure information,\nbut do not currently offer information about calculated or hy\u0002pothetical structures. Historically, such data was limited to\nspecialised areas (such as the Atlas of Prospective Zeolite\nStructures (3)), though recent developments have made re\u0002markable progress in generalising this concept, including ex\u0002tensions to the Crystallography Open Database (COD)(4\u20137)\nand the Materials Project (8). In the field of organic molecu\u0002lar crystals, however, much of our understanding of the rules\nof crystal packing derive from databases of experimentally\nobserved structures.\nModern computational chemistry, employing both molecular\nand solid-state simulation techniques, can add significantly\nto the information that is available from experimentally de\u0002termined crystal structures, and identify previously unverifi\u0002able trends. Computational studies of polymorphism(9\u201313)\nhave evaluated the typical lattice energy differences between\ncrystalline polymorphs of organic molecules, studies of con\u0002formations of flexible molecules (11, 14) in their observed\ncrystal structures have improved understanding of the lim\u0002its of molecular strain in stable structures, and studies of the\nthermodynamics of co-crystallisation (15\u201318) have aided in\nrationalising a complex phenomenon with ramifications for\nexperimental design.\nA more complete and, crucially, predictive view of organic\ncrystal packing can be obtained from crystal structure pre\u0002diction (CSP) (19, 20). A core concept in CSP is the crys\u0002tal energy landscape (or CSP landscape) \u2013 the set of plausi\u0002ble crystal packings for a chemical species (or combination\nthereof), representing an exploration of the crystalline con\u0002figuration space to identify candidate structures predicted to\nbe stable (which ideally includes any observed structures),\nranked in terms of this stability. These CSP landscapes are of\ngreat utility in understanding and rationalising the thermody\u0002namic and kinetic behaviour of crystal systems; multiple low\u0002energy minima that are close-lying on a CSP landscape may\nbe indicative of a significant risk of polymorphism, while dy\u0002namical simulations exploring these landscapes give insight\ninto the kinetic trapping of metastable forms(21) and the ob\u0002served absence of other predicted forms (22, 23).\nMoreover, the energy landscape forms the foundation of\nthe energy-structure-function maps that have in recent years\ndemonstrated great power in materials discovery (24\u201327). By\nassociating computed properties (e.g. gas uptake, charge car\u0002rier mobility) with hypothetical crystal structures from the\nDay | 1\u201313\nhttps://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-0c329 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8396-2771 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv. License: CC BY 4.0\nCSP landscape, it becomes possible to predict whether a\nmolecule is a promising candidate for creating new functional\nmaterials, i.e. if it has one (or more) favourably-ranked crys\u0002tal structures which are predicted to achieve the desired prop\u0002erty.\nThe techniques and challenges in the field of organic CSP\nhave been reviewed (19, 20); we provide a brief overview for\nthe sake of context. CSP is typically considered a combina\u0002tion of two broad challenges: efficient and thorough sampling\nof the configuration space of crystal packing, and accurate,\ncost-effective structural optimisation, ranking, and property\ncalculation.\nThe sampling of hypothetical crystal packing arrange\u0002ments is made extremely difficult due to the \u201ccurse of\ndimensionality\u201c\u2014the number of independent degrees of free\u0002dom to sample creates a vast configurational space. As a\nresult, simple grid-based sampling approaches must be es\u0002chewed in favour of more sophisticated techniques, such as\nlow-discrepancy quasi-random sampling (28, 29) and genetic\nalgorithm approaches.(30)\nMeanwhile, the optimisation and ranking methods must be\naccurate enough to describe the fine balance of different inter\u0002molecular interactions (electrostatics, dispersion, hydrogen\u0002bonding, etc.), resolving lattice energy differences often\nsmaller than a kJ mol\u22121, while sufficiently cost-effective to\nbe applied to very large numbers (\u00bb105) of trial crystal struc\u0002tures. Historically, this has entailed the use of simple em\u0002pirical force fields, but modern developments often employ\ntailor-made force fields (18, 31) or machine-learned poten\u0002tials derived from ab initio calculations. Still, empirical force\nfields retain their power even today due to their efficiency and\nbroad transferability, often being the initial step of a hierar\u0002chy of increasingly accurate (and expensive) energy models\nemployed in one CSP workflow.\nDespite these two broad and ongoing challenges, organic\nCSP has demonstrated enormous success in diverse ap\u0002plications, crucially proving itself to be a truly predic\u0002tive technique, guiding synthesis and discovery of novel\nforms of porous materials (24), highly-flexible pharmaceuti\u0002cal molecules (31), co-crystals (32), simple molecules previ\u0002ously thought to be monomorphic (33) and templating of pre\u0002dicted metastable polymorphs.(34) A recurrent landmark in\nthe field is the series of Cambridge Blind Tests of CSP, show\u0002casing the diversity of methods (and success rates th...",

But how well can we do? In this work, we give several constructions that may answer the various senses of this question. In so doing, we provide some solutions to packing, tiling, and covering problems of tetrahedra. Our results suggest that the regular tetrahedron may not be able to pack as densely as the sphere, which would contradict a conjecture of Ulam. The regular tetrahedron might even be the convex body having the smallest possible packing density.\n\n### Sign up for PNAS alerts.\n\nGet alerts for new articles, or get an alert when an article is cited.\n\n[Manage alerts](https://www.pnas.org/action/showPreferences?menuTab=Alerts)\n\nThe problem of how densely given solid objects can pack in space has been a source of fascination since the dawn of civilization. Dense packing of convex objects is intimately related to the arrangement of molecules in condensed states of matter ( [1](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.0601389103#core-b1)) and to the best way to transmit encoded messages over a noisy channel ( [2](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.0601389103#core-b2)). Three-dimensional Euclidean space \u211c3 (3-space) already provides many challenging open problems. It was only recently that Kepler\u2019s conjecture, which postulated that the densest packings of congruent spheres in 3-space have packing density (fraction of space covered by the spheres) \u0394 = \u03c0/18 = 74.048 \u2026 %, realized by variants of the face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice packing, was proved ( [3](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.0601389103#core-b3)). Much less is known about the packing characteristics of other congruent convex objects that do not tile 3-space. For example, an ellipsoid is simply obtained by an affine (linear) transformation of a sphere, and yet the densest packing of ellipsoids is an open problem. The rotational degrees of freedom of an ellipsoid (absent in a sphere) enables such packings to achieve densities greater than \u03c0/18, the densest sphere packing density ( [4](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.0601389103#core-b4)\u2013 [6](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.0601389103#core-b6)). There is a family of periodic arrangements of nearly spherically shaped ellipsoids that surpass the density of the optimal sphere packing and that has a maximal density of \u0394 = 0.7707 \u2026 % ( [6](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.0601389103#core-b6)), which is the highest known density for any ellipsoid packing.\n\nThe evidence below suggests that the regular tetrahedron is a counterexample to Ulam\u2019s conjecture (Martin Gardner, private communication; see also ref. [7](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.0601389103#core-b7)), which states that the optimal density for packing congruent spheres is smaller than that for any other convex body. Indeed, it suggests that perhaps the regular tetrahedron achieves this minimum. However, our interest in tetrahedra in this work goes beyond their packing characteristics. Tetrahedra have interesting connections to sphere packings, certain tilings of space (including foams), liquids, and glasses, and complex alloy structures. It is well known that the maximum number of spheres in 3-space that can be locally packed such that each sphere contacts the others is four. The polyhedron that results by taking the sphere centers as vertices is the regular tetrahedron, but such a tetrahedron cannot tile space because its dihedral angle \\[cos\u22121(1/3) \u2248 70.53\u00b0\\] is not a submultiple of 360\u00b0. Interestingly, the ratio of the volume of the portion of this tetrahedron covered by the spheres to the volume of the tetrahedron leads to the Rogers upper bound of 77.96 \u2026 % on the sphere packing density ( [8](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.0601389103#core-b8)).\n\nIt was Frank and Kasper ( [9](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.0601389103#core-b9), [10](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.0601389103#core-b10)) who proposed that the underlying \u201cpolytetrahedral\u201d network of sphere packings can serve to explain the crystalline structure of complex alloys, particularly those of transition metals. These arrangements are now known as \u201cFrank\u2013Kasper\u201d phases. If 5 regular tetrahedra are packed around a common edge, there remains a small gap of 7.36\u00b0, and if 20 regular tetrahedra are packed around a common vertex, the gaps amount to a solid angle of 1.54 steradians (see [Fig. 1](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.0601389103#f1)). By closing these gaps by a slight deformation, we get a regular icosahedron, which corresponds to a 12-coordinated sphere whose vertices correspond to the vertices of the icosahedron. A 12-fold coordination is an important case of the Frank\u2013Kasper phases; others include 14-, 15-, and 16-fold coordinations (13 is not possible), corresponding to triangular-faced tetrahedra constructed from tetrahedra sharing a single vertex. The Frank\u2013Kasper phases thus consist of various tilings of space by \u201calmost-regular\u201d tetrahedra with atoms at their vertices. It also has been shown that the structure of atomic liquids and glasses has significant polytetrahedral character ( [11](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.0601389103#core-b11)). The dual Voronoi regions of the vertices of the Frank\u2013Kasper structures (obtained by joining the centers of every pair of tetrahedra in face contact) together fill space and consist of polyhedra with 12, 14, 15, and 16 faces. It is well known that periodic structures with atoms at the vertices of these dual tilings occur in clathrate hydrates ( [12](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.0601389103#core-b12)). This type of polyhedral tiling inspired Weaire and Phelan ( [13](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.0601389103#core-b13)) in their discovery of a minimal area foam with a smaller average surface area per cell (\u201cbubble\u201d) than Kelvin\u2019s best solution ( [14](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.0601389103#core-b14)).\n\n[![](https://www.pnas.org/cms/10.1073/pnas.0601389103/asset/e726bb30-bb6f-42b9-b99c-80c0f73ad776/assets/graphic/zpq0280627550001.jpeg)](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.0601389103#f1) Certain arrangements of tetrahedra.

We also want to thank Dominik Krupke for providing a\nhelpful official validator for solutions.\n1 Introduction\nThe recent CG:SHOP 2024 Challenge introduced a variant of irregular packing problems\nknown as the Maximum Polygon Packing (MPP) problem. The MPP problem involves a\nconvex polygonal container C and a polygon set P = {p1, p2, ..., pN }, where polygon piis\nassociated with a value vi. It seeks for a non-overlapping packing with the maximum total\nvalue. The challenge presents a total of 180 instances whose number of polygons ranges from\n28 to 50,000. The official document [4] gives a detailed description of the challenge.\nOur proposed algorithm employs a general process to solve these instances indiscriminately,\nand the overall framework is presented in Figure 1. We first partition a large-scale problem\ninto multiple small-scale subproblems (Section 2) and then solve each subproblem using\nupper-level polygon ordering (Section 3.1) and lower-level packing optimization techniques\n(Section 3.2). Section 4 presents our experimental results, followed by conclusions.\n1 Corresponding author: Zhouxing Su\n\u00a9 Canhui Luo, Zhouxing Su, and Zhipeng L\u00fc;\nlicensed under Creative Commons License CC-BY 4.0\n40th International Symposium on Computational Geometry (SoCG 2024).\nEditors: Wolfgang Mulzer and Jeff M.

It involves two components: partitioning the container C into\nmultiple regions and assigning polygons to each region.\n2.1 Container Partitioning\nThe container partitioning process consists of two steps, as shown in Figure 2. Initially, we\narrange two-dimensional square grids starting from the bottom-left corner of the bounding\nbox until the entire container is covered. The subregions formed by the intersection of the\ncontainer with all the grids constitute its partition C = C1 \u222a C2 \u222a ... \u222a Cm. Subsequently,\nwe merge the small subregions with adjacent grids, which are difficult to be used effectively.\nThe grid is dimensioned to keep the scale of each subproblem at approximately 300 polygons,\nmaking a trade-off between effectiveness and efficiency of lower-level packing optimization.\n2.2 Polygon Assignment\nWe adopt a simple approach of randomly assigning polygons to each subregion. Specifically, for\neach subregion Ci, we randomly select a polygon pj from P until\nP\nj\narea(pj )\narea(Ci) \u2265\nPN\ni=0\narea(pi)\narea(C)\n.\nThe advantage of random assignment lies in ensuring that the overall characteristics of each\nsubproblem align with the original problem.\nC.

We repeatedly select one remaining polygon with the\nhighest priority (ties are broken by value) and try to insert it into the current solution. If the\ninsertion with lower-level packing optimization fails, we skip the current polygon and turn to\nthe next one. For the majority of instances, the priority is defined as the value-to-area ratio\nof a polygon (we also call it unit value). Polygons with higher unit values are prioritized\nfor putting in the container, which is called the Unit Value First (UVF) strategy. For\nsmall-scale instances (N < 100), we employ the \u03b1\u03b2-random strategy. It randomly selects\n\u03b1% and \u03b2% of the polygons and reassigns their UVF-based priority to the highest and the\nlowest, respectively. These instances are run for multiple times to ensure comprehensive\noptimization, with \u03b1 and \u03b2 set to 10 in our implementation.\n3.2 Lower-Level Packing Optimization\nThe position of a polygon can be represented by the coordinates l = (x, y) of a reference point,\nsuch as the bottom-left corner of the boundary. Then, the translation of a polygon can be\nrepresented by a vector pointing from its original position to its new position. Given a feasible\npacking S and a polygon p to be placed, it is impossible to find a non-overlapping position\nfor p without moving other polygons in most cases. This section introduces the algorithm for\neliminating overlaps for an invalid packing, which involves solving an unconstrained nonlinear\nproblem and heuristic polygon movement.\nS o C G 2 0 2 4\n86:4 A General Heuristic Approach for Maximum Polygon Packing\n3.2.1 Overlap Minimization\nTo determine the appropriate translation for the polygons, we utilized the no-fit polygon\n(NFP) and inner-fit polygon (IFP), which are fundamental in algorithmic approaches to\ngeometric design and optimization challenges. For a fixed polygon pi and a movable polygon\npj , NFP(pi, pj ) describes their non-overlapping positions with boundaries in contact precisely,\nwhich can be utilized to determine the minimum translation for pj to avoid overlap. Similarly,\nIFP(pi, pj ) is employed to determine the minimum translation to place pj inside pi. Figure 3\nillustrates the polygon translations determined using NFP (left) and IFP (right). The readers\nmay refer to Burke et al. [2] for a more detailed description.\nFor a packing S, based on NFP and IFP, we define the overlap between polygons pi\nand pj as fij (S), representing the minimum translation to separate them, and f0i(S) as the\nminimum translation for moving pi to fit into the container. Subsequently, we employ the\nseparation algorithm proposed by Imamichi et al. [7] to minimize the overlap, which involves\nsolving an unconstrained nonlinear programming problem as follows:\nmin\nS\nF(S) = X\n0\u2264i<j\u2264N\nf\n2\nij (S) (1)\nThe model relaxes the non-overlapping constraint but introduces repulsion forces between\nany two overlapped polygons. We use the classic L-BFGS (limited memory BFGS) method\nto solve this problem. It makes the packing S converge to a local optimum but strongly\ndepends on the initial layout. ...",
