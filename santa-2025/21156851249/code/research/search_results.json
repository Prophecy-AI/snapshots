      "text": "The local optimality of the double lattice packing\nYoav Kallus\u2217 and W\u00a8oden Kusner\u2020\nSeptember 19, 2018\nAbstract\nThis paper introduces a technique for proving the local optimality of packing con\u0002figurations. Applying this technique to a general convex polygon, we prove that the\nconstruction of the optimal double lattice packing by Kuperberg and Kuperberg is also\nlocally optimal in the full space of packings.\n1 Introduction\nThis paper began as an investigation of the optimality of the double lattice packing\nfor pentagons and heptagons. In [KK90], Kuperberg and Kuperberg describe a recipe\nfor finding the double lattice packing of congruent planar convex bodies with maxi\u0002mal density by solving an optimization problem over inscribed parallelograms. This\noptimization problem is usually tractable, and in the case of convex polygons can be\nsolved by an algorithm with running time linear in the number of vertices [Mou91].\nAs examples, Kuperberg and Kuperberg construct the densest double lattice packing\nfor both regular pentagons and regular heptagons and show that these packings have\ndensities of (5\u2212\n\u221a\n5)/3 = 0.92131 . . . and 0.8926 . . . respectively. These are the current\nrecords and possibly the best general packings of the plane by regular pentagons and\nby regular heptagons.\nStarting around the turn of the century, a significant push, both theoretical and\ncomputational, arose to answer some of the most basic yet frustrating questions in\nthe theory of packing problems (for background on packing problems, see [BMP05],\n[CGSS99], [Gro63]). Along with the proof and formal verification of the Kepler con\u0002jecture [HAB+15], a number of other results on sphere packing in higher dimensions\nhave proved illuminating [CE03, Van11, Ven13]. For packings by congruent anisotropic\nbodies, sharp results are limited mostly to the plane, where the best packings of all\ncentrally-symmetric bodies are achieved by lattices [FT50], and a series of sparse results\nin higher dimensions [BK13].\n\u2217Santa Fe Institute, 1399 Hyde Park Road, Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA\n\u2020Graz University of Technology, Institute for Analysis and Computational Number Theory, Steyrergasse\n30/II, 8010 Graz, Austria\n1\narXiv:1509.02241v1 [math.MG] 8 Sep 2015\nAmong general convex bodies, the problem of finding the best packing of regular\npentagons serves as a toy model for harder problems, like finding the best packing of\nregular tetrahedra. However, the pentagon problem is still not a tractable one. Explicit\nupper bounds for the packing density of regular tetrahedra and octahedra are better\nthan the trivial unity upper bound by minuscule margins [GEK11]. A semidefinite\nprogramming (SDP) approach has been suggested by Oliveira and Vallentin to calculate\nimproved upper bounds [dOV13]. Though the SDP method has not yet yielded a\nnontrivial upper bound for packing of tetrahedra, it has been used to obtain an upper\nbound of 0.98103 on the density of regular pentagon packings. There remains a sizable\ngap between the highest density achieved for pentagon packings and this upper bound.\nA long-open problem, still wide open even in the plane, asks for the pessimal convex\nbody for packing, that is, the shape that has the lowest maximum packing density\n[BMP05, BK13, Kal14]. In the class of centrally-symmetric bodies in the plane, it is\nReinhardt [Rei33] who conjectured that a smoothed octagon is the minimizer. In the\nclass of general convex bodies in the plane, it is conjectured to be the regular heptagon\n[Kal15]. However, even though the maximum-density double lattice is conjectured to\nachieve the maximum packing density for the regular heptagon, no sharp upper bound\nhas been proved.\nThe regular pentagon and heptagon are cases of special interest, and we initially\nsought out to investigate whether their optimal double-lattice packing can be shown\nto be also optimal among a broader class of packings. We were able to show that\nthese packings are optimal at least in some neighborhood in the space of all packings.\nFurthermore, we discovered that our method can be generalized to all convex polygons.\nWe demonstrate that, while double lattices are in general not globally optimal, they\nare always at least locally optimal.\nTheorem. If a double lattice packing is an isolated local maximum for density among\ndouble lattices and is not one of a two exceptional cases, then it is a local maximum\nfor density among all packings.\nThe precise meanings of the terms used will be elucidated in the rest of the paper.\n2 Theoretical Preparations\n2.1 Local Optimality\nWe will look at packings of congruent copies of a body K. That is, every element of\nthe packing is given by \u03be(K), where \u03be \u2208 E(n) is an isometry of Euclidean space. It\nwill be convenient to assume that the reference body K is situated so that its interior\ncontains the origin. The isometry group E(n) of R\nn can be considered as a subgroup\nof SLn+1(R) that preserves the plane (x1, . . . , xn, 1) \u2208 R\nn+1. This identification gives\nus the Frobenius norm N(\u03be) = k\u03be \u2212 Idk for \u03be \u2208 E(n). Some useful inequalities for this\n2\nnorm that we will use are\nN(\u03be\n\u22121\n) \u2264 k\u03be\n\u22121\nkN(\u03be)\nN(\u03be\u03be0) \u2264 N(\u03be) + N(\u03be\n0\n) + N(\u03be)N(\u03be\n0\n)\nN(\u03c8\u03be\u03c8\u22121) \u2264 k\u03c8kk\u03c8\n\u22121\nkN(\u03be)\nk\u03be(0)k \u2264 N(\u03be) \u2264 k\u03be(0)k + 2n\n1/2\n.\n(1)\nDefinition 2.1. Let \u039e be a set of isometries. The limit\nd(\u039e) = limt\u2192\u221e\nvol B(0, t)\n|{\u03be \u2208 \u039e : \u03be(0) \u2208 B(0, t)}|, (2)\nif it exists, is its mean volume. The limits superior and inferior are its upper and\nlower mean volumes, denoted d(\u039e) and d(\u039e). We say \u039e is a (r, R)-set if the point set\n{\u03be(0) : \u03be \u2208 \u039e} has a packing radius at least r and a covering radius at most R.\nDefinition 2.2. Let K be a compact set with interior. We say that \u039e is admissible\nfor K if the interiors of \u03be(K) and \u03be\n0\n(K) are disjoint for any two distinct isometries\n\u03be, \u03be0 \u2208 \u039e. We say furthermore that \u039e is saturated if there is no \u03be \u2208 E(n) \\ \u039e such that\n\u039e \u222a {\u03be} is again admissible.\nThere are r(K) and R(K) such that when \u039e is admissible and saturated, then \u039e is\na (r(K), R(K))-set. As a consequence, such sets are countable.\nDefinition 2.3. Given two (r\n0\n, R0)-sets \u039e and \u039e\n0 of isometries, we define the premetric\n\u03b4R(\u039e, \u039e\n0\n) = inf\nbij.\nsup{N(\u03be\n\u22121\u03c8(\u03c80\n)\n\u22121\n\u03be\n0\n) :\n\u03be, \u03c8 \u2208 \u039e such that k\u03be(0) \u2212 \u03c8(0)k \u2264 2R or k\u03be\n0\n(0) \u2212 \u03c8\n0\n(0)k \u2264 2R}.\n(3)\nThe infimum is over all bijections (\u00b7)\n0\n: \u039e \u2192 \u039e\n0\n.\nWhen R \u2265 R0, \u03b4R(\u039e, \u039e\n0\n) = 0 if and only if \u03be = \u03c8\u03be0for some \u03c8 \u2208 E(n) and some\nbijection. Consider a body K. When R \u2265 R(K), \u03b4R(\u039e, \u039e\n0\n) induces a metric on the\nspace of admissible (r, R)-sets up to overall isometry, which includes the saturated sets\nas a subset.\nDefinition 2.4. We say an admissible and saturated set \u039e is strongly extreme for\nK if there is R > 0 and \u000f > 0, such that whenever \u03b4R(\u039e, \u039e\n0\n) < \u000f, then either \u039e\n0\nis\ninadmissible or d(\u039e0\n) \u2265 d(\u039e).\nWe stop to discuss why we define the topology in the space of packing arrangements\nin the way that we do. A naive choice of topology is the one given by the metric\n\u03b4H(\u039e, \u039e\n0\n) = inf\nbij.,\u03c8\u2208E(n)\nsup\n\u03be\u2208\u039e\nN(\u03be\n\u22121\u03c8\u03be0\n), (4)\nwhich we call the Hausdorff metric. However, under the Hausdorff topology the mean\nvolume is locally constant, and any packing is trivially locally optimal. For the topology\nto allow the mean volume to vary locally, it must allow elements that are increasingly far\n3\nFigure 1: Sample of the packing arrangement of cylinders with screws and screw holes\ndescribed in the text. The arrangement can be condensed, but in a way that is not\ncontinuous in the topology given by \u03b4R.\napart to move by the action of increasingly different isometries. One metric satisfying\nthis criterion, similar to the one used in Ref. [Kup00], is\ninf\nbij.,\u03c8\u2208E(n)\nsup\n\u03be\u2208\u039e\nmin(N(\u03be\n\u22121\u03c8\u03be0\n), 1/ min(k\u03be(0)k, k\u03be\n0\n(0)k)). (5)\nWhile suited for the discussions of recurrence there, here this metric will yield the\nresult that any packing that is not as dense as the densest packing of K is not even\nlocally optimal, since the density can be improved by a finite amount at arbitrarily\nsmall distance by completely changing the packing outside a ball of arbitrarily large\nradi...",

Although tree-representations of this problem have been presented in the open literature extensively, the binary tree representation is shown in this work to be capable of capturing any configuration of such rectangular shapes in two-dimensional space, such as rotations through right angles and translations, and to be advantageous and more general over other approaches when local search [optimization procedures](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/optimisation-procedure) are to be utilized. The construction is such that these boxes must be bound together in pairs having a common edge, and can be extended to contain constrains regarding vertical or horizontal space between the actual objects as well as special types of cuts, e.g. guillotine cuts used in the glass cutting industry. Finally, a simple continuous sheet application is shown as a demonstration of the capabilities of the algorithm in connection with a local search method, specifically threshold accepting.\n\n## Section snippets\n\n## Introduction and literature survey\n\nThis paper presents a methodology suitable for local search methods when these are applied to two-dimensional space partitioning problems. Such problems include the trim loss minimization problem, which finds many applications, as for example in the cutting of two-dimensional shapes from wood, marble, glass, fabric, etc. In these applications the loss of material due to the placement and cutting constraints is the issue of concern and its minimization is the goal of related optimization\n\n## Local search methods: an overview\n\nAlthough the above sited literature is not an exhaustive attempt to account for the enormous bulk of work appearing on the theme topic of this paper, nonetheless it is considered as a representative cross section of advances and ideas in the field as it currently stands. Motivated by the work sited, and from continuous bibliographical search, we observe that interestingly there is still a missing ingredient in terms of an adequate representation of the two-dimensional rectangle packing (or\n\n## The binary tree data structure for rectangle placement and cutting\n\nThe placement of rectangles within a larger piece of cutting stock material (slabs) is considered in this section. Effectively, what will follow is an algorithmic description and elaboration as to how this is achieved using a binary tree, and how various operational constraints can be encapsulated into the moves associated with local search algorithms, such as SA and TA outlined in the previous section.\n\n## Computational demonstration\n\nThe binary tree data structure was implemented within a threshold accepting standard algorithm in C++. The runs were conducted on a Pentium III 750\u00a0MHz computer, using _Bloodshed DevCpp_, a C++ integrated development environment, interfacing _GNU_ C++ on a Windows NT operating system. CPU times are reported in the text within a range, since to obtain a good solution stochastic search methods have to be run from different starting points.\n\nTwo main case studies are presented, focusing on a finite\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis paper has presented a general purpose binary tree data structure for the representation of rectangle layout problems. This representation has been demonstrated to be able to encapsulate both requirements for cost (area) minimization and compaction, and also to be able to capture other operational constraints, such as traverses of objects placed on stock material slabs.\n\nComputational results have been also presented, not so much as to fine-tune a specific optimization procedure, but to\n\n## Acknowledgement\n\nThe author would like to thank Mr. Jose Ignacio Marin Alberdi for the many useful discussions during the development of this work.\n\nSpecial issue articlesRecommended articles\n\n- Beasley, J.

      "text": "<div><section>\n <section>\n \n <h2> 1. Introduction</h2>\n \n <p>Cutting and Packing problems are scientifically challenging problems with a wide spectrum of applications. They are very interesting NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems; that is, no procedure is able to exactly solve them in deterministic polynomial time. They are encountered in a variety of real-world applications including production and packing for the textile, apparel, naval, automobile, aerospace, and food industries. They are bottleneck problems in computer aided design where design plans are to be generated for industrial plants, electronic modules, nuclear and thermal plants, and so forth [<span><a href=\"#bib-0001\">1</a></span>].</p>\n \n <p>Cutting and packing problems consist of packing a set of geometric objects/items of fixed dimensions and shape into a region \u03a9 of predetermined shape while accounting for the design and technological considerations of the problem [<span><a href=\"#bib-0001\">1</a></span>]. The packing identifies the arrangement and positions of the geometric objects that determine the dimensions of the containing shape and reach the extremum of a specific objective function [<span><a href=\"#bib-0001\">1</a></span>]. When the geometric objects are <i>\u03c6</i> objects, the packing problem reduces to a mathematical model whose constraints reflect the conditions of arrangement of <i>\u03c6</i> objects within the given region, the mutual nonintersection conditions for <i>\u03c6</i> objects, and any technological constraints that cannot be reduced to purely geometric constraints [<span><a href=\"#bib-0001\">1</a></span>] (as guillotine cuts for rectangular packing). One approach to solve this complex problem is to arrange the <i>\u03c6</i> objects according to some prescribed order in \u03a9, and to search for the exact local extremum [<span><a href=\"#bib-0001\">1</a></span>]. However, the search for exact local extrema is time consuming without any guarantee of a sufficiently good convergence to optimum [<span><a href=\"#bib-0001\">1</a></span>].</p>\n \n <p>This paper focuses on problems dealing with circular <i>\u03c6</i> objects, being two- or three-dimensional. These problems have a wide spectrum of applications ranging from natural sciences, to engineering design, to every day life. They include the coverage of a geographical area with cell transmitters, storage of cylindrical drums into containers or stocking them into an open area, packaging bottles or cans into the smallest box, planting trees in a given region as to maximize the forest density and the distance between the trees, and so forth [<span><a href=\"#bib-0002\">2</a></span>].</p>\n \n <p>Packing circular objects is a challenge to discrete and computational geometry [<span><a href=\"#bib-0002\">2</a></span>]. With a large number of circular objects to pack, the optimal solution is very difficult to find. An optimal solution may be rotated, reflected or the circular objects reordered; hence, the number of equivalent optimal solutions blows up as the number of circular objects increases [<span><a href=\"#bib-0002\">2</a></span>\u2013<span><a href=\"#bib-0004\">4</a></span>]. In addition, one or more of the circular objects may be moved slightly without affecting the optimal solution. In fact, there exists a continuum of optimal solutions [<span><a href=\"#bib-0002\">2</a></span>\u2013<span><a href=\"#bib-0004\">4</a></span>]. Last, there is the issue of computational accuracy and precision.</p>\n \n <p>Obviously, packing circular objects gives rise to optimization problems, but their classification into continuous or discrete problems is fuzzy. Indeed, the positions of the circular objects are continuous whereas the structure of an optimal pattern has a discrete nature [<span><a href=\"#bib-0005\">5</a></span>]. The recent trend is to design solution techniques that tackle (to some extent) these two aspects simultaneously.</p>\n \n <p>Many variants of packing circular objects in the plane have been formulated as nonconvex optimization problems; with the hope that these formulations when solved using available nonlinear programming (NLP) solvers yield high quality approximate solutions [<span><a href=\"#bib-0006\">6</a></span>]. However, most NLP solvers fail to identify global optima. In fact, problems with circular objects are very hard optimization problems. They have a large number of variables and local minima. Thus, they require to be tackled with algorithms which mix local searches with heuristic procedures in order to widely explore the search space [<span><a href=\"#bib-0007\">7</a></span>, <span><a href=\"#bib-0008\">8</a></span>]. The recent trend has been to adopt approximation methods (heuristics) which combine methods of global (heuristic) search and methods of local exhaustive (exact) search of local minima or their approximations [<span><a href=\"#bib-0009\">9</a></span>].</p>\n \n <p>This paper provides an extensive survey of recent literature on packing circular objects. Literature can be classified into two categories: papers seeking optimal solutions or demonstrating the optimality of some patterns, and papers attempting to improve previously published results [<span><a href=\"#bib-0010\">10</a></span>]. Independently of their classification, these papers search for the best solutions regardless of the margin of improvement or the computational expense [<span><a href=\"#bib-0010\">10</a></span>]. Section <a href=\"#sec-0002\">2</a> considers the case where the region \u03a9 is a regular polygon whereas Section <a href=\"#sec-0008\">3</a> focuses on the case the region \u03a9 is circular. Finally, Section <a href=\"#sec-0011\">4</a> is a summary.</p>\n </section>\n <section>\n \n <h2> 2. Polygonal Region \u03a9</h2>\n \n <p>In this section, we distinguish between the two- and the three-dimensional case.</p>\n \n <section>\n \n <h3> 2.1. Two-Dimensional Case</h3>\n \n <p>Packing circles in a two-dimensional geometrical form such as a unit square or a unit-side triangle [<span><a href=\"#bib-0011\">11</a></span>] is the best known type of extremal planar geometry problems [<span><a href=\"#bib-0012\">12</a></span>]. Herein, the cases where the region \u03a9 is a square, a rectangle, and a polygon are discussed.</p>\n \n <section>\n \n <h4> 2.1.1. Packing Circles into a Square</h4>\n \n <div><p>One of the problems that attracted most attention consists in packing <i>n</i> identical circles within a unit square with the objective of maximizing the minimum distance between the centers of the circles; that is, of identifying the maximum radius <span></span></p><p> of <i>n</i> identical circles that fit into a square whose side length is one (i.e., fixed and known). The problem, which is a geometrical one, can be viewed as a continuous global optimization one. It can be stated as finding the optimal level of the decision variables <span></span></p><p> and (<i>x</i><sub><i>i</i></sub>, <i>y</i><sub><i>i</i></sub>), <i>i</i> \u2208 <i>I</i> = {1,2, \u2026, <i>n</i>}, thus\n\t\n </p><p><span>\n \n <span></span>\n </span><span>(2.1)</span></p><p>\n\twhere (<i>x</i><sub><i>i</i></sub>, <i>y</i><sub><i>i</i></sub>), <i>\u2009\u2009</i><i>i</i> \u2208 <i>I</i>, denote the coordinates of the center of circle <i>i</i>, and <span></span></p><p> is the Euclidean distance separating the centers of circles <i>i</i> and <i>j</i>, <i>\u2009\u2009</i>1 \u2264 <i>i</i> &lt; <i>j</i> \u2264 <i>n</i>.</p></div>\n \n <div><p>This packing problem is equivalent to the problem of scattering <i>n</i> points in a unit square such that the minimal distance <span></span></p><p> between any pair of points is maximized. This scattering problem can be stated as a difference of convex functions program [<span><a href=\"#bib-0013\">13</a></span>] or as an all-quadratic optimization problem [<span><a href=\"#bib-0014\">14</a></span>] or as a continuous nonlinear inequality-constrained global optimization one [<span><a href=\"#bib-0015\">15</a></span>]. The first two formulations are interesting to mathematicians since they are hard optimization problems; however, they are of little practical value [<spa...",

      "text": "<div><div>\n \n <main>\n \n <article><section></section><section><section><h2>Significance</h2>\n<p>Many natural systems are structured by the ordering of repeated, distinct shapes. Understanding how this happens is difficult because shape affects structure in two ways. One is how the shape of a cell or nanoparticle, for example, affects its surface, chemical, or other intrinsic properties. The other is an emergent, entropic effect that arises from the geometry of the shape itself, which we term \u201cshape entropy,\u201d and is not well understood. In this paper, we determine how shape entropy affects structure. We quantify the mechanism and determine when shape entropy competes with intrinsic shape effects. Our results show that in a wide class of systems, shape affects bulk structure because crowded particles optimize their local packing.</p>\n<section><p><strong>Keywords:</strong> entropy, self-assembly, colloids, nanoparticles, shape</p></section></section><section><h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Entropy drives the phase behavior of colloids ranging from dense suspensions of hard spheres or rods to dilute suspensions of hard spheres and depletants. Entropic ordering of anisotropic shapes into complex crystals, liquid crystals, and even quasicrystals was demonstrated recently in computer simulations and experiments. The ordering of shapes appears to arise from the emergence of directional entropic forces (DEFs) that align neighboring particles, but these forces have been neither rigorously defined nor quantified in generic systems. Here, we show quantitatively that shape drives the phase behavior of systems of anisotropic particles upon crowding through DEFs. We define DEFs in generic systems and compute them for several hard particle systems. We show they are on the order of a few times the thermal energy (<span></span>) at the onset of ordering, placing DEFs on par with traditional depletion, van der Waals, and other intrinsic interactions. In experimental systems with these other interactions, we provide direct quantitative evidence that entropic effects of shape also contribute to self-assembly. We use DEFs to draw a distinction between self-assembly and packing behavior. We show that the mechanism that generates directional entropic forces is the maximization of entropy by optimizing local particle packing. We show that this mechanism occurs in a wide class of systems and we treat, in a unified way, the entropy-driven phase behavior of arbitrary shapes, incorporating the well-known works of Kirkwood, Onsager, and Asakura and Oosawa.</p></section><hr/>\n<p>Nature is replete with shapes. In biological systems, eukaryotic cells often adopt particular shapes, for example, polyhedral erythrocytes in blood clots (<a href=\"#r1\">1</a>) and dendritic neurons in the brain (<a href=\"#r2\">2</a>). Before the development of genetic techniques, prokaryotes were classified by shape, as bacteria of different shapes were implicated in different diseases (<a href=\"#r3\">3</a>). Virus capsids (<a href=\"#r4\">4</a>, <a href=\"#r5\">5</a>) and the folded states of proteins (<a href=\"#r6\">6</a>) also take on well-recognized, distinct shapes. In nonliving systems, recent advances in synthesis make possible granules, colloids, and nanoparticles in nearly every imaginable shape (<a href=\"#r7\">7</a>\u2013<a href=\"#r12\">12</a>). Even particles of nontrivial topology now are possible (<a href=\"#r13\">13</a>).</p>\n<p>The systematic study of families of idealized colloidal and nanoscale systems by computer simulation has produced overwhelming evidence that shape is implicated in the self-assembly<a href=\"#fn1\">*</a> of model systems of particles (<a href=\"#r14\">14</a>\u2013<a href=\"#r17\">17</a>). In these model systems, the only intrinsic forces between particles are steric, and the entropic effects of shape (which we term \u201cshape entropy\u201d<a href=\"#fn2\"><sup>\u2020</sup></a>) can be isolated. Those works show that shape entropy begins to be important when systems are at moderate density (<a href=\"#r21\">21</a>).</p>\n<p>In laboratory systems, however, it is not possible to isolate shape entropy effects with as much control, and so the role of shape entropy in experiment is less clear. However, intuition suggests that shape entropy becomes important when packing starts to dominate intrinsic interactions and therefore should be manifest in crowded systems in the laboratory.</p>\n<p>Unlike other interactions, shape entropy is an emergent<a href=\"#fn3\"><sup>\u2021</sup></a> quantity that is expected to become important as systems become crowded. Although entropy-driven phase behavior, from the crystallization of hard spheres (<a href=\"#r22\">22</a>\u2013<a href=\"#r27\">27</a>) to the nematic transition in hard rods (<a href=\"#r28\">28</a>) to colloid\u2013polymer depletion interactions (<a href=\"#r29\">29</a>), has been studied for decades, linking microscopic mechanisms with macroscopic emergent behavior is difficult in principle (<a href=\"#r30\">30</a>). Hence, even for idealized systems, despite the overwhelming evidence that shape entropy is implicated in phase behavior, understanding how shape entropy is implicated is only now starting to be distilled (<a href=\"#r14\">14</a>\u2013<a href=\"#r17\">17</a>, <a href=\"#r31\">31</a>\u2013<a href=\"#r59\">59</a>). For example, the phase behavior of binary hard sphere mixtures (<a href=\"#r60\">60</a>\u2013<a href=\"#r64\">64</a>) or polygons (<a href=\"#r40\">40</a>, <a href=\"#r43\">43</a>, <a href=\"#r65\">65</a>) can be deduced from global packing arguments, but for many other shapes (<a href=\"#r17\">17</a>), including \u201csimple\u201d platonic solids such as the tetrahedron (<a href=\"#r36\">36</a>) and its modifications (<a href=\"#r15\">15</a>), this is not the case.</p>\n<p>One suggestion of how shape entropy is implicated in the phase behavior of systems of anisotropic particles is through the idea of directional entropic forces (DEFs). Damasceno et al. (<a href=\"#r15\">15</a>) inferred the existence of these forces by observing that in many idealized systems of convex polyhedral shapes, one tends to observe a high degree of face-to-face alignment between particles in crystals. However, the origin and strength of these forces are unclear.</p>\n<p>Here we use computer simulations to address how these forces arise and construct a rigorous theoretical framework that enables this investigation. Our key results are as follows: (<em>i</em>) We quantify pairwise DEFs in arbitrary systems, compute them directly in several example systems, and show they are on the order of a few times the thermal energy (<span></span>) just before the onset of crystallization. (<em>ii</em>) We show that the microscopic mechanism underlying the emergence of DEFs is the need for particles to optimize their local packing in order for the system to maximize shape entropy. (<em>iii</em>) By computing quantities for DEFs that can be compared with intrinsic forces between particles, we determine when shape entropy is important in laboratory systems and suggest how to measure DEFs in the laboratory. (<em>iv</em>) We explain two notable features of the hard particle literature: the observed frequent discordance between self-assembled and densest packing structures (<a href=\"#r15\">15</a>, <a href=\"#r17\">17</a>, <a href=\"#r39\">39</a>, <a href=\"#r41\">41</a>, <a href=\"#r44\">44</a>, <a href=\"#r53\">53</a>) and the high degree of correlation between particle coordination in dense fluids and crystals (<a href=\"#r17\">17</a>). (<em>v</em>) As we illustrate in <a href=\"#fig01\">Fig. 1</a>, we show that the same local dense packing mechanism that was known to drive the phase behavior of colloid\u2013depletant systems also drives the behavior of monodisperse hard particle systems, thereby allowing us to view\u2014within a single framework\u2014the entropic ordering considered here and in previous works (<a href=\"#r14\">14</a>\u2013<a href=\"#r17\">17</a>, <a href=\"#r21\">21</a>\u2013<a href=\"#r29\">29</a>, <a href=\"#r31\">31</a>\u2013<a href=\"#r59\">59</a>, <a href=\"#r66\">66</a>\u2013<a href=\"#r81\">81</a>).</p>\n<figure><h2>...",

The feasible solution region is contained in the set of pairs of points of the _\u03a6_-function 0-level surface of the polygon. The region is partitioned into a finite number of subregions corresponding to pairs of linear segments of the _\u03a6_-function 0-level surface. The frontiers of the subregions are generated by the conditions of non-overlapping of polygons. Only four such conditions imply non-overlapping of each pair of polygons in a lattice packing. The solution can be attained only in a finite number of points on the frontiers of these subregions. Hence, it is possible to use an organized sorting of such points with discarding of subregions whose objective function upper bound is lower than the record.\n\n## Introduction\n\nIt is necessary to find such a lattice 6, 22, 10 packing of congruent similarly oriented non-overlapping non-convex bounded polygons in the plane so that the density of packing \\[22\\] of the plane with these polygons be the greatest.\n\nThe problems of lattice packing of geometric objects were considered in the works of Refs. 20, 6, 22, 23, 27, 7, 9. Packings being exact coverings and their connection with Fyodorov's crystallographic groups 10, 11 were investigated in the works of Ref. \\[12\\]. Optimization problems of regular (single-row, multirow and lattice \\[22\\]) packing of geometric objects were investigated in the works of Refs. 24, 27, 23, 7, 9. For convex polygons the optimal lattice packing problem was investigated in Ref. \\[21\\]. The lower bounds for double lattice packings of centrally symmetric convex bodies were obtained by Kuperberg and Kuperberg \\[16\\].\n\nThe concept of _\u03a6_-functions \\[28\\] made it possible to represent various cutting and packing problems in terms of mathematical programming. _\u03a6_-function is a function on the set of placement parameters of objects positive when the objects are non-overlapping and negative if their interiorities intersect. 0-level surface of the _\u03a6_-function is the hodograph of the dense placement function \\[25\\] or the frontier of the non-fit polygon \\[19\\].\n\nIn the frames of the typology of cutting and packing problems proposed by Dyckhoff \\[4\\] our problem may be classified as two-dimensional \\`Beladeproblem' with one object (infinite plane) and congruent items (polygons) (abbreviation 2/B/O/C).\n\nThe approach adopted in this work for solving the problem in consideration is based on the use of the _\u03a6_-function properties \\[28\\] as well as on the concept of decomposition of the problem proposed in Refs. 7, 9 and on the properties of lattice packings investigated in Refs. 7, 9.\n\nWe give here proofs of the results justifying the approach proposed in Refs. 7, 9, select the set of pairs of the _\u03a6_-function 0-level surface vertices on which extremum can be attained. Algorithmic realization involves treating singularity cases and estimations reducing the region of feasible solutions.\n\nMethods of construction of 0-level surface of the _\u03a6_-function proposed in Refs. 14, 17, 1, 19 were used when obtaining optimal lattice packings.\n\nIn the present paper we describe in Section 2some properties of _\u03a6_-function and its 0-level surface used for formalization of conditions of mutual non-overlapping of polygons.\n\nIn Section 3some properties of lattices used when simplifying the mathematical model of the problem are described.\n\nIn Section 4the mathematical model of the problem is formulated. The number of conditions describing the region of feasible solutions is reduced by means of applying some properties of densest lattice packings. Namely, it is shown that for finding a densest lattice packing only lattice packings in which a polygon touches two ones obtained by translations by the basis lattice vectors may be taken into account. It is also shown that when a lattice packing is dense all the conditions of mutual non-overlapping are implied by only four ones written for the combinations _a_ 1, _a_ 2, _a_ 1+ _a_ 2, \u2212 _a_ 1+ _a_ 2 of basis lattice vectors _a_ 1 and _a_ 2. Thus, the ends of basis lattice vectors _a_ 1 and _a_ 2 lie on the piecewise linear _\u03a6_-function 0-level surface and satisfy a structure \\[18\\] of linear equations.\n\nIn Section 5the feasible solution region is decomposed into subsets represented parametrically as subsets of \\[0,1\\]\u00d7\\[0,1\\] with a piecewise linear frontier. The objective function in our problem has no extrema in the interiors of such subregions. Since each segment of their frontier has a unique extremum a sorting of such extrema allows to solve the problem.\n\n## Section snippets\n\n## Formalization of conditions of mutual non-overlapping of polygons\n\nIn order to construct a mathematical model of the problem it is necessary to present the objective function and the constraints describing the region of feasible solutions in the analytical form. The conditions of mutual non-overlapping of the polygons are such constraints.\n\nWe designate the interior of _S_ as intS, the closure of _S_ as clS and the frontier of _S_ as frS.\n\nLet there be a polygon _S_ _i_. Its position in _R_ 2 is well known to be fully characterized by three parameters _x_ _i_, _y_ _i_, _\u03b8_ _i_ where ( _x_ _i_, _y_ _i_)= _v_ _i_\n\n## Lattices and lattice packing\n\nIf _a_ 1, _a_ 2\u2208 _R_ 2 are linearly independent, a set of vectors \\[22\\]r=na1+ma2,n,m\u2208Z,is called a lattice with the basis _a_ 1, _a_ 2 and is denoted by _L_ = _\u039b_( _a_ 1, _a_ 2) where Z={0,\u00b11,\u00b12,\u2026} is the set of integers, _\u039b_ is an operator mapping a set of pairs of vectors onto a set of families of the form (6)....",

A particular case of the nesting problem occurs when congruent copies of one single shape have to fill, as much as possible, a limited sheet. Traditional approaches to the nesting problem have difficulty to tackle with high number of pieces to place. Additionally, if the orientation of the given shape is not a constraint, the general nesting approaches are not particularly successful. This problem arises in practice in several industrial contexts such as footwear, metalware and furniture. A possible approach is the periodic placement of the shapes, in a lattice way. In this paper, we propose three heuristic approaches to solve this particular case of nesting problems. Experimental results are compared with published results in literature and additional results obtained from new instances are also provided.\n## Introduction\nNesting has been widely studied (Dowsland and Dowsland, 1992), as it is a common problem in several industrial production processes (textile, garment, footwear, metalware, furniture, etc.). Most of the published papers impose orientation constraints: the shape can only be rotated a predetermined number of fixed angles (the most common is 180\u00b0 and, less commonly, 90\u00b0) or it cannot be rotated at all. However, in certain particular cases, orientation constraints do not arise. Additionally, some industries frequently need to cut big quantities of each type of shape. In these two situations, the periodic packing of the shapes (lattice packing) proved to be a very competitive approach, because:\n* \u2013good cutting patterns, with very small waste, can be obtained;\n* \u2013the automatic cutting process is more efficient when a periodic placement is considered;\n* \u2013reduced computational time (when compared with general nesting approaches, where each piece has to be treated individually), which allows to tackle problems of greater dimension.\nIn this section, we start by describing the problem and refer to related works in a brief review. In Section 2, we point out the geometric considerations necessary to understand this work. Section 3 describes the underlying rules and criteria used to build the three heuristic approaches, which are proposed in the fourth section. In Section 5, the instances used to evaluate the quality of the proposed approaches are defined and the results obtained with all the three heuristics are presented and compared. Finally, in the last section, we draw conclusions and make some comments about future work.\nThe periodic placement of congruent copies of one shape can be found in literature under the keywords \u201cperiodic packing\u201d, \u201cregular packing\u201d or \u201clattice packing\u201d. The lattice packing may be defined over an infinite plane or a limited sheet. If it is the plane, the main objective is to regularly place the shapes so that the density obtained is maximised. When lattice packing on a limited stock sheet, the goal is to maximise the percentage of stock sheet utilisation, which is equivalent to maximise the number of shapes placed inside the plate. As will be shown later, these two \u201capparently\u201d similar objectives are not quite equivalent. However, the definition of a lattice is identical in the two situations. A lattice is generated by two linearly independent vectors,*v*0and*v*1, whose linear combinations will produce a grid that guarantees that pieces do not overlap. The shapes are located in each node of the grid.\nThe problem we propose to solve does not considerer orientation constraints, so, any rotation of the given shape can be allowed. However, after a specific orientation is chosen, all the shapes must follow the same orientation (*Single-Lattice*\u2013 Fig. 1a) or be alternately rotated 180\u00b0 (*Double-Lattice*\u2013 Fig. 1b). According to the typology by W\u00e4scher et al. (2007), the problem described in this paper is a 2-dimensional irregular IIPP (Identical Item Packing Problem).\nThe orientation of the shapes is not relevant when lattice packing on the plane, as maximum density remains unchanged. However, when stock sheet borders need to be taken into account, the orientation of the shapes may be extremely important as will be shown in the following sections.\nIn this work, we propose to solve the problem of Periodic Packing of Irregular Shapes (PPIS) on a limited stock sheet (a rectangle) by heuristic methods.\nThere are references in the literature to the Lattice Packing Problem since the fifties, the first results concerning only theoretical aspects of the lattice packing of a single convex polygon on the plane (Rogers, 1951). However, only a few publications during the next 30 years can be found, and some of them are just marginally related to lattice packing. O\u2019Rourke et al. (1986) have considered the problem of finding minimal enclosing triangles and Dori and Ben Bassat (1983) have dealt with the problem of finding minimal enclosing convex polygons with fewer sides. Those approaches can be seen as a pre-processing to lattice packing, as regular convex polygons can be easily packed than the original ones.\nBetween 1990 and 2000, essentially theoretical results on lattice lacking have been published, mostly considering unlimited sheets and convex shapes (Mount and Silverman, 1990, Mount, 1991, Kuperberg and Kuperberg, 1990, Stoyan and Patsuk, 2000).\nMore recently, results concerning real industrial problems, with limited sheets, irregular shapes and no orientation constraints, have been published. Prasad et al. (1995) describe a nesting problem of irregular shaped metal blanks and propose a heuristic search, considering the variation in the or...",
