      "text": "Constructive heuristics for irregular\u2011polygon packing start with an empty container and iteratively place pieces according to simple geometric rules, avoiding any later \u201crepair\u201d or local\u2011search phase.  The most widely\u2011cited approaches that follow this philosophy are:\n\n* **Shape\u2011reasoning (or nesting) heuristics** \u2013 the classic method introduced by Albano\u202f1997 builds a \u201cno\u2011fit polygon\u201d (NFP) for every pair of pieces, then selects the next piece by scanning the NFPs for the smallest feasible insertion gap.  Because the NFP encodes all admissible relative positions, the algorithm can place a new polygon without overlap in a single pass, and it works with arbitrary rotations.  This pure construction step has become a benchmark for irregular nesting problems ([ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0010448596000656)).  \n\n* **Guillotine\u2011cut constructive procedures** \u2013 Alvarez\u2011Valdes\u202fet\u202fal. (2015) extend the NFP idea to the 2\u2011D bin\u2011packing setting with multiple bins, allowing rotations and enforcing guillotine cuts.  Their algorithm orders the pieces, then uses a greedy placement rule that respects the guillotine feasibility region; the order itself is generated by a simple first\u2011fit\u2011decreasing rule on piece area, so the whole solution is built from scratch.  The authors report that this method outperforms many post\u2011optimisation schemes on real\u2011world data ([ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0305048314001285)).  \n\n* **Beam\u2011search driven placement** \u2013 Song\u202f(2008) treats the packing order as a search tree and expands several partial solutions in parallel.  Each node is evaluated by a placement heuristic that uses an enhanced NFP generator and a set of evaluation criteria (e.g., waste area, edge\u2011contact).  Although beam search explores many orders, every partial solution is constructed incrementally; no later local\u2011search is applied, making it a \u201cconstruction\u2011only\u201d meta\u2011heuristic that still yields highly competitive packings ([Springer](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10732-008-9095-x)).  \n\n* **Partition\u2011and\u2011sequential placement (CG:SHOP 2024 challenge)** \u2013 Luo\u202fet\u202fal. (2024) propose a two\u2011stage constructive framework: first the container and the polygon set are recursively partitioned into small sub\u2011problems, then each sub\u2011problem is solved by sequentially inserting polygons using a simple NFP\u2011based rule and immediately discarding overlaps with a fast local\u2011elimination step.  Because the partitions are tiny, the sequential placement runs in linear time and produces high\u2011quality solutions for instances with up to 50\u202f000 polygons, demonstrating that modern constructive pipelines can scale to very large irregular\u2011packing challenges ([Dagstuhl](https://drops.dagstuhl.de/storage/00lipics/lipics-vol293-socg2024/LIPIcs.SoCG.2024.86/LIPIcs.SoCG.2024.86.pdf)).  \n\nTogether, these methods illustrate the current \u201cbest\u201d constructive toolbox: (1) compute NFPs to capture feasible relative positions, (2) order pieces by simple size\u2011based rules or by beam\u2011search exploration, (3) place each piece greedily while respecting additional constraints (guillotine cuts, bin limits, or partition boundaries).  They avoid any post\u2011hoc optimisation and are the preferred starting point for researchers who need fast, from\u2011scratch solutions to irregular polygon\u2011packing problems.",

At its core is an innovative mixed integer programme model that places irregular pieces and defines guillotine cuts. The two-dimensional irregular shape bin [packing problem](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/packing-problem) with guillotine constraints arises in the glass cutting industry, for example, the cutting of glass for conservatories. Almost all cutting and packing problems that include guillotine cuts deal with rectangles only, where all cuts are orthogonal to the edges of the stock sheet and a maximum of two [angles of rotation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/angles-of-rotation) are permitted. The literature tackling packing problems with irregular shapes largely focuses on strip packing i.e. minimizing the length of a single fixed width stock sheet, and does not consider guillotine cuts. Hence, this problem combines the challenges of tackling the complexity of packing irregular pieces with free rotation, guaranteeing guillotine cuts that are not always orthogonal to the edges of the stock sheet, and allocating pieces to bins. To our knowledge only one other recent paper tackles this problem. We present a hybrid algorithm that is a constructive heuristic that determines the relative position of pieces in the bin and guillotine constraints via a mixed integer programme model. We investigate two approaches for allocating guillotine cuts at the same time as determining the placement of the piece, and a two phase approach that delays the allocation of cuts to provide flexibility in space usage. Finally we describe an improvement procedure that is applied to each bin before it is closed. This approach improves on the results of the only other publication on this problem, and gives competitive results for the classic rectangle bin packing problem with guillotine constraints.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe paper focuses on the two-dimensional bin packing problem (BBP) with irregular convex pieces and guillotine cuts. Guillotine cuts arise due to the cutting process of certain materials, where cuts are restricted to extend from one edge of the stock-sheet to another. This is commonly found in the glass cutting industry and research has almost exclusively focused on the cutting of rectangles where the cuts are orthogonal to the edges of the stock sheet. The problem tackled here is a generalized version of the rectangle single size stock sheet bin packing problem with guillotine constraints, where the pieces to be cut are irregular convex polygons and the guillotine cuts are not constrained to be orthogonal to the edges of the bin. We present a number of constructive heuristics that exploit a mixed integer programming (MIP) model for placing the pieces in the bin while satisfying all the geometric constraints and the guillotine cuts and provide comprehensive results for benchmark instances for this problem and the rectangular bin packing problem with guillotine cuts. The results are compared with the best in the literature and new lower bound is presented.\n\nThe motivation for tackling this problems arises in the cutting of glass sheets, for example, the glass panes for conservatories. Glass is cut by scoring and snapping the material. Each cut divides the sheet in two and is called a guillotine cut. As a result, only convex pieces can be cut directly. Since the properties of the material are homogeneous, pieces can be cut at any angle of rotation, and in some cases reflected. Typically, cutting plans involve multiple stock sheets. An example solution to this problem is given in Fig. 1. Note that the pieces must be removed by the guillotine cuts (in bold) in a specific order so that each cut begins and ends at the edge of the complete or divided stock sheet.\n\nThe requirement for guillotine cuts arise in many industries such as glass, wood boards or fibre glass for printed circuit boards. Each industrial setting implies a particular class of cutting and packing problem. For example, Malaguti et al. \\[15\\] consider a cutting stock problem with multiple stocksheets found in the wood industry, while Cui \\[8\\] tackles the cutting of metal of coils where a stock sheet is considered to have unrestricted length.\n\nThe literature tackling packing problems with irregular shapes largely focuses on strip packing i.e. minimizing the length of a single fixed width stock sheet, see \\[3\\], and does not consider guillotine cuts. Further, almost all cutting and packing problems that include guillotine cuts deal with rectangles only, where all cuts are orthogonal to the edges of the stock sheet and a maximum of two angles of rotation of the pieces are permitted. Hence, this problem combines the challenges of tackling the complexity of packing irregular pieces with free rotation, guaranteeing guillotine cuts that may or may not be orthogonal to the edges of the stock sheet, and allocating pieces to bins or stock sheets. To our knowledge, Han et al. \\[13\\] is the only other paper that tackles this problem. They propose two different construction heuristics. The first heuristic, they call a one-stage algorithm, constructs multiple parallel clusters of pieces by iteratively joining two blocks, where a block is either a piece or the convex hull of a cluster of pieces. Blocks are combined by matching pairs of edges and selecting the best match according to a dynamic solution evaluation function. Since each accepted match, starting with two individual pieces, is transformed into its convex block by taking the convex hull, the guillotine cut structure is always satisfied. The approach uses threshold parameters to control the number of blocks generated and as a result the computational time. The second constructive heuristic, a two-stage algorithm, combines pairs of p...",

The simulated annealing controls: the rotation applied, the placement and the sequence of placement of the polygons. For each non placed polygon, a limited depth binary search is performed to find a scale factor that when applied to the polygon, would allow it to be fitted in the container. It is proposed a crystallization heuristic, in order to increase the number of accepted solutions. The bottom left and larger first deterministic heuristics were also studied.

We also want to thank Dominik Krupke for providing a\nhelpful official validator for solutions.\n1 Introduction\nThe recent CG:SHOP 2024 Challenge introduced a variant of irregular packing problems\nknown as the Maximum Polygon Packing (MPP) problem. The MPP problem involves a\nconvex polygonal container C and a polygon set P = {p1, p2, ..., pN }, where polygon piis\nassociated with a value vi. It seeks for a non-overlapping packing with the maximum total\nvalue. The challenge presents a total of 180 instances whose number of polygons ranges from\n28 to 50,000. The official document [4] gives a detailed description of the challenge.\nOur proposed algorithm employs a general process to solve these instances indiscriminately,\nand the overall framework is presented in Figure 1. We first partition a large-scale problem\ninto multiple small-scale subproblems (Section 2) and then solve each subproblem using\nupper-level polygon ordering (Section 3.1) and lower-level packing optimization techniques\n(Section 3.2). Section 4 presents our experimental results, followed by conclusions.\n1 Corresponding author: Zhouxing Su\n\u00a9 Canhui Luo, Zhouxing Su, and Zhipeng L\u00fc;\nlicensed under Creative Commons License CC-BY 4.0\n40th International Symposium on Computational Geometry (SoCG 2024).\nEditors: Wolfgang Mulzer and Jeff M.

It involves two components: partitioning the container C into\nmultiple regions and assigning polygons to each region.\n2.1 Container Partitioning\nThe container partitioning process consists of two steps, as shown in Figure 2. Initially, we\narrange two-dimensional square grids starting from the bottom-left corner of the bounding\nbox until the entire container is covered. The subregions formed by the intersection of the\ncontainer with all the grids constitute its partition C = C1 \u222a C2 \u222a ... \u222a Cm. Subsequently,\nwe merge the small subregions with adjacent grids, which are difficult to be used effectively.\nThe grid is dimensioned to keep the scale of each subproblem at approximately 300 polygons,\nmaking a trade-off between effectiveness and efficiency of lower-level packing optimization.\n2.2 Polygon Assignment\nWe adopt a simple approach of randomly assigning polygons to each subregion. Specifically, for\neach subregion Ci, we randomly select a polygon pj from P until\nP\nj\narea(pj )\narea(Ci) \u2265\nPN\ni=0\narea(pi)\narea(C)\n.\nThe advantage of random assignment lies in ensuring that the overall characteristics of each\nsubproblem align with the original problem.\nC.

We repeatedly select one remaining polygon with the\nhighest priority (ties are broken by value) and try to insert it into the current solution. If the\ninsertion with lower-level packing optimization fails, we skip the current polygon and turn to\nthe next one. For the majority of instances, the priority is defined as the value-to-area ratio\nof a polygon (we also call it unit value). Polygons with higher unit values are prioritized\nfor putting in the container, which is called the Unit Value First (UVF) strategy. For\nsmall-scale instances (N < 100), we employ the \u03b1\u03b2-random strategy. It randomly selects\n\u03b1% and \u03b2% of the polygons and reassigns their UVF-based priority to the highest and the\nlowest, respectively. These instances are run for multiple times to ensure comprehensive\noptimization, with \u03b1 and \u03b2 set to 10 in our implementation.\n3.2 Lower-Level Packing Optimization\nThe position of a polygon can be represented by the coordinates l = (x, y) of a reference point,\nsuch as the bottom-left corner of the boundary. Then, the translation of a polygon can be\nrepresented by a vector pointing from its original position to its new position. Given a feasible\npacking S and a polygon p to be placed, it is impossible to find a non-overlapping position\nfor p without moving other polygons in most cases. This section introduces the algorithm for\neliminating overlaps for an invalid packing, which involves solving an unconstrained nonlinear\nproblem and heuristic polygon movement.\nS o C G 2 0 2 4\n86:4 A General Heuristic Approach for Maximum Polygon Packing\n3.2.1 Overlap Minimization\nTo determine the appropriate translation for the polygons, we utilized the no-fit polygon\n(NFP) and inner-fit polygon (IFP), which are fundamental in algorithmic approaches to\ngeometric design and optimization challenges. For a fixed polygon pi and a movable polygon\npj , NFP(pi, pj ) describes their non-overlapping positions with boundaries in contact precisely,\nwhich can be utilized to determine the minimum translation for pj to avoid overlap. Similarly,\nIFP(pi, pj ) is employed to determine the minimum translation to place pj inside pi. Figure 3\nillustrates the polygon translations determined using NFP (left) and IFP (right). The readers\nmay refer to Burke et al. [2] for a more detailed description.\nFor a packing S, based on NFP and IFP, we define the overlap between polygons pi\nand pj as fij (S), representing the minimum translation to separate them, and f0i(S) as the\nminimum translation for moving pi to fit into the container. Subsequently, we employ the\nseparation algorithm proposed by Imamichi et al. [7] to minimize the overlap, which involves\nsolving an unconstrained nonlinear programming problem as follows:\nmin\nS\nF(S) = X\n0\u2264i<j\u2264N\nf\n2\nij (S) (1)\nThe model relaxes the non-overlapping constraint but introduces repulsion forces between\nany two overlapped polygons. We use the classic L-BFGS (limited memory BFGS) method\nto solve this problem. It makes the packing S converge to a local optimum but strongly\ndepends on the initial layout. ...",

There exist many applications of this problem, such as VLSI design, timber/glass cutting, and newspaper layout. In this paper, we design efficient implementations of two construction heuristics for rectilinear block packing. The proposed algorithms are tested on a series of instances, which are generated from nine benchmark instances. The computational results show that the proposed algorithms are especially efficient for large instances with repeated shapes.\n## Introduction\nThe rectilinear block packing problem involves packing a set of arbitrarily shaped rectilinear blocks into a larger rectangular container without overlap so as to minimize or maximize a given objective function. A rectilinear block is a polygonal block whose interior angle is either 90\u00b0 or 270\u00b0. This problem is important for many industrial applications, such as VLSI design, timber/glass cutting, and newspaper layout. It is among the classical packing problems and is known to be NP-hard [3].\nThe rectilinear block packing problem is a special case of the problem of packing general polygons, called the irregular packing problem or nesting problem, for which a series of approaches have been developed [1], [4], [5], [6], [11], [14], [19], [26]. A special case of the rectilinear block packing problem is the rectangle packing problem. Many efficient algorithms have been proposed to solve the rectangle packing problem, including simulated annealing [10], hybrid algorithm [15], and quasi-human heuristic algorithm [29]. The*bottom-left algorithm*[3] and the*best-fit algorithm*[7] are known as the most remarkable works among existing construction heuristics. Compared with the rectangle packing problem, the rectilinear block packing problem is more complicated, and it is difficult to design efficient data structures to represent the relationships among the rectilinear blocks. Several heuristic methods have been proposed for the rectilinear block packing problem based on different data structures to represent the relationships among the blocks, e.g., BSG (bounded sliceline grid) [20], [24], sequence-pairs [12], [13], [21], [30], O-tree [25], B\u204e-tree [28], TCG (transitive closure graph) [22], CBL (corner block list) [23], etc.\nThis paper proposes construction heuristics for the rectilinear block packing problem by generalizing representative construction heuristics for rectangle packing. It then shows how to reduce the time complexity of these algorithms. One of the basic ideas of our algorithms is that we regard each rectilinear block as a set of rectangles whose relative positions are fixed. This leads to efficient implementations of the construction heuristics, and it also allows us to deal with the problem having noncontinuous items, each of which consists of a set of (separate) rectilinear blocks whose relative positions are fixed.\nThe main strategy of our algorithms is the*bottom-left strategy*, which derives from the bottom-left algorithm for rectangle packing [3]. In this strategy, starting from an empty layout, items are packed into the container one by one, and whenever a new item is packed into the container, it is placed at the*BL position*relative to the current layout. The BL position of a new item relative to the current layout is defined as the leftmost location among the lowest*bottom-left stable feasible positions*, where a bottom-left stable feasible position is a location where the new item can be placed without overlap and cannot be moved leftward or downward.\nVarious algorithms are possible under the bottom-left strategy, and if we consider two standard rules for choosing the new item from the remaining items, the resulting algorithms become the*bottom-left algorithm*and the*best-fit algorithm*. We explain how we generalize these representative construction heuristics for rectangle packing to solve the rectilinear block packing problem in Section 4. Observe that, it is necessary to find a method to calculate BL positions for implementing these algorithms. We generalize the*Find2D-BL*algorithm [17], which was proposed to calculate the BL position of a new rectangle relative to a rectangular container and rectangles placed in the container, to the case of rectilinear blocks. We also analyze the time complexity of the bottom-left and best-fit algorithms when they are implemented based on the generalized Find2D-BL algorithm.\nWe then design more efficient implementations of the bottom-left and best-fit algorithms for the rectilinear block packing problem in Section 5. The basic idea is to design sophisticated data structures that keep the information dynamically so that the BL position of each item can be found in sub-linear amortized time. We then analyze the time complexity of the resulting implementations of the two construction heuristics. In this paper, the methods of processing the rectilinear block packing problem with rotation is also proposed as the extension of our algorithms in Section 6.\nWe perform a series of experiments on a set of instances that are generated from nine benchmark instances. The computational results are shown in Section 7. The computational results show that the proposed algorithms are effective for large-scale instances of the rectilinear block packing problem and are especially efficient for those instances having many repeated shapes. Even for instances with 10,000 distinct shapes, our algorithms run in about one and a half hours on a PC with a 2.3GHz Intel Core i5 processor. For instances with more tha...",

Despite its relevance to industry, research publications are relatively low when compared to other cutting and packing problems. One explanation offered is the perceived difficulty and substantial time investment of developing a geometric tool box to assess computer generated solutions. In this paper we set out to provide a tutorial covering the core geometric methodologies currently employed by researchers in cutting and packing of irregular shapes. The paper is not designed to be an exhaustive survey of the literature but instead will draw on the literature to illustrate the theory and implementation of the approaches. We aim to provide a sufficiently instructive description to equip new and current researchers in the area to select the most appropriate methodology for their needs.\n## Introduction\nCutting and packing problems involving irregular shapes arise in a wide variety of industries including; garment manufacturing, sheet metal cutting, furniture making and shoe manufacturing. An example of a layout from the garment manufacturing industry is provided in Fig. 1. As a result the range of problem variants involving irregular shapes, referred to here as nesting problems, is a core area of research in the field of cutting and packing. The problem is NP-complete and as a result solution methodologies predominantly utilise heuristics. A further defining characteristic of nesting problems is the requirement to develop powerful geometric tools to handle the wide variety and complexity of shapes that need to be packed. In this paper we propose to provide detailed explanations of the most popular techniques for handling the geometry when solving nesting problems and provide guidance on their implementation, strengths and weaknesses.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized in six sections. In the next section the nesting problem is defined more precisely and the key differences between nesting problems and other cutting and packing problems are highlighted. In particular, the importance of the geometry is explained. In Section 3 geometric approaches based on pixel or raster representations are introduced. In Section 4 the concept of the*D*function is presented including algorithms to handle geometric tasks that use this function. In the following section, the nofit polygon is introduced and two different algorithms for its generation are described, one based on the sliding analogy and another using Minkowski sums. Polygon decomposition is also discussed in this section. In Section 6 the concept of Phi function is presented with illustrative examples.\n## Section snippets\n## Problem definition\nNesting problems are one of many terms used to identify the group of problems that will be discussed. A discussion of nomenclature is beyond the scope of this paper, however, it is helpful to identify the other names under which these problems are referenced. Some commonly used terms are irregular shape stock cutting, irregular packing, polygon placement, marker making, non-convex cutting stock, 2-D packing problems or some combination of any of these terms. The term*nesting problems*is adopted\n## Pixel/raster method\nRaster methods are approaches that divide the continuous stock sheet into discrete areas, hence reducing the geometric information to coding the data by a grid represented by a matrix. However, different authors have used different codification schemes, which are largely driven by the placement algorithm that will use this geometric information.\nOliveira and Ferreira (1993) propose the simplest coding scheme that uses the value of 1 to code the existence of piece and the value of 0 to denote the\n## Direct trigonometry and the*D*function\nGiven that the raster representation cannot accurately represent the irregular shape of the pieces, the alternative is to use the polygons directly. When representing the pieces as polygons the amount of information is proportional to the number of vertices and does not depend on the absolute size of the pieces or of the layout. However unlike the raster method, the feasibility or quality of a placement is not implied by the geometry and as a result another evaluation method must be employed.\n## The nofit polygon\nThe nofit polygon has become an increasingly popular option for dealing with the geometry since it is more efficient than direct trigonometry, particularly when using an iterative search, yet shares the benefit of accuracy by using the original edges of the polygon. In addition, the concept opens up new options for placement strategies. In essence the NFP is a polygon derived from aggregating the two component polygons. It can be used, along with the vector difference of the position of the two\n## Phi function\nThe phi-function is the most recent innovation in dealing with the geometric issues for nesting problems. Its purpose is to represent all mutual positions of two objects (in this context polygons), and therefore it is often associated with the NFP. However, this association is misleading as the NFP is only a special case of the broader theory. The Phi-function for cutting and packing were conceived and applied by Stoyan et al., 2001, Stoyan et al., 2004 and this research group continue to be\n## Conclusion\nThe paper has given a detailed description of the operations of a number of different approaches for dealing with the geometry required in the solution of nesting problems, these are; the raster method, direct trigonometry, the Nofit polygon and phi-functions. Each has its advantages and limitations and a common theme is that the more computationally efficient the approach the more complex it is to realise. There is no doubt that there is a sign...",

We represent the problem as an ordered list of pieces to be packed where the order is decoded by a placement heuristic. A placement heuristic from the literature is presented and modified with a more powerful nofit polygon generator and new evaluation criteria. We implement a beam search algorithm to search over the packing order. Using this approach many parallel partial solutions can be generated and compared. Computational results for benchmark problems show that the algorithm generates highly competitive solutions in significantly less time than the best results currently in the literature.\n\nThis is a preview of subscription content, [log in via an institution](https://wayf.springernature.com?redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1007%2Fs10732-008-9095-x%3Ferror%3Dcookies_not_supported%26code%3Db8660074-95a2-4d55-9d9f-66840b869591) to check access.\n\n## Access this article\n\n[Log in via an institution](https://wayf.springernature.com?redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1007%2Fs10732-008-9095-x%3Ferror%3Dcookies_not_supported%26code%3Db8660074-95a2-4d55-9d9f-66840b869591)\n\nBuy article PDF USD 39.95\n\nPrice excludes VAT (USA)\n\nTax calculation will be finalised during checkout.\n\nInstant access to the full article PDF.\n\nRent this article via DeepDyve\n\n[Institutional subscriptions](https://www.springernature.com/gp/librarians/licensing/agc/journals)\n\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n\n![](https://media.springernature.com/w215h120/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10898-018-0637-y/MediaObjects/10898_2018_637_Fig1_HTML.gif)\n\n### [A customized branch-and-bound approach for irregular shape nesting](https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10898-018-0637-y?fromPaywallRec=true)\n\nArticle13 March 2018\n\n![](https://media.springernature.com/w92h120/springer-static/cover-hires/book/978-3-319-24154-8?as=webp)\n\n### [GPU-Based Computing for Nesting Problems: The Importance of Sequences in Static Selection Approaches](https://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-319-24154-8_23?fromPaywallRec=true)\n\nChapter\u00a9 2015\n\n![](https://media.springernature.com/w92h120/springer-static/cover-hires/book/978-3-319-68640-0?as=webp)\n\n### [Placement Problems for Irregular Objects: Mathematical Modeling, Optimization and Applications](https://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-319-68640-0_25?fromPaywallRec=true)\n\nChapter\u00a9 2017\n\n## References\n\n- Art, R.C.: An approach to the two dimensional irregular cutting stock problem.

Irregular shape packing is one of the most recent variants to be widely researched and its history extends over 40 years. The evolution of solution approaches to this problem can be attributed to increased computer power and advances in geometric techniques as well as more sophisticated and insightful algorithm design. In this paper we will focus on the latter. Our aim is not to give a chronological account or an exhaustive review, but to draw on the literature to describe and evaluate the core approaches. Irregular packing is combinatorial and as a result solution methods are heuristic, save a few notable exceptions. We will explore different ways of representing the problem and mechanisms for moving between solutions. We will also propose where we see the future challenges for researchers in this area.\n\n## Suggested Citation\n\nJ A Bennell & J F Oliveira, 2009.\n\" **[A tutorial in irregular shape packing problems](https://ideas.repec.org/a/pal/jorsoc/v60y2009i1d10.1057_jors.2008.169.html)**,\"\n[Journal of the Operational Research Society](https://ideas.repec.org/s/pal/jorsoc.html), Palgrave Macmillan;The OR Society, vol. 60(1), pages 93-105, May.\nHandle: _RePEc:pal:jorsoc:v:60:y:2009:i:1:d:10.1057\\_jors.2008.169_\n\nDOI: 10.1057/jors.2008.169\n\nas\n\nHTMLHTML with abstractplain textplain text with abstractBibTeXRIS (EndNote, RefMan, ProCite)ReDIFJSON\n\n## Download full text from publisher\n\n**File URL:** http://link.springer.com/10.1057/jors.2008.169\n\n**File Function:** Abstract\n\n**Download Restriction:** Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.\n\n* * *\n\n**File URL:** https://libkey.io/10.1057/jors.2008.169?utm\\_source=ideas\n\n**LibKey link**: if access is restricted and if your library uses this service, LibKey will redirect you to where you can use your library subscription to access this item\n\n---><---\n\nAs the access to this document is restricted, you may want to [search](https://ideas.repec.org/cgi-bin/htsearch2?q=%22A+tutorial+in+irregular+shape+packing+problems%22) for a different version of it.\n\n## References listed on IDEAS\n\nas\n\nHTMLHTML with abstractplain textplain text with abstractBibTeXRIS (EndNote, RefMan, ProCite)ReDIFJSON\n\n01.

To be worthwhile, such a combination should outperform the single heuristics. This article presents a GA-based method that produces general hyper-heuristics that solve two-dimensional regular (rectangular) and irregular (convex polygonal) bin-packing problems. A hyper-heuristic is used to define a high-level heuristic that controls low-level heuristics. The hyper-heuristic should decide when and where to apply each single low-level heuristic, depending on the given problem state. In this investigation two kinds of heuristics were considered: for selecting the figures (pieces) and objects (bins), and for placing the figures into the objects. Some of the heuristics were taken from the literature, others were adapted, and some other variations developed by us. We chose the most representative heuristics of their type, considering their individual performance in various studies and also in an initial experimentation on a collection of benchmark problems. The GA included in the proposed model uses a variable-length representation, which evolves combinations of condition-action rules producing hyper-heuristics after going through a learning process which includes training and testing phases. Such hyper-heuristics, when tested with a large set of benchmark problems, produce outstanding results for most of the cases. The testbed is composed of problems used in other similar studies in the literature. Some additional instances for the testbed were randomly generated.
