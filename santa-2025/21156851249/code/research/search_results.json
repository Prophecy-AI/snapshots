      "text": "The sparrow search algorithm (SSA) is a swarm\u2011based meta\u2011heuristic introduced in 2020 that mimics the foraging and anti\u2011predation behaviour of sparrows; it uses a small set of control parameters, conducts parallel searches with \u201cdiscoverers\u201d and \u201cjoiners\u201d, and is praised for its simplicity, ability to avoid premature convergence and flexibility across many engineering problems, including polygon\u2011packing tasks where a modified version (CASSA) has been proposed to handle the geometric constraints of irregular pieces\u3010https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11831-023-09887-z.pdf\u3011. In contrast, simulated annealing (SA) is a trajectory\u2011based stochastic method that emulates the cooling of metals: a single solution is perturbed repeatedly, and worse moves are accepted with a probability that decreases as the \u201ctemperature\u201d lowers, making it a well\u2011understood but often slower technique for packing problems such as the irregular strip\u2011packing (nesting) problem\u3010https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0377221704005879\u3011.\n\n**Comparison:**  \n- **Search strategy:** SSA explores the solution space with a population of agents simultaneously, providing diverse candidate layouts for polygon packing, whereas SA follows one solution path and relies on a temperature schedule to escape local minima\u3010https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11831-022-09804-w.pdf\u3011\u3010https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/simulated-annealing-algorithm\u3011.  \n- **Parameter handling:** SSA needs only a few parameters (population size, discovery\u2011joiner ratio, max iterations), while SA requires careful tuning of initial temperature, cooling rate, and stopping criteria, which can affect convergence speed and solution quality\u3010https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11831-023-09887-z.pdf\u3011\u3010https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/simulated-annealing\u3011.  \n- **Performance on polygon packing:** Studies using a modified SSA (CASSA) report competitive or superior packing efficiency for 3\u2011D routing and irregular polygon layouts compared with traditional heuristics, whereas SA\u2011based approaches have shown good results but often need hybridisation (e.g., with constructive heuristics) to reach comparable waste\u2011reduction levels\u3010https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/21/4/1224\u3011\u3010https://skoge.folk.ntnu.no/prost/proceedings/ifac11-proceedings/data/html/papers/0563.pdf\u3011.  \n- **Computational effort:** Because SSA evaluates many candidates in parallel, it can converge faster on large\u2011scale packing instances, while SA\u2019s single\u2011solution nature may require more iterations to achieve similar quality, especially when the temperature schedule is conservative\u3010https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11831-022-09804-w.pdf\u3011\u3010https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378437113004858\u3011.\n\nIn summary, the sparrow search algorithm offers a population\u2011driven, easily\u2011tuned alternative that often attains higher-quality polygon\u2011packing solutions with fewer iterations, whereas simulated annealing provides a classic, single\u2011trajectory approach that remains effective but may need additional hybrid mechanisms to match SSA\u2019s performance.",

A highly efficient route planning approach is required for this complex high dimensional optimization problem. However, many algorithms are infeasible or have low efficiency, particularly in the complex three-dimensional (3d) flight environment. In this paper, a modified sparrow search algorithm named CASSA has been presented to deal with this problem. Firstly, the 3d task space model and the UAV route planning cost functions are established, and the problem of route planning is transformed into a multi-dimensional function optimization problem. Secondly, the chaotic strategy is introduced to enhance the diversity of the population of the algorithm, and an adaptive inertia weight is used to balance the convergence rate and exploration capabilities of the algorithm. Finally, the Cauchy\u2013Gaussian mutation strategy is adopted to enhance the capability of the algorithm to get rid of stagnation. The results of simulation demonstrate that the routes generated by CASSA are preferable to the sparrow search algorithm (SSA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), artificial bee colony (ABC), and whale optimization algorithm (WOA) under the identical environment, which means that CASSA is more efficient for solving UAV route planning problem when taking all kinds of constraints into consideration. </p>\n </section>\n <div>\n \n<div>\n <section><h2> 1. Introduction</h2><section><h4> 1.1. Research Background</h4><p>The three-dimensional (3d) route planning for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) can be considered as a multi-constraint global optimization problem [<a href=\"#B1-sensors-21-01224\">1</a>], and the main purpose of this problem is to search for the optimal route from the departure point to the target point autonomously according to the task requirements and the flight constraints. In recent years, with the broad use of different kinds of UAV, this problem has drawn widespread attention from researchers. </p><p>In recent years, various approaches have been put forward for solving this complex optimization problem, such as A* algorithm [<a href=\"#B2-sensors-21-01224\">2</a>], rapidly exploring random trees [<a href=\"#B3-sensors-21-01224\">3</a>], potential field based method (PFM) [<a href=\"#B4-sensors-21-01224\">4</a>], genetic algorithm (GA) [<a href=\"#B5-sensors-21-01224\">5</a>], linear programming [<a href=\"#B6-sensors-21-01224\">6</a>], and artificial intelligence guidance [<a href=\"#B7-sensors-21-01224\">7</a>]. These methods can be classified as deterministic algorithms and non-deterministic algorithms. Obviously, most of the practical engineering problems have many local optimal solutions [<a href=\"#B8-sensors-21-01224\">8</a>,<a href=\"#B9-sensors-21-01224\">9</a>]. Although deterministic algorithms are quite mature in mathematical theory, there also exists the problem that they are less effective in dealing with discontinuous and non-derivative functions, and they are easily trapped into local optimal solutions when solving the UAV route planning problem with multiple constraints [<a href=\"#B10-sensors-21-01224\">10</a>]. Due to those problems that deterministic algorithms have, researchers have begun to pay more attention to heuristic algorithms. The most important feature of the heuristic algorithm is that it introduces a stochastic approach, which provides the opportunity to get rid of the local optimal solutions. Compared with classical methods, the heuristic algorithms require less computation due to their independence of initial conditions. In general, it is significant to use heuristic algorithms to obtain the optimal solution for global optimization problems.</p></section><section><h4> 1.2. Related Work</h4><p>With the development of computer science, some heuristic algorithms have been widely applied to deal with UAV route planning problems. In <a href=\"#sensors-21-01224-t001\">Table 1</a>, the recent relevant studies are shown as below.</p><p>Inspired by the predatory behavior of sparrows, the sparrow search algorithm (SSA) is firstly proposed in Ref. [<a href=\"#B27-sensors-21-01224\">27</a>]. As a heuristic algorithm, the SSA imitates the predatory activity and the escape activity of a sparrow group, which has better convergence performance than some other swarm-intelligence algorithms. Because of its few controlling parameters as well as easy implementation, SSA has been successfully used in various practical engineering applications. For example, Ref. [<a href=\"#B28-sensors-21-01224\">28</a>] proposed a power flow management of a hybrid renewable energy source (HRES) with SSA. Ref. [<a href=\"#B29-sensors-21-01224\">29</a>] used an improved SSA to solve the renewable energy system optimization problem. In Ref. [<a href=\"#B30-sensors-21-01224\">30</a>], the authors combined the neural networks with the SSA for the obstacle avoidance. In Ref. [<a href=\"#B31-sensors-21-01224\">31</a>], the authors proposed an adaptive SSA to identify the optimal parameter of proton exchange membrane fuel cell stacks.</p></section><section><h4> 1.3.

      "text": "<div><div><h2>Introduction</h2><section><p>The Irregular Strip Packing problem belongs to the more general class of combinatorial optimisation problems\u2014the Cutting and Packing problems. In these problems, one or more big items, either material or space, must be divided into smaller pieces. Usually the objective is the waste minimisation, i.e. the portions of the big items that are not used to produce small pieces. In Cutting and Packing problems, on the one hand, decisions have to be taken on which pieces to produce and from which big item, which is a hard combinatorial problem. On the other hand, a specific geometric problem arises: how to cut the small pieces. These two problems are interlaced and solutions must be feasible both from the \u201cquantitative\u201d viewpoint (i.e. minimum or maximum number of small pieces to produce, availability of big items) and from the geometric viewpoint (i.e. no overlapping between the small pieces, containment of the small pieces inside the big items).</p><p>Cutting and Packing problems are mainly characterised by: the number of relevant dimensions, the regularity or irregularity of the shapes of the small pieces and big items, the big items assortment and availability, the total number of small pieces and the number of different types of small pieces. For a detailed classification of Cutting and Packing problems see Dyckhoff et al. (1988). Additional information on Cutting and Packing is available online on the ESICUP\u2014EURO Special Interest Group on Cutting and Packing web site (<a href=\"http://www.apdio.pt/esicup\"></a>).</p><p>The economic and ecologic impact of the Cutting and Packing problems is obvious in many industrial production processes and better solving these problems contributes to a better usage of natural resources. Examples of industrial Cutting and Packing problems are:</p><ul><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul><p>The focus of this work is on the 2D Irregular Strip Packing problem, also known as nesting problem, and specially on a variant of the problem that arises in the garment industry. In its most general formulation, the nesting problem is a two dimensional Cutting and Packing problem where both the small and the big pieces have irregular (non-rectangular) shapes. Small pieces can be placed with an arbitrary orientation.</p><p>Nesting problems in the garment industry have several characteristics that are specific to this industry. These characteristics are inherent to the production process and to several technological issues. In this type of industry, the plates are big rolls of fabric with a total length up to several kilometres. This leads to the consideration of a single rectangle with a fixed width and an infinite length (a strip). The objective is the minimisation of the layout length. In the garment industry usually only two orientations are allowed for the small pieces: the original and the one obtained by a 180\u00b0 rotation. This restriction is due to the existence of drawing patterns and to intrinsic characteristics of the fabric\u2019s weave. Finally, in the garment industry the total number of small pieces can rise above 100, but usually from less than 20 different types, although with very different sizes. In this paper, an approach that takes advantage of these characteristics is proposed. An example of a nesting layout or cutting pattern is represented in Fig. 1. A more detailed description of nesting problems and cutting and packing problems can be found in Dowsland and Dowsland (1995).</p><p>In the industrial environment this problem is usually tackled by experienced workers that \u201cmanually\u201d (with the help of CAD systems) build the layouts. The quality of the layouts produced by these specialised workers is high and, presently, automatic solutions can only barely match this level of quality. A list of (semi-)automatic commercial solutions is available in Hopper (2000).</p><p>In the literature we can find several algorithms that follow different approaches to tackle the different issues present in nesting problems. For some of those issues there are techniques that clearly out-perform all the others available. That is the case of the no-fit-polygon concept, used to ensure the geometric feasibility of a layout, and the case of the algorithms based on linear programming compaction models, used to obtain layouts that are local optima (Li and Milenkovic, 1995, Stoyan et al., 1996, Bennell and Dowsland, 2001). There are also a few simple greedy heuristics that are very effective in achieving a \u201cgood\u201d layout rapidly (Daniels and Milenkovic, 1996, Gomes and Oliveira, 2002). In order to avoid local optima, metaheuristics have become very popular in this field (Oliveira and Ferreira, 1993, B\u0142a\u017cewicz and Walkowiak, 1995, Heckmann and Lengauer, 1995, Bennell and Dowsland, 1999, Gomes and Oliveira, 1999, Hopper, 2000, Gomes and Oliveira, 2001, Bennell and Dowsland, 2001, B\u0142a\u017cewicz et al., 2004). A very promising approach is the use of hybrid algorithms that combine metaheuristics and linear programming compaction models (Bennell and Dowsland, 2001). This is the approach followed in this work, where a simulated annealing algorithm is used to guide the search through the solution space, being the neighbourhood structure based on linear programming compaction models.</p><p>This paper is structured as follows. The next section has a description of the basic blocks of the proposed nesting algorithm: the no-fit-polygon concept, the greedy bottom-left placement heuristic and the compaction/separation algorithms. The following section is used to present the hybrid algorithm, with a detailed description of its main components: the simulated annealing algorithm, the neighbourhood structure\u2014LC\u2014and the multi-stage approach. Finally, computational results are presented and some conclusions drawn.</p></section></div><div><h2>Section snippets</h2><section><h2>Blocks to build nesting algorithms</h2><p>Algorithms based on a high level search algorithm need to perform a fairly wide search over the solution space to ensure the quality of the results obtained.

They compared the performance of the optimized MA parameters to those determined using the SDR and found that the protocols determined by the [simulated annealing algorithm](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/mathematics/simulated-annealing-algorithm) detected an induced SE condition more rapidly (lower ANPed) than those established using the SDR with the greatest differences observed for skewed population distributions. Ng et al. were also able to show an improved [error detection](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/mathematics/error-detection) ability (lower ANPed) by establishing separate inpatient and ambulatory patient protocols as the population distribution for these groups show substantially different means and [standard deviations](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/mathematics/standard-deviation).\n\nPerformance was assessed by the ANPed. When the simulations are performed for various systematic errors, the results can be plotted in specifically designed [bias detection](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/detection-bias) curve graphs in which, for multiple systematic errors, the mean number of assay results needed for error detection is presented.\n\n[View chapter](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065242323000835) [Explore book](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/bookseries/00652423)\n\n[Read full chapter](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065242323000835)\n\nURL:\u00a0https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065242323000835\n\n## [Composite materials \u2013 modelling, prediction and optimization](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781782421795500055)\n\nDragan Aleksendri\u0107, Pierpaolo Carlone, in [Soft Computing in the Design and Manufacturing of Composite Materials](https://www.sciencedirect.com/book/9781782421795/soft-computing-in-the-design-and-manufacturing-of-composite-materials), 2015\n\n### Simulated annealing\n\nThe simulated annealing algorithm is an optimization method which mimics the slow cooling of metals, which is characterized by a progressive reduction in the atomic movements that reduce the density of lattice defects until a lowest-energy state is reached \\[143\\]. In a similar way, at each virtual annealing temperature, the simulated annealing algorithm generates a new potential solution (or neighbour of the current state) to the problem considered by altering the current state, according to a predefined criterion. The acceptance of the new state is then based on the satisfaction of the Metropolis criterion, and this procedure is iterated until convergence.\n\nFor this application, the Nelder\u2013Mead algorithm, as described in Section 5.2.5, was employed to individuate new candidates for a solution, by probabilistically conditioning the acceptance of each movement of the simplex. In other words, during the [annealing process](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/annealing-process), each new solution _xj_ was accepted with a temperature-dependent probability _PT_ given by\n\n\\[5.85\\]PT={1iff(xj)\u2264f(xi),e(f(xi)\u2212f(xj)kT)iff(xj)\u2265f(xi),\n\nwhere _T_ is the current temperature, _k_ is the [Boltzmann constant](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/boltzmanns-constant), and _f_( _xi_) and _f_( _xj_) are the fitness scores of the worst vertex _xi_ and new vertex of the simplex, respectively. The annealing temperature varied within a range \\[ _T_ in, _T_ fin\\], following a predefined cooling rate _c_ and a predefined cooling scheme.\n\nAt the beginning of the process, which started from a randomly generated simplex, the higher temperature and higher probability of acceptance of new solutions allowed the simplex to explore a wide region of the [search space](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/search-space), thereby escaping from [local minima](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/local-minimum); however, as the temperature was reduced, the probability of acceptance of unfavourable solutions was reduced. The simulated cooling process followed a geometric temperature reduction scheme, activated after a maximum number of simplex walks _U_ max or a maximum number of conditioned acceptances _V_ max. The algorithm parameters _T_ in, _T_ fin, _c_, _U_ max and _V_ max were defined as 2000\u00a0\u00b0C, 0\u00a0\u00b0C, 0.95, 20 and 5, respectively. Two stopping criteria, based on the maximum allowed number of simplex walks (250) and the minimum allowed difference between the best and worst fitness scores (100\u00a0s), were adopted. Four optimization routines were run for each configuration of the algorithm, to assess the repeatability of the method.\n\nIn Figure 5.56, one of the optimal thermal cycles evaluated by the algorithm that we implemented is depicted, showing also the temperature and degree of cure profiles experienced by the composite material. The first two steps of the cycle describe two sharp heating ramps from room temperature up to about 125\u00a0\u00b0C (at the same heating rate), which activate the cure reaction but avoid excessive [thermal gradients](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/thermal-gradient) and heating rates. Then a very slow increase in the autoclave temperature is indicated, in order to keep the peak temperature at an acceptable value. In addition, during the third step, an effective activation of the cure reaction in the core of the material is induced (after approximately 20\u00a0min), resulting in a cure crossover before the gel point ( _\u03b1_ = 0.45, _t_ = 50\u00a0min), with an inside\u2013out direction of solidification.\n\n![](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/3-s2.0-B9781782421795500055-f05-56-9781782421795.jpg)\n\n[Sign in to download full-size image](https://www.sciencedirect.com/user/login?returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sciencedirect.com%2Ftopics%2Fengineering%2Fsimulated-annealing-algorithm)\n\nFigure 5.56.

The process is relatively fast, compared to traditional mathematical programming methods as well as other heuristic processes. Adjustments to a solution are chosen randomly from the neighborhood of the existing solution, and if they result in an inferior solution, they may be acceptable, but the probability of acceptance declines as the number of adjustments increase. One can utilize simulated annealing to develop conservation and management plans for large areas. The advantage to using the heuristic process comes when the decisions (land-use activities) assigned to management units are numerous and utilize binary variables.</p></section><p></p></div><div><p><a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780080454054001671\">Read full chapter</a></p><p>URL:\u00a0https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780080454054001671</p></div></div></article><article><div><div><p><span></span></p><section><h3>1.15.4.4.2.1.2 Simulated annealing</h3><p><span><span>Simulated annealing</span> (SA) approach mimics the process of arranging atoms when a material is heated and then slowly cooled (</span><span>Kirkpatrick et\u00a0al., 1983</span>).

SA is inspired by the annealing process in metallurgy, which is used to alter physical and chemical properties of a material. In annealing, a solid is heated above its recrystallization temperature and then cooled down slowly, allowing sufficient time for the atoms in the material to move toward the defects and fill them. This minimizes Gibbs free energy. Annealing leads to the diffusion of atoms within the solid toward equilibrium state. Initial high-temperature phase of annealing increases the rate of diffusion of atoms by providing the energy needed to break bonds; and the free atoms can easily move to new positions and redistribute at higher temperatures. The subsequent cooling phase of the annealing process results in the stabilization of the atoms at the lowest energy state, thereby filling the defects in the solid.</p><p>SA tries to mimic the annealing process, where at high temperatures, atoms shift unpredictably leading to the elimination of impurities as the material cools down into pure crystal. The impurities/defect are analogous to the optimal solution. SA for parameter estimation starts searching the model-parameter space (i.e., solution space) for an optimal solution by assuming a high value for a search-parameter referred as temperature (analogous to an atom starting the search for low-energy defect locations during the initial high-temperature phase of annealing). The high temperature initiates the search for solution and promotes exploration of the model-parameter space. As the <span></span>temperature gradually reduces based on a predefined temperature-reduction rule, the extent of exploration reduces and a locally optimal solution is obtained at each temperature level. For each temperature level, a neighboring solution is identified by slightly perturbing a current solution. The neighboring solution is accepted based on an acceptance criterion. When neighboring solution is better than current solution, the neighboring solution is unconditionally accepted. On the other hand, when neighboring solution is not better than current solution, the neighboring solution is accepted based on a probability that is directly proportional to the current temperature and inversely proportional to the extent of difference between current and neighboring solutions. These steps are performed at each temperature level. By occasionally accepting worse solutions during the estimation process, SA finds the optimal solution as the temperature tends to zero.</p><p>To avoid local solutions, SA uses Metropolis algorithm that accepts suboptimal trial solutions to explore more of the solution space.

The proposed algorithm\nconstructively creates layouts from an ordered list of items and a placement heuristic. A\nmoveable item is exclusively placed on a collision free region vertex. The container has a fixed\nwidth, while its length can change so that all items are placed on it. The objective is to find a\nlayout of the set of items that minimizes the length of the container. The proposed algorithm has\ntwo hierarchical levels: core level with a simulated annealing algorithm, and the external level\ncontrolling the container length. The simulated annealing algorithm controls the ordered list of\nitems and the placement of the items. If a feasible layout is found, the external level decreases\nthe container length and applies the simulated annealing again. Otherwise, the container length\nis increased and the simulated annealing is applied again. Computational comparisons on\nbenchmark problems show that the proposed algorithm generated highly competitive solutions.\nMoreover, our algorithm updated some best known results.

INTRODUCTION\nCutting and packing are classic problems of finding the\nmost efficient layout for a set of input items out of a\ngiven container with the objective of minimizing the waste\nmaterial. The applications of cutting and packing, e.g.\nclothing, shipbuilding, and furniture industry are numer\u0002ous. W\u00a8ascher et al. (2007) have developed a typology that\nclassifies the nesting problems according to dimension,\nobjective, assortment of item type, as well as the number\nand nature of the container where the items are to be\nallocated. In this paper, we consider the irregular shape\npacking problem, classified as a two-dimensional irregular\nopen dimension problem (ODP).\nThe problem is NP-complete (Fowler et al., 1981) and\nas a result solution methodologies predominantly utilize\nheuristics. Although there are many different solution\napproaches presented in the literature, there appears to\nbe two key strategies for representing and searching the\nsolution space. The first approach represents the solution\nas an ordered list of items and applies a placement rule\nto construct the solution (Babu and Babu, 2001; Gomes\nand Oliveira, 2002; Burke et al., 2007, 2006). The second\napproach represents the solution as a physical layout on\nthe container and moves items within the layout (Bennell\n1 e-mail: andre.kubagawa@gmail.com. This author was partially\nsupported by CNPq.\n2 e-mail: thiago@usp.br. This author was partially supported by\nFAPESP (grant 2009/14699-0).\n3 e-mail: mtsuzuki@usp.br. This author was partially supported by\nCNPq (grant 304258/2007-5) and FAPESP (grant 2009/07173-2).\nand Dowsland, 1999; Gomes and Oliveira, 2006; Egeblad\net al., 2007). The former strategy is dependent on two\ncritical characteristics of the algorithm; the placement rule\nand the placement order of the items.\nWhen irregular shaped items are involved an extra di\u0002mension of complexity is generated by the geometry. The\nno-fit polygon is the principal approach for handling the\ngeometry in cutting and packing problems with irregular\nshaped items (Burke et al., 2007; Bennell and Song, 2008;\nCosta et al., 2009). The no-fit polygon is used to ensure\nfeasible layouts; i.e. layouts where the items do not overlap\nand fit inside the container.\nIn this paper, the solution is represented as an ordered\nlist of items and a constructive heuristic is applied se\u0002quentially. A simulated annealing algorithm controls how\nthe items are ordered in the list and where the items are\nconstructively placed. The proposed algorithm has two\nhierarchical levels. The inner level solves the placement\nproblem where the container has fixed dimensions. The\nexternal level reduces or increases the container dimen\u0002sion that must be minimized. Experiments show that the\nproposed method is very efficient compared with other\npublished methods.\n2. PREVIOUS WORKS\nThe no-fit polygon alone has limited utility in cutting\nand packing problems. Some recent works are using the\ncollision free region to determine feasible layouts in con\u0002tainers with fixed dimensions. Martins and Tsuzuki (2006)\nproposed a constructive heuristic where the collision free\nPreprints of the 18th IFAC World Congress\nMilano (Italy) August 28 - September 2, 2011\nCopyright by the\nInternational Federation of Automatic Control (IFAC)\n3968\nFig. 1. Cost function behavior when the container has fixed\ndimensions. The cost function assumes only discrete\nvalues, while the rotating angle \u03b8 is continuous.\nregion represents feasible placements for a moveable item\nconsidering the already placed items and the container.\nThe cost function is the non occupied area inside the\ncontainer with fixed dimensions. As the non occupied\narea can change only by adding or removing areas of\nitems, the cost function can assume only a finite set of\nvalues, becoming discontinuous (see Fig. 1). A simulated\nannealing algorithm with adaptive neighborhood (Martins\nand Tsuzuki, 2008, 2009a) controls the sequence of items\nand the placement on the collision free region boundary.\nThe collision free region was calculated using regularized\nBoolean operations implemented with limited precision\n(Hobby, 1999).\nMartins and Tsuzuki (2007) combined the simulated an\u0002nealing with deterministic heuristics (larger first and bot\u0002tom left). They showed that it is possible to create problem\ninstances where deterministic heuristics cannot reach the\nlayout associated with the global optimum.\nSato et al. (2010) implemented a robust algorithm to\ndetermine the collision free region with two dimension\nnon manifold Boolean operations. They created a problem\ninstance where the the global optimum can not be reached\nby placing the moveable item exclusively on collision free\nregion vertices. Such situation rarely occurs considering\nstudied and practical problems. They showed several re\u0002sults where the area of the container was exactly equal\nto the total area of the items. The layout associated with\nglobal optimum was reached in averagely 15 times fewer\niterations when compared to previously published results\n(Martins and Tsuzuki, 2009b, 2010) where the area of the\ncontainer was larger than the total area of the items. The\ncorrect calculation of the collision free region showed to be\nan effective tool to obtain such results.\n3. NO-FIT POLYGONS AND COLLISION FREE\nREGION\nNo-fit polygons represent set of translations of an item\nand are mathematically represented by a set of vectors.\nFor a better understanding of the properties of the no-fit\npolygons, the set of translations of an item is represented\nby polygons in the plane. Every item has a reference point\nthat can be internal or external to it. The no-fit polygon\nrepresents a set of forbidden translations, as shown in\nFig. 2. For an item P, let i(P) be its interior, \u2202P be its\nboundary and c(P) be its complement.\nFig. 2. Set of translations of a shape represented as a region\ncontaining all possible translations from its reference\npoint.\nDefinition 3.1. The no-fit polygon induced by item Pi to\nitem Pj , denoted by \u03a5(Pi, Pj ), is the set of translation\nvectors applied to Pj that leads it to a collision with Pi.\nThus,\n\u03a5(Pi, Pj ) = i(Pi) \t i(Pj ) (1)\n= {v | \u2203 a \u2208 i(Pj ), a + v \u2208 i(Pi)}\nThe no-fit polygon can be obtained by the Minkowski\nsum algorithm (Agarwal et al., 2002), that can be calcu\u0002lated very efficiently for convex polygons.

By mapping the layout problem to a physical system, we present a self-organization emergence algorithm (SEA) based on a multi-agent system (MAS). SEA uses information on the local energy of agents and neighborhood rules to guide interactions between the agents and the environment. System self-organization evolves at a microcosmic level and eventually yields a layout that meets the performance constraints for a satellite. Experiments show that SEA can provide much better performance than other optimization techniques, such as generalized simulated annealing (GSA).\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe two-dimensional layout problem involves placing some items optimally in a container according to certain requirements and is an NP-complete (NPC) problem. A problem that only requires non-overlapping of all items and minimization of the container size or maximization of the area occupied by the items is called a no performance constraints layout problem (NPCLP). A problem that need to satisfy other performance constraints such as inertia, balance, and stability is called performance constraints layout problem (PCLP). While researchers have thoroughly investigated the NPCLP, PCLP has been the focus of less attention.\n\nThe two-dimensional satellite module layout problem (TDSMLP) involves the placement of payloads such as equipment and instruments with different qualities and shapes on a bearing plate. In TDSMLP, which is a PCLP, the performance constraints of the satellite need to be considered.\n\nMuch research has been devoted to the TDSMLP with a static equilibrium constraint and has mainly focused on circular or rectangular items for simplicity, with good results\u00a0 \\[1\\], \\[2\\], \\[3\\], \\[4\\], \\[5\\], \\[6\\], \\[7\\]. However, in practice, TDSMLP items do not always have a regular shape such as a circle or a rectangle, and can be a more general polygon. A recent study considered the problem for irregular polygons (TDSIPLP)\u00a0 \\[8\\]. In general, a hybrid algorithm is used to solve TDSMLPs, which combines an evolutionary algorithm, such as particle swarm optimization (PSO), genetic algorithm (GA), simulated annealing (SA), scatter search algorithm (SSA), and the artificial bee colony algorithm (ABC), with a heuristic method. These methods are mostly based on centralized control theory and do not use local solution information.\n\nThe self-organization approach for a multi-agent system (MAS) for physical systems and artificial life fields is widely used in other branches of computational science. It is based on decentralized control theory and has features of autonomy, distribution, and coordination. It has been demonstrated that the self-organization approach is superior in solving NPC problems such as graph coloring\u00a0 \\[9\\], spin glasses\u00a0 \\[10\\], n-queen and k-coloring problems\u00a0 \\[11\\], \\[12\\], and the traveling salesman problem\u00a0 \\[13\\], \\[14\\], \\[15\\], \\[16\\], \\[17\\].\n\nStarting from a system view, by mapping the TDSIPLP onto a multi-agent physical system, we develop a self-organization emergence algorithm (SEA) using the concept of an extreme algorithm in statistical physics. According to the problem characteristics, SEA divides the whole system into three layers: a separation layer, a swap layer, and an adjustment layer, which have different neighborhood structures and mutual interaction rules. In each layer of the system, a layout result emerges with certain characteristics according to local interactions between the agents and the environment guided by the local energy function. Meanwhile, through mutual interactions between the layers, a satisfactory layout result that meets all the constraints eventually emerges.\n\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section\u00a0 2 we describe a mathematical model for the TDSIPLP and some basic concepts. Section\u00a0 3 outlines the MAS-based SEA and Section\u00a0 4 provides details for each layer. Section\u00a0 5 presents numerical results for a benchmark and an analysis of SEA and GSA. Finally, Section\u00a0 6 summarizes and identifies further research.\n\n## Section snippets\n\n## Traditional optimization TDSIPLP model\n\nFor a given set P=(P1,\u2026,Pn) of n items described as polygons, a set of allowed rotation angles \u03a9, and a bearing plate C=(OC,R), where OC is the center of C and R is the radius, the TDSIPLP requires all the items to be placed reasonably on the bearing plate to meet the following technical requirements:\n\n- \u2022\nNo interference between items or between an object and the cabin wall;\n\n- \u2022\nThe static balance value for the system should be less than a threshold; and\n\n- \u2022\nThe radius of the bearing plate should be as small\n\n\n## Overview of the SEA\n\nFor the adjusted optimization model of TDSIPLP (2), our goal is to map model (2) to the physical MAS and obtain a satellite cabin layout via MAS self-organization.

Meta-heuristic algorithms can identify optimal/near-optimal solutions by mimicking natural behaviours or occurrences and provide benefits such as simplicity of execution, a few parameters, avoidance of local optimization, and flexibility. Many meta-heuristic algorithms have been introduced to solve optimization issues, each of which has advantages and disadvantages. Studies and research on presented meta-heuristic algorithms in prestigious journals showed they had good performance in solving hybrid, improved and mutated problems. This paper reviews the sparrow search algorithm (SSA), one of the new and robust algorithms for solving optimization problems. This paper covers all the SSA literature on variants, improvement, hybridization, and optimization. According to studies, the use of SSA in the mentioned areas has been equal to 32%, 36%, 4%, and 28%, respectively. The highest percentage belongs to Improved, which has been analyzed by three subsections: Meat-Heuristics, artificial neural networks, and Deep Learning.\n\nThis is a preview of subscription content, [log in via an institution](https://wayf.springernature.com?redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1007%2Fs11831-022-09804-w%3Ferror%3Dcookies_not_supported%26code%3Dd4e06684-a641-4a21-9c7d-56314444161e)\nto check access.\n\n## Access this article\n\n[Log in via an institution](https://wayf.springernature.com?redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1007%2Fs11831-022-09804-w%3Ferror%3Dcookies_not_supported%26code%3Dd4e06684-a641-4a21-9c7d-56314444161e)\n\n## Subscribe and save\n\nSpringer+\n\nfrom $39.99 /Month\n\n- Starting from 10 chapters or articles per month\n- Access and download chapters and articles from more than 300k books and 2,500 journals\n- Cancel anytime\n\n[View plans](https://link.springer.com/product/springer-plus)\n\n## Buy Now\n\nBuy article PDF USD 39.95\n\nPrice excludes VAT (USA)\nTax calculation will be finalised during checkout.\n\nInstant access to the full article PDF.\n\n[Institutional subscriptions](https://www.springernature.com/gp/librarians/licensing/agc/journals)\n\n**Fig. 1**\n\n**Fig. 2**\n\n**Fig. 3**\n\n**Fig. 4**\n\n**Fig. 5**\n\n**Fig. 6**\n\n**Fig. 7**\n\n**Fig. 8**\n\n**Fig. 9**\n\n**Fig. 10**\n\n**Fig. 11**\n\n**Fig. 12**\n\n**Fig. 13**\n\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n\n### [Recent Versions and Applications of Sparrow Search Algorithm](https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11831-023-09887-z?fromPaywallRec=true)\n\nArticle07 February 2023\n\n### [Numerical optimization and feed-forward neural networks training using an improved optimization algorithm: multiple leader salp swarm algorithm](https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12065-019-00269-8?fromPaywallRec=true)\n\nArticle31 July 2019\n\n### [Improved Sparrow Search Algorithm for Test Redundancy Reduction](https://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-981-97-3847-2_4?fromPaywallRec=true)\n\nChapter\u00a9 2024\n\n### Explore related subjects\n\nDiscover the latest articles, books and news in related subjects, suggested using machine learning.\n\n- [Algorithms](https://link.springer.com/subjects/algorithms)\n- [Computational Intelligence](https://link.springer.com/subjects/computational-intelligence)\n- [Computer Science](https://link.springer.com/subjects/computer-science)\n- [Genome assembly algorithms](https://link.springer.com/subjects/genome-assembly-algorithms)\n- [Learning algorithms](https://link.springer.com/subjects/learning-algorithms)\n- [Optimization](https://link.springer.com/subjects/optimization)\n\n## References\n\n001.
