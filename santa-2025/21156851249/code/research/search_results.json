Kuperberg ~ artd W. Kuperberg 2 \nDepartment of Mathematics, University of California at Berkeley, \nBerkeley, CA 94720, USA \n2 Division of Mathematics, Auburn University, Auburn, AL 36849, USA \nAbstract. Mahler [7] and Fejes T6th [2] proved that every centrally symmetric \nconvex plane body K admits a packing in the plane by congruent copies of K with \ndensity at least x/3/2. In this paper we extend this result to all, not necessarily \nsymmetric, convex plane bodies. The methods of Mahler and Fejes T6th are construc\u0002tive and produce lattice packings consisting of translates of K. Our method is \nconstructive as well, and it produces double-lattice packings consisting of translates \nof K and translates of -K. The lower bound of x/3/2 for packing densities produced \nhere is an improvement of the bounds obtained previously in [5] and [6]. \n1. Introduction and Preliminaries \nA convex body is a compact convex set with an interior point. A convex body is \nstrictly convex if its boundary contains no line segment. Throughout this paper, \nK will denote an arbitrary convex body in the Euclidean plane E, unless otherwise \nspecifically assumed. If S is a subset of E, v is a vector in E, and r is a real \nnumber, then v + S denotes the set {v + x : x e S}, and rS denotes {rx : x ~ S}. We \nwrite -S instead of (-1)S. The set v+S is called the translate of S by v. The \narea of S will be denoted by ]S], and, since each set considered here will be \neither a convex body or a polygon, the question of measurability need not be \ndiscussed. \nFor any pair of independent vectors u and v in E, the lattice generated by u \nand v is the set of vectors L(u,v)={nu+kv:n and k are integers}. The \nparallelogram spanned by u and v is called a basic parallelogram of the lattice. \nA packing of the plane with copies of K is a family {Ks} of convex bodies \ncongruent to K whose interiors are mutually disjoint. A packing is a lattice packing \nif all of its members are translates of each other and the vectors of the translations \n390 G. Kuperberg and W. Kuperberg \nFig. 1. Lattice packing. \nform a lattice (see Fig. 1). A packing ~ is called a double-lattice packing if ~ is \nthe union of two lattice packings ~o and ~ such that the 180 \u00b0 rotation about \nsome point interchanges ~o and ~1 (see Fig. 2). Obviously, the lattice of \ntranslations of ~o is the same as that of ~. \nEach packing is assigned a real number in the interval [0, 1], called the density \nof the packing, which is, intuitively speaking, the percentage fraction of the plane \noccupied by the copies of K. A general definition of the density of a packing \ninvolves the notion of limit and requires a detailed investigation of its existence \nand uniqueness (see Chapter III, Section 1 of [4]). However, for lattice packings \nand for double-lattice packings, the density is easily defined using the area of a \nbasic parallelogram of the underlying lattice of translations. If ~ is a lattice \npacking with copies of K, and if p is a basic parallelogram of the lattice of \ntranslations of ~, then the density of ~ equals JKJ/Jp[. Similarly, if ~ = ~oW ~1 \nis a double-lattice packing with copies of K, and if p is a basic parallelogram \nfor the lattice of translations of each of ~o and ~t, then the density of ~ is 21K [/[p[. \nNote that the concepts of double-lattice packing and its density are affine\u0002invariant, just as for lattice packings (see p. 26 of [10]). Specifically, let ~ be a \nFig. 2. Double-lattice packing. \nDouble-Lattice Packings of Convex Bodies in the Plane 391 \nFig. 3. Extensive parallelogram; a >- dr~2, b >- d2/2. \ndouble-lattice packing of the plane with copies of K and let A be an affine \ntransformation of the plane. Then A(~) is a double-lattice packing of the plane \nwith copies of A(K) and the density of A(~) is the same as that of ~. \nA chord of K is a segment whose endpoints lie on the boundary of K. A chord \nof K is a diameter of K if it is at least as long as any chord parallel to it. If v \nis a unit vector, the length of K in the direction of v is the length of the diameter \nof K parallel to v. A polygon is inscribed in K if each of its vertices lies on the \nboundary of K. A parallelogram inscribed in K is extensive if the length of each \nof its sides is at least one-half of the length of K in the direction of the side (see \nFig. 3). Notice that extensive parallelograms are affine-invariant, i.e., if q is an \nextensive parallelogram inscribed in K and if A is an affine transformation of \nthe plane, then A(q) is an extensive parallelogram inscribed in A(K). \n2. Double-Lattice Packings Generated by Extensive Parallelograms \nAssume that q is an extensive parallelogram inscribed in K, place the origin at \none of the vertices of q, and let u and v be the vectors spanning q. For every \npair of integers i, j, and for e=O, 1, let K~(i,j)=2(iu+jv)+(-1)~K. Observe \nthat the family ~ = {K~(i,j)} is a double-lattice packing of the plane with copies \nof K, namely ~= ~o u ~1, where ~o = {K\u00b0(i,j)} and ~1 = {K l(i,j)} (see Fig. 4). \nThe lattice of translations is generated by 2u and 2v, its basic parallelogram is \np =2q, and the density of ~ equals 21Kt/[pl = tK[/2Iqt. We say that the double\u0002lattice packing is generated by the extensive parallelogram q. \nFig. 4. Double-lattice packing generated by an extensive parallelogram. \n392 G. Kuperberg and W. Kuperberg \nFig. 5. A row of translates of K. \nAmong all double-lattice packings of the plane with copies of K there exists \none of maximum density. This can be easily shown using a compactness-type \nargument. In this section we show how to construct such a packing. \nTheorem 1. If K is strictly convex, and if ~ is a maximum density double-lattice \npacking of the plane with copies of K, then ~ is generated by a minimum area \nextensive parallelogram inscribed in K. \nProof. Let Ko E ~. Obviously, K0 touches another member of ~. \nCase L Ko touches a translate of Ko, call it K~. Let u be the vector of the \ntranslation from Ko to K~. Since u belongs to the lattice of translations of ~, \nthere is in ~ a \"row\" Ro .... K_2u K_~ w Kou K~ u K2- \u2022 \u2022 of translates of Ko \nin which Ki+l = u + Ki (see Fig. 5). It follows that ~ is the union of a sequence \nof nonoverlapping rows {Rj} such that every other row is a translate of Ro and \neach of the remaining rows is a translate of -Ro. Since ~ is of maximum density, \ntwo neighboring rows are as close to each other as is possible. This implies that \nK0 touches two copies of K in each of the two rows neighboring Ro. Each of \nthese four copies of K is a translate of -Ko, and it is easy to notice that the \npoints at which they touch K0 are vertices of a parallelogram q inscribed in/Co. \nThis parallelogram is extensive, and it generates the packing ~. \nCase IL Ko does not touch any translate of itself in ~. In this case, Ko touches \nat least two translates of -Ko, say K_~ and K~. The vector of the translation \nfrom K_~ to K~ belongs to the lattice of ~ and it produces an \"alternating \nrow\" \u2022 - \u2022 K_2u K_t u Kow K~ u K 2 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 in which each K2~ is a translate of Ko \nand each K2i+i is a translate of -Ko (see Fig. 6). Now the entire packing \nconsists of translates of that one alternating row. In a similar fashion as in \nCase I we conclude that Ko touches four translates of -Ko, and, again, we find \nthe extensive parallelogram q inscribed in Ko which generates ~. \nSince the density of ~ depends only on the area of q, and since that density \nis maximum, the area of q is minimum among all extensive parallelograms \nFig. 6. An alternating row. \nDouble-Lattice Packings of Convex Bodies in the Plane 393 \ninscribed in Ko, and the proof is complete. However, it can be noticed now that \nthe minimality of the area of q implies that the length of one of the sides of q \nactually equals one-half of the length of Ko in the dir...",

      "text": "The local optimality of the double lattice packing\nYoav Kallus\u2217 and W\u00a8oden Kusner\u2020\nSeptember 19, 2018\nAbstract\nThis paper introduces a technique for proving the local optimality of packing con\u0002figurations. Applying this technique to a general convex polygon, we prove that the\nconstruction of the optimal double lattice packing by Kuperberg and Kuperberg is also\nlocally optimal in the full space of packings.\n1 Introduction\nThis paper began as an investigation of the optimality of the double lattice packing\nfor pentagons and heptagons. In [KK90], Kuperberg and Kuperberg describe a recipe\nfor finding the double lattice packing of congruent planar convex bodies with maxi\u0002mal density by solving an optimization problem over inscribed parallelograms. This\noptimization problem is usually tractable, and in the case of convex polygons can be\nsolved by an algorithm with running time linear in the number of vertices [Mou91].\nAs examples, Kuperberg and Kuperberg construct the densest double lattice packing\nfor both regular pentagons and regular heptagons and show that these packings have\ndensities of (5\u2212\n\u221a\n5)/3 = 0.92131 . . . and 0.8926 . . . respectively. These are the current\nrecords and possibly the best general packings of the plane by regular pentagons and\nby regular heptagons.\nStarting around the turn of the century, a significant push, both theoretical and\ncomputational, arose to answer some of the most basic yet frustrating questions in\nthe theory of packing problems (for background on packing problems, see [BMP05],\n[CGSS99], [Gro63]). Along with the proof and formal verification of the Kepler con\u0002jecture [HAB+15], a number of other results on sphere packing in higher dimensions\nhave proved illuminating [CE03, Van11, Ven13]. For packings by congruent anisotropic\nbodies, sharp results are limited mostly to the plane, where the best packings of all\ncentrally-symmetric bodies are achieved by lattices [FT50], and a series of sparse results\nin higher dimensions [BK13].\n\u2217Santa Fe Institute, 1399 Hyde Park Road, Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA\n\u2020Graz University of Technology, Institute for Analysis and Computational Number Theory, Steyrergasse\n30/II, 8010 Graz, Austria\n1\narXiv:1509.02241v1 [math.MG] 8 Sep 2015\nAmong general convex bodies, the problem of finding the best packing of regular\npentagons serves as a toy model for harder problems, like finding the best packing of\nregular tetrahedra. However, the pentagon problem is still not a tractable one. Explicit\nupper bounds for the packing density of regular tetrahedra and octahedra are better\nthan the trivial unity upper bound by minuscule margins [GEK11]. A semidefinite\nprogramming (SDP) approach has been suggested by Oliveira and Vallentin to calculate\nimproved upper bounds [dOV13]. Though the SDP method has not yet yielded a\nnontrivial upper bound for packing of tetrahedra, it has been used to obtain an upper\nbound of 0.98103 on the density of regular pentagon packings. There remains a sizable\ngap between the highest density achieved for pentagon packings and this upper bound.\nA long-open problem, still wide open even in the plane, asks for the pessimal convex\nbody for packing, that is, the shape that has the lowest maximum packing density\n[BMP05, BK13, Kal14]. In the class of centrally-symmetric bodies in the plane, it is\nReinhardt [Rei33] who conjectured that a smoothed octagon is the minimizer. In the\nclass of general convex bodies in the plane, it is conjectured to be the regular heptagon\n[Kal15]. However, even though the maximum-density double lattice is conjectured to\nachieve the maximum packing density for the regular heptagon, no sharp upper bound\nhas been proved.\nThe regular pentagon and heptagon are cases of special interest, and we initially\nsought out to investigate whether their optimal double-lattice packing can be shown\nto be also optimal among a broader class of packings. We were able to show that\nthese packings are optimal at least in some neighborhood in the space of all packings.\nFurthermore, we discovered that our method can be generalized to all convex polygons.\nWe demonstrate that, while double lattices are in general not globally optimal, they\nare always at least locally optimal.\nTheorem. If a double lattice packing is an isolated local maximum for density among\ndouble lattices and is not one of a two exceptional cases, then it is a local maximum\nfor density among all packings.\nThe precise meanings of the terms used will be elucidated in the rest of the paper.\n2 Theoretical Preparations\n2.1 Local Optimality\nWe will look at packings of congruent copies of a body K. That is, every element of\nthe packing is given by \u03be(K), where \u03be \u2208 E(n) is an isometry of Euclidean space. It\nwill be convenient to assume that the reference body K is situated so that its interior\ncontains the origin. The isometry group E(n) of R\nn can be considered as a subgroup\nof SLn+1(R) that preserves the plane (x1, . . . , xn, 1) \u2208 R\nn+1. This identification gives\nus the Frobenius norm N(\u03be) = k\u03be \u2212 Idk for \u03be \u2208 E(n). Some useful inequalities for this\n2\nnorm that we will use are\nN(\u03be\n\u22121\n) \u2264 k\u03be\n\u22121\nkN(\u03be)\nN(\u03be\u03be0) \u2264 N(\u03be) + N(\u03be\n0\n) + N(\u03be)N(\u03be\n0\n)\nN(\u03c8\u03be\u03c8\u22121) \u2264 k\u03c8kk\u03c8\n\u22121\nkN(\u03be)\nk\u03be(0)k \u2264 N(\u03be) \u2264 k\u03be(0)k + 2n\n1/2\n.\n(1)\nDefinition 2.1.

We say \u039e is a (r, R)-set if the point set\n{\u03be(0) : \u03be \u2208 \u039e} has a packing radius at least r and a covering radius at most R.\nDefinition 2.2. Let K be a compact set with interior. We say that \u039e is admissible\nfor K if the interiors of \u03be(K) and \u03be\n0\n(K) are disjoint for any two distinct isometries\n\u03be, \u03be0 \u2208 \u039e. We say furthermore that \u039e is saturated if there is no \u03be \u2208 E(n) \\ \u039e such that\n\u039e \u222a {\u03be} is again admissible.\nThere are r(K) and R(K) such that when \u039e is admissible and saturated, then \u039e is\na (r(K), R(K))-set. As a consequence, such sets are countable.\nDefinition 2.3. Given two (r\n0\n, R0)-sets \u039e and \u039e\n0 of isometries, we define the premetric\n\u03b4R(\u039e, \u039e\n0\n) = inf\nbij.\nsup{N(\u03be\n\u22121\u03c8(\u03c80\n)\n\u22121\n\u03be\n0\n) :\n\u03be, \u03c8 \u2208 \u039e such that k\u03be(0) \u2212 \u03c8(0)k \u2264 2R or k\u03be\n0\n(0) \u2212 \u03c8\n0\n(0)k \u2264 2R}.\n(3)\nThe infimum is over all bijections (\u00b7)\n0\n: \u039e \u2192 \u039e\n0\n.\nWhen R \u2265 R0, \u03b4R(\u039e, \u039e\n0\n) = 0 if and only if \u03be = \u03c8\u03be0for some \u03c8 \u2208 E(n) and some\nbijection. Consider a body K. When R \u2265 R(K), \u03b4R(\u039e, \u039e\n0\n) induces a metric on the\nspace of admissible (r, R)-sets up to overall isometry, which includes the saturated sets\nas a subset.\nDefinition 2.4. We say an admissible and saturated set \u039e is strongly extreme for\nK if there is R > 0 and \u000f > 0, such that whenever \u03b4R(\u039e, \u039e\n0\n) < \u000f, then either \u039e\n0\nis\ninadmissible or d(\u039e0\n) \u2265 d(\u039e).\nWe stop to discuss why we define the topology in the space of packing arrangements\nin the way that we do. A naive choice of topology is the one given by the metric\n\u03b4H(\u039e, \u039e\n0\n) = inf\nbij.,\u03c8\u2208E(n)\nsup\n\u03be\u2208\u039e\nN(\u03be\n\u22121\u03c8\u03be0\n), (4)\nwhich we call the Hausdorff metric. However, under the Hausdorff topology the mean\nvolume is locally constant, and any packing is trivially locally optimal. For the topology\nto allow the mean volume to vary locally, it must allow elements that are increasingly far\n3\nFigure 1: Sample of the packing arrangement of cylinders with screws and screw holes\ndescribed in the text. The arrangement can be condensed, but in a way that is not\ncontinuous in the topology given by \u03b4R.\napart to move by the action of increasingly different isometries. One metric satisfying\nthis criterion, similar to the one used in Ref. [Kup00], is\ninf\nbij.,\u03c8\u2208E(n)\nsup\n\u03be\u2208\u039e\nmin(N(\u03be\n\u22121\u03c8\u03be0\n), 1/ min(k\u03be(0)k, k\u03be\n0\n(0)k)).

The feasible solution region is contained in the set of pairs of points of the _\u03a6_-function 0-level surface of the polygon. The region is partitioned into a finite number of subregions corresponding to pairs of linear segments of the _\u03a6_-function 0-level surface. The frontiers of the subregions are generated by the conditions of non-overlapping of polygons. Only four such conditions imply non-overlapping of each pair of polygons in a lattice packing. The solution can be attained only in a finite number of points on the frontiers of these subregions. Hence, it is possible to use an organized sorting of such points with discarding of subregions whose objective function upper bound is lower than the record.\n\n## Introduction\n\nIt is necessary to find such a lattice 6, 22, 10 packing of congruent similarly oriented non-overlapping non-convex bounded polygons in the plane so that the density of packing \\[22\\] of the plane with these polygons be the greatest.\n\nThe problems of lattice packing of geometric objects were considered in the works of Refs. 20, 6, 22, 23, 27, 7, 9. Packings being exact coverings and their connection with Fyodorov's crystallographic groups 10, 11 were investigated in the works of Ref. \\[12\\]. Optimization problems of regular (single-row, multirow and lattice \\[22\\]) packing of geometric objects were investigated in the works of Refs. 24, 27, 23, 7, 9. For convex polygons the optimal lattice packing problem was investigated in Ref. \\[21\\]. The lower bounds for double lattice packings of centrally symmetric convex bodies were obtained by Kuperberg and Kuperberg \\[16\\].\n\nThe concept of _\u03a6_-functions \\[28\\] made it possible to represent various cutting and packing problems in terms of mathematical programming. _\u03a6_-function is a function on the set of placement parameters of objects positive when the objects are non-overlapping and negative if their interiorities intersect. 0-level surface of the _\u03a6_-function is the hodograph of the dense placement function \\[25\\] or the frontier of the non-fit polygon \\[19\\].\n\nIn the frames of the typology of cutting and packing problems proposed by Dyckhoff \\[4\\] our problem may be classified as two-dimensional \\`Beladeproblem' with one object (infinite plane) and congruent items (polygons) (abbreviation 2/B/O/C).\n\nThe approach adopted in this work for solving the problem in consideration is based on the use of the _\u03a6_-function properties \\[28\\] as well as on the concept of decomposition of the problem proposed in Refs. 7, 9 and on the properties of lattice packings investigated in Refs. 7, 9.\n\nWe give here proofs of the results justifying the approach proposed in Refs. 7, 9, select the set of pairs of the _\u03a6_-function 0-level surface vertices on which extremum can be attained. Algorithmic realization involves treating singularity cases and estimations reducing the region of feasible solutions.\n\nMethods of construction of 0-level surface of the _\u03a6_-function proposed in Refs. 14, 17, 1, 19 were used when obtaining optimal lattice packings.\n\nIn the present paper we describe in Section 2some properties of _\u03a6_-function and its 0-level surface used for formalization of conditions of mutual non-overlapping of polygons.\n\nIn Section 3some properties of lattices used when simplifying the mathematical model of the problem are described.\n\nIn Section 4the mathematical model of the problem is formulated. The number of conditions describing the region of feasible solutions is reduced by means of applying some properties of densest lattice packings. Namely, it is shown that for finding a densest lattice packing only lattice packings in which a polygon touches two ones obtained by translations by the basis lattice vectors may be taken into account. It is also shown that when a lattice packing is dense all the conditions of mutual non-overlapping are implied by only four ones written for the combinations _a_ 1, _a_ 2, _a_ 1+ _a_ 2, \u2212 _a_ 1+ _a_ 2 of basis lattice vectors _a_ 1 and _a_ 2. Thus, the ends of basis lattice vectors _a_ 1 and _a_ 2 lie on the piecewise linear _\u03a6_-function 0-level surface and satisfy a structure \\[18\\] of linear equations.\n\nIn Section 5the feasible solution region is decomposed into subsets represented parametrically as subsets of \\[0,1\\]\u00d7\\[0,1\\] with a piecewise linear frontier. The objective function in our problem has no extrema in the interiors of such subregions. Since each segment of their frontier has a unique extremum a sorting of such extrema allows to solve the problem.\n\n## Section snippets\n\n## Formalization of conditions of mutual non-overlapping of polygons\n\nIn order to construct a mathematical model of the problem it is necessary to present the objective function and the constraints describing the region of feasible solutions in the analytical form. The conditions of mutual non-overlapping of the polygons are such constraints.\n\nWe designate the interior of _S_ as intS, the closure of _S_ as clS and the frontier of _S_ as frS.\n\nLet there be a polygon _S_ _i_. Its position in _R_ 2 is well known to be fully characterized by three parameters _x_ _i_, _y_ _i_, _\u03b8_ _i_ where ( _x_ _i_, _y_ _i_)= _v_ _i_\n\n## Lattices and lattice packing\n\nIf _a_ 1, _a_ 2\u2208 _R_ 2 are linearly independent, a set of vectors \\[22\\]r=na1+ma2,n,m\u2208Z,is called a lattice with the basis _a_ 1, _a_ 2 and is denoted by _L_ = _\u039b_( _a_ 1, _a_ 2) where Z={0,\u00b11,\u00b12,\u2026} is the set of integers, _\u039b_ is an operator mapping a set of pairs of vectors onto a set of families of the form (6)....",
