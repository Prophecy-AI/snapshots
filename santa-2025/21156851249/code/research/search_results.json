Decide whether rotations are allowed; store each polygon as a list of vertices and an orientation flag.  \n   *(covers the problem statement used in packing\u2011problem literature)*\u202f([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packing_problems))\n\n2. **Create a quick feasible layout** \u2013 sort the polygons by a size metric (height or bounding\u2011box area) and place them with a simple shelf\u2011or\u2011grid algorithm (the \u201cheight\u2011sorted shelf packing\u201d that improves the classic Alt\u202fet\u202fal. approach).

We also want to thank Dominik Krupke for providing a\nhelpful official validator for solutions.\n1 Introduction\nThe recent CG:SHOP 2024 Challenge introduced a variant of irregular packing problems\nknown as the Maximum Polygon Packing (MPP) problem. The MPP problem involves a\nconvex polygonal container C and a polygon set P = {p1, p2, ..., pN }, where polygon piis\nassociated with a value vi. It seeks for a non-overlapping packing with the maximum total\nvalue. The challenge presents a total of 180 instances whose number of polygons ranges from\n28 to 50,000. The official document [4] gives a detailed description of the challenge.\nOur proposed algorithm employs a general process to solve these instances indiscriminately,\nand the overall framework is presented in Figure 1. We first partition a large-scale problem\ninto multiple small-scale subproblems (Section 2) and then solve each subproblem using\nupper-level polygon ordering (Section 3.1) and lower-level packing optimization techniques\n(Section 3.2). Section 4 presents our experimental results, followed by conclusions.\n1 Corresponding author: Zhouxing Su\n\u00a9 Canhui Luo, Zhouxing Su, and Zhipeng L\u00fc;\nlicensed under Creative Commons License CC-BY 4.0\n40th International Symposium on Computational Geometry (SoCG 2024).\nEditors: Wolfgang Mulzer and Jeff M.

It involves two components: partitioning the container C into\nmultiple regions and assigning polygons to each region.\n2.1 Container Partitioning\nThe container partitioning process consists of two steps, as shown in Figure 2. Initially, we\narrange two-dimensional square grids starting from the bottom-left corner of the bounding\nbox until the entire container is covered. The subregions formed by the intersection of the\ncontainer with all the grids constitute its partition C = C1 \u222a C2 \u222a ... \u222a Cm. Subsequently,\nwe merge the small subregions with adjacent grids, which are difficult to be used effectively.\nThe grid is dimensioned to keep the scale of each subproblem at approximately 300 polygons,\nmaking a trade-off between effectiveness and efficiency of lower-level packing optimization.\n2.2 Polygon Assignment\nWe adopt a simple approach of randomly assigning polygons to each subregion. Specifically, for\neach subregion Ci, we randomly select a polygon pj from P until\nP\nj\narea(pj )\narea(Ci) \u2265\nPN\ni=0\narea(pi)\narea(C)\n.\nThe advantage of random assignment lies in ensuring that the overall characteristics of each\nsubproblem align with the original problem.\nC.

We repeatedly select one remaining polygon with the\nhighest priority (ties are broken by value) and try to insert it into the current solution. If the\ninsertion with lower-level packing optimization fails, we skip the current polygon and turn to\nthe next one. For the majority of instances, the priority is defined as the value-to-area ratio\nof a polygon (we also call it unit value). Polygons with higher unit values are prioritized\nfor putting in the container, which is called the Unit Value First (UVF) strategy. For\nsmall-scale instances (N < 100), we employ the \u03b1\u03b2-random strategy. It randomly selects\n\u03b1% and \u03b2% of the polygons and reassigns their UVF-based priority to the highest and the\nlowest, respectively. These instances are run for multiple times to ensure comprehensive\noptimization, with \u03b1 and \u03b2 set to 10 in our implementation.\n3.2 Lower-Level Packing Optimization\nThe position of a polygon can be represented by the coordinates l = (x, y) of a reference point,\nsuch as the bottom-left corner of the boundary. Then, the translation of a polygon can be\nrepresented by a vector pointing from its original position to its new position. Given a feasible\npacking S and a polygon p to be placed, it is impossible to find a non-overlapping position\nfor p without moving other polygons in most cases. This section introduces the algorithm for\neliminating overlaps for an invalid packing, which involves solving an unconstrained nonlinear\nproblem and heuristic polygon movement.\nS o C G 2 0 2 4\n86:4 A General Heuristic Approach for Maximum Polygon Packing\n3.2.1 Overlap Minimization\nTo determine the appropriate translation for the polygons, we utilized the no-fit polygon\n(NFP) and inner-fit polygon (IFP), which are fundamental in algorithmic approaches to\ngeometric design and optimization challenges. For a fixed polygon pi and a movable polygon\npj , NFP(pi, pj ) describes their non-overlapping positions with boundaries in contact precisely,\nwhich can be utilized to determine the minimum translation for pj to avoid overlap. Similarly,\nIFP(pi, pj ) is employed to determine the minimum translation to place pj inside pi. Figure 3\nillustrates the polygon translations determined using NFP (left) and IFP (right). The readers\nmay refer to Burke et al. [2] for a more detailed description.\nFor a packing S, based on NFP and IFP, we define the overlap between polygons pi\nand pj as fij (S), representing the minimum translation to separate them, and f0i(S) as the\nminimum translation for moving pi to fit into the container. Subsequently, we employ the\nseparation algorithm proposed by Imamichi et al. [7] to minimize the overlap, which involves\nsolving an unconstrained nonlinear programming problem as follows:\nmin\nS\nF(S) = X\n0\u2264i<j\u2264N\nf\n2\nij (S) (1)\nThe model relaxes the non-overlapping constraint but introduces repulsion forces between\nany two overlapped polygons. We use the classic L-BFGS (limited memory BFGS) method\nto solve this problem. It makes the packing S converge to a local optimum but strongly\ndepends on the initial layout. ...",

The feasible solution region is contained in the set of pairs of points of the _\u03a6_-function 0-level surface of the polygon. The region is partitioned into a finite number of subregions corresponding to pairs of linear segments of the _\u03a6_-function 0-level surface. The frontiers of the subregions are generated by the conditions of non-overlapping of polygons. Only four such conditions imply non-overlapping of each pair of polygons in a lattice packing. The solution can be attained only in a finite number of points on the frontiers of these subregions. Hence, it is possible to use an organized sorting of such points with discarding of subregions whose objective function upper bound is lower than the record.\n\n## Introduction\n\nIt is necessary to find such a lattice 6, 22, 10 packing of congruent similarly oriented non-overlapping non-convex bounded polygons in the plane so that the density of packing \\[22\\] of the plane with these polygons be the greatest.\n\nThe problems of lattice packing of geometric objects were considered in the works of Refs. 20, 6, 22, 23, 27, 7, 9. Packings being exact coverings and their connection with Fyodorov's crystallographic groups 10, 11 were investigated in the works of Ref. \\[12\\]. Optimization problems of regular (single-row, multirow and lattice \\[22\\]) packing of geometric objects were investigated in the works of Refs. 24, 27, 23, 7, 9. For convex polygons the optimal lattice packing problem was investigated in Ref. \\[21\\]. The lower bounds for double lattice packings of centrally symmetric convex bodies were obtained by Kuperberg and Kuperberg \\[16\\].\n\nThe concept of _\u03a6_-functions \\[28\\] made it possible to represent various cutting and packing problems in terms of mathematical programming. _\u03a6_-function is a function on the set of placement parameters of objects positive when the objects are non-overlapping and negative if their interiorities intersect. 0-level surface of the _\u03a6_-function is the hodograph of the dense placement function \\[25\\] or the frontier of the non-fit polygon \\[19\\].\n\nIn the frames of the typology of cutting and packing problems proposed by Dyckhoff \\[4\\] our problem may be classified as two-dimensional \\`Beladeproblem' with one object (infinite plane) and congruent items (polygons) (abbreviation 2/B/O/C).\n\nThe approach adopted in this work for solving the problem in consideration is based on the use of the _\u03a6_-function properties \\[28\\] as well as on the concept of decomposition of the problem proposed in Refs. 7, 9 and on the properties of lattice packings investigated in Refs. 7, 9.\n\nWe give here proofs of the results justifying the approach proposed in Refs. 7, 9, select the set of pairs of the _\u03a6_-function 0-level surface vertices on which extremum can be attained. Algorithmic realization involves treating singularity cases and estimations reducing the region of feasible solutions.\n\nMethods of construction of 0-level surface of the _\u03a6_-function proposed in Refs. 14, 17, 1, 19 were used when obtaining optimal lattice packings.\n\nIn the present paper we describe in Section 2some properties of _\u03a6_-function and its 0-level surface used for formalization of conditions of mutual non-overlapping of polygons.\n\nIn Section 3some properties of lattices used when simplifying the mathematical model of the problem are described.\n\nIn Section 4the mathematical model of the problem is formulated. The number of conditions describing the region of feasible solutions is reduced by means of applying some properties of densest lattice packings. Namely, it is shown that for finding a densest lattice packing only lattice packings in which a polygon touches two ones obtained by translations by the basis lattice vectors may be taken into account. It is also shown that when a lattice packing is dense all the conditions of mutual non-overlapping are implied by only four ones written for the combinations _a_ 1, _a_ 2, _a_ 1+ _a_ 2, \u2212 _a_ 1+ _a_ 2 of basis lattice vectors _a_ 1 and _a_ 2. Thus, the ends of basis lattice vectors _a_ 1 and _a_ 2 lie on the piecewise linear _\u03a6_-function 0-level surface and satisfy a structure \\[18\\] of linear equations.\n\nIn Section 5the feasible solution region is decomposed into subsets represented parametrically as subsets of \\[0,1\\]\u00d7\\[0,1\\] with a piecewise linear frontier. The objective function in our problem has no extrema in the interiors of such subregions. Since each segment of their frontier has a unique extremum a sorting of such extrema allows to solve the problem.\n\n## Section snippets\n\n## Formalization of conditions of mutual non-overlapping of polygons\n\nIn order to construct a mathematical model of the problem it is necessary to present the objective function and the constraints describing the region of feasible solutions in the analytical form. The conditions of mutual non-overlapping of the polygons are such constraints.\n\nWe designate the interior of _S_ as intS, the closure of _S_ as clS and the frontier of _S_ as frS.\n\nLet there be a polygon _S_ _i_. Its position in _R_ 2 is well known to be fully characterized by three parameters _x_ _i_, _y_ _i_, _\u03b8_ _i_ where ( _x_ _i_, _y_ _i_)= _v_ _i_\n\n## Lattices and lattice packing\n\nIf _a_ 1, _a_ 2\u2208 _R_ 2 are linearly independent, a set of vectors \\[22\\]r=na1+ma2,n,m\u2208Z,is called a lattice with the basis _a_ 1, _a_ 2 and is denoted by _L_ = _\u039b_( _a_ 1, _a_ 2) where Z={0,\u00b11,\u00b12,\u2026} is the set of integers, _\u039b_ is an operator mapping a set of pairs of vectors onto a set of families of the form (6)....",

A link will be provided\nin a future version of this document.\narXiv:2308.08523v1 [cs.CG] 16 Aug 2023\n2 Improved Approximations for Translational Packing of Convex Polygons\n1 Introduction\nMany real-life situations require us to make decisions about optimally packing a collection\nof objects into a specific container. One particular category of these packing problems is\ntwo-dimensional packing, which is encountered in everyday scenarios like arranging items\non a shelf and in industrial applications such as cutting cookies from rolled-out dough\nor manufacturing sets of tiles from standard-sized panels made of wood, glass, or metal.\nAnother intriguing example involves cutting fabric pieces for clothing production. In this\ncase, the pieces often cannot be rotated freely, as they must adhere to a desired pattern\nin the final product, which is tailored of multiple elements. The widespread applicability\nof two-dimensional packing problems has led to a surge of interest in designing efficient\nalgorithms to address them. In this paper, we follow the line of research and study the\nproblem of packing convex polygons without rotations in various settings depending on the\ntype of containers used.\nPast research focusing on theoretical considerations of two-dimensional packings mainly\nconcentrates on the scenario when all objects are axis-parallel rectangles. In this paper, we\nwill discuss packing without rotations, in which only translations are permitted. There are\ntwo main classes of the problem depending on whether the size of the container is fixed and\nwe want to minimize the number of containers used or whether we want to minimize the\ncontainer\u2019s size with respect to some objective function.\nA seminal example of the first class is the Geometric Bin Packing problem in which\na number of unit size squared bins to pack is to be minimized. The problem is arguably\nthe most natural generalization of the regular (1D) Bin Packing to two dimensions, and\nits absolute approximability has been fully understood. Unless P = N P, the best possible\nefficient constant factor approximation is 2 [15], and such an algorithm is known [10].\nIn the second class, there are several variants to be considered. An example is the\nStrip Packing Problem which is concerned with packing objects into a strip of width\n1 and infinite height in such a way that the maximum of all the heights of the placed\nobjects is minimized. Like Geometric Bin Packing, Strip Packing generalizes (1D)\nBin Packing. The best known efficient constant factor approximation for Strip Packing\nhas approximation factor (5/3 + \u03f5) [9]. It is known that there can not exist a polynomial\ntime algorithm with an approximation ratio of (3/2 \u2212 \u03f5) for any \u03f5 > 0 unless P = N P, which\nfollows directly from the approximation hardness of (1D) Bin Packing. Both classes of\nproblems have been also considered in the asymptotic setting, see e.g. [11, 5, 12].\nIn younger time, there was also an increase of interest in cases where the objects in\nquestion are general convex polygons. Alt, de Berg and Knauer [2, 3] considered the problem\nof packing an instance consisting of a number of convex polygons of the form p \u2282 [0, 1]2into\na minimum area axis-parallel rectangular container. We refer to this problem as Polygon\nArea Minimization throughout this paper. In the special case where the instance consists\nof rectangles only, the problem is known to admit a PTAS [4]. They proved the existence of\nthe following efficient algorithm:\nA 23.78-approximation for Polygon Area Minimization.\nRecently, Aamand, Abrahamsen, Beretta and Kleist [1] showed that the algorithm of Alt,\nde Berg and Knauer can be leveraged to obtain also efficient approximation algorithms of\nfurther problems:\nA 7-approximation for Polygon Perimeter Minimization.\nA 51-approximation for Polygon Strip Packing.\nAn 11-approximation for Polygon Bin Packing for polygons with diameter at most 1\n10 .\nA. Kurpisz and S. Suter 3\n1.1 Our results\nThe results of Alt, de Berg and Knauer [2, 3] and Aamand et al. [1] are heavily based on\nso-called shelf packing algorithms. In shelf packing algorithms, the objects are first placed\non the shelves, possibly ordered by height, which are later stacked on one another to build\na final solution. Compared to axis-parallel rectangles, the main challenge in designing an\napproximation algorithm for polygon packing problems is that objects cannot be sorted by\nheight and orientation simultaneously. As a result, the algorithm and its analysis in [2, 3]\nhave such a large approximation guarantee. In this paper, we provide new insight into how\nshelf packing algorithms should be applied to polygon packing problems. We introduce a\nsequence of transformations of the objects that allow us first to sort them by height and later\nby orientation to build a solution of a much better approximation guarantee. More precisely,\nwe design polynomial-time algorithms with the following factors:\nA 9.45-approximation for Polygon Area Minimization.\nUsing this algorithm as a subroutine, we build upon the methods from Aamand et al. [1] to\nobtain the following efficient approximation algorithms:\nA (3.75 + \u03f5)-approximation for Polygon Perimeter Minimization.\nA 21.89-approximation for Polygon Strip Packing.\nA 5.09-approximation for Polygon Bin Packing for polygons which have their diameter\nbounded by 1\n10 .\nThe results are proved in Sections 4, 5, 6, and 7 respectively. Furthermore, in Section 8\nwe show the following results, which make progress towards solving an open question of a\nO(1)-approximation algorithm for Polygon Bin Packing for arbitrary polygons.\nThere is an efficient O(\n1\n\u03b4\n)-approximation algorithm for Polygon Bin Packing for\ninstances where each polygon has width or height at most 1 \u2212 \u03b4.\nThere is an efficient O(1)-approximation algorithm for Polygon Bin Packing for\ninstances with the property that all polygons share a spine (up to translation) with height\nat least 3\n4\n.\n2 Preliminaries\nWe start out considerations by recalling a classical and well-known problem in theoretical\ncomputer science, the Bin Packing problem: Given a list of numbers s1, . . . , sn \u2208 (0, 1] \u2229 Q,\nrepresenting the sizes of n objects, the goal is to find the minimum number of bins of size 1,\nso that we can pac...",

Anything that works with distinct shapes should trivially work with identical shapes too. If you have an algorithm that works well for a rectangular boundary, you can try to adapt it for an arbitrary boundary. Modify it so that you can at a flip opre-fill your boundary with some shapes that cannot be moved or deleted (e.g. there's only one way to place them).

To put this in perspective, the (much) simpler case where you're packing the interior of your bounded polygon with non-overlapping disks is already hard, and disks are the simplest possible \"packing shape\" (with any other shape you have to consider orientation as well as size and center location).\n\nIn fact, I think it's an open problem in [computational geometry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_geometry) to determine for an arbitrary integer N and arbitrary bounded polygonal region (in the Euclidean plane), what is the \"optimal\" (in the sense of covering the greatest percentage of the polygon interior) packing of N inscribed non-overlapping disks, where you are free to choose the radius and center location of each disk. I'm sure the \"best\" answer _is_ known for certain special polygonal shapes (like rectangles, circles, and triangles), but for arbitrary shapes your best \"heuristic\" is probably:\n\n1. Start your shape counter at N.\n2. Add the largest \"packing shape\" you can fit completely inside the polygonal boundary without overlapping any other packing shapes.\n3. Decrement your shape counter.\n4. If your shape counter is > 0, go to step 2.\n\nI say \"probably\" because \"largest first\" isn't always the best way to pack things into a confined space. You can dig into that particular flavor of craziness by reading about the [bin packing problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bin_packing_problem) and [knapsack problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem).\n\n**EDIT:** Step 2 by itself is hard. A reasonable strategy would be to pick an arbitrary point on the interior of the polygon as the center and \"inflate\" the disk until it touches either the boundary or another disk (or both), and then \"slide\" the disk while continuing to inflate it so that it remains inside the boundary without overlapping any other disks until it is \"trapped\" - with at least 2 points of contact with the boundary and/or other disks. But it isn't easy to formalize this \"sliding process\". And even if you get the sliding process right, this strategy doesn't guarantee that you'll find the biggest \"inscribable disk\" - your \"locally maximal\" disk could be trapped in a \"lobe\" of the interior which is connected by a narrow \"neck\" of free space to a larger \"lobe\" where a larger disk would fit.\n\n[Share](https://stackoverflow.com/a/7342898)\n\n[Improve this answer](https://stackoverflow.com/posts/7342898/edit)\n\nFollow\n\n[edited Feb 27, 2013 at 20:29](https://stackoverflow.com/posts/7342898/revisions)\n\nanswered Sep 8, 2011 at 3:46\n\n[![Peter's user avatar](https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f031e9e9b7476fc5d3674fe4a9c59ef2?s=64&d=identicon&r=PG)](https://stackoverflow.com/users/227491/peter)\n\n[Peter](https://stackoverflow.com/users/227491/peter) Peter\n\n2,53611 gold badge2323 silver badges3232 bronze badges\n\n[Add a comment](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6864382/packing-arbitrary-polygons-within-an-arbitrary-boundary)\u00a0\\|\n\n3\n\nThanks for the replies, my requirements were such that I was able to further simplify the problem by not having to deal with orientation and I then even further simplified by only really wor...",

A lot of effort has been devoted into solving the famous Square\nPacking Problem, which investigates the minimum side length of a square\ncontainer that can pack n unit squares. This involves the search for the most\noptimal packing for squares. The aim of this research is to investigate an\nopposite idea to the original problem. We delve into the least optimal packing\nof squares, i.e. finding the minimum side length of a square container that\ncan contain all configurations of n unit squares.\nBy considering the idea of a rotating container, we have successfully found\nthe solution to the case of two squares. At the end, by studying the classi\u0002fication of intersections between the configuration and the container, as well\nas harnessing analytical methods, we have found the exact solution to the\ngeneral case of n squares.\n1. Introduction\nSquare packing in a square has been a famous open problem for several decades.\nThe problem studies the optimal packing of unit squares in a larger container\nsquare such that the number of unit squares attains maximum. This problem is\ndifficult and only a few results are found. For instance, the minimal side length of\nthe larger container square containing 10 unit squares is 3 + \u221a\n1\n2 , which is one of\nthe few known exact results. [1]\n40 MOK CHUN HEI, WONG HEI\nFigure 1. smin(10) = 3 + \u221a\n1\n2 .\nOur investigation is induced by twisting the idea of the original problem, which\nseems to find the \u201cmost optimal\u201d packing of the unit squares. Instead, we attempt\nto find the \u201cleast optimal\u201d configuration of the unit squares such that the side\nlength of its square container attains maximum. In this paper, we investigate a\nsquare container that contains all possible configurations given the number of unit\nsquares.\nConsider the following configurations of two unit squares (in gray).\nFigure 2. Minimum side length of the square container = 2.\nFigure 3. Minimum side length of the square container = \u221a5.\nFigure 3 requires a larger square container. Thus, it is a less optimal configu\u0002ration compared to Figure 2. In fact, as we will see in Section 3, Figure 3 is the\nLEAST OPTIMAL SQUARE PACKING IN A SQUARE 41\nleast optimal configuration of two unit squares. This means that any configurations\nof two unit squares can be contained in a square of side length \u221a5. The goal of\nour research is to formulate the notion of a \u201cleast optimal\u201d configuration, rigor\u0002ously prove this fact about configurations of two unit squares, and develop tools to\ngeneralise to configurations of an arbitrary number of unit squares.\n1.1. Problem Definition. In order to define our problem, we now define a unit\nsquare and a configuration.\nDefinition 1.1. A unit square is a set of four points {A, B, C, D} on a two\u0002dimensional plane such that lengths of line segments AB = BC = CD = AD = 1\nand AB \u22a5 BC, BC \u22a5 CD, CD \u22a5 AD and AD \u22a5 AB. The boundary of a\nunit square is the union of line segments AB, BC, CD, AD. The interior of a unit\nsquare is the area bounded by the boundary excluding the boundary.\nDefinition 1.2. For a positive integer n, a set of n unit squares is called an n\u0002configuration if\n\u2022 none of the interior of the squares overlap with each other; and\n\u2022 all the squares are connected to each other, i.e. for every pair of squares\nQ1, Q2, there exists a finite sequence of distinct squares K that starts with\nQ1 and ends with Q2 with adjacent squares in K having a point of inter\u0002section.\nIn the same way the \u201cmost optimal\u201d square packing problem requires the unit\nsquares not to overlap, in the \u201cleast optimal\u201d square packing problem, we restrict\nthe unit squares to be connected since otherwise they can be brought very far away\nfrom each other and the problem is no longer interesting. In the meantime, intu\u0002itively, overlapping squares should result in a smaller square container compared\nto non-overlapping squares. Thus, we define a configuration that is formed by\nconnected and also non-overlapping unit squares.\nNext, we define the bounding rectangle or square, i.e. a container.\nDefinition 1.3. A container C of a configuration \u03bb is a rectangle such that all of\n\u03bb lies in the interior of C or on the boundary of C. Similarly, a square container\nC of a configuration \u03bb is a square such that all of \u03bb lies in the interior of C or on\nthe boundary of C.\nFor the optimal square packing problem, the goal is to find the minimum length\nsmin(n) such that there exists an n-configuration which has a square container\nof side length smin(n). Taking this as an inspiration, we define our least optimal\nsquare packing problem as follows.\nProblem. For any positive integer n \u2265 2, find the minimum length s(n) such that\nany n-configuration can be contained in a square container of side length s(n).\n1.2. Main Results. We begin by exploring properties of the square container of\nconfigurations, which offers great insights into possible proof techniques. Then,\nwe look into the case of 2-configuration by means of computer simulations and\nlogical deductions, which results in s(2) = \u221a5 as stated in Theorem 3.3. After\ntrying several attempts and developing techniques such as classification, analysis\n42 MOK CHUN HEI, WONG HEI\nand rearrangement of geometric figures, we lead into the complete proof, concluding\nthat s(n) = n+\n\u221a5\u22122. The solution is surprisingly simple compared to the thinking\nand proving process.\n1.3. Notation.\nDefinition 1.4. Denote R2 = {(x, y) : x, y \u2208 R} as the two-dimensional rectangu\u0002lar coordinate plane.\nDefinition 1.5. Denote S1 = {(x, y) \u2208 R2 : x2 + y2 = 1} as the unit circle.\nDefinition 1.6. Denote \u039bn be the set of all n-configurations.\nDefinition 1.7. Denote\n\u039b = \n\u221e\nn=2\n\u039bn\nbe the set of n-configurations for all n. An element of \u039b is known simply as a\nconfiguration.\nDefinition 1.8. For a unit vector r\u02c6 \u2208 S1, r\u02c6\u22a5 is the image of r\u02c6 under anticlockwise\n90\u25e6 rotation about the origin.\n2. Square Container\n2.1. Definitions. Let S = {Si} is a finite set of points in R2. As a square container\nis essential in our research, we frequently find the length of a set of points S by\nprojecting S along a unit vector r\u02c6. We denote this quantity dS(r\u02c6).\nDefinition 2.1. Let dij\nS (r\u02c6) where r\u02c6 \u2208 S1 be the length of the line segment connecting\nSi and Sj when projected along r\u02c6 i.e.\ndij\nS (r\u02c6) = |r\u02c6 \u00b7 (Si \u2212 Sj )|.\nDefinition 2.2. Let dS(r\u02c6) where r\u02c6 \u2208 S1 be\ndS(r\u02c6) = max{r\u02c6 \u00b7 P : P \u2208 S} \u2212 min{r\u02c6 \u00b7 P : P \u2208 S} = max i,jdij\nS (r\u02c6).\nLEAST OPTIMAL SQUARE PACKING IN A SQUARE 43\nS\nSi\nSj\nr\u02c6\ndS(r\u02c6)\nFigure 4. Illustration of dS(r\u02c6).\nAs a result, for a square container along the directions r\u02c6 and r\u02c6\u22a5, the minimum\nside length is the greater of dS(r\u02c6) and dS(r\u02c6\u22a5), denoted fS(r\u02c6).\nDefinition 2.3. Let the side length of the square container of S when oriented\nalong unit vector r\u02c6 be\nfS(r\u02c6) = max{dS(r\u02c6), dS(r\u02c6\u22a5)}.\nr\u02c6\nr\u02c6\u22a5\ndS(r\u02c6)\ndS(r\u02c6\u22a5)\nFigure 5. Illustration of fS(r\u02c6). The smallest square container\nalong directions r\u02c6 and r\u02c6\u22a5, shown in dotted line, has side length\nmax{dS(r\u02c6), dS(r\u02c6\u22a5)}.\nDefinition 2.4. The side length of the smallest square container of S is the min\u0002imum value of fS, denoted fmin S :\nfmin S = min{fS(r\u02c6) : r\u02c6 \u2208 S1}.\n44 MOK CHUN HEI, WONG HEI\nNote that each configuration is a set of unit squares, which by definition is a set\nof points. Let us define the notation of d\u03bb, f\u03bb etc. where \u03bb is a configuration.\nDefinition 2.5. For a configuration \u03bb, let T be the set of all vertices of all unit\nsquares in \u03bb. Then dij\n\u03bb (r\u02c6), d\u03bb(r\u02c6), f\u03bb(r\u02c6) and fmin \u03bb are defined the same as dij\nT (r\u02c6),\ndT (r\u02c6), fT (r\u02c6) and fmin T respectively.\nThen our problem can be rephrased as: for a positive integer n \u2265 2, s(n) is\ndefined as the maximum side length of the smallest square container of any n\u0002co...",

This isn't very difficult with the additional assumption that the vertices of the triangle all lie on the circumference (we can smooth the triangles \"together\" to form a triangulation of a (N+2)-gon, and either use Jensen or compactness and further smoothing to show the regular (N+2)-gon is optimal). But in the general case, smoothing seems much more difficult---the triangles can \"block\" each other in much more complicated configurations, which seem hard to classify.\n\n**Edit (8/18/14).** First, a potentially fruitful (and quite nice!) idea from [fedja](https://mathoverflow.net/users/1131/fedja) copied from [AoPS](http://www.artofproblemsolving.com/Forum/viewtopic.php?p=3517455#p3517455), which works for the **semicircle** case (i.e. packing into a semicircle rather than a circle):\n\n> Then \\[in the semicircle case\\] all you would need to do (assuming that the diameter is \\[\u22121,1\\])\n> would be to consider the vertical cross-sections and notice that their\n> length is a piecewise linear function with at most as many \"down\"\n> corners as we have triangles, dominated by \u221a1\u2212x2, so we would\n> have to estimate the area between the axis and a piecewise convex\n> curve with a fixed number of pieces under the circular arc, and\n> everything would become pretty obvious.
