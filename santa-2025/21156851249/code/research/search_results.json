      "text": "The\u202ffractional\u2011translation technique is a packing\u2011by\u2011translation approach that avoids rotating the pieces and instead moves each polygon by small (fractional) shifts until a dense, non\u2011overlapping layout is obtained.  In the academic literature this idea is formalized as \u201ctranslational packing\u201d of convex polygons: the algorithm first applies a sequence of simple transformations that sort the items by a \u201cnatural slope\u2019\u2019 (or by height and orientation) so that they form a fan\u2011like order, and then places them with a shelf\u2011packing routine that repeatedly translates each shape by a fractional amount to fill the gaps left by the previous ones\u202f([export.arxiv.org](https://export.arxiv.org/pdf/2308.08523v1.pdf)).

A link will be provided\nin a future version of this document.\narXiv:2308.08523v1 [cs.CG] 16 Aug 2023\n2 Improved Approximations for Translational Packing of Convex Polygons\n1 Introduction\nMany real-life situations require us to make decisions about optimally packing a collection\nof objects into a specific container. One particular category of these packing problems is\ntwo-dimensional packing, which is encountered in everyday scenarios like arranging items\non a shelf and in industrial applications such as cutting cookies from rolled-out dough\nor manufacturing sets of tiles from standard-sized panels made of wood, glass, or metal.\nAnother intriguing example involves cutting fabric pieces for clothing production. In this\ncase, the pieces often cannot be rotated freely, as they must adhere to a desired pattern\nin the final product, which is tailored of multiple elements. The widespread applicability\nof two-dimensional packing problems has led to a surge of interest in designing efficient\nalgorithms to address them. In this paper, we follow the line of research and study the\nproblem of packing convex polygons without rotations in various settings depending on the\ntype of containers used.\nPast research focusing on theoretical considerations of two-dimensional packings mainly\nconcentrates on the scenario when all objects are axis-parallel rectangles. In this paper, we\nwill discuss packing without rotations, in which only translations are permitted. There are\ntwo main classes of the problem depending on whether the size of the container is fixed and\nwe want to minimize the number of containers used or whether we want to minimize the\ncontainer\u2019s size with respect to some objective function.\nA seminal example of the first class is the Geometric Bin Packing problem in which\na number of unit size squared bins to pack is to be minimized. The problem is arguably\nthe most natural generalization of the regular (1D) Bin Packing to two dimensions, and\nits absolute approximability has been fully understood. Unless P = N P, the best possible\nefficient constant factor approximation is 2 [15], and such an algorithm is known [10].\nIn the second class, there are several variants to be considered. An example is the\nStrip Packing Problem which is concerned with packing objects into a strip of width\n1 and infinite height in such a way that the maximum of all the heights of the placed\nobjects is minimized. Like Geometric Bin Packing, Strip Packing generalizes (1D)\nBin Packing. The best known efficient constant factor approximation for Strip Packing\nhas approximation factor (5/3 + \u03f5) [9]. It is known that there can not exist a polynomial\ntime algorithm with an approximation ratio of (3/2 \u2212 \u03f5) for any \u03f5 > 0 unless P = N P, which\nfollows directly from the approximation hardness of (1D) Bin Packing. Both classes of\nproblems have been also considered in the asymptotic setting, see e.g. [11, 5, 12].\nIn younger time, there was also an increase of interest in cases where the objects in\nquestion are general convex polygons. Alt, de Berg and Knauer [2, 3] considered the problem\nof packing an instance consisting of a number of convex polygons of the form p \u2282 [0, 1]2into\na minimum area axis-parallel rectangular container. We refer to this problem as Polygon\nArea Minimization throughout this paper. In the special case where the instance consists\nof rectangles only, the problem is known to admit a PTAS [4]. They proved the existence of\nthe following efficient algorithm:\nA 23.78-approximation for Polygon Area Minimization.\nRecently, Aamand, Abrahamsen, Beretta and Kleist [1] showed that the algorithm of Alt,\nde Berg and Knauer can be leveraged to obtain also efficient approximation algorithms of\nfurther problems:\nA 7-approximation for Polygon Perimeter Minimization.\nA 51-approximation for Polygon Strip Packing.\nAn 11-approximation for Polygon Bin Packing for polygons with diameter at most 1\n10 .\nA. Kurpisz and S. Suter 3\n1.1 Our results\nThe results of Alt, de Berg and Knauer [2, 3] and Aamand et al. [1] are heavily based on\nso-called shelf packing algorithms. In shelf packing algorithms, the objects are first placed\non the shelves, possibly ordered by height, which are later stacked on one another to build\na final solution. Compared to axis-parallel rectangles, the main challenge in designing an\napproximation algorithm for polygon packing problems is that objects cannot be sorted by\nheight and orientation simultaneously. As a result, the algorithm and its analysis in [2, 3]\nhave such a large approximation guarantee. In this paper, we provide new insight into how\nshelf packing algorithms should be applied to polygon packing problems. We introduce a\nsequence of transformations of the objects that allow us first to sort them by height and later\nby orientation to build a solution of a much better approximation guarantee. More precisely,\nwe design polynomial-time algorithms with the following factors:\nA 9.45-approximation for Polygon Area Minimization.\nUsing this algorithm as a subroutine, we build upon the methods from Aamand et al. [1] to\nobtain the following efficient approximation algorithms:\nA (3.75 + \u03f5)-approximation for Polygon Perimeter Minimization.\nA 21.89-approximation for Polygon Strip Packing.\nA 5.09-approximation for Polygon Bin Packing for polygons which have their diameter\nbounded by 1\n10 .\nThe results are proved in Sections 4, 5, 6, and 7 respectively. Furthermore, in Section 8\nwe show the following results, which make progress towards solving an open question of a\nO(1)-approximation algorithm for Polygon Bin Packing for arbitrary polygons.\nThere is an efficient O(\n1\n\u03b4\n)-approximation algorithm for Polygon Bin Packing for\ninstances where each polygon has width or height at most 1 \u2212 \u03b4.\nThere is an efficient O(1)-approximation algorithm for Polygon Bin Packing for\ninstances with the property that all polygons share a spine (up to translation) with height\nat least 3\n4\n.\n2 Preliminaries\nWe start out considerations by recalling a classical and well-known problem in theoretical\ncomputer science, the Bin Packing problem: Given a list of numbers s1, . . . , sn \u2208 (0, 1] \u2229 Q,\nrepresenting the sizes of n objects, the goal is to find the minimum number of bins of size 1,\nso that we can pac...",

For example, in a scene which was not included in the final cinema edition of\u00a0<em>The Sound of Music</em>, the butler of the von Trapp family was singing the measurements of the children to Maria from the kitchen (in German), and all the while she was cutting out the pieces for the playclothes one by one in the living room.\nThis is in contrast to <em>offline</em> problems, where all the pieces are known in advance.\nProblems related to packing were some of the first for which online algorithms were described and analyzed.\nIndeed, the first use of the terms \u201conline\u201d and \u201coffline\u201d in the context of approximation algorithms was in the early 1970s and used for algorithms for bin-packing problems\u00a0<cite>[<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2112.03791v2#bib.bibx26\">26</a>]</cite>.</p>\n<p>Most existing theoretical research on packing, and all research on online translational packing that we are aware of, is concerned with axis-parallel rectangular pieces.\nIn this paper, we study online translational packing of convex polygons. The pieces arrive one by one and have to be placed irrevocably into a horizontal strip (or into bins, a square, the plane) before the next piece is revealed, and only translations of the pieces are allowed. The aim is to minimize the used space depending on the specific problem at hand, e.g., the used length of the strip, the number of bins, etc.</p>\n<p>We note that these problems have known -competitive algorithms if the arriving pieces are axis-parallel rectangles; see <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2112.03791v2#S1.SS2\"><span>Section</span>\u00a0<span>1.2</span></a> for references. In other words, online algorithms exists which produce solutions that are only a constant factor worse than the offline optimum. If the arriving pieces are convex polygons that may be arbitrarily rotated, the task reduces to\npacking axis-parallel rectangles by first rotating each piece so that a diameter of the piece is horizontal.\nThen the density of the piece in its axis-parallel bounding box is at least , and the algorithm for rectangles can be applied to the bounding box, again leading to -competitive algorithms.\nWe also note that using known results, it is easy to show that the <em>offline</em> versions of the translational versions of these problems have -approximation algorithms; see <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2112.03791v2#Thmtheorem6\"><span>Theorem</s...",

The MPP problem involves a\nconvex polygonal container C and a polygon set P = {p1, p2, ..., pN }, where polygon piis\nassociated with a value vi. It seeks for a non-overlapping packing with the maximum total\nvalue. The challenge presents a total of 180 instances whose number of polygons ranges from\n28 to 50,000. The official document [4] gives a detailed description of the challenge.\nOur proposed algorithm employs a general process to solve these instances indiscriminately,\nand the overall framework is presented in Figure 1. We first partition a large-scale problem\ninto multiple small-scale subproblems (Section 2) and then solve each subproblem using\nupper-level polygon ordering (Section 3.1) and lower-level packing optimization techniques\n(Section 3.2). Section 4 presents our experimental results, followed by conclusions.\n1 Corresponding author: Zhouxing Su\n\u00a9 Canhui Luo, Zhouxing Su, and Zhipeng L\u00fc;\nlicensed under Creative Commons License CC-BY 4.0\n40th International Symposium on Computational Geometry (SoCG 2024).\nEditors: Wolfgang Mulzer and Jeff M.

It involves two components: partitioning the container C into\nmultiple regions and assigning polygons to each region.\n2.1 Container Partitioning\nThe container partitioning process consists of two steps, as shown in Figure 2. Initially, we\narrange two-dimensional square grids starting from the bottom-left corner of the bounding\nbox until the entire container is covered. The subregions formed by the intersection of the\ncontainer with all the grids constitute its partition C = C1 \u222a C2 \u222a ... \u222a Cm. Subsequently,\nwe merge the small subregions with adjacent grids, which are difficult to be used effectively.\nThe grid is dimensioned to keep the scale of each subproblem at approximately 300 polygons,\nmaking a trade-off between effectiveness and efficiency of lower-level packing optimization.\n2.2 Polygon Assignment\nWe adopt a simple approach of randomly assigning polygons to each subregion. Specifically, for\neach subregion Ci, we randomly select a polygon pj from P until\nP\nj\narea(pj )\narea(Ci) \u2265\nPN\ni=0\narea(pi)\narea(C)\n.\nThe advantage of random assignment lies in ensuring that the overall characteristics of each\nsubproblem align with the original problem.\nC.

We repeatedly select one remaining polygon with the\nhighest priority (ties are broken by value) and try to insert it into the current solution. If the\ninsertion with lower-level packing optimization fails, we skip the current polygon and turn to\nthe next one. For the majority of instances, the priority is defined as the value-to-area ratio\nof a polygon (we also call it unit value). Polygons with higher unit values are prioritized\nfor putting in the container, which is called the Unit Value First (UVF) strategy. For\nsmall-scale instances (N < 100), we employ the \u03b1\u03b2-random strategy. It randomly selects\n\u03b1% and \u03b2% of the polygons and reassigns their UVF-based priority to the highest and the\nlowest, respectively. These instances are run for multiple times to ensure comprehensive\noptimization, with \u03b1 and \u03b2 set to 10 in our implementation.\n3.2 Lower-Level Packing Optimization\nThe position of a polygon can be represented by the coordinates l = (x, y) of a reference point,\nsuch as the bottom-left corner of the boundary. Then, the translation of a polygon can be\nrepresented by a vector pointing from its original position to its new position. Given a feasible\npacking S and a polygon p to be placed, it is impossible to find a non-overlapping position\nfor p without moving other polygons in most cases. This section introduces the algorithm for\neliminating overlaps for an invalid packing, which involves solving an unconstrained nonlinear\nproblem and heuristic polygon movement.\nS o C G 2 0 2 4\n86:4 A General Heuristic Approach for Maximum Polygon Packing\n3.2.1 Overlap Minimization\nTo determine the appropriate translation for the polygons, we utilized the no-fit polygon\n(NFP) and inner-fit polygon (IFP), which are fundamental in algorithmic approaches to\ngeometric design and optimization challenges. For a fixed polygon pi and a movable polygon\npj , NFP(pi, pj ) describes their non-overlapping positions with boundaries in contact precisely,\nwhich can be utilized to determine the minimum translation for pj to avoid overlap. Similarly,\nIFP(pi, pj ) is employed to determine the minimum translation to place pj inside pi. Figure 3\nillustrates the polygon translations determined using NFP (left) and IFP (right). The readers\nmay refer to Burke et al. [2] for a more detailed description.\nFor a packing S, based on NFP and IFP, we define the overlap between polygons pi\nand pj as fij (S), representing the minimum translation to separate them, and f0i(S) as the\nminimum translation for moving pi to fit into the container. Subsequently, we employ the\nseparation algorithm proposed by Imamichi et al. [7] to minimize the overlap, which involves\nsolving an unconstrained nonlinear programming problem as follows:\nmin\nS\nF(S) = X\n0\u2264i<j\u2264N\nf\n2\nij (S) (1)\nThe model relaxes the non-overlapping constraint but introduces repulsion forces between\nany two overlapped polygons. We use the classic L-BFGS (limited memory BFGS) method\nto solve this problem. It makes the packing S converge to a local optimum but strongly\ndepends on the initial layout. ...",

The sixth edition in\n2024 considers a 2-dimensional knapsack packing problem. The team Shadoks won first place\nwith the best solution (among the 14 participating teams) to 75 instances out of 180. In this\npaper, we describe the heuristics we used. We start by briefly describing the problem.\nAn input instance consists of a convex polygon called container and a multiset of items.\nEach item is a simple polygon with an associated integer value. The goal is to pack some of\nthe instance items inside the container using integer translations in order to maximize the\nsum of their values. In total, 180 instances have been given, ranging from 28 to 50,000 items.\nThe instances are of several different types according to the shape and values of the items.\nSome instances have mostly convex items, while other instances have many non-convex items\nsuch as polyominoes. In terms of item values, some items have only unit value, some have\nvalues proportional to the area, and other have random values, for example. Some solutions\nare presented in Figure 1 and more details about the challenge are available in the organizers\u2019\nsurvey paper [3].\nOur general strategy consists of finding a good initial solution (using integer programming\nor a greedy heuristic) and subsequently optimizing them with local search. Our strategy\nshares many common elements with the second place [5], but they did not use integer\nprogramming to obtain initial solutions and their optimization phase is more sophisticated\nthan ours. The third place [4] uses an hierarchical grid approach. The fourth place [1] used\na completely different integer programming model and a genetic algorithm.\nWe describe the algorithms in Section 2 and experimentally analyze their performance\nusing different parameters in Section 3. Our solvers were coded in Python and C++ and\nexecuted on several desktop laptop computers, as well as the LIMOS and LIS clusters.\n2 Algorithms\nWe used two different algorithms to compute initial solutions, a preprocessing phase that\ncan be executed beforehand, and a local search phase to improve the solutions.\n2.1 Integer Programming Approach\nA simple idea to solve the challenge problem is to produce a set V of random translations of\neach item inside the container and then reduce the problem to a kind of maximum weight\nindependent set problem in a graph G = (V, E). Each translated item is a vertex and there\nare two types of edges: (1) an edge between two translations that overlap and (2) translations\nof the same item i form a clique Ci. If all item have quantity one, then this is a traditional\nmaximum weight independent set problem. However, if items have non-unit quantities, then\neach clique Ciis associated with the quantity qi of item i and at most qi vertices of the\nclique are allowed in the solution.\nThis combinatorial problem can easily be modeled as integer programming with one\nbinary variable per vertex. A type-1 edge uv is modeled as u + v \u2264 1 and each clique Ci\nis modeled as P\nv\u2208Ci\nv \u2264 qi. The CPLEX solver [2] can optimally solve graphs with a few\nthousand vertices obtained from the challenge instances, which is not enough to obtain good\nsolutions using uniformly random placements.\nTo obtain better solutions, we start from a solutions S obtained with the aforementioned\nmethod and build a new graph G = (V, E) as follows. Let \u03c3 > 0 be a parameter and N be a\nset of the zero vector and random vectors where each random vector has x and y coordinates\nG. D. da Fonseca and Y. Gerard 84:3\nas Gaussian random variables of average 0 and standard deviation \u03c3. We create a translation\nin V for each item that is placed in S and for each translation vector in N if the translation\nis inside the container. We also create vertices in V using uniform random translations for\nall items. Edges and cliques are created as before, and the new combinatorial problem is\nsolved with CPLEX. We repeat this procedure multiple times using the previous solution S\nand reducing the value of \u03c3 at each step.\nThis method works well for instances with up to 200 items. To handle larger instances,\nwe partition the container using a square grid and partition the items equally among the\ncells. The partition is such that items are grouped by the slope of the longest edge, breaking\nties by the slope of the diameter. Each cell is then solved independently. The intuition to\ngroup items of similar slope together is that they can often be placed in a way that minimizes\nthe wasted space. Since the values of the items do not seem to be related to the slopes, this\napproach works well for the challenge instances.\n2.2 Greedy Heuristic\nThe greedy heuristic starts by creating an initial list L of n grid points inside the container\n(typically n = 1000). The list L is shuffled and we compute its centroid c rounded to integer\ncoordinates. The point c is inserted in the beginning of L. The input items are placed into a\nlist I ordered by decreasing utility, where the utility function is described next. Different\nutility functions may be used (more details in Section 3). The goal is that items of small\narea and high value have high utility while large items with small value have low utility.\nWe then build the packing by considering the items of the list I one by one in order. At\neach step, we have a current packing and a new item i to pack. We first try to pack i at\nthe first grid position g \u2208 L and at a number of random positions around g. If one of these\npositions is availa...",

We expect a fun puzzle. We get a nightmare of Combinatorial Optimization.\nThis year\u2019s edition,**\u201cSanta 2025: The Christmas Tree Packing Challenge,\u201d**is no exception. The goal? Pack $N$ irregular \u201cTree Polygons\u201d into the smallest possible square bounding box for $N=1$ to $200$.\nIf you checked the leaderboard today (Dec 21), you noticed a trend:**Reinforcement Learning (RL) is getting crushed.**\nDespite the massive hype around \u201cReasoning Models\u201d and PPO agents this year, the top 100 teams aren\u2019t using neural networks. They are using 1980s physics simulations. Here is why the \u201cOld School\u201d is winning, and how the pros are using LLMs to cheat the system.\n## The Problem: Why RL Hates \u201cPacking\u201d\nOn paper, this looks like a game.*Place a tree, check for overlap, repeat.*Perfect for a DQN agent, right?\nWrong. The geometry kills the gradient.\n1. **Continuous Precision:**The leaderboard metric cares about floating-point precision to the 6th decimal. RL agents (which output discrete actions or probability distributions) struggle to make the \u201cmicro-adjustments\u201d needed to squeeze a tree into a 0.001mm gap.\n2. **The \u201cCollision\u201d Cliff:**In packing, a move is either valid (reward = 1) or it overlaps by a pixel (reward = -100). This sparse, binary feedback loop makes it nearly impossible for an agent to \u201clearn\u201d a gradient. It doesn\u2019t know*how*to fix the overlap, just that it failed.## The Solution: Simulated Annealing (on Steroids)\nThe \u201cSecret Sauce\u201d currently dominating the leaderboard is**Simulated Annealing (SA)**combined with**Lattice Generation**.\nInstead of training a model to*predict*the position, teams are writing physics engines that*shake*the box.\n* **High Temperature:**Randomly spin and throw trees into the box (Explorer Phase).\n* **Low Temperature:**Jiggle the trees by microscopic amounts to resolve collisions (Exploiter Phase).\nThe best solutions right now use a \u201cHybrid\u201d strategy:\n* **N &lt; 58:**Use Simulated Annealing to find unstructured, chaotic packings.\n* **N &gt; 58:**Switch to \u201cCrystalline Packing\u201d (regular geometric lattices) which is mathematically superior for large numbers.## The Twist: How LLMs are Actually Helping\nIf RL is dead, where is the AI?\nTop competitors aren\u2019t using LLMs to*solve*the puzzle; they are using LLMs to**write the solver**.\nPython is too slow for 10 billion annealing steps. The meta this year is to prompt Gemini 3 or Claude to:\n\u201cRewrite this Python overlap-check function in Rust/C++ with AVX2 vectorization.\u201d\nWe are seeing \u201cHybrid\u201d workflows where the**Human**defines the heuristics, the**LLM**writes the highly optimized C++ kernels, and**Simulated Annealing**does the heavy lifting.\n## The Starter Code: A Simple Annealer\nIf you want to jump in before the January deadline, don\u2019t start with PyTorch. Start here.\nHere is a conceptual snippet for a \u201cPerturbation\u201d mover \u2014the heart of any good annealing solution.\n```\nimport numpy as np\nimport math\ndef anneal(layout, max\\_temps=10000):\n# layout: Array of [x, y, rotation] for N trees\ncurrent\\_score = calculate\\_area(layout)\ntemperature = 1.0\ncooling\\_rate = 0.9995\nfor i in range(max\\_temps):\n# 1. Propose a Move (The &quot;Shake&quot;)\n# We only move ONE tree slightly to save compute\nidx = np.random.randint(0, len(layout))\noriginal\\_pos = layout[idx].copy()\n# Perturb: Move x/y by small amount, rotate slightly\nlayout[idx][0] += np.random.normal(0, temperature)\nlayout[idx][1] += np.random.normal(0, temperature)\nlayout[idx][2] += np.random.normal(0, temperature \\* 10) # Rotate\n# 2. Check Constraints (The &quot;Wall&quot;)\nif check\\_overlap(layout):\n# Revert immediately if invalid\nlayout[idx] = original\\_pos\ncontinue\n# 3. Acceptance Criteria (Metropolis-Hastings)\nnew\\_score = calculate\\_area(layout)\ndelta = new\\_score - current\\_score\n# If better, accept. If worse, accept with prob based on Temp.\nif delta &lt; 0 or math.exp(-delta / temperature) &gt; np.random.rand():\ncurrent\\_score = new\\_score\nelse:\nlayout[idx] = original\\_pos # Revert\n# Cool down\ntemperature \\*= cooling\\_rate\nreturn layout, current\\_score\n# Pro Tip: Ask an LLM to convert &#x27;&#x27;check\\_overlap&#x27;&#x27; to Cython for 100x speed.\n```\nThe competition ends**January 30, 2026**. You have 40 days. Put down the Neural Network and pick up a physics textbook.\n*(****Discussion:****Are you using a Lattice approach or pure Annealing for N=200?
