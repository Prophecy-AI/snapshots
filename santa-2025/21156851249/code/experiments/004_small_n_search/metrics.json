  "notes": "Ran bbox3 C++ optimizer (Global Dynamics Edition) with 50000 iterations and 100 rounds. Features: Complex Number Vector Coordination, Fluid Dynamics, Hinge Pivot, Density Gradient Flow, Global Boundary Tension. NO IMPROVEMENTS FOUND. The baseline is at a very tight local optimum that even advanced C++ optimizers cannot escape. This confirms the evaluator's assessment that incremental optimization is exhausted."
