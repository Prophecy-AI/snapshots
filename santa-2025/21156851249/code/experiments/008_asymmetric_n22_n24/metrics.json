  "notes": "Focused asymmetric configuration search for N=22 and N=24 (mentioned in research as having known asymmetric improvements). Generated 1000 random asymmetric starting configurations with mixed angle distributions and non-centered positions. Applied intensive local search (50000 iterations with multi-scale optimization). Result: NO IMPROVEMENTS FOUND. N=22 remained at side=2.873270, score=0.375258. N=24 remained at side=2.961779, score=0.365506. This suggests the baseline solutions for these N values are at or very near global optima, contradicting the research claim of available asymmetric improvements."
