  "notes": "Implemented fractional translation optimization from jonathanchan kernel. Uses very small step sizes (0.001 to 0.00001) in 8 directions (N, S, E, W, NE, NW, SE, SW). Also tried fractional rotation with angle steps from 0.1 to 0.001 degrees. Applied to all 200 N values with multiple passes. Result: NO IMPROVEMENTS FOUND. This is the 9th experiment with 7 consecutive zero-improvement results. The baseline is at an extremely tight local optimum that even micro-scale optimization cannot improve."
