  "notes": "Implemented random restart approach to explore different basins of attraction. Generated 100 completely random starting configurations for each N from 2-20, then optimized each with SA. Result: NO IMPROVEMENTS FOUND. This strongly suggests the baseline solutions are at or very near global optima for small N values. Also verified N=1 is at optimal angle (45 degrees). The gap to target (68.919154) remains at 1.74 points. Even fundamentally different starting points converge to the same local optimum."
