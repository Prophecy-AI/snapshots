  "notes": "Implemented TRUE crystalline lattice packing with optimized lattice vectors for large N values (58-200). The approach generates periodic positions based on lattice vectors u and v, with alternating 0°/180° angles (double-lattice pattern). Tried 100+ different lattice configurations per N value with local optimization. Result: NO IMPROVEMENTS from lattice construction. However, found that the ensemble_best_per_n.csv has slightly better solutions for 64 N values compared to the current submission. Combined the best solutions from both sources, improving the score from 70.659957 to 70.659437 (improvement of 0.000520). The baseline solutions already use an optimized double-lattice structure that cannot be improved by generating new lattice packings from scratch."
