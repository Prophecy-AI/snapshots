      "text": "Two\u2011dimensional irregular polygon packing \u2013 where pieces of arbitrary shape must be placed inside a rectangular sheet, strip or a set of bins \u2013 is a classic combinatorial optimisation problem that appears in shipbuilding, metal\u2011working, textile and furniture manufacturing. Because the search space grows exponentially with the number of polygons and their possible orientations, exact methods (e.g., branch\u2011and\u2011bound or mixed\u2011integer programming) are only practical for very small instances, so most industrial\u2011scale solvers rely on sophisticated heuristics and approximation schemes\u202f([Frontiers](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmech.2022.966691/full)).\n\nThe most effective approaches reported in the literature combine a **selection heuristic** (which orders the pieces) with a **placement heuristic** (which decides where to put each piece).  A widely used selection rule is the DJD (Djang\u2011Finch) heuristic, originally devised for 1\u2011D bin packing and adapted to 2\u2011D irregular shapes; when paired with a bottom\u2011left placement strategy it yields solutions that outperform many classic selectors\u202f([Burke\u202f2013](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10479-013-1341-4)).  For the placement step, the **bottom\u2011left algorithm** and its variants (e.g., shelf\u2011packing with height\u2011sorting) are simple yet powerful, especially when combined with polygon\u2011specific transformations that improve shelf utilisation\u202f([Hu\u202fet\u202fal.\u202f2018](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.1201/9781351236423-33/practical-algorithms-two-dimensional-packing-general-shapes-yannan-hu-hideki-hashimoto-shinji-imahori-mutsunori-yagiura)).  **Local\u2011search heuristics** that iteratively jostle pieces to reduce overlap or waste have been shown to outperform generic meta\u2011heuristics on heterogeneous\u2011bin instances, while still keeping computational effort modest\u202f([Martinez\u202fSykora\u202f2017](https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/415314)).  When a broader exploration of the solution space is needed, **meta\u2011heuristics** such as genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, tabu search and even artificial neural\u2011network\u2011guided searches are frequently employed; surveys report that genetic algorithms in particular achieve robust performance across regular and irregular strip\u2011packing benchmarks\u202f([Turton\u202f2001](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1012590107280)).  For convex polygons without rotations, recent **approximation algorithms** provide provable guarantees (e.g., O(1)\u2011approximation for bin and strip packing) by sorting polygons by height and applying enhanced shelf\u2011packing schemes\u202f([Kurpisz\u202f&\u202fSuter\u202f2023](https://export.arxiv.org/pdf/2308.08523v1.pdf)).\n\nIn practice, the \u201cbest\u201d algorithm is problem\u2011specific: for large industrial cut\u2011planning with many heterogeneous stock sheets, a hybrid that starts with a fast DJD\u202f+\u202fbottom\u2011left construction and then refines the layout with a local\u2011search or genetic\u2011algorithm phase is often recommended.  For theoretical guarantees or instances limited to convex shapes, the newer polynomial\u2011time approximation methods give the strongest worst\u2011case performance, while extended local\u2011search methods based on nonlinear programming can further tighten solutions for irregular strip\u2011packing problems\u202f([Gomes\u202fet\u202fal.\u202f2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0305054811001596)).  Selecting among these techniques should consider instance size, allowed rotations, bin heterogeneity, and the need for provable bounds versus empirical solution quality.",

An efficient 2D irregular packing algorithm can effectively improve material utilization and reduce processing costs. The reduction in material consumption will also have a beneficial impact on the environment ([Ke et al., 2020](#B76)). Therefore, research of the packing problem is of great significance for technology and social interest.\nThe 2D packing problem is a type of combinatorial optimization problems to locate parts with different shapes compactly in one or more master sheet material to minimize the occupied space or maximize the utilization of the material. The 2D packing problem is currently recognized as a NP problem, which is mainly solved by heuristic algorithms. In recent years, many scholars have conducted research on 2D irregular packing problems with a verity of solutions.\nThere exists a number of review articles on packing and cutting problems. We have summarized the main review literature in the field of 2D packing and cutting as shown in[Table 1](#T1). Brown ([Brown, 1971](#B17)) introduced an optimum packing and depletion problem with optimization of space and resource usage. Harvey ([Salkin and De Kluyver, 1975](#B116)) surveyed the application of mathematical optimization models such as linear programming to the knapsack problem. Bruce ([Golden, 1976](#B50)) surveyed various approaches to the cutting stock problem. Hinxman ([Hinxman, 1980](#B65)) surveyed the trim-loss and assortment problems, this research paid more attention to cutting and packaging problems in practical applications, and did not mention much about theoretical methods. Garey and Coffman ([Garey and Johnson, 1981](#B47);[Coffman et al., 1984](#B27)) surveyed the approximation algorithms for bin packing problems. Israni ([Israni and Sanders, 1982](#B72)) reviewed the 2D cutting stock problem including almost all 2D packaging problems. The author also proposed a rectangular layout method. Sarin ([Sarin, 1983](#B118)) reviewed methodologies and literature to solve 2D stock cutting problems and introduced an interactive optimization procedure for a general 2D stock cutting problem. Dyckhoff ([Dyckhoff et al., 1985](#B38)) described a trim loss and related problems and categorized them briefly. Dudzi&#x00144;ski ([Dudzi&#x00144;ski and Walukiewicz, 1987](#B36)) summarized the exact methods for knapsack problems, such as linear programming. Matthias ([Rode and Rosenberg, 1987](#B114)) analyzed the algorithm for the trim-loss problems. Haessler ([Haessler and Sweeney, 1991](#B59)) reviewed the solution process of cutting stock problems, including placement algorithm and sequence optimization algorithm. Dowsland ([Dowsland and Dowsland, 1992](#B34)) reviewed the application of operations research methods to the packing problem and summarized some exact heuristics. Sweeney ([Sweeney and Paternoster, 1992](#B128)) categorized cutting and packing problems and made application-oriented research records. Cheng ([Cheng et al., 1994](#B22)) discussed 2D cutting stock problems and their application cases including the pallet loading problem and VLSI placement problem. With the gradual deepening of research on 2D layout problems, typology becomes a common research topic. 2D regular and irregular layout problems are clearly distinguished in practical applications and theoretical methods. Dowsland ([Dowsland and Dowsland, 1995](#B29)) gave a special review of the 2D irregular nesting problem for the first time. Mavridou ([Mavridou and Pardalos, 1997](#B98)) summarized applications of the genetic algorithm and simulated annealing algorithm in the optimization of facility layout problems. Dyckhoff ([Dyckhoff, 1990](#B37)) made a typology of the cutting and packing problems in detail, and W&#x000e4;scher ([W&#x000e4;scher et al., 2007](#B135)) improved the typology later. Hopper ([Hopper and Turton, 1999](#B67);[Hopper and Turton, 2001a](#B68);[Hopper and Turton, 2001b](#B69)) investigated the application of meta-heuristic and heuristic algorithms in 2D and 3D packing problems. Lodi ([Lodi et al., 2002a](#B90);[Lodi et al., 2002b](#B91)) reviewed algorithms proposed in the 1990s of 2D packing problems. Bennell et al. ([Bennell and Oliveira, 2008](#B10);[Bennell and Oliveira, 2009](#B9)) discussed 2D irregular packing problems and related geometric problems. Leao ([Leao et al., 2020](#B81)) introduced the mathematical models in the 2D irregular packing problem.\nTABLE 1\n[![www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/966691/fmech-08-966691-HTML/image_m/fmech-08-966691-t001.jpg)](https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/966691/fmech-08-966691-HTML/image_m/fmech-08-966691-t001.jpg)\n**TABLE 1**.

A link will be provided\nin a future version of this document.\narXiv:2308.08523v1 [cs.CG] 16 Aug 2023\n2 Improved Approximations for Translational Packing of Convex Polygons\n1 Introduction\nMany real-life situations require us to make decisions about optimally packing a collection\nof objects into a specific container. One particular category of these packing problems is\ntwo-dimensional packing, which is encountered in everyday scenarios like arranging items\non a shelf and in industrial applications such as cutting cookies from rolled-out dough\nor manufacturing sets of tiles from standard-sized panels made of wood, glass, or metal.\nAnother intriguing example involves cutting fabric pieces for clothing production. In this\ncase, the pieces often cannot be rotated freely, as they must adhere to a desired pattern\nin the final product, which is tailored of multiple elements. The widespread applicability\nof two-dimensional packing problems has led to a surge of interest in designing efficient\nalgorithms to address them. In this paper, we follow the line of research and study the\nproblem of packing convex polygons without rotations in various settings depending on the\ntype of containers used.\nPast research focusing on theoretical considerations of two-dimensional packings mainly\nconcentrates on the scenario when all objects are axis-parallel rectangles. In this paper, we\nwill discuss packing without rotations, in which only translations are permitted. There are\ntwo main classes of the problem depending on whether the size of the container is fixed and\nwe want to minimize the number of containers used or whether we want to minimize the\ncontainer\u2019s size with respect to some objective function.\nA seminal example of the first class is the Geometric Bin Packing problem in which\na number of unit size squared bins to pack is to be minimized. The problem is arguably\nthe most natural generalization of the regular (1D) Bin Packing to two dimensions, and\nits absolute approximability has been fully understood. Unless P = N P, the best possible\nefficient constant factor approximation is 2 [15], and such an algorithm is known [10].\nIn the second class, there are several variants to be considered. An example is the\nStrip Packing Problem which is concerned with packing objects into a strip of width\n1 and infinite height in such a way that the maximum of all the heights of the placed\nobjects is minimized. Like Geometric Bin Packing, Strip Packing generalizes (1D)\nBin Packing. The best known efficient constant factor approximation for Strip Packing\nhas approximation factor (5/3 + \u03f5) [9]. It is known that there can not exist a polynomial\ntime algorithm with an approximation ratio of (3/2 \u2212 \u03f5) for any \u03f5 > 0 unless P = N P, which\nfollows directly from the approximation hardness of (1D) Bin Packing. Both classes of\nproblems have been also considered in the asymptotic setting, see e.g. [11, 5, 12].\nIn younger time, there was also an increase of interest in cases where the objects in\nquestion are general convex polygons. Alt, de Berg and Knauer [2, 3] considered the problem\nof packing an instance consisting of a number of convex polygons of the form p \u2282 [0, 1]2into\na minimum area axis-parallel rectangular container. We refer to this problem as Polygon\nArea Minimization throughout this paper. In the special case where the instance consists\nof rectangles only, the problem is known to admit a PTAS [4]. They proved the existence of\nthe following efficient algorithm:\nA 23.78-approximation for Polygon Area Minimization.\nRecently, Aamand, Abrahamsen, Beretta and Kleist [1] showed that the algorithm of Alt,\nde Berg and Knauer can be leveraged to obtain also efficient approximation algorithms of\nfurther problems:\nA 7-approximation for Polygon Perimeter Minimization.\nA 51-approximation for Polygon Strip Packing.\nAn 11-approximation for Polygon Bin Packing for polygons with diameter at most 1\n10 .\nA. Kurpisz and S. Suter 3\n1.1 Our results\nThe results of Alt, de Berg and Knauer [2, 3] and Aamand et al. [1] are heavily based on\nso-called shelf packing algorithms. In shelf packing algorithms, the objects are first placed\non the shelves, possibly ordered by height, which are later stacked on one another to build\na final solution. Compared to axis-parallel rectangles, the main challenge in designing an\napproximation algorithm for polygon packing problems is that objects cannot be sorted by\nheight and orientation simultaneously. As a result, the algorithm and its analysis in [2, 3]\nhave such a large approximation guarantee. In this paper, we provide new insight into how\nshelf packing algorithms should be applied to polygon packing problems. We introduce a\nsequence of transformations of the objects that allow us first to sort them by height and later\nby orientation to build a solution of a much better approximation guarantee. More precisely,\nwe design polynomial-time algorithms with the following factors:\nA 9.45-approximation for Polygon Area Minimization.\nUsing this algorithm as a subroutine, we build upon the methods from Aamand et al. [1] to\nobtain the following efficient approximation algorithms:\nA (3.75 + \u03f5)-approximation for Polygon Perimeter Minimization.\nA 21.89-approximation for Polygon Strip Packing.\nA 5.09-approximation for Polygon Bin Packing for polygons which have their diameter\nbounded by 1\n10 .\nThe results are proved in Sections 4, 5, 6, and 7 respectively. Furthermore, in Section 8\nwe show the following results, which make progress towards solving an open question of a\nO(1)-approximation algorithm for Polygon Bin Packing for arbitrary polygons.\nThere is an efficient O(\n1\n\u03b4\n)-approximation algorithm for Polygon Bin Packing for\ninstances where each polygon has width or height at most 1 \u2212 \u03b4.\nThere is an efficient O(1)-approximation algorithm for Polygon Bin Packing for\ninstances with the property that all polygons share a spine (up to translation) with height\nat least 3\n4\n.\n2 Preliminaries\nWe start out considerations by recalling a classical and well-known problem in theoretical\ncomputer science, the Bin Packing problem: Given a list of numbers s1, . . . , sn \u2208 (0, 1] \u2229 Q,\nrepresenting the sizes of n objects, the goal is to find the minimum number of bins of size 1,\nso that we can pac...",

It explores the procedure of applying the bottom-left strategy to a given order the bottom-left algorithm. The chapter explains the irregular strip packing problem and introduces some practical algorithms for irregular packing problems. It focuses on the problem of packing irregular shapes represented in bitmap format and analyses the rectilinear block packing problem and also introduces various schemes used to represent solutions to the rectilinear block packing problem and algorithms based on such coding schemes. The chapter considers two-dimensional irregular packing problems, which have been actively studied in the last decade. It provides some basic techniques including bottom-left strategy, clustering strategy, and no-fit polygons. The chapter shows that various algorithms proposed for the irregular strip packing and bin packing problems and their variants. T.

We also discuss the effect of different groups of stock sheet sizes.\n\nText\n\n**ICCL17\\_paper\\_43**\n**\\- Accepted Manuscript**\n\n[Download](https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/415314/1/ICCL17_paper_43.pdf) (729kB)\n\n## More information\n\ne-pub ahead of print date: October 2017\n\nPublished date: October 2017\n\nKeywords:\nIrregular shapes, Multiple bin size bin packing, Jostle Algorithm\n\n## Identifiers\n\nLocal EPrints ID: 415314\n\nURI: http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/id/eprint/415314\n\nDOI: [doi:10.1007/978-3-319-68496](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-68496)\n\nPURE UUID: e654d0b7-af4b-43c1-86e1-635828997331\n\nORCID for Antonio Martinez Sykora: [orcid.org/0000-0002-2435-3113](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2435-3113)\n\n## Catalogue record\n\nDate deposited: 07 Nov 2017 17:30\n\nLast modified: 16 Mar 2024 05:53\n\n## Export record\n\nASCII CitationAtomBibTeXData Cite XMLDublin CoreDublin CoreEP3 XMLEndNoteHTML CitationHTML CitationHTML ListJSONMETSMODSMPEG-21 DIDLOpenURL ContextObjectOpenURL ContextObject in SpanRDF+N-TriplesRDF+N3RDF+XMLRIOXX2 XMLReferReference ManagerSimple Metadata\n\n## Altmetrics\n\n## Share this record\n\n[Share this on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/415314/) [Share this on Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Efficient%20local%20search%20heuristics%20for%20packing%20irregular%20shapes%20in%20two%2Ddimensional%20heterogeneous%20bins+https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/415314/) [Share this on Weibo](http://service.weibo.com/share/share.php?url=Efficient%20local%20search%20heuristics%20for%20packing%20irregular%20shapes%20in%20two%2Ddimensional%20heterogeneous%20bins+https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/415314/)\n\n## Contributors\n\nAuthor:Ranga, Prasad Abeysooriya\n\nAuthor:Julia Bennell\n\nAuthor: [Antonio Martinez Sykora](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/business-school/about/staff/am1u10.page)\n\nEditor:Tolga Bektas\n\nEditor:Stefano Coniglio\n\nEditor:Antonio Martinez-Sykora\n\nEditor:Stefan Boss\n\n## Download statistics\n\nDownloads from ePrints over the past year.

It adopts two neighborhoods, swapping two given polygons in a placement and placing one polygon into a new position. The local search algorithm is used to minimize the overlap on the basis of the neighborhoods mentioned above and the unconstrained[nonlinear programming](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/nonlinear-programming)model is adopted to further minimize the overlap during the search process. Moreover, the[tabu](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/tabu)search algorithm is used to avoid[local minima](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/local-minimum), and a compact algorithm is presented to improve the result. The results of standard test instances indicate that when compared with other existing algorithms, the presented algorithm does not only show some signs of competitive power but also updates several best known results.\n## Introduction\nThe irregular strip packing problem, also known as the nesting problem, has a wide area of applications. Given a set of irregular shapes and a rectangular strip with a fixed width and an arbitrary length, the target of the two-dimensional irregular strip packing problem is to place all shapes within the strip such that the length of the strip is minimized and the irregular shapes do not overlap. A classic example application is clothing industry. Several pieces of clothes will be cut from a roll of fabric and the objective is to minimize the waste of fabric. The fabric has a fixed width and its length can be generally assumed infinite; so the problem is to minimize the length required for producing the specified number of irregular shapes.\nThe irregular strip packing problem is a NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem [1]. Numerous papers on nesting problem have been published since the first paper by Art [2]. Meta-heuristics are often used to solve this problem. Hopper and Turton [3] reviewed these methods, and a summary of geometric methods was published by Bennell and Oliveira [4]. As research progressed, further breakthroughs in algorithms for this problem have achieved in recent years. When compared with the previous years, these solutions have markedly improved the effect and speed of nesting results. The typical methods include Burke et al. [5], Gomes and Oliveira [6], Egeblad et al. [7], Imamichi et al. [8], etc.\nAlbano and Sapuppo [9] proposed an algorithm that places each shape at the bottom-left position, and the sequence of places is obtained by tree search. Jakobs [10] proposed a two-stage solution which first generates the rectangular enclosure of each irregular shape, and then finds the placement for these enclosures through a genetic algorithm. Secondly, a shrinking algorithm moves the shapes to another one as close as possible using the idea of the bottom-left heuristic. Gomes and Oliveira [11] based on bottom-left heuristic and find a good placement by exchanging two shapes in the layout. Dowsland et al. [12] developed a compact algorithm to improve the bottom-left heuristic algorithm. The algorithm first gets the initial placement by the bottom-left heuristic, and then uses a shaking process to compact the placement. Burke et al. [5] presented a new bottom-left heuristic algorithm based on discretization, and combination with hill climbing or tabu search to get a high quality solution. This algorithm can also pack the shapes with circular arcs and holes. Egeblad et al. [7] proposed an efficient fast local search method whose neighborhood is any horizontal or vertical translation of a given shape. They also formulated a polynomial time algorithm to find a translation with minimum overlap area between the given polygon and the other polygons in the current placement. Gomes and Oliveira [6] presented a separation algorithm to locally optimize the placement based on linear programming models, and used simulated annealing to guide the search. A new separation algorithm based on unconstrained nonlinear programming is proposed by Imamichi et al. [8]. They also designed an algorithm that swaps two polygons in a placement, and then the algorithms are combined as a component into an iterated local search algorithm for the overlap minimization problem. This method yielded several best known results on the standard test instances. Our algorithm is based on a separation algorithm presented by Imamichi et al. [8], and local search is adopted to guide the search. Moreover, a tabu search algorithm is used to avoid local minima and a compacted algorithm is used to improve the packing results.\n## Section snippets\n## Formulation\nIn this section, some fundamental elements of geometry are first defined, before formulation of the irregular strip packing problem algorithm is given.\n**Definition 1 (point)**\nA point*p*in two-dimensional space is represented by a pair:p=(px,py)\u2208R2.\n**Definition 2 (line segment)**\nA line segment*s*is a point set defined by two endpoints*p**a*and*p**b*:s={p\u2208R2,t\u2208[0,1]|p=pa+t(pb\u2212pa)}.\n**Definition 3 (polygon)**\nA polygon is a plane figure bounded by a closed path composes of a finite sequence of line segments denoted by*S*.

As packing tasks arecombinatorial problems with very large searchspaces, the recent literature encourages theuse of meta-heuristic search methods, inparticular genetic algorithms. The objective ofthis paper is to present and categorise thesolution approaches in the literature for 2Dregular and irregular strip packing problems.The focus is hereby on the analysis of themethods involving genetic algorithms. Anoverview of the methods applying othermeta-heuristic algorithms including simulatedannealing, tabu search, and artificial neuralnetworks is also given.\n\nThis is a preview of subscription content, [log in via an institution](https://wayf.springernature.com?redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1023%2FA%3A1012590107280%3Ferror%3Dcookies_not_supported%26code%3D60bc48b4-b7d2-4520-acdb-8666b5b6d1b2) to check access.\n\n## Access this article\n\n[Log in via an institution](https://wayf.springernature.com?redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1023%2FA%3A1012590107280%3Ferror%3Dcookies_not_supported%26code%3D60bc48b4-b7d2-4520-acdb-8666b5b6d1b2)\n\nBuy article PDF USD 39.95\n\nPrice excludes VAT (USA)\n\nTax calculation will be finalised during checkout.\n\nInstant access to the full article PDF.\n\nRent this article via DeepDyve\n\n[Institutional subscriptions](https://www.springernature.com/gp/librarians/licensing/agc/journals)\n\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n\n![](https://media.springernature.com/w215h120/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10479-021-04226-6/MediaObjects/10479_2021_4226_Fig1_HTML.png)\n\n### [A hybrid metaheuristic for the two-dimensional strip packing problem](https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10479-021-04226-6?fromPaywallRec=true)\n\nArticle24 August 2021\n\n![](https://media.springernature.com/w92h120/springer-static/cover-hires/book/978-3-662-44739-0?as=webp)\n\n### [An Analogy between Bin Packing Problem and Permutation Problem: A New Encoding Scheme](https://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-662-44739-0_70?fromPaywallRec=true)\n\nChapter\u00a9 2014\n\n![](https://media.springernature.com/w92h120/springer-static/cover-hires/book/978-3-319-22635-4?as=webp)\n\n### [Hybrid Heuristic Algorithms for the Multiobjective Load Balancing of 2D Bin Packing Problems](https://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-319-22635-4_19?fromPaywallRec=true)\n\nChapter\u00a9 2016\n\n## References\n\n- Adamowicz, M. & Albano, A.

In the two-dimensional case, not only is it the case that the piece\u2019s size is important but its shape also has a significant influence. Therefore, DJD as a selection heuristic has to be paired with a placement heuristic to completely construct a solution to the underlying packing problem. A successful adaptation of the DJD requires a routine to reduce computational costs, which is also proposed and successfully tested in this paper. Results, on a wide variety of instance types with convex polygons, are found to be significantly better than those produced by more conventional selection heuristics.\n\nThis is a preview of

Research on 2D irregular packing problems is essential for improving material utilization and industrial automation. Much research has been conducted on this problem with significant research results and certain algorithms. The work has made important contributions to solving practical problems. This paper reviews recent advances in the domain of 2D irregular packing problems based on a variety of research papers. We first introduce the basic concept and research background of 2D irregular packing problems and then summarize algorithms and strategies that have been proposed for the problems in recent years. Conclusion summarize development trends and research hotspots of typical 2D irregular shape packing problems. We hope that this review could provide guidance for researchers in the field of 2D irregular packing.</p><p>Content may be subject to copyright.</p></div><div><p><strong>Discover the world's
