      "text": "A mixed\u2011integer programming model for 2\u2011D polygon packing introduces continuous variables \\((x_i ,y_i )\\) that give the coordinates of a reference point (e.g., the lower\u2011left vertex) of each polygon\u202f\\(i\\) and binary variables that capture the combinatorial decisions that prevent overlap.  The objective is usually to minimise the length of a strip, the number of bins, or the total area of the enclosing rectangle, while ensuring that every polygon stays inside the container.  For polygons whose edges are orthogonal (polyominoes) the model can be written with a simple \u201crelative\u2011position\u201d formulation: for every unordered pair \\((i,j)\\) four binary variables \\(l_{ij}, r_{ij}, a_{ij}, b_{ij}\\) indicate whether\u202f\\(i\\) is left, right, above or below\u202f\\(j\\).  Big\u2011\\(M\\) constraints then enforce the corresponding geometric ordering, e.g.  \n\n\\[\nx_i + w_i \\le x_j + M(1-l_{ij}),\\qquad\ny_i + h_i \\le y_j + M(1-a_{ij}),\n\\]\n\nand the four binaries must sum to\u202f1 so that exactly one relative placement holds\u202f([International Journal of Operational Research](https://ideas.repec.org/a/ids/ijores/v15y2012i4p391-405.html)).  \n\nWhen the items are arbitrary (possibly non\u2011convex) polygons, a common \u201cpolygonal\u2011enclosure\u2019\u2019 approach linearises each shape by a set of facet inequalities \\(A_i v \\le b_i\\) that describe its convex hull (or a tight convex decomposition).  After translation, the vertices satisfy  \n\n\\[\nA_i (v_k + (x_i ,y_i )) \\le b_i \\quad\\forall k,\n\\]\n\nand non\u2011overlap is modelled by separating the two convex hulls with a pair of opposite half\u2011spaces using binary variables \\(s_{ij}^p\\) and a large constant\u202f\\(M\\) (the classic \u201cbig\u2011\\(M\u2019\u2019 disjunctive formulation)\u202f([Springer \u2013 MILP model based on a polygonal enclosure](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10479-015-1971-9)).  \n\nTwo alternative discretisation\u2011based tricks are also popular.  The **vertical\u2011slice** model splits the strip into a finite set of columns and uses binary variables \\(z_{i,s}\\) to indicate that piece\u202f\\(i\\) occupies slice\u202f\\(s\\); feasibility cuts guarantee that at most one piece can use a slice at a given height\u202f([Ejores 2024](https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/ejores/v313y2024i1p69-91.html)).  The **dotted\u2011board** model overlays a fine grid of \u201cdots\u2019\u2019 on the container and lets binary variable \\(d_{i,k}\\) denote that polygon\u202f\\(i\\) covers dot\u202f\\(k\\); the non\u2011overlap condition is simply \\(\\sum_i d_{i,k}\\le 1\\) for every dot\u202f([International Journal of Production Economics 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0925527313001722)).  \n\nTogether, these ingredients\u2014continuous placement variables, binary relative\u2011position or occupancy variables, and big\u2011\\(M\\) or grid\u2011based non\u2011overlap constraints\u2014constitute the standard MIP formulation used for 2\u2011D polygon packing problems.",

In this paper, a new mixed-integer programming (MIP) model is introduced to optimally solve a special case of the problem, where item shapes are polygons with orthogonal edges, named polyominoes. Polyominoes strip packing may be classified as polyominoes tiling; a problem that can also be handled by the proposed model. Reasonable problem sizes (e.g. 45 polyominoes inside a 10 \u00d7 25 sheet) are solvable using an ordinary PC. Larger problem sizes are expected to be solvable when using state-of-the-art computational facilities.

Nesting methods based on heuristics are a mature technology, and currently, the only practical solution to this problem. However, recent performance gains of the Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) solvers, together with the known limitations of the heuristics methods, have encouraged the exploration of exact optimization models for nesting during the last decade. Despite the research effort, there is room to improve the efficiency of the current family of exact MIP models for nesting. In order to bridge this gap, this work introduces a new family of continuous MIP models based on a novel formulation of the NoFit-Polygon Covering Model (NFP-CM), called NFP-CM based on Vertical Slices (NFP-CM-VS). Our new family of MIP models is based on a new convex decomposition of the feasible space of relative placements between pieces into vertical slices, together with a new family of valid inequalities, symmetry breakings, and variable eliminations derived from the former convex decomposition. Our experiments show that our new NFP-CM-VS models outperform the current state-of-the-art MIP models. Ten instances are solved up to optimality within one hour for the first time, including one with 27 pieces. Finally, we provide a detailed reproducibility protocol and dataset as supplementary material to allow the exact replication of our models, experiments, and results.\n\n## Suggested Citation\n\nLastra-D\u00edaz, Juan J. & Ortu\u00f1o, M.

It differs from other 2-D C&P problems in the irregular shape of the pieces. This paper proposes a new mixed-integer model in which binary decision variables are associated with each discrete point of the board (a dot) and with each piece type. It is much more flexible than previously proposed formulations and solves to [optimality](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/optimality) larger instances of the nesting problem, at the cost of having its precision dependent on board [discretization](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/discretization). To date no results have been published concerning optimal solutions for nesting problems with more than 7 pieces. We ran computational experiments on 45 problem instances with the new model, solving to [optimality](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/optimality) 34 instances with a total number of pieces ranging from 16 to 56, depending on the number of piece types, grid resolution and the size of the board. A strong advantage of the model is its insensitivity to piece and board geometry, making it easy to extend to more complex problems such as non-convex boards, possibly with defects. Additionally, the number of binary variables does not depend on the total number of pieces but on the number of piece types, making the model particularly suitable for problems with few piece types. The discrete nature of the model requires a trade-off between grid resolution and problem size, as the number of binary variables grows with the square of the selected grid resolution and with board size.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe nesting problem, also known as irregular packing problem, belongs to the more generic class of cutting and packing (C&P) problems. As in all C&P problems, one or more big objects have to be divided into smaller items or pieces so that (1) unused regions of the big object, usually designated as waste, are minimized \u2014 input minimization problems, according to W\u00e4scher typology, or (2) the value of the pieces cut from the big object is maximized \u2014 output maximization problem, according to the same typology (W\u00e4scher et al., 2007). The problem addressed in this paper is a two-dimensional (2D) C&P problem, i.e. only two of the dimensions of the objects are relevant, as the third dimension is equal for all objects and pieces. Moreover, the goal is to minimize the used length of a big rectangular object (the board), of unbound length, making it a 2D Open Dimension Problem. It is often called irregular strip packing.\n\nThe nesting problem differs from other 2D C&P problems in the irregular shape of the pieces. Irregular shapes are those that involve non-trivial handling of the geometry (Bennell and Oliveira, 2008). This leaves out of our scope rectangles and circles, in which the evaluation of the distance between two pieces can be performed by simple coordinate comparison. The most common representation, in the literature, for the irregular shape of a piece is the polygon, and although geometric operations with polygons are not trivial, we will also assume that all pieces are represented by polygons. No additional constraints are imposed on the polygon characteristics, so we deal with the harder to tackle class of non-convex polygons.\n\nNesting problems are not only a scientific challenge, as they add the geometry handling complexity to the combinatorial optimization nature of C&P problems, but they are also most relevant in real-world applications. Indeed they arise in a wide variety of industrial production processes, including textile, garment, metalware, furniture and shoe industries. In all cases saving raw-materials represents an important contribution to the economic and environmental performance of companies.\n\nNesting problems have been addressed by many authors. However, given the problem complexity, to the best of the authors' knowledge there is no published exact mathematical programming based method to solve it, reaching guaranteed optimal solutions for the problem. Although a thorough tutorial on the nesting problem resolution is available (Bennell and Oliveira, 2009), the approaches that more closely relate to the work reported in this paper will be briefly highlighted.\n\nNot surprisingly, heuristic and metaheuristic algorithms are the basis of the overwhelming majority of the published approaches. Among these, the most recent approaches with best performance are from Gomes and Oliveira (2006), Egeblad et al. (2007), Imamichi et al. (2009), Bennell and Song (2010), and Leung et al. (2012). A pioneering work on the exact resolution of non-convex nesting problems (Carravilla et al., 2003) used constraint logic programming as resolution method and has solved to optimality problems with up to 7 pieces. All the other approaches deal with approximations or simpler forms of the nesting problem.\n\nThe first approximation is geometric and consists in considering only rectangular shapes. The first exact solution procedure for the constrained (i.e. with an upper bound on the number of pieces of each type to cut or pack) 2D non-guillotine rectangular problem was proposed by Beasley (1985) and was based on a binary integer programming formulation. The author assumes that all rectangle's lengths and widths are integers, leading to a discrete model, as pieces can only be placed on a set of discrete points of the board.

A small number of exact methods have been proposed to solve nesting problems, typically focusing on a single problem variant, the strip packing problem. There are however several other variants of the nesting problem which were identified in the literature and are very relevant in the industry.\n\nIn this paper, constraint programming (CP) is used to model and solve all the variants of irregular cutting and packing problems proposed in the literature. Three approaches, which differ in the representation of the variable domains, in the way they deal with the core constraints and in the objective functions, are the basis for the three models proposed for each variant of the problem. The non-overlap among pieces, which must be enforced for all the problem variants, is guaranteed through the new global constraint NoOverlap in one of the proposed approaches.\n\nTaking the benchmark instances for the strip-packing problem, new instances were generated for each problem variant. Extensive computational experiments were run with these problem instances from the literature to evaluate the performance of each approach applied to each problem variant. The models based on the global constraint NoOverlap performed consistently better for all variants due to the increased propagation and to the low memory usage.\n\nThe performance of the CP model for the strip packing problem with the global constraint NoOverlap was then compared with the Dotte...",

In this paper we make a systematic study of the problem and develop an exact Branch &amp; Bound Algorithm. The initial existing mixed integer formulations are reviewed, tested and used as a starting point to develop a new and more efficient formulation. We also study several branching strategies, lower bounds and procedures for fixing variables, reducing the size of the problem to be solved at each node. An extensive computational study allows us first to determine the best strategies to be used in the Branch &amp; Bound Algorithm and then to explore its performance and limits. The results show that the algorithm is able to solve instances of up to 16 pieces to[optimality](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/optimality).\n## Introduction\nNesting problems are two-dimensional cutting and packing problems involving irregular shapes. These problems arise in a wide variety of industries like garment manufacturing, sheet metal cutting, furniture making and shoe manufacturing. The wide range of applications implies many different variants of the problem. The placement areas into which the pieces have to be packed or cut can be rectangular, as in the case of materials provided in rolls, or can have irregular shapes, as in the case of leather hides for making shoes. This placement area can have a uniform quality or different qualities depending on the region, including sometimes defective parts that cannot be used for pieces. The pieces to be cut can be described as polygons, convex or not, or can include curved edges. Depending on the real application, the pieces can be rotated freely, at specific angles only (90\u00b0, 180\u00b0, \u2026), or not rotated at all. There may also be different objectives, usually involving the minimization of the area required for cutting the pieces or the maximization of the value of the pieces cut. Using the typology proposed by W\u00e4scher et al. (2007), nesting problems, in general, are open-dimension problems with irregular pieces.\nIn this paper we consider a nesting problem in which we have to arrange a set of two-dimensional irregular shapes without overlapping in a rectangular stock sheet of a fixed width, where the objective is to minimize the required length. We will consider the pieces to be described as polygons, not necessarily convex, which cannot be rotated.\nThe main difficulty of nesting problems is to ensure that the pieces have a non-overlapping configuration. This question has been studied extensively in recent years and there are several approaches which determine when two polygons overlap. Bennell and Oliveira (2008) give a tutorial on the different approaches which study the geometry of nesting problems. The problem is NP-complete and as a result solution methodologies predominantly utilize heuristics.\n*Pixel/Raster*methods transform the continuous stock sheet into a discrete grid represented by a matrix, and the position of each piece adds a given coded value to each matrix element. Identifying possible overlapping comes down to checking the matrix values. There are three known codification schemes the first one proposed by Segenreich and Braga (1986), the second one by Oliveira and Ferreira (1993), and the last one by Babu and Babu (2001).\nWhen pieces are represented (or approximated) using polygons, there are tests for edge intersection and for point inclusion that can be used for identifying overlapping (Konopasek, 1981, Ferreira et al., 1998). The most widely used tool for checking whether two polygons overlap is the No-Fit Polygon (NFP). It can be used, along with the vector difference of the position of the two polygons, to determine whether these polygons overlap, touch or are separated, by conducting a simple test to identify whether the resulting vector is inside the NFP. There are three approaches to generating the NFP the orbiting algorithm by Mahadevan (1984), improved by Burke et al. (2007); the Minkowski sums used by Milenkovic et al. (1991) and Bennell and Dowsland (2001); and the decomposition into star-shaped polygons (Daniels et al., 1994) or convex polygons (Watson and Tobias, 1999, Agarwal et al., 2002).\nA more general tool that generalizes the NFP is the*Phi-function*. Its purpose is to represent all the mutual positions of two polygons. The*Phi-functions*for cutting and packing were conceived of and applied by Stoyan et al., 2001, Stoyan et al., 2004, Scheithauer et al. (2005). Bennell et al. (2010) provide a good explanation of how the*Phi-functions*can be built, as well as some applications for them.\nMany different heuristic and metaheuristic approaches have been proposed for solving nesting problems. Simple heuristic rules are used for building a solution step by step, placing one piece at a time, using different placement procedures and different piece sequences. Metaheuristic procedures are used for working with complete solutions and modifying them iterat...",

At its core is an innovative mixed integer programme model that places irregular pieces and defines guillotine cuts. The two-dimensional irregular shape bin [packing problem](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/packing-problem) with guillotine constraints arises in the glass cutting industry, for example, the cutting of glass for conservatories. Almost all cutting and packing problems that include guillotine cuts deal with rectangles only, where all cuts are orthogonal to the edges of the stock sheet and a maximum of two [angles of rotation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/angles-of-rotation) are permitted. The literature tackling packing problems with irregular shapes largely focuses on strip packing i.e. minimizing the length of a single fixed width stock sheet, and does not consider guillotine cuts. Hence, this problem combines the challenges of tackling the complexity of packing irregular pieces with free rotation, guaranteeing guillotine cuts that are not always orthogonal to the edges of the stock sheet, and allocating pieces to bins. To our knowledge only one other recent paper tackles this problem. We present a hybrid algorithm that is a constructive heuristic that determines the relative position of pieces in the bin and guillotine constraints via a mixed integer programme model. We investigate two approaches for allocating guillotine cuts at the same time as determining the placement of the piece, and a two phase approach that delays the allocation of cuts to provide flexibility in space usage. Finally we describe an improvement procedure that is applied to each bin before it is closed. This approach improves on the results of the only other publication on this problem, and gives competitive results for the classic rectangle bin packing problem with guillotine constraints.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe paper focuses on the two-dimensional bin packing problem (BBP) with irregular convex pieces and guillotine cuts. Guillotine cuts arise due to the cutting process of certain materials, where cuts are restricted to extend from one edge of the stock-sheet to another. This is commonly found in the glass cutting industry and research has almost exclusively focused on the cutting of rectangles where the cuts are orthogonal to the edges of the stock sheet. The problem tackled here is a generalized version of the rectangle single size stock sheet bin packing problem with guillotine constraints, where the pieces to be cut are irregular convex polygons and the guillotine cuts are not constrained to be orthogonal to the edges of the bin. We present a number of constructive heuristics that exploit a mixed integer programming (MIP) model for placing the pieces in the bin while satisfying all the geometric constraints and the guillotine cuts and provide comprehensive results for benchmark instances for this problem and the rectangular bin packing problem with guillotine cuts. The results are compared with the best in the literature and new lower bound is presented.\n\nThe motivation for tackling this problems arises in the cutting of glass sheets, for example, the glass panes for conservatories. Glass is cut by scoring and snapping the material. Each cut divides the sheet in two and is called a guillotine cut. As a result, only convex pieces can be cut directly. Since the properties of the material are homogeneous, pieces can be cut at any angle of rotation, and in some cases reflected. Typically, cutting plans involve multiple stock sheets. An example solution to this problem is given in Fig. 1. Note that the pieces must be removed by the guillotine cuts (in bold) in a specific order so that each cut begins and ends at the edge of the complete or divided stock sheet.\n\nThe requirement for guillotine cuts arise in many industries such as glass, wood boards or fibre glass for printed circuit boards. Each industrial setting implies a particular class of cutting and packing problem. For example, Malaguti et al. \\[15\\] consider a cutting stock problem with multiple stocksheets found in the wood industry, while Cui \\[8\\] tackles the cutting of metal of coils where a stock sheet is considered to have unrestricted length.\n\nThe literature tackling packing problems with irregular shapes largely focuses on strip packing i.e. minimizing the length of a single fixed width stock sheet, see \\[3\\], and does not consider guillotine cuts. Further, almost all cutting and packing problems that include guillotine cuts deal with rectangles only, where all cuts are orthogonal to the edges of the stock sheet and a maximum of two angles of rotation of the pieces are permitted. Hence, this problem combines the challenges of tackling the complexity of packing irregular pieces with free rotation, guaranteeing guillotine cuts that may or may not be orthogonal to the edges of the stock sheet, and allocating pieces to bins or stock sheets. To our knowledge, Han et al. \\[13\\] is the only other paper that tackles this problem. They propose two different construction heuristics. The first heuristic, they call a one-stage algorithm, constructs multiple parallel clusters of pieces by iteratively joining two blocks, where a block is either a piece or the convex hull of a cluster of pieces. Blocks are combined by matching pairs of edges and selecting the best match according to a dynamic solution evaluation function. Since each accepted match, starting with two individual pieces, is transformed into its convex block by taking the convex hull, the guillotine cut structure is always satisfied. The approach uses threshold parameters to control the number of blocks generated and as a result the computational time. The second constructive heuristic, a two-stage algorithm, combines pairs of p...",

      "title": "Rectangle blanket problem: Binary integer linear programming formulation and solution algorithms",
      "text": "<div><div><h2>Introduction</h2><section><p>The problem of approximately representing a two-dimensional image using multiple non-overlapping axis-aligned rectangles arises in many computer vision problems such as template matching (Zachmann, Mohr, Zachmann, 2010b) and people tracking (Demir\u00f6z, Salah, Akarun, 2014, Fleuret, Berclaz, Lengagne, Fua, 2008). A rectangle is axis-aligned if its adjacent (orthogonal) edges are parallel to <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> axes. An illustration for an approximation of the image with three rectangles is provided in Fig.\u00a01. Here, the rectangles determine a <em>rectangle blanket</em>. We define the blanket as a set of non-overlapping axis-aligned rectangles. It should be noticed that a blanket does not have to cover the image perfectly. There can be uncovered parts of the image as well as uncovering parts of the blanket. Besides, it can be connected or disconnected depending on the image it approximates. Nevertheless, it is possible to say that the number of rectangles forming a blanket directly effects the quality of the approximation: the higher it is, the finer the approximation becomes.</p><p>We formally define the <em>Rectangle Blanket Problem</em> (RBP) as determining a rectangle set that contains no more than <em>K</em> non-overlapping axis-aligned rectangles that minimizes the non-overlapping area with the given two-dimensional image (i.e. the uncovered area of the image and uncovering area of the blanket). This problem has similarities with <em>rectangle covering</em> (Chaiken, Kleitman, Saks, Shearer, 1981, Heinrich-Litan, Lubbecke, 2006, Stoyan, Romanova, Scheithauer, Krivulya, 2011), <em>rectangle partitioning</em> (Ohtsuki, 1982, O\u2019Rourke, Tewari, 2001) and <em>cutting/packing</em> (Dyckhoff, Scheithauer, Terno, 1997, Wascher, Haussner, Schumann, 2007) problems, which we try to outline briefly in the following lines. It is not our aim to provide a comprehensive review of the similarities and dissimilarites between all the works in these three fertile research areas and this one, but to use a number of examples to illustrate potentials for cross-fertilization of ideas and methodologies among RBP and the problems they study.</p><p>Rectangle covering and partitioning problems, and cutting/packing problems have attracted considerable research interest in the last three decades and sophisticated solution approaches have been proposed. As a consequence of the inherent difficulty of the problems (Culberson, Reckhow, 1994, Fowler, Paterson, Tanimoto, 1981, Haessler, Sweeney, 1991, Hochbaum, Maass, 1991) these are mostly heuristic methods. We direct interested readers to (Baldacci, Boschetti, Ganovelli, Maniezzo, 2014, Daniels, Inkulu, 2001) for didactic overviews. Despite the emergence of heuristics with considerably better quality of solutions, the research interest in methods based on mathematical formulation, has not waned. Furthermore, the availability of increased computational power made available by advances in hardware technology has accelerated the search for exact solution methods.</p><section><p>RBP and cutting/packing problems have a similar structure. First of all, two sets of elements, namely, a master object (i.e. input, supply, image) and a set of small items (i.e. output, demand, nonidentical rectangles) are defined. Second, small items are selected and grouped into a subset (i.e. a rectangle blanket) which is assigned to a large object such that the geometric condition (i.e. rectangles are non-overlapping and axis-aligned, but not necessarily lying within the image) holds, and a given objective function is optimized. As a result, it is possible to say that RBP is somewhat related to cutting/packing problems coded as 2/B/O/R or 2/B/O/M in particular, according to Dyckhoff\u2019s typology (Dychoff, 1990), which is improved later on by Wascher et\u00a0al. (2007) in order to clear away the ambiguities. RBP can be seen as an output maximization problem, and within this category of problems, it can be treated as a close relative of the two-dimensional single large object placement problem (SLOPP) according to Wacher et\u00a0al.\u2019s improved typology. However, although small items are rectangular, for two reasons, it is not possible to say that RBP exactly belongs to the family of the two-dimensional rectangular SLOPP with explicit upper bounds on the number of times a small item of particular type can be cut from the large object (Beasley, 1985b, Beasley, 2004, Christofides, Hadjiconstantinou, 1995, Christofides, Whitlock, 1977, Wang, 1983). First of all, in RBP, the upper bound is aggregated and the total number of rectangles is bounded. Besides, the master object, namely the image, has an irregular shape rather than rectangular, which pushes RBP towards irregular cutting/packing problems (Baldacci, Boschetti, Ganovelli, Maniezzo, 2014, Cherri, Mundim, Andretta, Toledo, Oliveira, Carravilla, 2016, Downsland, Downsland, 1995).</p><p>Mathematical programming formulations of cutting and packing problems are mixed-integer linear programs (MILPs) in general and their complexity depends on the geometric methodologies used to model constraints related to the type of interactions between the small items and their layout on the master object. The core geometric methodologies available in the literature are very well explained in the tutorial by Bennell and Oliveira (2008). There are four of them; but they can be grouped into two: the pixel/raster method and polygonal methods. The pixel/raster method divides the surface of the master object into discrete regions in order to represent it as a grid coded in the form of a matrix. One drawback of this representation is the inability to represent irregular shapes accurately. However, this is not the case when the D-function is used; it enables benefitting from the well known tests for line intersection and point intersection of direct trigonometry. Unfortunately the inefficiency in checking the feasibility is its weakness; it takes exponential time in the number of edges of the items, which is quadratic in the grid size for the pixel/raster method. The nofit polygon (NFP) is a polygonal construct that offers higher efficiency than direct trigonometry, and more accuracy, since it uses the original edges. The nofit polygon of two items <em>i</em> and <em>j</em> (NFP<sub><em>ij</em></sub>), is the locus of all points where the reference point of item <em>j</em> cannot be placed without overlapping item <em>i</em>. Unfortunately, calculating NFP<sub><em>ij</em></sub> is still a non-trivial task and can be very time consuming. Finally, the \u03a6-function is the most recent polygonal methodology invented to represent all mutual positions of two polygons (Stoyan, Scheithauer, Gil, Romanova, 2004, Stoyan, Terno, Scheithauer, Gil, Romanova, 2001). The major problem is the determination of the expression of a suitable \u03a6-function.</p><p>The proposed MILP formulations are not numerous. Some of them are compaction models hybridized with meta-heuristics. Compaction is known to be a difficult problem as well (Li &amp; Milenkovic, 1993). Compaction models can improve layouts by moving small items continuously on the master object without overlapping, by changing the relative positions of the pairs. A good example of this type of work is due to Gomes and Oliveira (2006). Their hybrid algorithm solves the Linear Programming (LP) relaxation of their MILP compaction formulation under the guidance of a simulated annealing search. The formulation uses NFP to model constraints preventing overlapping. The main drawback of this formulation is that its definition of non-overlapping constraints does not limit the relative positions of the small items strictly enough so that many different branches of a branch-and-bound (BB) tree can contain the same solution, when this formulation is used in a BB algorithm. Clearly, this can increase the inefficiency of the search. Fischetti and Luzzi (2009) develop another MILP ...",
