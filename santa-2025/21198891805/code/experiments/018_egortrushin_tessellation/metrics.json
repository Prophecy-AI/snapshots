  "findings": [
    "Tessellation with valid spacing (dx=1.0, dy=1.1) produces score 0.605 for N=18",
    "Baseline score for similar N is ~0.37 - tessellation is 63% WORSE",
    "All tessellation configurations failed to beat baseline",
    "The baseline uses sophisticated continuous angle optimization that tessellation cannot match"
  ],
  "conclusion": "Egortrushin tessellation approach produces WORSE scores than baseline. The baseline is at a very strong optimum that cannot be improved with grid-based approaches."
