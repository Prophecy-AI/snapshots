This is the game-changer:\nNo Compression: Since the exact polygonal shape is given, optimization through deformation (like real-world netting) is excluded.\nThe Constraint: We are strictly limited to finding the optimal rotation and translation for up to 200 rigid shapes while ensuring zero strict overlap (collision), only allowing for perfect contact.\n2\\. The Algorithmic Imperative\nTo succeed, the solution must focus entirely on robust geometric algorithms and advanced optimization techniques:\nPrecision is Key: The notebook's use of the Decimal type is a huge hint. This mandates that our solution relies on high-precision arithmetic to manage the complex geometry and avoid floating-point errors, especially in the crucial collision checks.\nThe Solving Method: The heavy lifting requires a powerful Metaheuristic like Simulated Annealing (SA). SA is necessary to efficiently search the vast, multi-dimensional solution space of 3N variables and minimize the side of the Minimum Bounding Square (our cost function).\n3\\. Conclusion\nThis challenge boils down to mastering Algorithmic Geometry and Stochastic Optimization (the core of the SA algorithm). Our submission will be the precise set of coordinates and angles that yields the mathematically tightest fit. It's a deep test of mathematical implementation!\n[https://lnkd.in/e-vyv4NJ](https://lnkd.in/e-vyv4NJ?trk=public_post-text)

You saw an interesting challenge or the big prize money but feel a bit lost about how to tackle the competition ?\nThis blog provides a broad overview of Kaggle competitions, guides you through the winning methodologies, and offers tips and tricks to help you tackle a Kaggle competition more effectively.\n## All you need to know about Kaggle competitions\n![](https://dataroots.ghost.io/content/images/2023/06/Untitled-1.png)Kaggle competition overview page\n\ud83d\udca1Kaggle is a platform where data enthusiasts come together to explore and analyse datasets and participate in machine learning competitions. The platform is a fun and collaborative space that encourages learning, problem-solving, and innovation.\nWhile Kaggle has grown substantially over the last few years to a more all-round data science hub, the competitions were and remain Kaggle\u2019s raison d\u2019\u00eatre and come in all shapes and forms but can be divided into three main (albeit slightly arbitrary) categories: getting-started , community competitions, and cash prize competitions.\nFirstly there are the**getting-started competitions**, such as the[Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic?ref=dataroots.ghost.io)or[Digit Recognizer](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer?ref=dataroots.ghost.io)ones. These are meant more as a sandbox with a well-defined goal to allow newcomers to become familiar with ML concepts, libraries and the Kaggle ecosystem in a fun way. Together with the**community competitions**, where someone just had an idea for an interesting competition, these generally list \u201ckudos\u201d, \u201cswag\u201d or \u201cknowledge\u201d as their prizes with the reasoning that the journey and knowledge gained on the way are more important than the destination.\nWhat actually tends to attract people to Kaggle are the**competitions with cash prizes**. These \u00a0attach prize money to top leaderboard spots and are usually set up by companies or research institutes that actually want a problem solved and would like the broader audience to take a shot at this. With prizes ranging from a few 100\u2019s to multiple 100 000\u2019s of dollars, these attract some of the best in their respective fields, which makes competing challenging but very rewarding.\nEvery single one of those competitions is defined by a**dataset**and an**evaluation score**. Here the labels from the dataset define the problem to be solved and the evaluation score is the single objective measure that indicates how well a solution solves this problem (and that will be used to rank the solutions for the leaderboard).\nWhile the********************train set********************is publicly available, the data used to evaluate solutions is not and is usually divided into two parts. First there is the**public leaderboard test set**which is used to calculate leaderboard scores while the competition is still going on. This can be used by teams to check how well their solution performs on unseen data and verify their validation strategy. Secondly there is the**private leaderboard test set.**This is used to calculate the private leaderboard scores, which decides ones actual final place, and these are only disclosed after the competition ended.\nThis not only prevents fine-tuning on the test data but also keeps things exiting since leaderboards can completely change last minute if people did (either intentionally or not) do this anyway. The resulting shuffle usually makes for some interesting drama where long-reigning champions fall from grace and unnoticed underdogs, who kept best practices in mind, suddenly rise to the top.\n### Notebooks\nTo compete one can either work on private resources (such as a local machine or cloud-hosted vm or compute instance) or use a Kaggle notebook.\nPrivate resources do have some advantages since one has full freedom about the environment, packages, etc. Especially if you want to use packages such as MLFlow or Tensorboard, which do not work in the Kaggle notebooks. Next to this, not having a limit to running times, memory and disk space can be quite convenient.\nThe Kaggle notebooks are Jupyter notebooks running on a maintained and standardised environment, hosted by Kaggle and they come with unlimited, free CPU time (with session limits of 12h) and 30h of GPU time (per user) each week for most of your parallel computing needs. This ensures that everybody who wants to compete can compete and is not limited by their hardware, which makes the competitions as democratic as possible. Additionally, you can easily import Kaggle datasets in a few seconds, which is especially convenient for the larger ones which can easily exceed 100s of GBs. Finally they are also the way to submit a solution to the competition. The submission notebook will have to read in a (private )test set and generate predictions on this set that will be used to calculate the leaderboard score. So even if you work on your own resources for training and fine-tuning, you will have to convert your code to a Kaggle notebook eventually.\n## How to take the W in a Kaggle competition ?\nIt is a matter of approach taken and how many of your ideas you could try out to finish high on the leaderboard !\nWe participated in the[Vesuvius Challenge - Ink Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/c/vesuvius-challenge-ink-detection?ref=dataroots.ghost.io)competition. While we did not win any prizes, some of the top Kaggle competitors shared their solutions after the competition ended. The methodology used by the winners seems to be more or less the same across the board. Interested to know them ? Let\u2019s break them down in few simple steps !\n### 1. Have a good understanding of the competition and how to tackle the problem\nAs the people who are organising these competitions often already spend a lot of time finding a good solution themselves, a ton of material might be already available. We would recommend you to:\n* Read the competition overview and linked resources thoroughly\n* Get familiar with the data. Look at samples, plot statistics, all the usual EDA\n* Check existing literature on approaches that were tried/succeeded in solving this or similar problems### 2. Get inspired by other participants\u2019 work to get started\nTo earn Kaggle medals or because they are genuinely nice, some competitors share their knowledge through making notebooks and datasets public or sharing findings and insights in discussions to get \u201cupvotes\u201d. We recommend reading the ones that got a lot of upvotes. This step is really a must as there are so much things to try out to improve your result it is impossible to cover everything with your team.\n![](https://dataroots.ghost.io/content/images/2023/06/Untitled--1--1.png)Go in the \"Code\" section of the competition page. You can select notebooks with the most votes and check the number of upvotes on the right side of the notebook\nBased on your readings, choose a clear and simple notebook with a decent LB score as**baseline**. Try to come up with a strategy on how to improve this baseline based on your thoughts and what you read from the shared work.\n### 3. Improve your model in an efficient way\nIn this phase, you will experiment a lot in the hopes of improving your LB. The goal here is to maximise the number of experiments you will try in a limited amount of time !\n##### Create datasets for intermediate results / preprocessed data\nSaved preprocessed datasets and trained models will make your results comparis...",

      "text": "[iframe](about:blank)\n\nTable of Contents\n\nExpand\n\nTable of Contents\n\n- [The Christmas Tree Options Strategy](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/christmastree.asp#toc-what-is-a-christmas-tree-options-strategy)\n\n- [How Christmas Trees Work](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/christmastree.asp#toc-how-christmas-trees-work)\n\n- [Examples](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/christmastree.asp#toc-examples)\n\n\nClose\n\n## What Is a Christmas Tree Options Strategy?\n\nA Christmas tree is an [options trading](https://www.investopedia.com/options-basics-tutorial-4583012) spread strategy achieved by buying and selling six call (or six put) options with different strikes but the same expiration dates for a neutral to bullish forecast. When using calls, the strategy is termed a long call Christmas tree. It is a put Christmas tree when the trader uses put options.\n\nThe strategy is available long (bullish) or short (bearish).\n\nThis spread is essentially the combination of a long vertical spread and two short vertical spreads.\n\n### Key Takeaways\n\n- A Christmas tree is an options spread strategy that involves 6 call (or put) options: buying one ATM call (put) selling 3x calls (puts) two strikes out of the money and then buy 2x more call (put) three strikes out of the money.\n- This strategy pays off with a neutral to slightly bullish outcome in the underlying security.\n- Christmas trees can be constructed with either all calls or all puts and may be structured as either long or short.\n\n## How Christmas Trees Work\n\nThe Christmas tree name comes from the strategy's very loose resemblance to a tree when viewed on an options chain display. The connection is tenuous at best.\n\nChristmas trees are similar to [butterfly spreads](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/butterflyspread.asp) in that they use multiple [vertical spreads](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/verticalspread.asp) to box in a desired potential return. The difference is that one of the strike prices is skipped, which introduces a directional bias.\n\nFor instance, if a condor spread involved the 50-55-60-65 strikes, the corresponding Christmas tree would involve just the 50-55-65 strikes (skipping the 60 strike).\n\nThe regular, or long Christmas tree with calls (sometimes referred to simply as a \"call tree\"), involves buying one call option with an [at-the-money](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/atthemoney.asp) strike, skipping the next strike, and then selling three options with the following strike. Finally, buy two more calls with the next higher strike. The 1-3-2 structure supposedly appears as a tree.\n\nThe strategy profits from a small increase in the price of the underlying asset and maxes when the underlying closes at the middle option strike price at options expiration.\n\n- Maximum profit equals middle [strike](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/strikeprice.asp) minus lower strike minus the premium.\n- Maximum loss is the net debit paid for the strategy.\n- Breakeven occurs at the lowest strike plus the premium paid or the highest strike minus half the premium.\n\nTime decay is on the holder's side as the holder wants all options except the lowest to expire worthless.\n\n## Examples\n\n### Long Christmas Tree With Calls\n\nFor example, with the underlying asset at $50.00:\n\n- Buy 1 call strike price 50.00\n- Sell 3 calls strike price 54.00\n- Buy 2 calls strike price 56.00\n\n### Long Christmas Tree With Puts\n\nWith this strategy, the holder is neutral to bearish. Sometimes referred to simply as a \"put tree.\"\n\n- Buy 1 put strike price 50.00\n- Sell 3 puts strike price 46.00\n- Buy 2 puts strike price 44.00\n\nMaximum profit is at an underlying asset price of 48.00 at expiration.\n\n- Maximum profit equals middle strike minus higher strike minus the premium.\n- Maximum loss is the net debit paid for the strategy.\n- Breakeven occurs at the lower strike plus half the premium paid or the highest strike minus the premium.\n\nMaximum loss is the premium paid to initiate the strategy.\n\n### Short Christmas Tree With Calls\n\nShort strategies should result in a net credit to the account when initiated. This strategy profits when the underlying asset moves by a minimum direction in either direction but it is capped. The bias is bearish because it does not take much of a move lower in the underlying asset to make the strategy profitable. However, a larger move higher may also result in a profit.\n\n- Sell 1 call strike price 50.00\n- Buy 3 calls strike price 54.00\n- Sell 2 calls strike price 56.00\n\nThe maximum profit is the net credit received.\n\n### Short Christmas Tree With Puts\n\nThis strategy results in a net credit to the account and profits when the underlying moves by a minimum in either direction. Profits come quicker with a smaller upside move although a larger downside move would also be profitable. Therefore, this strategy leans bullish.\n\n- Sell 1 put strike price 50.00\n- Buy 3 puts strike price 46.00\n- Sell 2 puts strike price 44.00\n\nThe maximum profit is the net credit received.\n\nTake the Next Step to Invest\n\nAdvertiser Disclosure\n\n\u00d7\n\nThe offers that appear in this table are from partnerships from which Investopedia receives compensation.

The final solution is evaluated by an ensemble score that combines all cases.\n**Notebook Link**:[Santa 2025 - Christmas Tree Packing Challenge V1](https://www.kaggle.com/code/adityapawar327/santa-2025-christmas-tree-packing-challenge-v1)\n**Public Score**: 85.92\n## Table of Contents\n[](#table-of-contents)\n* Library Imports and Environment Setup\n* Global Configuration and Precision Settings\n* ChristmasTree Class Definition\n* Utility Functions (Scoring/Collision)\n* Simulated Annealing Algorithm (N &lt; 20)\n* Grid Search Algorithm (N &gt;= 20)\n* Hybrid &amp; Ensemble Solvers\n* Main Computation Loop (N = 1 to 200)\n* Submission Formatting and Export\n## Methodology\n[](#methodology)\n* **Small N (&lt; 20):**Uses Simulated Annealing for efficient search in small configuration spaces.\n* **Large N (&gt;= 20):**Uses a tailored Grid Search for tractable solution space exploration.\n* **Hybrid/Ensemble:**Runs multiple seeds and chooses the best solution for each N.\n* **Collision Detection:**Employs Shapely geometry operations to prevent tree overlap.\n* **Performance:**Code leverages parallelization (`ProcessPoolExecutor`) and high-precision (Decimal) arithmetic.\n## Usage\n[](#usage)\n1. Install dependencies:\n* `shapely`,`numpy`,`pandas`,`matplotlib`,`tqdm`\n* Run the notebook or script sequentially to output results and save a`submission.csv`.\n* Check the score on important N cases (e.g., 1, 10, 25, 50, 100, 150, 200).\n## Output\n[](#output)\n* The notebook prints key logs during computation.\n* A`submission.csv`is generated with columns:`id`,`x`,`y`,`deg`(example row:`001\\_0, s-9.146226, s-0.12832, s-224.999647`).\n## License\n[](#license)\nThis project is released under the[Apache 2.0 License](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).\n## Author\n[](#author)\nAditya Pawar ([Kaggle Profile](https://www.kaggle.com/adityapawar327))\nFor questions or collaboration, feel free to reach out via Kaggle discussions or connect on[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adityapawar327).\n## About\nIn this re-defined optimization problem, help Santa fit Christmas tree toys into the smallest (2-dimension) parcel size possible so that ...",
