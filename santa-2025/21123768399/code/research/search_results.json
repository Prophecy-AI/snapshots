This approach, introduced by Korf\u202f(2003) and later refined by Huang\u202f&\u202fKorf (2009, 2013), can solve optimal rectangle\u2011packing instances far beyond earlier benchmarks (e.g., extending the consecutive\u2011square benchmark from\u202fN\u202f=\u202f27 to\u202fN\u202f=\u202f32) and has been adapted to non\u2011rectangular polygons by exploiting the same coordinate\u2011ordering and pruning ideas ([Korf\u202f2003](https://cdn.aaai.org/ICAPS/2003/ICAPS03-029.pdf); [Huang\u202f2009](https://ijcai.org/Proceedings/09/Papers/092.pdf); [Huang\u202f2013](https://jair.org/index.php/jair/article/view/10797)).  \n\nWhen optimality is infeasible for larger or irregular instances, **approximation and heuristic schemes** dominate.

One particular category of these packing problems is\ntwo-dimensional packing, which is encountered in everyday scenarios like arranging items\non a shelf and in industrial applications such as cutting cookies from rolled-out dough\nor manufacturing sets of tiles from standard-sized panels made of wood, glass, or metal.\nAnother intriguing example involves cutting fabric pieces for clothing production. In this\ncase, the pieces often cannot be rotated freely, as they must adhere to a desired pattern\nin the final product, which is tailored of multiple elements. The widespread applicability\nof two-dimensional packing problems has led to a surge of interest in designing efficient\nalgorithms to address them. In this paper, we follow the line of research and study the\nproblem of packing convex polygons without rotations in various settings depending on the\ntype of containers used.\nPast research focusing on theoretical considerations of two-dimensional packings mainly\nconcentrates on the scenario when all objects are axis-parallel rectangles. In this paper, we\nwill discuss packing without rotations, in which only translations are permitted. There are\ntwo main classes of the problem depending on whether the size of the container is fixed and\nwe want to minimize the number of containers used or whether we want to minimize the\ncontainer\u2019s size with respect to some objective function.\nA seminal example of the first class is the Geometric Bin Packing problem in which\na number of unit size squared bins to pack is to be minimized. The problem is arguably\nthe most natural generalization of the regular (1D) Bin Packing to two dimensions, and\nits absolute approximability has been fully understood. Unless P = N P, the best possible\nefficient constant factor approximation is 2 [15], and such an algorithm is known [10].\nIn the second class, there are several variants to be considered. An example is the\nStrip Packing Problem which is concerned with packing objects into a strip of width\n1 and infinite height in such a way that the maximum of all the heights of the placed\nobjects is minimized. Like Geometric Bin Packing, Strip Packing generalizes (1D)\nBin Packing. The best known efficient constant factor approximation for Strip Packing\nhas approximation factor (5/3 + \u03f5) [9]. It is known that there can not exist a polynomial\ntime algorithm with an approximation ratio of (3/2 \u2212 \u03f5) for any \u03f5 > 0 unless P = N P, which\nfollows directly from the approximation hardness of (1D) Bin Packing. Both classes of\nproblems have been also considered in the asymptotic setting, see e.g. [11, 5, 12].\nIn younger time, there was also an increase of interest in cases where the objects in\nquestion are general convex polygons. Alt, de Berg and Knauer [2, 3] considered the problem\nof packing an instance consisting of a number of convex polygons of the form p \u2282 [0, 1]2into\na minimum area axis-parallel rectangular container. We refer to this problem as Polygon\nArea Minimization throughout this paper. In the special case where the instance consists\nof rectangles only, the problem is known to admit a PTAS [4]. They proved the existence of\nthe following efficient algorithm:\nA 23.78-approximation for Polygon Area Minimization.\nRecently, Aamand, Abrahamsen, Beretta and Kleist [1] showed that the algorithm of Alt,\nde Berg and Knauer can be leveraged to obtain also efficient approximation algorithms of\nfurther problems:\nA 7-approximation for Polygon Perimeter Minimization.\nA 51-approximation for Polygon Strip Packing.\nAn 11-approximation for Polygon Bin Packing for polygons with diameter at most 1\n10 .\nA. Kurpisz and S. Suter 3\n1.1 Our results\nThe results of Alt, de Berg and Knauer [2, 3] and Aamand et al. [1] are heavily based on\nso-called shelf packing algorithms. In shelf packing algorithms, the objects are first placed\non the shelves, possibly ordered by height, which are later stacked on one another to build\na final solution. Compared to axis-parallel rectangles, the main challenge in designing an\napproximation algorithm for polygon packing problems is that objects cannot be sorted by\nheight and orientation simultaneously. As a result, the algorithm and its analysis in [2, 3]\nhave such a large approximation guarantee. In this paper, we provide new insight into how\nshelf packing algorithms should be applied to polygon packing problems. We introduce a\nsequence of transformations of the objects that allow us first to sort them by height and later\nby orientation to build a solution of a much better approximation guarantee. More precisely,\nwe design polynomial-time algorithms with the following factors:\nA 9.45-approximation for Polygon Area Minimization.\nUsing this algorithm as a subroutine, we build upon the methods from Aamand et al. [1] to\nobtain the following efficient approximation algorithms:\nA (3.75 + \u03f5)-approximation for Polygon Perimeter Minimization.\nA 21.89-approximation for Polygon Strip Packing.\nA 5.09-approximation for Polygon Bin Packing for polygons which have their diameter\nbounded by 1\n10 .\nThe results are proved in Sections 4, 5, 6, and 7 respectively. Furthermore, in Section 8\nwe show the following results, which make progress towards solving an open question of a\nO(1)-approximation algorithm for Polygon Bin Packing for arbitrary polygons.\nThere is an efficient O(\n1\n\u03b4\n)-approximation algorithm for Polygon Bin Packing for\ninstances where each polygon has width or height at most 1 \u2212 \u03b4.\nThere is an efficient O(1)-approximation algorithm for Polygon Bin Packing for\ninstances with the property that all polygons share a spine (up to translation) with height\nat least 3\n4\n.\n2 Preliminaries\nWe start out considerations by recalling a classical and well-known problem in theoretical\ncomputer science, the Bin Packing problem: Given a list of numbers s1, . . . , sn \u2208 (0, 1] \u2229 Q,\nrepresenting the sizes of n objects, the goal is to find the minimum number of bins of size 1,\nso that we can pac...",

The improved algorithm can cope with complex cases and is given an implementation in detail. The proposed concept of a touching group can simplify the judging process when recognizing the potential translation vector for an orbital polygon. In addition, the generation of the no-fit polygon only involves three main steps based on the proposed concept. The proposed algorithm has a mechanism that searches other start positions to generate a complete no-fit polygon for handling complex cases. To improve the efficiency, many acceleration strategies have been proposed, such as point exclusion strategy and point inclusion test. The robust and efficient performance of the algorithm is tested by well-known benchmark instances and degenerate and complex cases, such as holes, interlocking concavities and jigsaw-type pieces. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can produce complete no-fit polygons for complex cases, and acceleration strategies can reduce the creation time of no-fit polygon on benchmark instances by more than sixteen percent on average.\nKeywords:\n[no-fit polygon](https://www.mdpi.com/search?q=no-fit+polygon);[irregular packing problem](https://www.mdpi.com/search?q=irregular+packing+problem);[sliding algorithm](https://www.mdpi.com/search?q=sliding+algorithm);[cutting](https://www.mdpi.com/search?q=cutting);[configuration space obstacle](https://www.mdpi.com/search?q=configuration+space+obstacle)\nMSC:\n90; 68; 51\n## 1. Introduction\nIn the field of cutting and packing problems, there is a kind of problem known as the two-dimensional (2D) irregular packing problem or the nesting problem. It is commonly encountered in many industries and applications, such as metal sheet cutting [1,2], leather [3], clothing [4], paper [5] and spatial arrangement [6]. Through excellent algorithms to optimize the packing, even a one percent increase in the material utilization rate will save lots of resource costs for enterprises and generate huge economic benefits for the whole society. Despite the many practical applications and benefits, the problem has received relatively little attention in the literature when compared to the regular packing problem [7,8,9]. One of the main reasons is that researchers have to deal with the geometry problem, which is the first obstacle they encounter. This means that satisfying the constraint of having all irregular pieces without overlapping is much harder than regular pieces.\nDirect trigonometry involving line intersection and point inclusion testing is the classic method to identify the positional relationship between two polygons. However, the optimization algorithms will become inefficient when it adopts this method, which results in the slightly poor performance of the algorithms. The alternative used in irregular packing problems is the no-fit polygon (NFP), which is also used in the field of engineering and robot motion planning and the aircraft parking stand allocation problem [10]. The no-fit polygon facilitates the research of irregular packing problems [11,12,13,14]. It is an increasingly popular option since it is more efficient than direct trigonometry, particularly when using an iterative search. Determining whether polygons overlap, touch, or are separated only needs to conduct a simple test to identify whether the reference point is inside the NFP. Essentially, the no-fit polygon describes the region in which two polygons intersect. The computational efficiency gained by utilizing this method is very attractive. Hence, it is important to develop an algorithm for creating NFP for the research of irregular packing problems. The algorithm can enrich the application in 2D geometrical computer software.\nHowever, there are few published works on algorithms for generating NFP. Note the fact that developing a robust geometry library is still needed, and this task is very time-consuming and difficult. Furthermore, it is difficult to develop a robust NFP generator because of the complexity of irregular piece shapes. Thus, we propose an improved sliding algorithm for the generation of NFP and give an implementation in detail of our algorithm. Such an algorithm can become good preparation for applying more strategies to solve the irregular packing problem. For instance, in the work published by Costa et al. [15], if the NFP algorithm is efficient, it can directly calculate the new merged piece instead of approximating by one already computed because of this time-consuming operation. In other words, the more efficient the algorithm is, the better.\nThe proposed algorithm only involves two simple geometric stages. The first is generating the external NFP between two polygons, which includes three main steps: finding the touching group, determining the translation vector from all touching groups and computing the translation distance. The second stage is searching on the unvisited edges to determine whether there is a feasible starting point that can be found. If the starting point is available, then return to the first stage to generate the NFP.\nThe contributions of this study are:\n* To address the problem of the efficient and robust creation of the no-fit polygon;\n* To propose an improved sliding algorithm and provide a detailed implementation;\n* To present the concept of touching group, resulting in the number of cases to consider being reduced by half when determining the feasible translation vector;\n* To develop many acceleration strategies to improve the algorithm\u2019s efficiency, such as the point exclusion strategy, the right side test, and the point inclusion test;\n* To assess the performance of the proposed alg...",

      "text": "New Improvements in Optimal Rectangle Packing\nEric Huang and Richard E. Korf\nComputer Science Department\nUniversity of California, Los Angeles\nLos Angeles, CA 90095\nehuang@cs.ucla.edu, korf@cs.ucla.edu\nAbstract\nThe rectangle packing problem consists of find\u0002ing an enclosing rectangle of smallest area that can\ncontain a given set of rectangles without overlap.\nOur algorithm picks the x-coordinates of all the\nrectangles before picking any of the y-coordinates.\nFor the x-coordinates, we present a dynamic vari\u0002able ordering heuristic and an adaptation of a prun\u0002ing algorithm used in previous solvers. We then\ntransform the rectangle packing problem into a per\u0002fect packing problem that has no empty space, and\npresent inference rules to reduce the instance size.\nFor the y-coordinates we search a space that models\nempty positions as variables and rectangles as val\u0002ues. Our solver is over 19 times faster than the pre\u0002vious state-of-the-art on the largest problem solved\nto date, allowing us to extend the known solutions\nfor a consecutive-square packing benchmark from\nN=27 to N=32.\n1 Introduction\nGiven a set of rectangles, our problem is to find all enclosing\nrectangles of minimum area that will contain them without\noverlap. We refer to an enclosing rectangle as a bounding\nbox. The optimization problem is NP-hard, while the prob\u0002lem of deciding whether a set of rectangles can be packed in\na given bounding box is NP-complete, via a reduction from\nbin-packing [Korf, 2003]. The consecutive-square packing\nbenchmark is a simple set of increasingly difficult bench\u0002marks for this problem, where the task is to find the bounding\nboxes of minimum area that contain a set of squares of sizes\n1x1, 2x2, ..., up to NxN [Korf, 2003]. For example, Figure 1\nis an optimal solution for N=32. We use this benchmark here\nbut none of the techniques introduced in this paper are spe\u0002cific to packing squares as opposed to rectangles.\nRectangle packing has many practical applications. It ap\u0002pears when loading a set of rectangular objects on a pallet\nwithout stacking them, and also in VLSI design where rect\u0002angular circuit components must be packed onto a rectangu\u0002lar chip. Various other cutting stock and layout problems also\nhave rectangle packing at their core.\nFigure 1: An optimal solution for N=32 with a bounding box\nof 85x135.\n511\n(a) Compulsory part of a 5x2 at\nx=[0,2]\n(b) Assigning a 4x2 to [0,2].\nFigure 2: Examples of compulsory parts and intervals.\n2 Previous Work\nKorf [2003] divided the rectangle packing problem into two\nsubproblems: the minimal bounding box problem and the\ncontainment problem. The former finds a bounding box of\nleast area that can contain a given set of rectangles, while the\nlatter tries to pack the given rectangles in a given bounding\nbox. The algorithm that solves the minimal bounding box\nproblem calls the algorithm that solves the containment prob\u0002lem as a subroutine.\n2.1 Minimal Bounding Box Problem\nA simple way to solve the minimal bounding box problem\nis to find the minimum and maximum areas that describe\nthe set of feasible and potentially optimal bounding boxes.\nBounding boxes of all dimensions can be generated with ar\u0002eas within this range, and then tested in non-decreasing order\nof area until all feasible solutions of smallest area are found.\nThe minimum area is the sum of the areas of the given rectan\u0002gles. The maximum area is determined by the bounding box\nof a greedy solution found by setting the bounding box height\nto that of the tallest rectangle, and then placing the rectangles\nin the first available position when scanning from left to right,\nand for each column scanning from bottom to top.\n2.2 Containment Problem\nKorf\u2019s [2003] absolute placement approach modeled rectan\u0002gles as variables and empty locations in the bounding box\nas values. Moffitt and Pollack\u2019s [2006] relative placement ap\u0002proach used a variable for every pair of rectangles to represent\nthe relations above, below, left, and right. Absolute place\u0002ment was faster than relative placement [Korf et al., 2009],\nwhich in turn was faster than the methods of Clautiaux et al.\n[2007] and Beldiceanu et al. [2008].\nSimonis and O\u2019Sullivan [2008] used Clautiaux et al.\u2019s\n[2007] variable order with additional constraints from\nBeldiceanu et al. [2008] to greatly outperform Korf et al.\u2019s\nsolver [2009]. They used Prolog\u2019s backtracking engine to\nsolve a set of constraints which they specified prior to the\nsearch effort. They first assigned the x-coordinates of all\nthe rectangles before any of the y-coordinates. Since we use\nsome of these ideas, we review them here.\nSimonis and O\u2019Sullivan [2008] used two sets of redundant\nvariables for the x-coordinates. The first set of N variables\ncorrespond to \u201cintervals\u201d where a rectangle is assigned an\ninterval of x-coordinates. Interval sizes are hand-picked for\neach rectangle prior to search, and they induce a smaller rect\u0002angle representing the common intersecting area of placing\nthe rectangle in any location in the interval [Beldiceanu et\nal., 2008]. Larger intervals result in weaker constraint prop\u0002agation (less pruning) but a smaller branching factor, while\nsmaller intervals result in stronger constraint propagation but\na larger branching factor.\nAs shown in Figure 2b, a 4x2 rectangle assigned an x\u0002interval of [0,2] consumes 2 units of area at each x-coordinate\nin [2,3], represented by the doubly-hatched area. This \u201ccom\u0002pulsory profile\u201d [Beldiceanu et al., 2008] is a constraint com\u0002mon to all positions x \u2208 [0, 2] of the original 4x2 rectan\u0002gle. If there were no feasible set of interval assignments, then\nthe constraint would save us from having to try individual x\u0002values. However, if we do find a set of interval assignments,\nthen we must search for a set of single x-coordinate val\u0002ues. Simonis and O\u2019Sullivan [2008] used a total of 4N vari\u0002ables, assigning (in order) x-intervals, single x-coordinates,\ny-intervals, and finally single y-coordinates.\n3 Overall Search Strategy\nWe separate the containment problem from the minimal\nbounding box problem, and use Korf et al.\u2019s [2009] al\u0002gorithm to solve the latter problem. Like Simonis and\nO\u2019Sullivan [2008], we assign all x-coordinates prior to any y\u0002coordinates, and use interval variables for the x-coordinates.\nWe set a rectangle\u2019s interval size to 0.35 times its width,\nwhich gave us the best performance. Finally, we do not use\ninterval variables for the y-coordinates. All of the remaining\nideas presented in this paper are our contributions.\nAlthough we use some ideas used by Simonis and\nO\u2019Sullivan [2008], we do not take a constraint programming\napproach in which all constraints are specified to a general\npurpose solver like Prolog, prior to the search effort. Instead,\nwe have implemented our program from scratch in C++, al\u0002lowing us to easily choose which constraints and inferences to\nuse at what time, and giving us more flexibility during search.\nFor example, as we will explain later, we make different in\u0002ferences depending on the partial solution.\nWe implemented a chronological backtracking algorithm\nwith dynamic variable ordering and forward checking. Our\nalgorithm works in three stages as it goes from the root of the\nsearch tree down to the leaves:\n1. It first works on the x-coordinates in a model where\nvariables are rectangles and values are x-coordinate lo\u0002cations, using dynamic variable ordering by area and a\nconstraint that detects infeasible subtrees.\n2. For each x-coordinate solution found, it conducts a per\u0002fect packing transformation, applies inference rules to\nreduce the transformed problem size, and derives conti\u0002guity constraints between rectangles.\n3. It then searches for a set of y-coordinates in a model\nwhere variables are empty corners and values are rect\u0002angles.\n4 Assigning X-Coordinates\nFor the x-coordinates, we propose a dynamic variable order\nand a constraint adapted from Korf\u2019s [2003] wasted-space\npruning heuristic. For a bounding box of size WxH we use\n512\nan array of size W representing the...",

Our rectangle packer chooses the x-coordinates of all the rectangles before any of the y-coordinates. We then transform the problem into a perfect-packing problem with no empty space by adding additional rectangles. To determine the y-coordinates, we branch on the different rectangles that can be placed in each empty position. Our packer allows us to extend the known solutions for a consecutive-square benchmark from 27 to 32 squares. We also introduce three new benchmarks, avoiding properties that make a benchmark easy, such as rectangles with shared dimensions. Our third benchmark consists of rectangles of increasingly high precision. To pack them efficiently, we limit the rectangles' coordinates and the bounding box dimensions to the set of subset sums of the rectangles' dimensions. Overall, our algorithms represent the current state-of-the-art for this problem, outperforming other algorithms by orders of magnitude, depending on the benchmark.\n## Article Details\nIssue\n[Vol. 46 (2013)](https://jair.org/index.php/jair/issue/view/1130)\nSection\nArticles\n## news\nNEWS\n[AAAI Contributes to JAIR Sustainability Campaign](https://jair.org/index.php/jair/News#AAAIContribution)\n[Reproducibility Initiative](https://jair.org/index.php/jair/News#Reproducibility)\n[2025 IJCAI-JAIR Prize Awarded](https://jair.org/index.php/jair/News#IJCAI-JAIR)\n[Special Track on Multi-Agent Path Finding](https://jair.org/index.php/jair/News#Special-TrackMAPF)\n[JAIR Available in ACM Library](https://jair.org/index.php/jair/News#ACM)\n[JAIR Sustainability Campaign: Help Support Us](https://jair.org/index.php/jair/News#sustainability)\n## submission\nSUBMISSIONS\nJAIR invites submissions in all areas of AI.

      "text": "Optimal Rectangle Packing: Initial Results\nRichard E. Korf\nComputer Science Department\nUniversity of California, Los Angeles\nLos Angeles, CA 90095\nkorf@cs.ucla.edu\nAbstract\nGiven a set of rectangles with fixed orientations, we want to\nfind an enclosing rectangle of minimum area that contains\nthem all with no overlap. Many simple scheduling tasks can\nbe modelled by this NP-complete problem. We use an any\u0002time branch-and-bound algorithm to solve the problem op\u0002timally. Our main contributions are a lower-bound on the\namount of wasted space in a partial solution, based on a re\u0002laxation of the problem to one-dimensional bin packing, and\na dominance condition that allows us to ignore many par\u0002tial solutions. For our experiments, we choose a class of in\u0002creasingly difficult square-packing problems as a simple and\neasily-specified benchmark. The square-packing problem of\nsize N is to find the smallest rectangle that contains the 1x1,\n2x2, etc. up to NxN square. We find optimal solutions to\nthese problems up to size N=22. For comparison, we also\nfind the best slicing solutions, a popular approximation al\u0002gorithm. Our approach is rather general, and many of our\ntechniques can be applied to packing non-rectangular shapes\nin non-rectangular enclosing regions, and higher-dimensional\npacking problems as well.\nIntroduction and Overview\nConsider the following very simple scheduling problem: We\nhave a set of independent jobs, each of which requires a cer\u0002tain number of workers for a certain amount of time. We as\u0002sume that the jobs are indivisible, meaning they can\u2019t be bro\u0002ken down into smaller subtasks. If they can be decomposed,\nwe break them down into their indivisible components, and\nthen consider the components as jobs. All workers work the\nsame hours, and are paid for their whole shift, whether they\nare busy or idle. We can adjust the number of workers, and\nthe total amount of time. We\u2019d like to minimize the total\nlabor cost to complete all the jobs, which is proportional to\nthe number of workers times the number of hours they are\nat work. Alternatively, we may want to complete all jobs as\nquickly as possible, using as many workers as necessary. As\nanother alternative, we may want to minimize the number of\nworkers, and complete all the jobs as soon as possible given\nthat number of workers. A closely related problem is how to\nschedule a set of tasks that require a certain resource level,\nsuch as electric power on a spacecraft, for a given amount\nCopyright \u0001c 2003, American Association for Artificial Intelli\u0002gence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved.\nof time, so that all tasks are completed as soon as possible\nwithout exceeding a maximum resource capacity.\nWe can model these problems as rectangle-packing prob\u0002lems. Each job is represented by a rectangle, where one\ndimension is the number of workers needed, and the other\nis the amount of time required. The total number of work\u0002ers is the height of an enclosing rectangle, and the length\nof time is the width. All the job rectangles must be packed\ninto the enclosing rectangle, with no overlap. Minimizing\nthe total labor cost amounts to finding the enclosing rect\u0002angle of minimum area that contains all the job rectangles.\nTo minimize the number of workers, we want an enclosing\nrectangle of minimum width, whose height is the maximum\nnumber of workers needed for any job. Similarly, to mini\u0002mize the amount of time, we want an enclosing rectangle of\nminimum height, whose width is the amount of time needed\nfor the longest job.\nOf course, in reality there will be other constraints on the\njobs, such as precedence constraints between jobs. Such\nconstraints can be easily added to our solution algorithm, re\u0002sulting in the pruning of partial solutions that don\u2019t satisify\nthe constraints. This pruning will make it easier to deter\u0002mine that a particular enclosing rectangle can\u2019t contain all\nthe job rectangles, but potentially more difficult to find a\nfeasible solution within a particular enclosing rectangle. For\nsimplicity, we consider the unconstrained case here, which\nis a subproblem of the more general case.\nRectangle packing has other applications as well. In the\ndesign of VLSI chips, circuit blocks such as processors,\nmemory, and I/O drivers must be assigned to physical re\u0002gions of the chip. Another application is cutting a set of\nrectangles out of a single piece of stock material. A re\u0002lated problem is loading a set of rectangular objects onto a\ncargo pallet. An important difference between the schedul\u0002ing problem described above and these other applications\nis that in the scheduling problem the orientation of the job\nrectangles is fixed, since workers and time are often not in\u0002terchangeable. In VLSI design or cutting-stock problems,\nhowever, we can rotate our rectangles by ninety degrees. In\nthis paper, we consider the fixed-orientation problem, and\nonly briefly discuss the extension to unoriented rectangles.\nWe focus here on optimal solutions, but develop an any\u0002time algorithm. In other words, our algorithm finds an ap\u0002proximate solution immediately, and as it continues to run it\nICAPS 2003 287 \nFrom: ICAPS-03 Proceedings. Copyright \u00a9 2003, AAAI (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved. \nfinds better solutions, until it eventually finds and verifies an\noptimal solution. This eliminates solution quality as a vari\u0002able in comparisons with other work. Furthermore, finding\noptimal solutions allows us to characterize the quality of ap\u0002proximate solutions. For example, we evaluate the quality\nof slicing solutions in our experiments.\nWe first show that rectangle-packing problem is NP\u0002complete, and then briefly consider related work. We then\nconsider how to pack a set of rectangles into an enclosing\nrectangle of fixed dimensions, using a branch-and-bound al\u0002gorithm. In particular, we introduce a lower-bound on the\namount of wasted space in a partial solution, based on a\nrelaxation of the problem to one-dimensional bin packing.\nWe also introduce a dominance condition that allows us to\nprune parts of the search space. We then show how to ef\u0002ficiently search the two-dimensional space of different en\u0002closing rectangles to find one with the smallest area that will\ncontain all the given rectangles. To test our algorithm, we we\nfind the enclosing rectangle of smallest area that will con\u0002tain a 1x1, 2x2, 3x3, etc., up to n \u00d7 n square. We choose\nthe special case of square packing because we can specify\na set of increasingly difficult problem instances with just a\nsingle parameter n, making it easier for other researchers to\ncompare their results to ours. Our algorithms, however, do\nnot take advantage of the fact that our rectangles are squares,\nwith one minor exception. We present optimal solutions for\nall problems up to size n = 22, and also the best of a class\nof approximate solutions. Finally, we conclude with further\nideas to improve the performance of our algorithms and gen\u0002eralize our techniques.\nRectangle Packing is NP-Complete\nThe specific decision problem we consider in this section is\ngiven a set of rectangles with fixed orientation, and a specific\nenclosing rectangle, can all the given rectangles fit within the\nboundaries of the enclosing rectangle without any overlap?\nWe show that this problem is NP-complete, by showing that\nthe problem is in NP, and that it is NP-hard.\nIt is clear that this problem can be solved in non\u0002deterministic polynomial time. Given an assignment of the\nrectangles to positions within the enclosing rectangle, it is\neasy to check in polynomial time that no rectangle extends\nbeyond the boundary of the enclosing rectangle, and that no\ntwo rectangles overlap.\nTo show that rectangle packing is NP-hard, we demon\u0002strate that bin packing can be reduced in polynomial time to\nrectangle packing. In other words, if rectangle packing can\nbe solved in polynomial time, then so can bin packing. An\ninstance of the bin-packing decision problem consists of a\nset of numbers, along with a fixed set of bins, each with the\nsame fi...",

Grandoni, E. Husi\u0107, M. Mari and A. Tinguely XX:1\n1 Introduction\nThe Maximum Independent Set of Convex Polygons problem (MISP) is a natural geometric\npacking problem with many applications in map labeling [13, 39], cellular networks [34],\nunsplittable flow [6], chip manufacturing [27], or data mining [18, 33]. Given a set of n\nconvex polygons in the plane, the goal is to select a maximum number of them such that the\npolygons are pairwise non-overlapping.\nMISP is NP-hard [16, 28], hence it makes sense to design approximation algorithms for it.\nDisappointingly, the best (polynomial-time) approximation ratio for MISP (more precisely\nfor k-intersecting curves) has been n\n\u03b5\n[17], for any fixed constant \u03b5 > 0. This ratio has\nrecently been improved to OPT\u03b5[12].\nApproximation Schemes. Interestingly, there is a quasi-polynomial time approximation\nscheme (QPTAS) for MISP [1] (if the polygons have at most quasi-polynomially many\nvertices in total). Thus, the problem is not APX-Hard, assuming NP \u2288 DTIME(2polylog(n)),\nsuggesting that it should be possible to obtain a polynomial time approximation scheme\n(PTAS) for the problem.\nIf we assume that we are allowed to shrink the polygons by a factor 1\u2212\u03b4 for an arbitrarily\nsmall constant \u03b4, then there is a PTAS for the problem [40]. Note that here the output is\ncompared to the optimal solution without shrinking.\nWhen the input polygons are fat, e.g., regular polygons, then PTASes are known [9, 15].\nAxis-parallel rectangles. A prominent special case of MISP that has attracted a lot of\nattention over the years is the maximum independent set of axis-parallel rectangles (MISR),\nwhere all the polygons are rectangles with their edges parallel with the axes. An O(log n)\napproximation for MISR was given in [30, 38]. This was slightly improved to O(log n/ log log n)\nin [10], and substantially improved to O(log log n) in [7]. In a recent breakthrough result,\nMitchell [36] presented the first constant factor approximation algorithm with approximation\nratio 10, and later 3 + \u03b5 in an updated version [37] with a considerably shorter case analysis.\nSubsequently, his approach was simplified and improved to a (2 +\u03b5)-approximation algorithm\nby G\u00e1lvez, Khan, Mari, M\u00f6mke, Reddy, and Wiese [21, 22]. These approaches rely on a\ndynamic program that considers all the partitions of a bounding box containing the instance\ninto a number of containers with constant complexity (constant number of line segments).\nOur contribution. With the goal of better understanding the approximability of MISP, in\nthis paper, we consider the following natural special case of MISP: d-MISP is the special case of\nMISP where the edges of the input polygons are parallel to a given set D of d = |D| directions.\nNotice that MISR is equivalent to 2-MISP. Our main result is a constant approximation for\nd-MISP when d is a constant.\n\u25b6 Theorem 1. There exists an 8d/3-approximation algorithm for d-MISP running in time\nO((nd)\nO(d4\nd\n)\n).\nOur result builds on the approaches in [21, 22, 37], however we have to face several additional\ncomplications. In particular, already for d = 3 the algorithm and its analysis deviates\nsubstantially from the known (polynomial-time) results in the literature about axis-aligned\nrectangles. An overview of our approach is given in Section 3.\nRelated Work. One can consider a natural weighted version of MISP, where each convex\npolygon has a positive weight, and the goal is to find an independent set of maximum total\nweight. The weighted version of MISR was studied in the literature, and the current-best\npolynomial time approximation factor is O(log log n) [8]. We remark that our approach,\nlikewise the approaches in [21, 22, 36], does not seem to extend to the weighted case.

The edge e3(P) is degenerate.\nparticular, finding a constant approximation for weighted MISR remains a challenging open\nproblem. We remark that the QPTAS in [1] extends to the weighted case, hence suggesting\nthat the weighted version of MISP might also admit a PTAS.\nMISR was also studied in terms of parameterized algorithms. Marx [35] proved that\nthe problem is W[1]-hard, which rules out the existence of an EPTAS. A parameterized\napproximation scheme for the problem is given in [23].\nA rectangle packing problem related to MISR is the 2D Knapsack problem. Here we\nare given an axis-parallel square (the knapsack) and a collection of axis-parallel rectangles.\nThe goal is to pack a maximum cardinality (or weight) subset of rectangles in the knapsack\n(without rotations). 2D Knapsack admits a QPTAS [2] and a few constant approximation\nalgorithms are known [19, 20, 29]. Here as well, finding a PTAS is a challenging open\nproblem.\nBonsma et al. [6] established an intriguing connection between MISR and the Unsplittable\nFlow on a Path problem. A PTAS for the latter problem was recently obtained [24], closing\na very long line of research (see, e.g., [3, 4, 5, 6, 25, 26]).\n2 Preliminaries\nIn this paper, a (possibly closed) curve is always assumed to be a polygonal chain (or a\nsingleton point) and a polygon S is a bounded set with non-empty interior int(S) and whose\nboundary \u2202S is a closed curve. We denote the closure of S as S\u00af, so S\u00af = \u2202S \u222a int(S). We say\nthat two polygons S, T (with non-empty interior) touch if int(S)\u2229int(T) = \u2205 but \u2202S\u2229\u2202T \u0338= \u2205\nand intersect if int(S) \u2229 int(T) \u0338= \u2205. A curve f touches S if f \u2229 int(S) = \u2205 but f \u2229 \u2202S \u0338= \u2205.\nA line segment or curve is called degenerate if it is a singleton point. A line segment\nor curve is assumed to be non-degenerate unless we explicitly state the opposite. For an\n(oriented) line segment e = ww\u2032 (resp. curve \u03b3 = w1w2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 wk) we define the head of e (of \u03b3)\nas h(e) = w\n\u2032\n(h(\u03b3) = wk) and the tail of e (of \u03b3) as t(e) = w (t(\u03b3) = w1) and the interior of\ne (of \u03b3) as int(e) = e \\ {h(e), t(e)} (int(\u03b3) = \u03b3 \\ {h(\u03b3), t(\u03b3)}). For a degenerate line segment\n(resp. curve), the head and the tail coincide with the line segment (resp. curve).\nFor a vector v = (x, y), let v\n\u22a5 := (y, \u2212x) (which is v rot...",
