The most influential parameters are the **initial temperature (T\u2080)**, the **cooling schedule (how T is reduced)**, and the **length of the Markov chain at each temperature** (number of neighbour moves before cooling).  In practice\u202fT\u2080 is chosen so that a large fraction (\u2248\u202f70\u201180\u202f%) of randomly generated moves are accepted; this can be obtained by a short pilot run that measures the average increase \u0394E of the objective and sets\u202fT\u2080\u202f\u2248\u202f\u2212\u0394E/ln\u202f0.8.  The chain length is usually taken proportional to the number of items (e.g.,\u202f10\u202fN\u202fto\u202f20\u202fN moves per temperature) so that each rectangle has several chances to be repositioned before the temperature drops.  An adaptive neighbourhood, controlled by a \u201ccrystallisation factor\u201d, further improves acceptance by enlarging move amplitudes after a successful step and shrinking them after a rejection, which has been shown to raise the number of accepted solutions in rotational packing problems\u202f([semanticscholar](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/6509/3a9d2d6b9b38ac2c9a2da79c3905b76ef008.pdf)).  \n\nEmpirical studies on 2\u2011D bin\u2011packing and strip\u2011packing consistently identify a **geometric (exponential) cooling schedule** as the most effective compromise between solution quality and run\u2011time.

Experiments comparing linear, logarithmic and geometric cooling found the geometric rule to dominate both linear and classic logarithmic cooling for a 100\u2011item benchmark\u202f([springer](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/BF02283751.pdf)).  A more recent theoretical development proposes a **modified geometric schedule**  \n\n\\[\nT_{k+1}= \\frac{T_{k}}{1+\\beta T_{k}},\n\\]\n\nwhich retains the exponential decay but adapts the rate based on a parameter\u202f\u03b2; this \u201cnew cooling schedule\u201d yields faster convergence without sacrificing solution quality\u202f([sciencedirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0377221704003388)).

Tsuzuki\nAdditional information is available at the end of the chapter\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5772/50302\n1. Introduction\nSimulated annealing has been applied to a wide range of problems: combinatorial and\ncontinuous optimizations. This work approaches a new class of problems in which the\nobjective function is discrete but the parameters are continuous. This type of problem arises in\nrotational irregular packing problems. It is necessary to place multiple items inside a container\nsuch that there is no collision between the items, while minimizing the items occupied area.\nA feedback is proposed to control the next candidate probability distribution, in order to\nincrease the number of accepted solutions. The probability distribution is controlled by\nthe so called crystallization factor. The proposed algorithm modifies only one parameter\nat a time. If the new configuration is accepted then a positive feedback is executed to\nresult in larger modifications. Different types of positive feedbacks are studied herein. If\nthe new configuration is rejected, then a negative feedback is executed to result in smaller\nmodifications. For each non-placed item, a limited depth binary search is performed to find a\nscale factor that, when applied to the item, allows it to be fitted in the layout. The proposed\nalgorithm was used to solve two different rotational puzzles. A geometrical cooling schedule\nis used. Consequently, the proposed algorithm can be classified as simulated quenching.\nThis work is structured as follows. Section 2 presents some simulated annealing and\nsimulated quenching key concepts. In section 3 the objective function with discrete values and\ncontinuous parameters is explained. Section 4 explains the proposed adaptive neighborhood\nbased on the crystallization factor. Section 5 explains the computational experiments and\nsection 6 presents the results. Finally, section 7 rounds up the work with the conclusions.\n2. Background\nSimulated annealing is a probabilistic meta-heuristic with a capacity of escape from local\nminima. It came from the Metropolis algorithm and it was originally proposed in the area\nof combinatorial optimization [9], that is, when the objective function is defined in a discrete\n\u00a92012 Tsuzuki et al., licensee InTech.

The simulated annealing was modified in order to apply to the optimization of\nmultimodal functions defined on continuous domain [4]. The choices of the cooling schedule\nand of the next candidate distribution are the most important decisions in the definition of a\nsimulated annealing algorithm [13]. The next candidate distribution for continuous variables\nis discussed herein.\nIn the discrete domain, such as the traveling salesman and computer circuit design problems,\nthe parameters must have discrete values; the next point candidate xk+1 corresponds to a\npermutation in the list of cities to be visited, interchanges of circuit elements, or other discrete\noperation. In the continuous application of simulated annealing a new choice of the next point\ncandidate must be executed. Bohachevsky et al. [1] proposed that the next candidate xk+1 can\nbe obtained by first generating a random direction vector u, with |u| = 1, then multiplying it\nby a fixed step size \u0394r, and summing the resulting vector to the current candidate point xk.\nBrooks & Verdini [2] showed that the selection of \u0394r is a critical choice. They observed that an\nappropriate choice of this parameter is strictly dependent on the objective function F(x), and\nthe appropriate value can be determined by presampling the objective function.\nThe directions in [1] are randomly sampled from the uniform distribution and the step size is\nthe same in each direction. In this way, the feasible region is explored in an isotropic way and\nthe objective function is assumed to behave in the same way in each direction. But this is not\noften the case. The step size to define the next candidate point xk+1 should not be equal for all\nthe directions, but different directions should have different step sizes; i.e. the space should\nbe searched in an anisotropic way. Corana et al. [4] explored the concept of anisotropic search;\nthey proposed a self-tuning simulated annealing algorithm in which the step size is configured\nin order to maintain a number of accepted solutions. At each iteration k, a single variable of\nxk is modified in order to obtain a new candidate point xk+1, and iterations are subdivided\ninto cycles of n iterations during which each variable is modified. The new candidate point is\nobtained from xk in the following form xk+1 = xk + v \u00b7 \u0394ri \u00b7 ei. Where v is a uniform random\nnumber in [\u22121, 1], and \u0394ri is the step size along direction ei of the i-th axis. The anisotropy is\nobtained by choosing different values of \u0394ri for all the directions. The step size is kept fixed\nfor a certain number of cycles of variables, and the fraction of accepted moves in direction ei\nis calculated. If the fraction of accepted moves generated in the same direction is below 0.4,\nthen the step size \u0394ri along ei is decreased. It is assumed that the algorithm is using too large\nsteps along ei thus causing many moves to be rejected. If the fraction is between 0.4 and 0.6\nthe step size is left unchanged. If the fraction is above 0.6 then \u0394ri is increased. It is assumed\nthat the step size is too small thus causing many moves to be accepted.\nThis procedure may not be the best possible to process the different behavior of the objective\nfunction along different axes. Ingber [7] proposed that the random variable should follow a\nCauchy distribution with different sensitivities at different temperatures. The maximum step\nsize is kept constant during the algorithm and it allows escaping from local minima even at\nlow temperatures. The parameter space can have completely different sensitivities for each\ndimension, therefore the use of different temperatures for each dimension is suggested. This\nmethod is often referred to as very fast simulated re-annealing (VFSR) or adaptive simulated\nannealing (ASA). The sensitivity of each parameter is given by the partial derivative of the\nfunction with relation to the i-th dimension [3].\n4 Simulated Annealing \u2013 Advances, Applications and Hybridizations\nAdaptive Neighborhood Heuristics for Simulated Annealing over Continuous Variables 3\n3. Integer objective function with float parameters\nIrregular packing problems arise in the industry whenever one must place multiple items\ninside a container such that there is no collision between the items, while minimizing the\narea occupied by the items. It can be shown that even restricted versions of this problem (for\ninstance, limiting the polygon shape to rectangles only) are NP complete, which means that\nall algorithms currently known for optimal solutions require a number of computational steps\nthat grow exponentially with the problem size rather than according to a polynomial function\n[5]. Usually probabilistic heuristics relax the original constraints of the problem, allowing the\nsearch to go through points outside the space of valid solutions and applying penalization to\ntheir cost. This technique is known as external penalization. The most adopted penalization\nheuristic for external solutions of packing problems is to apply a penalization based on\nthe overlapping area of colliding items. While this heuristic leads to very computationally\nefficient iterations of the optimization process, the layout with objective function in minimum\nvalue may have overlapped items [6].\nFig. 1 shows an example in which the c...",

It considers various parameters such as landscape and neighborhood. The need for a better understanding of SA, with the additional goal of implementing the algorithm efficiently, motivated this study. The method selected to conduct that study was to carry out experiments to obtain practical data, which could be utilized to carry out a theoretical study simultaneously. Experiments on such a stochastic algorithm as SA were initiated following the observation that it is possible to calculate the exact probability for SA to reach any point in the landscape, provided that the number of solutions and the number of neighbors per solution are small enough. An efficient development of a SA simulator has enabled us to study the influence of the tuning of all the main parameters of SA as well as theoretical concepts such as thermodynamic equilibrium and optimal temperature decrement rules. Interesting results have been obtained in the field of adaptive cooling schedules that enable us to demonstrate that the classical cooling schedules are all equivalent. Finally a new schedule has been proposed that exhibits some useful properties. The proposed cooling schedule has been successfully implemented in the SA algorithm to solve the well known traveling salesman problem.\n## Introduction\nIn 1953, Metropolis et al. proposed an algorithm for the efficient simulation of the evolution of a solid to thermal equilibrium. Almost 30 years later, Kirkpatrick et al. (1982) realized that there exists a profound analogy between minimizing the cost function of a combinatorial optimization problem and the slow cooling of a solid until it reaches its low energy ground state and that the optimization process can be carried out by applying the Metropolis criterion. By substituting energy for cost and by executing the Metropolis algorithm at a sequence of slowly decreasing temperature values, Kirkpatrick et al. obtained a combinatorial optimization algorithm that they called \u201csimulated annealing\u201d. Twenty years later SA is still of great interest and the research into this algorithm and its applications has evolved into a field of study of its own (Michalewicz et al., 2000; Salamon et al., 2002; Hromkovic, 2003).\nEven if the theoretical basis of the algorithm have been known for almost two decades, still there is a lack of enough practical information about it. As a matter of fact, it is still not simple for a user to design his own algorithm. A lot of tuning, usually, has to be carried out and no theoretical results give clear statement about which temperature decrement rule should be used or what kind of neighborhood should be chosen.\nWe initiated our study of SA while working on loading pattern optimization of nuclear reactors at Electricit\u00e9 de France (EDF). Indeed, thanks to its robustness and flexibility, SA is currently the most widely used combinatorial optimization algorithm in this field. At that time we were particularly interested in using SA in some new multiobjective optimization algorithms (Collette, 2002).\nThe work presented in this paper has evolved out of the results of the experiments carried out employing simulated annealing and of a theoretical study, which was aimed at improving the design of SA algorithms. At the beginning of the work, an important aspect of investigation was the level of performances that could be expected to obtain employing the SA algorithm. We needed to know how SA would perform on a given landscape with a given temperature decrement rule and a given neighborhood. Our interest lied in obtaining satisfactory answers to the age-old questions like how high the temperature should be for the SA algorithm to be able to climb a given hill.\nIn the initial phase of our work we performed some calculations for simple one-dimension cases and then we noticed that, for small problems and for a limited number of neighbors, it was possible to calculate exactly the probability for SA to find a given solution. Taking this into account, we developed a basic SA simulator which enabled us to calculate the distribution of probability over the landscape. The benefit of this simple method is that results of the experiments can be displayed as a probability density that can be easily exploited for further analysis. These experiments helped us to achieve several interesting empirical results that allowed a better understanding of the SA and that were helpful in the subsequent design of improved implementations of the algorithm. We have achieved interesting results in the field of neighborhoods, where it has been demonstrated that the neighborhood structure should have some desirable properties to make it possible for the SA algorithm to explore efficiently the solution space. Then we have studied the theoretical concept of thermal equilibrium and its effect on SA convergence. Finally we have studied cooling schedules. Our experiments enabled us to construct an optimum schedule that could not be used in practice but that showed that there was no clearly better cooling schedule than logarithmic schedule to ensure convergence toward the set of optima with probability one. Then we conducted experiments on adaptive cooling schedules to compare classical proposals. This study led to important theoretical results. First we were able to show that several classical adaptive temperature decrement rules proposed in the literature, that had different theoretical foundations and different mathematical equations, were in fact the same practical rule. Next, we were able to calculate a new adaptive decrement rule that exhibit...",

The major motivation for applying a modified genetic algorithm is as an attempt to alleviate the problem of pre-mature convergence. We found that in the long run, the mixed heuristic produces better results; while the pure heuristic produces only \u201cgood\u201d results, but produces them faster.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe two-dimensional orthogonal packing problem consists of packing rectangular pieces of predetermined sizes into a large but finite rectangular plate (the _stock plate_), or equivalently, cutting small rectangular pieces from the large rectangular plate. We wish to find \u201cpacking patterns\u201d that minimize the unused area ( _trim loss_). The problem has obvious relevancy to the textile, paper, and other industries, and in the three-dimensional case, is related to the problem of packing boxes into a container.\n\nThe problem has been formulated as an integer program. For that approach and variations, see Beasley (1985), Tsai (1993) or Christofides (1995). Recently, different meta-heuristics have been applied to problems of this kind, for instance, see Parada et al. (1998), Lai and Chan (1997), Jakobs (1996), Glover et al. (1995), Dowsland, 1993, Dowsland, 1996. For an introduction to meta-heuristics, see Osman and Laporte (1996). Based on the papers of Jakobs (1996), also Lai and Chan (1997), we have carried out extensive comparisons of these heuristics (Leung et al., 2000). An important building block in any area of research is a valid comparison among the different theories or models that were proposed in the field. Such a comparison is missing in the area of meta-heuristics for the two-dimensional orthogonal packing problem.\n\nIn our investigation, we found that the pure genetic algorithm meta-heuristic usually produces good results. Nevertheless, we also found that this heuristic converges very fast; thus, good results were produced at early stages. That is, while good, these results are improvable if what we call \u201cpre-mature convergence\u201d can be avoided. For this purpose, we employ a mixed meta-heuristic and test its performance.\n\n## Section snippets\n\n## Methodology\n\nA packing pattern may be represented by a permutation, which corresponds to the sequence in which the small rectangles are packed. Other representations may be found in Beasley (1985) or Dowsland, 1993, Dowsland, 1996. In this paper we concentrate on the permutation representation. Now if we have a permutation, we know the order of packing the small pieces, but we may still consider different strategies for packing the pieces. In Jakobs\u2019s (1996) paper, the problem of packing rectangular pieces\n\n## The difference process strategy\n\nIn the difference process strategy, while trying to pack a new piece, the \u201cempty spaces\u201d are considered. In short, a space is a rectangular area of largest possible size, with sides parallel to the stock plate, which is not yet occupied by any rectangular pieces. One may observe that in the packing process, there are only finitely many spaces. At the very beginning, there is only one space and its bottom left corner is precisely at the origin. After the first piece is packed, there are\n\n## Genetic search algorithm\n\nA genetic search algorithm is a heuristic search process that resembles natural selection. There are many variations and refinements, but any genetic algorithm has the features of reproduction, crossover and mutation. Initially a population is selected, and by means of crossovers among members of the population or mutations of members, the better of the population will remain, because of the \u201csurvival of the fittest\u201d. This idea was first proposed by Holland (1975), among others. For its many\n\n## Simulated annealing and genetic algorithms\n\nAfter many reported experiments in the literature, genetic algorithms have been found to be efficient and robust. In addition, it is usually straightforward to encode a problem suitable for application of genetic algorithms. Nevertheless, genetic algorithms also have their shortcomings. In fact, if the worst members are discarded after each generation, the population will tend to quickly become homogeneous. If the mutation probability is small then chromosomes of large variation in fitness may\n\n## Experimental results\n\nWe have altogether 19 test problems. The first eight problems came from Lai and Chan (1997) and Jakobs (1996). The 9th and the 10th problems were our own constructions. They all have a known optimal solution of zero trim loss, so that the absolute performances of the various algorithms can be determined. The number of rectangular pieces in each stock plate ranges from 10 to 50. The data sets for these 10 problems are given in Table 1, Table 2, Table 3, Table 4, Table 5, Table 6, Table 7, Table 8\n\n## Final remarks\n\nTheoretically, we can tune the cooling process and the iteration numbers of a SA to achieve the global optimum (Mahfoud and Goldberg, 1995). Nevertheless, this implies that longer times may be required to achieve optimal or good solutions. Moreover, the serial nature of SA prevents us from employing parallelism. On the other hand, though GA exhibits implicit parallelism it is not easy to control the GA\u2019s convergence. Formally, there is also no proof of its global convergence. See, however,\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThanks to C.H.

In the past, very large combinatorial optimization problems have been solved using this technique. It has also been shown that this method is effective in obtaining close-to-optimal solutions for problems known to be NP complete. Further, this technique is applicable to a whole class of problems that satisfy a few requirements.\n\nThe purpose of this paper is to illustrate an efficient version of the simulated annealing method as applied to a variant of the bin-packing problem. The computational complexity of the method is linear in input size similar to various well-known heuristic methods for the problem. The solutions obtained, however, are much better than any of the heuristic methods. The particular variant of the bin-packing problem we consider has several practical applications such as static task allocation in process scheduling and batch processing. At the time of this writing, we have not yet seen a stochastic solution to the bin-packing problem in the literature.\n\nOne of the distinguishing features of our research is the high quality of solutions obtained by our method. Extensive simulation experiments we have carried out show that the solutions obtained by the stochastic method show a significant improvement over those obtained by any of the well-known heuristic methods.\n\n- [Previous article in issue](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0898122194900760)\n- [Next article in issue](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0898122194900787)\n\n## Keywords\n\nBin-Packing\n\nCombinatorial optimization\n\nGlobal minimum\n\nMonte Carlo methods\n\nNP completeness\n\nSimulated annealing\n\nStatistical cooling\n\n[View PDF](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0898122194900779/pdf?md5=30492ae375a8dc570527f689a4f3bffb&pid=1-s2.0-0898122194900779-main.pdf)\n\nRecommended articles\n\n## References\n\n01.

Two heuristics, which belong to the class of packing procedures that preserve bottom-left (BL) stability, are hybridised with three meta-heuristic algorithms (genetic algorithms (GA), simulated annealing (SA), na\u0131\u0308ve evolution (NE)) and local search heuristic (hill-climbing). This study compares the hybrid algorithms in terms of solution quality and computation time on a number of packing problems of different size. In order to show the effectiveness of the design of the different algorithms, their performance is compared to random search (RS) and heuristic packing routines.\n\n## Introduction\n\nCutting and packing problems are encountered in many industries, with different industries incorporating different constraints and objectives. The wood-, glass- and paper industry are mainly concerned with the cutting of regular figures, whereas in the ship building, textile and leather industry irregular, arbitrary shaped items are to be packed.\n\nPacking problems are optimisation problems that are concerned with finding a _good_ arrangement of multiple _items_ in larger containing regions ( _objects_). The usual objective of the allocation process is to maximise the material utilisation and hence to minimise the \u201cwasted\u201d area. This is of particular interest to industries involved with mass-production as small improvements in the layout can result in savings of material and a considerable reduction in production costs.\n\nOur work is concerned with a 2D rectangular packing problem. The problem consists of packing a collection of items onto a rectangular object while minimising the used object space. The packing process has to ensure that there is no overlap between the items. The specific problem that is addressed in this paper has the following characteristics:\n\n- \u2022\na set of items, which may contain identical items;\n\n- \u2022\none single object of fixed width and infinite height;\n\n- \u2022\nall pieces are of rectangular shape;\n\n- \u2022\nitems can be rotated by 90\u00b0;\n\n- \u2022\nnon-guillotineable (Dyckhoff, 1990).\n\n\nThe 2D stock cutting problem occurs as an industrial problem where a number of rectangular items need to be cut from a roll of material. Since the order (set of items) is small compared to the stock material, the height of the object can be regarded as infinite. Processor allocation can also be treated as a 2D packing problem (Hwang, 1997).\n\n## Section snippets\n\n## A review of meta-heuristic packing algorithms\n\nMany heuristic packing algorithms have been suggested in the literature. Surveys on solution methodologies for various types of the 2D rectangle packing problem can be found in Hinxman, 1980, Sarin, 1983, H\u00e4ssler and Sweeney, 1991. In comparison to the great quantity of literature on heuristic algorithms to the packing problem, only a few researchers have experimented with meta-heuristic algorithms.\n\n## Heuristic placement algorithms\n\nIn this paper we turn our attention to the class of BL heuristics (Baker et al., 1980). These packing procedures preserve BL stability in the layout. An item is allocated in a BL stable position if it cannot be moved any further to the left or downwards. Two implementations of a BL heuristic are combined in our study with meta-heuristic algorithms.\n\n## Heuristic search techniques\n\nThe quality of the layout which is constructed using the above placement algorithms depends on the sequence in which the rectangles are presented to the routine. Since the number of combinations is too large to be explored exhaustively in a reasonable amount of time, meta-heuristic algorithms are used as a more efficient search strategy. In the following hybrid approaches the task of the meta-heuristic is to search for a good ordering of the items. A placement routine is then needed to\n\n## Implementation of the search algorithms\n\nA number of problem-specific and generic decisions have to be made for the implementation of the meta-heuristic search algorithms. The problem-specific choices concern the objective function, initial solution, representation scheme as well as the operators applied to manipulate the search space. Generic decisions include the probabilities at which the search space manipulators such as crossover and mutation are applied, the cooling schedule in the case of SA and the population and generation\n\n## Comparison between the heuristic algorithms BL and BLF\n\nThe comparison of the two heuristic packing algorithms shows that the more sophisticated placement routine (BLF) achieves better layouts. Table 2. summarises the relative distances between the lowest packing height found and the height of the optimal solution. Using random input sequences the layouts generated by the BLF algorithm are between 10 and 30% better than the ones obtained with the BL rule.\n\nPre-ordering the input sequences according to decreasing width (DW) or height (DH) of the items\n\n## Packing heuristics\n\nThe BLF packing algorithm achieves better packing patterns than the BL heuristic for our example problems. Since the BLF routine first attempts to fill the gaps in the layout, the majority of the small items will be \\`absorbed' within the existing partial layout and does not contribute further to the packing height, which is mainly determined by the larger items (Fig. 6). With the BL-rule, however, unused regions in layout cannot be accessed and smaller rectangles also contribute to the height.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nTwo types of hybrid algorithms for the rectangle packing problem have been implemented consisting of a combination of a meta-heuristic algorithm (GA, NE and SA) and heuristic packing routine to allocate the items on the object. The heuristic packing routine generates the layouts in a BL justified manner. Whereas one of the techniques (BL) is a time-efficient implementation based on a sliding principle, the second one (BLF) is able to fill enclosures in the layouts, however, at higher\n\nRecommended articles\n\n- K.A.

The hybrid simulated annealing algorithm uses the modified penalty algorithm to generate an initial solution and then improves it using simulated annealing. It is tested on single-row layout problems with facilities of unequal area and multi-row layout problems with facilities of equal area. The algorithm produced solutions better than those previously reported in the literature for two of the larger single-row problems and five multi-row layout problems. For all the other single-row problems and eight of ten multi-row layout test problems, it produced the best known solutions. The hybrid simulated annealing algorithm appears to produce better quality solutions than the simulated annealing and tabu navigation algorithms, but requires more computation time than simulated annealing.\n\nSpecial issue articlesRecommended articles\n\n- R.E.

Many heuristic algorithms can apply the 2-opt local search to find better solutions. In complete 2-opt local search, every valid neighboring solutions of swapping mechanism will be compared, which is very time consuming especially when a sequential algorithm is adopted. Nowadays, graphic processing units (GPUs) have evolved into powerful and flexible parallel computation platforms that have been widely used to accelerate the solving of NP-hard problems. Therefore, in this study, we focus on how to use GPUs to solve the single-row facility layout problem (SRFLP) with the 2-opt-based simulated annealing (SA) heuristic algorithm. As far as we know, this study is the first to solve SRFLP by using a GPU. After analyzing the fitness function and the move gains calculation between parent and child solutions, we propose a prefix-sum formula table to eliminate a large amount of replicated computation. To calculate move gains for the 2-opt local search during each iteration, many GPU threads are created and they construct and lookup the table in parallel. According to experimental results, if the prefix-sum formula table is not adopted, the GPU version outperforms the sequential CPU counterpart with the best speedup of 123. However, if the table is used in the GPU version, the best speedup can reach up to 3208. Because the proposed parallelization approach with the prefix-sum formula table is based on the features of the 2-opt local search and the SRFLP fitness function, it can be applied to any 2-opt-based heuristic algorithm for solving SRFLP even though the SA algorithm is used in this study.\n\n- ### [A GRASP algorithm for solving large-scale single row facility layout problems](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305054819300486)\n\n\n\n2019, Computers and Operations Research\n\n\n\nShow abstract\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe single-row facility layout problem (SRFLP) is an NP-hard problem, which consists of arranging facilities along a straight line in order to minimize the weighted sum of distances between all pairs of facilities. In this paper, an implementation of the Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP) meta-heuristic is presented to solve large-scale instances of the problem. The novelty of the proposed implementation is that it is endowed with a diversification phase based on frequency memory. The algorithm was tested on 93 instances with sizes up to one thousand facilities. To date, in the literature, there is only one work, which has considered instances of such magnitude. Computational experiments demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm, which improved the best-known values for 29 out of 93 instances.\n\n- ### [Mathematical modeling and multi-start search simulated annealing for unequal-area facility layout problem](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417417305274)\n\n\n\n2018, Expert Systems with Applications\n\n\n\nShow abstract\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this paper, a mixed integer nonlinear programming model (MINLP) is ...",
