# Santa 2025 Christmas Tree Packing - Evolved Seed Prompt (Loop 7)

## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.676102 from exp_000 (saspav baseline)
- Best LB score: 70.676102398091 (verified match)
- Target: 68.922808 | Gap to target: 1.753294 (2.54%)

## CRITICAL DISCOVERY
**The target (68.922808) is BETTER than the current LB #1 (71.191427)!**

This means:
1. Our current score (70.676102) is actually 0.5 points BETTER than LB #1
2. The target requires techniques BEYOND what's publicly available
3. We need to INNOVATE, not just copy existing kernels
4. Top competitors use "crystallography-inspired hybrid lattice packing"

## Response to Evaluator

The evaluator correctly identified that:
1. tree_packer_v18 lacks `fractional_translation` - a key micro-optimization technique
2. The jonathanchan C++ optimizer has this technique and should be tried
3. 7 experiments with identical scores indicates we're stuck at a local optimum

**I AGREE** with the evaluator's assessment. The jonathanchan optimizer is the most promising next step because:
- It has `fractional_translation` with step sizes down to 0.00001
- It has `sa_v3` with 8 move types including corner tree focus
- It has population-based search with basin hopping
- It runs `fractional_translation` after every SA run (120-150 iterations)

However, I note that even the jonathanchan optimizer may not reach the target since:
- The target is 2.27 points better than LB #1
- This suggests the target was achieved with techniques not in public kernels
- We may need to research crystallography-inspired approaches

## Recommended Approaches (Priority Order)

### 1. **[HIGHEST PRIORITY]** Compile and run jonathanchan C++ optimizer
The jonathanchan kernel has a complete C++ optimizer with key techniques missing from tree_packer_v18:

**Steps:**
1. Extract the C++ code from the jonathanchan notebook (cell 8 or cell 20)
2. The code contains `sa_v3`, `ls_v3`, `fractional_translation`, and `opt_v3`
3. Compile with: `g++ -O3 -march=native -std=c++17 -fopenmp -o jonathanchan_optimizer sa_v1_parallel.cpp`
4. Run with saspav baseline as input: `./jonathanchan_optimizer -i /home/code/santa-2025-csv/santa-2025.csv -n 20000 -r 80`

**Key differences from tree_packer_v18:**
- `fractional_translation` - micro-adjustments with step sizes from 0.001 down to 0.00001
- `sa_v3` - 8 move types including corner tree focus and coordinated moves
- `ls_v3` - local search with 300 iterations
- Population-based search - keeps top 3 solutions
- Basin hopping - perturbs best solution to escape local optima
- Adaptive parameters for different N ranges

**Parameters from kernel:**
- SA iterations: 15000-50000 (adaptive by N)
- Restarts: 80
- T0=1.0, Tm=0.000005, ms=0.25, rs=70.0
- fractional_translation: 120-150 iterations after each SA run

### 2. **[HIGH PRIORITY]** Research crystallography-inspired techniques
Web search revealed top competitors use "crystallography-inspired hybrid lattice packing":
- This is different from simple 2-tree lattice
- May involve larger repeating units (3-4 tree motifs)
- May use specific rotation angles based on crystal symmetry

### 3. **[MEDIUM PRIORITY]** Decimal precision arithmetic
Top solutions use Python's `Decimal` type for exact collision detection

### 4. **[LOWER PRIORITY]** Exact algorithms for small N
For N=1 to 20, exact solutions may be achievable with branch-and-bound

## What NOT to Try
- ❌ More tree_packer_v18 runs (already tried 1M iterations, 0 improvement)
- ❌ Simple backward propagation (already tried, 0 improvement)
- ❌ Simple lattice construction (produces worse scores than baseline)
- ❌ Ensembling existing solutions (saspav is already best for all N)

## SUBMISSION STRATEGY
- Remaining submissions: 98
- **SUBMIT after every experiment** - we have abundant submissions
- LB feedback is free information - use it!
- Even if jonathanchan optimizer shows small improvement, SUBMIT to verify

## Key Insight
The saspav baseline is at a very strong local optimum. All 7 experiments produced identical scores. The jonathanchan optimizer's `fractional_translation` technique may be able to find micro-improvements that escape this local optimum. If that fails, we need to research fundamentally different approaches (crystallography-inspired lattice packing).
