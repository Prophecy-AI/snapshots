    "CP-SAT for N=2 with fixed angles: 0.838 vs current 0.451 - WORSE (simplified constraints too conservative)",

  "result": "no_improvement",
  "conclusion": "True CP-SAT with simplified constraints found WORSE results because minimum distance constraints are too conservative. Random restart + SA also found WORSE results. The current solutions use very precise interlocking positions that neither approach can discover. After 16 experiments, ALL approaches have failed to improve beyond 70.630478."
