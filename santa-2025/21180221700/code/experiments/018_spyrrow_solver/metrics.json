    "spyrrow solver for N=5: 1.80 vs current 0.417 - MUCH WORSE",
    "spyrrow solver for N=110 with different strip heights: best 0.444 vs current 0.338 - WORSE"
  ],
  "result": "no_improvement",
  "key_insight": "spyrrow is a state-of-the-art strip packing solver, but it's optimized for minimizing strip WIDTH for fixed HEIGHT, not for minimizing max(width, height). Even with different strip heights, it cannot achieve the tight interlocking configurations our current solutions have.",
  "conclusion": "After 18 experiments, ALL approaches have failed to improve beyond 70.630478. Even state-of-the-art external solvers (spyrrow/sparrow) produce WORSE results. The current solutions are at an extremely strong local optimum."
