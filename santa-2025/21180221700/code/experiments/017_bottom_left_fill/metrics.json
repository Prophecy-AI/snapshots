  "key_insight": "The jiweiliu kernel starts from 71.657 and improves to 71.36 (0.29 improvement). Our baseline at 70.630478 is ALREADY 1.03 points BETTER than their starting point. This suggests our baseline is already highly optimized and the jiweiliu approach may not help.",
  "conclusion": "After 17 experiments, ALL approaches have failed to improve beyond 70.630478. The current solutions are at an extremely strong local optimum."
