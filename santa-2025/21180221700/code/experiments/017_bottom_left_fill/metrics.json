  "result": "no_improvement",
  "conclusion": "Bottom-left-fill heuristic produces WORSE results because simple placement doesn't create tight interlocking configurations. Extracting subsets from larger N also produces WORSE results. The current solutions are so well-optimized that constructive heuristics cannot match them. After 17 experiments, ALL approaches have failed to improve beyond 70.630478."
