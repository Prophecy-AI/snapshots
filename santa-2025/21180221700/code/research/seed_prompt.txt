## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.630478 from exp_010 (saspav_best ensemble)
- Best LB score: 70.6305 (verified)
- Target: 68.919154 | Gap to target: 1.711324 (2.42%)
- Stuck for 7 consecutive experiments (011-017)

## CV-LB Relationship
- CV = LB for this problem (deterministic scoring, no distribution shift)
- The challenge is purely optimization, not generalization

## Response to Evaluator

The evaluator correctly identified that:
1. Our baseline (70.630478) is ALREADY 1.03 points BETTER than jiweiliu's starting point (71.657)
2. The jiweiliu iterative mixing approach achieves only 0.29 improvement - not enough to close our 1.711 gap
3. Very Large N (101-200) contributes 48% of score and needs only 5% improvement to close the entire gap

**I AGREE** with the evaluator's assessment that we need fundamentally different approaches. All standard optimization (SA, bbox3, CP) has been exhausted.

**CRITICAL PIVOT REQUIRED**: We must try approaches that have NOT been attempted:

## Approaches NOT Yet Tried (Priority Order)

### 1. **[HIGHEST PRIORITY] sparroWASM/spyrrow External Solver**
- State-of-the-art nesting algorithm from Jeroen Gar (https://github.com/JeroenGar/sparrow)
- The sacuscreed kernel shows how to use it: generate JSON config, run solver, parse SVG output
- Focus on N=101-200 where 5% improvement closes the entire gap
- **Implementation**: 
  1. Install spyrrow: `pip install spyrrow`
  2. Create StripPackingInstance with Christmas tree polygon
  3. Solve for each N with time limit
  4. Compare with current best

### 2. **[HIGH PRIORITY] Backward Propagation (BackPacking)**
- The crodoc kernel shows this approach: start from N=200, iteratively remove trees
- For each N, remove the tree that minimizes bounding box increase
- This propagates good configurations from large N to small N
- **Implementation**:
  1. Load best N=200 solution
  2. For N=199 down to 1: remove tree that minimizes score
  3. Compare each N with current best

### 3. **[MEDIUM PRIORITY] Asymmetric Solutions**
- All current solutions appear symmetric
- Breaking symmetry might find better local optima
- Try random perturbations that break symmetry

### 4. **[MEDIUM PRIORITY] Different Rotation Angles**
- Current solutions use standard angles (0, 45, 90, etc.)
- Try non-standard angles like 30, 60, 120 degrees
- May find better interlocking configurations

## What NOT to Try
- ❌ More SA with different parameters (exhausted)
- ❌ More bbox3 optimization (exhausted)
- ❌ Constraint Programming with conservative constraints (WORSE)
- ❌ Bottom-left-fill heuristic (WORSE)
- ❌ Grid-based approaches (WORSE)
- ❌ jiweiliu iterative mixing (starts from worse baseline)

## Score Breakdown Analysis
- Small N (1-20): 8.05 (11.4%) - needs 21.3% improvement
- Medium N (21-50): 10.98 (15.5%) - needs 15.6% improvement
- Large N (51-100): 17.62 (24.9%) - needs 9.7% improvement
- **Very Large N (101-200): 33.98 (48.1%) - needs only 5.0% improvement**

**FOCUS ON VERY LARGE N (101-200)** - This is where the gap can be closed!

## Recommended Experiment: 018_spyrrow_solver

**Goal**: Use the spyrrow/sparrow external solver to find better configurations for N=101-200

**Steps**:
1. Install spyrrow (Python wrapper for sparrow)
2. Define Christmas tree polygon
3. For each N in [101, 110, 120, ..., 200]:
   - Create StripPackingInstance
   - Solve with 60-second time limit
   - Extract positions and rotations
   - Validate with Shapely
   - Compare with current best
4. If any improvements found, create ensemble

**Expected Outcome**: 
- sparrow is a state-of-the-art solver that may find configurations our SA-based approaches missed
- Even small improvements in N=101-200 can significantly reduce total score

## SUBMISSION STRATEGY
- Remaining submissions: 84 (ABUNDANT!)
- Submit after this experiment: YES - we need LB feedback on new approaches
- Even if worse, we learn what doesn't work

## Validation Notes
- Use Shapely for overlap detection (matches Kaggle's checker exactly)
- CV = LB for valid submissions (deterministic scoring)
