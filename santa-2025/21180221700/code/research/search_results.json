      "text": "Based on recent research on irregular\u2011polygon nesting, the most effective way to minimise the bounding\u2011box is to formulate the problem as a global\u2011constraint CP model or as a specialised MIP model and let a modern solver handle the combinatorial search\u202f([ScienceDirect\u202fCP paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214716019300594);\u202f[The Dotted\u2011Board MIP model](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0925527313001722);\u202f[Vertical\u2011slice MIP with feasibility cuts](https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/ejores/v313y2024i1p69-91.html)).\n\n**Step\u2011by\u2011step recipe**\n\n1. **Pre\u2011process each polygon**  \n   * Compute a convex or trapezoidal decomposition (or the No\u2011Fit Polygon) so that non\u2011overlap can be expressed with linear/global constraints.  \n   * Store the width, height and possible rotation angles for each piece.  \n\n2. **Define decision variables**  \n   * For every polygon *i*: continuous variables `x_i`, `y_i` for the lower\u2011left corner and a discrete variable `r_i` for the chosen rotation (e.g., 0\u00b0,\u202f90\u00b0,\u202f180\u00b0,\u202f270\u00b0).  \n   * Introduce two auxiliary variables `X_max` and `Y_max` that represent the right\u2011most and top\u2011most extents of the layout.  \n\n3. **Add non\u2011overlap constraints**  \n   * In CP, use the global **no\u2011overlap** (or **cumulative**) constraint on the rectangles derived from the decomposition; the constraint automatically enforces that any two pieces are separated by at least one separation line\u202f([CP paper, \u00a74\u20116](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214716019300594)).  \n   * In MIP, encode the same condition with the **dotted\u2011board** formulation (binary variables indicate whether a cell of a fine grid is occupied)\u202f([Dotted\u2011Board model](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0925527313001722)) or with **vertical\u2011slice** cuts that create linear \u201cleft\u2011of/right\u2011of\u201d relationships\u202f([Vertical\u2011slice MIP](https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/ejores/v313y2024i1p69-91.html)).  \n\n4. **Link the layout extents to the variables**  \n   * `X_max \u2265 x_i + w_i(r_i)` and `Y_max \u2265 y_i + h_i(r_i)` for every polygon *i* (where `w_i`/`h_i` are the width/height after the chosen rotation).  \n\n5. **Set the objective**  \n   * Minimise the area of the bounding box, e.g., `min  X_max * Y_max` (linearised with a standard MIP trick) or, if only the length matters (strip\u2011packing), minimise `X_max` while fixing the strip width.  \n\n6. **Choose a solver and run**  \n   * For CP, a solver such as **OR\u2011Tools CP\u2011SAT**, **Choco**, or **IBM CP Optimizer** handles the global no\u2011overlap constraint efficiently.  \n   * For MIP, use a high\u2011performance MILP engine (CPLEX, Gurobi, or the open\u2011source COIN\u2011OR\u202fIPOPT for the nonlinear separation\u2011line model) with the dotted\u2011board or vertical\u2011slice formulation.  \n\n7. **Post\u2011process the solution**  \n   * Extract the `x_i`, `y_i`, `r_i` values, compute the final bounding\u2011box dimensions (`X_max`, `Y_max`), and, if needed, map the decomposition back to the original polygon shapes.  \n\nThese steps combine the strongest elements reported in the literature: CP\u2019s global non\u2011overlap constraints for fast feasible\u2011region pruning, and MIP\u2019s exact linear formulations (dotted\u2011board or vertical slices) that have shown competitive optimality gaps on benchmark instances\u202f([review article, 2022](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmech.2022.966691/full)). Using either route will give you a mathematically rigorous model that directly minimises the bounding box for irregular polygons.",

A small number of exact methods have been proposed to solve nesting problems, typically focusing on a single problem variant, the strip packing problem. There are however several other variants of the nesting problem which were identified in the literature and are very relevant in the industry.\n\nIn this paper, constraint programming (CP) is used to model and solve all the variants of irregular cutting and packing problems proposed in the literature. Three approaches, which differ in the representation of the variable domains, in the way they deal with the core constraints and in the objective functions, are the basis for the three models proposed for each variant of the problem. The non-overlap among pieces, which must be enforced for all the problem variants, is guaranteed through the new global constraint NoOverlap in one of the proposed approaches.\n\nTaking the benchmark instances for the strip-packing problem, new instances were generated for each problem variant. Extensive computational experiments were run with these problem instances from the literature to evaluate the performance of each approach applied to each problem variant. The models based on the global constraint NoOverlap performed consistently better for all variants due to the increased propagation and to the low memory usage.\n\nThe performance of the CP model for the strip packing problem with the global constraint NoOverlap was then compared with the Dotte...",

It differs from other 2-D C&P problems in the irregular shape of the pieces. This paper proposes a new mixed-integer model in which binary decision variables are associated with each discrete point of the board (a dot) and with each piece type. It is much more flexible than previously proposed formulations and solves to [optimality](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/optimality) larger instances of the nesting problem, at the cost of having its precision dependent on board [discretization](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/discretization). To date no results have been published concerning optimal solutions for nesting problems with more than 7 pieces. We ran computational experiments on 45 problem instances with the new model, solving to [optimality](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/optimality) 34 instances with a total number of pieces ranging from 16 to 56, depending on the number of piece types, grid resolution and the size of the board. A strong advantage of the model is its insensitivity to piece and board geometry, making it easy to extend to more complex problems such as non-convex boards, possibly with defects. Additionally, the number of binary variables does not depend on the total number of pieces but on the number of piece types, making the model particularly suitable for problems with few piece types. The discrete nature of the model requires a trade-off between grid resolution and problem size, as the number of binary variables grows with the square of the selected grid resolution and with board size.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe nesting problem, also known as irregular packing problem, belongs to the more generic class of cutting and packing (C&P) problems. As in all C&P problems, one or more big objects have to be divided into smaller items or pieces so that (1) unused regions of the big object, usually designated as waste, are minimized \u2014 input minimization problems, according to W\u00e4scher typology, or (2) the value of the pieces cut from the big object is maximized \u2014 output maximization problem, according to the same typology (W\u00e4scher et al., 2007). The problem addressed in this paper is a two-dimensional (2D) C&P problem, i.e. only two of the dimensions of the objects are relevant, as the third dimension is equal for all objects and pieces. Moreover, the goal is to minimize the used length of a big rectangular object (the board), of unbound length, making it a 2D Open Dimension Problem. It is often called irregular strip packing.\n\nThe nesting problem differs from other 2D C&P problems in the irregular shape of the pieces. Irregular shapes are those that involve non-trivial handling of the geometry (Bennell and Oliveira, 2008). This leaves out of our scope rectangles and circles, in which the evaluation of the distance between two pieces can be performed by simple coordinate comparison. The most common representation, in the literature, for the irregular shape of a piece is the polygon, and although geometric operations with polygons are not trivial, we will also assume that all pieces are represented by polygons. No additional constraints are imposed on the polygon characteristics, so we deal with the harder to tackle class of non-convex polygons.\n\nNesting problems are not only a scientific challenge, as they add the geometry handling complexity to the combinatorial optimization nature of C&P problems, but they are also most relevant in real-world applications. Indeed they arise in a wide variety of industrial production processes, including textile, garment, metalware, furniture and shoe industries. In all cases saving raw-materials represents an important contribution to the economic and environmental performance of companies.\n\nNesting problems have been addressed by many authors. However, given the problem complexity, to the best of the authors' knowledge there is no published exact mathematical programming based method to solve it, reaching guaranteed optimal solutions for the problem. Although a thorough tutorial on the nesting problem resolution is available (Bennell and Oliveira, 2009), the approaches that more closely relate to the work reported in this paper will be briefly highlighted.\n\nNot surprisingly, heuristic and metaheuristic algorithms are the basis of the overwhelming majority of the published approaches. Among these, the most recent approaches with best performance are from Gomes and Oliveira (2006), Egeblad et al. (2007), Imamichi et al. (2009), Bennell and Song (2010), and Leung et al. (2012). A pioneering work on the exact resolution of non-convex nesting problems (Carravilla et al., 2003) used constraint logic programming as resolution method and has solved to optimality problems with up to 7 pieces. All the other approaches deal with approximations or simpler forms of the nesting problem.\n\nThe first approximation is geometric and consists in considering only rectangular shapes. The first exact solution procedure for the constrained (i.e. with an upper bound on the number of pieces of each type to cut or pack) 2D non-guillotine rectangular problem was proposed by Beasley (1985) and was based on a binary integer programming formulation. The author assumes that all rectangle's lengths and widths are integers, leading to a discrete model, as pieces can only be placed on a set of discrete points of the board. More recent work on exact approaches to the rectangular strip packing p...",

Nesting methods based on heuristics are a mature technology, and currently, the only practical solution to this problem. However, recent performance gains of the Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) solvers, together with the known limitations of the heuristics methods, have encouraged the exploration of exact optimization models for nesting during the last decade. Despite the research effort, there is room to improve the efficiency of the current family of exact MIP models for nesting. In order to bridge this gap, this work introduces a new family of continuous MIP models based on a novel formulation of the NoFit-Polygon Covering Model (NFP-CM), called NFP-CM based on Vertical Slices (NFP-CM-VS). Our new family of MIP models is based on a new convex decomposition of the feasible space of relative placements between pieces into vertical slices, together with a new family of valid inequalities, symmetry breakings, and variable eliminations derived from the former convex decomposition. Our experiments show that our new NFP-CM-VS models outperform the current state-of-the-art MIP models.

It should also prefer rectangles over triangles where possible.\n\nIf possible, the answer to this question should explain the general heuristics used in the suggested algorithm.\n\nThis should run in deterministic time for irregular polygons with less than 100 vertices.\n\nThe goal is to produce a \"sensible\" breakdown of the irregular polygon for a layman.\n\nThe first heuristic applied to the solution will determine if the polygon is regular or irregular.

Is it possible that the polygons you and your users want to tessellate can be characterized more narrowly? Such as sides being parallel, and maybe the polygons look like thickened strokes? Could you perhaps supply some more examples of what you're looking for?\n\n\u2013\u00a0[brainjam](https://stackoverflow.com/users/242848/brainjam)\n\nCommentedJul 23, 2010 at 3:04\n\n- Are there any constraints on the segments making up the polygons? For example, they always have sides oriented at multiples of X degrees, or the corners are aways angles multiple of Y degrees? I'm trying to figure out if we can have an _exact_ algorithm (fixed point operations), that doesn't run into this sort of problems: [flixxy.com/geometric-puzzle-solution-i.jpg](http://www.flixxy.com/geometric-puzzle-solution-i.jpg).\n\n\u2013\u00a0[Mau](https://stackoverflow.com/users/334220/mau)\n\nCommentedJul 23, 2010 at 10:06\n\n\n[Add a comment](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3303689/efficient-packing-algorithm-for-irregular-polygons)\u00a0\\|\n\n## 2 Answers 2\n\nSorted by:\n[Reset to default](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3303689/efficient-packing-algorithm-for-irregular-polygons?answertab=scoredesc#tab-top)\n\nHighest score (default)Trending (recent votes count more)Date modified (newest first)Date created (oldest first)\n\n8\n\nI don't know if this would give the optimal answer, but it would at least give an answer:\n\n1. Compute a Delaunay triangulation for the given polygon. There are standard algorithms to do this which will run very quickly for 100 vertices or fewer (see, for example, [this library here.](http://code.google.com/p/poly2tri/)) Using a Delaunay triangulation should ensure that you don't have too many long, thin triangles.\n2. Divide any non-right triangles into two right triangles by dropping an altitude from the largest angle to the opposite side.\n3. Search for triangles that you can combine into rectangles: any two congruent right triangles (not mirror images) which share a hypotenuse. I suspect there won't be too many of these in the general case unless your irregular polygon had a lot of right angles to begin with.\n\nI realize that's a lot of detail to fill in, but I think starting with a Delaunay triangulation is probably the way to go. Delaunay triangulations in the plane can be computed efficiently and they generally look quite \"natural\".\n\nEDITED TO ADD: since we're in ad-hoc heuristicville, in addition to the greedy algorithms being discussed in other answers you should also consider some kind of divide and conquer strategy. If the shape is non-convex like your example, divide it into convex shapes by repeatedly cutting from a reflex vertex to another vertex in a way that comes as close to bisecting the reflex angle as possible. Once you've divided the shape into convex pieces, I'd consider next dividing the convex pieces into pieces with nice \"bases\", pieces with at least one side having two acute or right angles at its ends. If any piece doesn't have such a \"base\" you should be able to divide it in two along a diameter of the piece, and get two new pieces which each have a \"base\" (I think). This should reduce the problem to dealing with convex polygons which are kinda-sorta trapezoidal, and from there a greedy algorithm should do well. I think this algorithm will subdivide the original shape in a fairly natural way until you get to the kinda-sorta trapezoidal pieces.\n\n[Share](https://stackoverflow.com/a/3313753)\n\n[Improve this answer](https://stackoverflow.com/posts/3313753/edit)\n\nFollow\n\n[edited Jul 23, 2010 at 12:50](https://stackoverflow.com/posts/3313753/revisions)\n\nanswered Jul 22, 2010 at 21:42\n\n[![Peter Milley's user avatar](https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/eb2a346fde4e2c5dc426aa702d181443?s=64&d=identicon&r=PG)](https://stackoverflow.com/users/298736/peter-milley)\n\n[Peter Milley](https://stackoverflow.com/users/298736/peter-milley) Peter Milley\n\n2,7781919 silver badges1818 bronze badges\n\n5\n\n- +1 for a solid breakdown answer. My first go-round that's actually what I did. Unfortunately, because it's not specifically designed to create rectangles, it's unusual (except in super special cases) to find any combination of those triangles that create a rectangle. The users complained that the breakdown seemed too complicated. And they are really pushing for rectangles.\n\n\u2013\u00a0[Steve](https://stackoverflow.com/users/355583/steve)\n\nCommentedJul 22, 2010 at 22:06\n\n- It sounds like the users are pushing this problem into the realm of \"things that sound really easy until you try to implement them\".

It takes a lot of work just to fit as many circles into a square as possible, for example. When the original polygon is complicated--as in the illustration--you need some powerful optimization procedures. The best method I have found for this problem is simulated annealing, but that won't be available in ArcGIS and it would take extremely crafty scripting to script it (ArcGIS is too slow). Could you perhaps relax your requirements a little, such as fitting the smaller polygon a _sufficient_ number of times, rather than as many times as possible?\n\n\u2013\u00a0[whuber](https://gis.stackexchange.com/users/664/whuber)\n\nCommentedJun 12, 2012 at 17:36\n\n- 1\n\n\n\n\n\n@whuber Thanks for editing my post. Yeah, sufficient number of times would work. Or, how about at a given angle orientation. ex. in the image above, I have fit the polygon as many times as i could have at that orientation, had I rotated them 90 degrees you could fit one more...\n\n\u2013\u00a0[Thad](https://gis.stackexchange.com/users/4679/thad)\n\nCommentedJun 12, 2012 at 17:41\n\n- 1\n\n\n\n\n\nYes, but it's also fraught with pitfalls. Some are elementary. For example, the ESRI-authored and -published text, \"Getting to Know ArcView GIS\" (for version 3) included an exercise in which a rectangle representing a soccer field was placed interactively within a polygon. The problem was, the exercise's answer was _wrong_ because the author failed to project the data and the errors in using geographic coordinates were large enough to affect the result. The answer looked good in the GIS, but if anyone had attempted to build that field, they would have found there wasn't enough room for it :-).\n\n\u2013\u00a0[whuber](https://gis.stackexchange.com/users/664/whuber)\n\nCommentedJun 12, 2012 at 18:58\n\n- 6\n\n\n\n\n\n@whuber I guess they thought a \"ball park\" figure was sufficient.\n\n\u2013\u00a0[Kirk Kuykendall](https://gis.stackexchange.com/users/59/kirk-kuykendall)\n\nCommentedJun 14, 2012 at 20:08\n\n- 2\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the general case of irregular polygon within irregular polygon, this is a computationally intractable problem: Finding an optimal solution is not a plausible goal in all cases, and it's likely NP-complete from a technical perspective: Which cases those are cannot be predetermined. If you constrain the problem significantly, some iterative random fitting algorithms are likely to give you _reasonably high_ numbers. My feeling if this is an assignment is that they're not looking for the _correct_ answer, they're looking for creative approaches.\n\n\u2013\u00a0[MappingTomorrow](https://gis.stackexchange.com/users/8027/mappingtomorrow)\n\nCommentedJun 14, 2012 at 23:28\n\n\n\\|\u00a0[Show **9** more comments](https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/27303/packing-polygons-within-polygon-using-arcgis-desktop)\n\n## 3 Answers 3\n\nSorted by:\n[Reset to default](https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/27303/packing-polygons-within-polygon-using-arcgis-desktop?answertab=scoredesc#tab-top)\n\nHighest score (default)Date modified (newest first)Date created (oldest first)\n\n22\n\n+150\n\n**There are many ways to approach this problem.** The raster format of the data suggests a raster-based approach; in reviewing those approaches, a formulation of the problem as a [binary integer linear program](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming#Integer_unknowns) looks promising, because it is very much in the spirit of many GIS site-selection analyses and can readily be adapted to them.\n\nIn this formulation, we enumerate all possible positions and orientations of the filling polygon(s), which I will refer to as \"tiles.\" Associated with each tile is a measure of its \"goodness.\" The objective is to find a collection of non-overlapping tiles whose total goodness is as large as possible. Here, we can take the goodness of each tile to be the area it covers. (In more data-rich and sophisticated decision environments, we may be computing the goodness as a combination of properties of the cells included within each tile, properties perhaps related to visibility, proximity to other things, and so on.)\n\nThe constraints on this problem are simply that no two tiles within a solution may overlap.\n\n**This can be framed a little more abstractly,** in a way conducive to efficient computation, by enumerating the cells in the polygon to be filled (the \"region\") 1, 2, ..., _M_. Any tile placement can be encoded with an _indicator_ vector of zeros and ones, letting the ones correspond to cells covered by the tile and zeros elsewhere. In this encoding, all the information needed about a collection of tiles can be found by _summing_ their indicator vectors (component by component, as usual): the sum will be nonzero exactly where at least one tile covers a cell and the sum will be greater than one anywhere two or more tiles overlap. (The sum effectively counts the amount of overlap.)\n\nOne more little abstraction: the set of possible tile placements can itself be enumerated, say 1, 2, ..., _N_. The selection of any set of tile placements itself corresponds to an indicator vector where the ones designate the tiles to be placed.\n\n**Here's a tiny illustration to fix the ideas**. It is accompanied with the _Mathematica_ code used to do the calculations, so that the programming difficulty (or lack thereof) can be evident.\n\nFirst, we depict a region to be tiled:\n\n```\nregion =  {{0, 0, 1, 1}, {1, 1, 1, 1}, {1, 1, 1, 1}, {1, 1, 1, 1}};\n\n```\n\n![Figure 1: region](https://i.sstatic.net/pMES9.png)\n\nIf we number its cells from left to right, starting at the top, the indicator vector for the region has 16 entries:\n\n```\nFlatten[region]\n\n```\n\n> {0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1}\n\nLet's use the following tile, along with all rotations by multiples of 90 degrees:\n\n```\ntileSet = ...",

An efficient 2D irregular packing algorithm can effectively improve material utilization and reduce processing costs. The reduction in material consumption will also have a beneficial impact on the environment ( [Ke et al., 2020](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B76)). Therefore, research of the packing problem is of great significance for technology and social interest.\n\nThe 2D packing problem is a type of combinatorial optimization problems to locate parts with different shapes compactly in one or more master sheet material to minimize the occupied space or maximize the utilization of the material. The 2D packing problem is currently recognized as a NP problem, which is mainly solved by heuristic algorithms. In recent years, many scholars have conducted research on 2D irregular packing problems with a verity of solutions.\n\nThere exists a number of review articles on packing and cutting problems. We have summarized the main review literature in the field of 2D packing and cutting as shown in [Table 1](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#T1). Brown ( [Brown, 1971](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B17)) introduced an optimum packing and depletion problem with optimization of space and resource usage. Harvey ( [Salkin and De Kluyver, 1975](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B116)) surveyed the application of mathematical optimization models such as linear programming to the knapsack problem. Bruce ( [Golden, 1976](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B50)) surveyed various approaches to the cutting stock problem. Hinxman ( [Hinxman, 1980](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B65)) surveyed the trim-loss and assortment problems, this research paid more attention to cutting and packaging problems in practical applications, and did not mention much about theoretical methods. Garey and Coffman ( [Garey and Johnson, 1981](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B47); [Coffman et al., 1984](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B27)) surveyed the approximation algorithms for bin packing problems. Israni ( [Israni and Sanders, 1982](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B72)) reviewed the 2D cutting stock problem including almost all 2D packaging problems. The author also proposed a rectangular layout method. Sarin ( [Sarin, 1983](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B118)) reviewed methodologies and literature to solve 2D stock cutting problems and introduced an interactive optimization procedure for a general 2D stock cutting problem. Dyckhoff ( [Dyckhoff et al., 1985](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B38)) described a trim loss and related problems and categorized them briefly. Dudzi\u0144ski ( [Dudzi\u0144ski and Walukiewicz, 1987](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B36)) summarized the exact methods for knapsack problems, such as linear programming. Matthias ( [Rode and Rosenberg, 1987](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B114)) analyzed the algorithm for the trim-loss problems. Haessler ( [Haessler and Sweeney, 1991](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B59)) reviewed the solution process of cutting stock problems, including placement algorithm and sequence optimization algorithm. Dowsland ( [Dowsland and Dowsland, 1992](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B34)) reviewed the application of operations research methods to the packing problem and summarized some exact heuristics. Sweeney ( [Sweeney and Paternoster, 1992](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B128)) categorized cutting and packing problems and made application-oriented research records. Cheng ( [Cheng et al., 1994](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B22)) discussed 2D cutting stock problems and their application cases including the pallet loading problem and VLSI placement problem. With the gradual deepening of research on 2D layout problems, typology becomes a common research topic. 2D regular and irregular layout problems are clearly distinguished in practical applications and theoretical methods. Dowsland ( [Dowsland and Dowsland, 1995](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B29)) gave a special review of the 2D irregular nesting problem for the first time. Mavridou ( [Mavridou and Pardalos, 1997](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B98)) summarized applications of the genetic algorithm and simulated annealing algorithm in the optimization of facility layout problems. Dyckhoff ( [Dyckhoff, 1990](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B37)) made a typology of the cutting and packing problems in detail, and W\u00e4scher ( [W\u00e4scher et al., 2007](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B135)) improved the typology later. Hopper ( [Hopper and Turton, 1999](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B67); [Hopper and Turton, 2001a](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B68); [Hopper and Turton, 2001b](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B69)) investigated the application of meta-heuristic and heuristic algorithms in 2D and 3D packing problems. Lodi ( [Lodi et al., 2002a](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B90); [Lodi et al., 2002b](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B91)) reviewed algorithms proposed in the 1990s of 2D packing problems. Bennell et al.

To ensure non-overlapping, we used separation lines. A straight line is a separation line if given two polygons, all vertices of one of the polygons are on one side of the line or on the line, and all vertices of the other polygon are on the other side of the line or on the line. Since we are considering free rotations of the polygons and separation lines, the mathematical model of the studied problem is nonlinear. Therefore, we use the nonlinear programming solver IPOPT (an algorithm of interior points type), which is part of COIN-OR. Computational tests were run using established benchmark instances and the results were compared with the ones obtained with other methodologies in the literature that use free rotation.\n\n|     |
