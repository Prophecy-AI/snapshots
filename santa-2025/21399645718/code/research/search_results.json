      "text": "[Jump to content](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#bodyContent)\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nA [Robinson R44 Raven II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robinson_R44) helicopter lifting Christmas trees using a belly hook, a long line, and a remote hook at a Christmas tree farm in Oregon\n\nWhile the first [Christmas tree farm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_tree_farm) may have appeared as early as 1901, **Christmas tree production in the United States** was largely limited to what could be harvested from natural forests until the 1950s. Among the important Christmas tree producing areas in the U.S. are [Wisconsin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin), [North Carolina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina), [Pennsylvania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania) and the [Pacific Northwest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Northwest). In 2002 [Christmas tree production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_tree_production) in the United States totaled 20.8 million trees and the U.S. was one of the world's leading producers of natural [Christmas trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_trees). That same year, Pennsylvania was the top producer in the United States.\n\n## History\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Christmas_tree_production_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=1)\\]\n\nThe first Christmas tree farm in the United States is believed to have begun in 1888 when George E. Wagner founded the Wagner Tree Farm on 1,700 acres near Pocono Lake, PA. He and his son, Sterling R. Wagner, achieved recognition in the fields of forestry and conservation. A WB&E rail spur provided an outlet for forest products, coal, blueberries, and 1,500 Christmas trees annually. \" [\\[1\\]](https://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=97721)\" Despite the early pioneers of the industry, by the late 1940s 90 percent of all natural Christmas trees sold in the United States were still harvested from forests. The most popular species during that era, [Balsam Fir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balsam_Fir), [Douglas-fir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas-fir), [Black Spruce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Spruce) and [White Spruce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Spruce), were all readily available from forests.[\\[1\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-chastagner-1)\n\nFollowing World War II more trees began to be planted in [plantations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plantation). Other changes were taking place as well, in the late 1940s and early 1950s farmers began to shear trees in response to customer demand for denser trees.[\\[1\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-chastagner-1) During the 1960s the market for [Christmas trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_trees) in the United States began to change. The number of part-time growers declined, while some part-time growers ceased operations others expanded their operations and became full-time Christmas tree farmers. Expansion occurred in all major U.S. Christmas tree growing regions, [Michigan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan), the [Pacific Northwest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Northwest) and [North Carolina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina).[\\[2\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-msu-2)\n\nThe number of plantings increased during the late 1970s and continued to do so into the 1980s.[\\[2\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-msu-2) From 1977 to 1979 total U.S. production reached about 29 million Christmas trees annually.[\\[3\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-rma-3) One species, [Scots Pine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scots_Pine) was planted in numbers which far exceeded [demand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demand) for the product. As the number of individual farmers increased, better marketing strategies and promotion programs were developed.[\\[2\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-msu-2) [Helicopters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter) became a fixture on large farms during the early 1980s as growers used them to move trees from the field to the shipping yard.[\\[1\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-chastagner-1) Between 1988 and 1994 U.S. the number of Christmas trees harvested in the U.S. was about 34\u201336 million per year.[\\[3\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-rma-3)\n\nChristmas tree farm in Texas\n\nIn 2002, in the United States, 21,904 Christmas tree farms covered 447,000 acres (1,810\u00a0km2) of cropland and accounted for 20.8 million Christmas trees cut.[\\[4\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-usda1-4) Of those farms, 686 harvested 100 acres (0.40\u00a0km2) or more, which accounted for over 196,000 of the total acres of trees harvested. That same year, there were only three U.S. Christmas tree farms with more than 10,000 acres (40\u00a0km2) of cropland in production.[\\[4\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-usda1-4) Pennsylvania was home to the most American Christmas tree farms in 2002; the state boasted 2,164 farms. [Oregon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon), however, had the most acreage devoted to the crop with 67,800 acres being used for Christmas tree farming.[\\[5\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-census05-5)\n\nThe total U.S. crop in 2004 was valued at $506 million with $143 million attributed to the nation's leading producer in 2004, Oregon.[\\[5\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-census05-5) Oregon was followed in production numbers by North Carolina, [Washington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)), and Michigan.[\\[5\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-census05-5)\n\n## North Carolina\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Christmas_tree_production_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=2)\\]\n\nIn 2002 about 2.9 million Christmas trees were harvested in the state of North Carolina, second behind only Oregon in terms of trees cut.[\\[4\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-usda1-4) By 2004 the crop in North Carolina was worth more than $100 million.[\\[6\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-ncda-6) The North Carolina Department of Agriculture stated that 18% of natural Christmas tree harvested in the United States come from the 42 million trees planted by 1,500 growers in the states.[\\[6\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-ncda-6)\n\n## Pacific Northwest\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Christmas_tree_production_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=3)\\]\n\nA Christmas tree lot in the suburbs of Portland, Oregon\n\nOregon and Washington are among the most important U.S. states in the production of Christmas trees. 92% of the crop produced in this region consists of Douglas fir and Noble fir species.[\\[7\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-Facts_at_a_Glance-7) Other species produced in this region include grand fir, balsam fir, Nordmann fir, Colorado blue spruce and Norway spruce trees.\n\nCurrently approximately 92% of Christmas trees grown in the Pacific Northwest are exported out of the region. California is the largest market for Pacific Northwest Christmas trees, purchasing 45% of the crop. Other large foreign export destinations include China, Japan, Mexico and Philippines.[\\[7\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-Facts_at_a_Glance-7)\n\nIn 2015, Oregon had approximately 700 Christmas tree farms with a combined 63,000 acres, yielding 7.2 million Christmas trees valued at approximately $120 million. The majority of Christmas tree production occurs in the Willamette Valley region including Benton, Clackamas, Marion, Polk and Yamhill counties.[\\[7\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-Facts_at_a_Glance-7)\n\nIn 2015, Washington State had approximately 250 Christmas tree farms with a combined 23,000 acres, yielding 2.3 mi...",
