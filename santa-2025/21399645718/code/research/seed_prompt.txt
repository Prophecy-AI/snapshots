## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.316492 (exp_022, exp_028)
- Best LB score: 70.3165 (exp_022)
- Target: 68.874108 | Gap to target: 1.44 points (2.09%)

## CRITICAL FINDING: WE ARE AT THE PUBLIC CEILING

**Our current solution (70.316492) is the BEST VALID solution available:**
- Better than ALL external kernel outputs (best external: 70.319)
- Better than ALL valid snapshot solutions
- All "better" solutions in snapshots have OVERLAPS and are INVALID

**The gap of 1.44 points to the target suggests top teams have:**
1. Extended optimization runs (DAYS, not hours)
2. Private/unpublished solutions
3. 900+ submissions to accumulate tiny improvements
4. Fundamentally different algorithms not publicly available

## Submission Log

| 002 | backward_prop | 70.615 | 70.615 | No improvement |
| 010 | safe_ensemble | 70.365 | 70.365 | Ensemble from snapshots |

## Response to Evaluator

The evaluator correctly identified that:
1. The experiment ran for 25 minutes, not 8 hours
2. The solution is at a VERY STRONG local optimum
3. Extended compute time (days, not hours) is the only unexplored avenue

**I AGREE with the evaluator's assessment.** The key insight is that:
- 29 experiments have found ZERO improvement since exp_020
- All algorithmic approaches converge to the same score
- The only remaining avenue is EXTENDED COMPUTE TIME

## ⛔ WHAT DOES NOT WORK (PROVEN BY 29 EXPERIMENTS)

- ❌ SA with different parameters → same score
- ❌ Branch-and-bound for small N → same score
- ❌ Exhaustive search for N=2 → same score
- ❌ NFP-based placement → same score
- ❌ Multi-start random → same score
- ❌ Genetic algorithm → same score
- ❌ Lattice packing → same score
- ❌ Interlock patterns → same score
- ❌ Jostle algorithm → same score
- ❌ Bottom-Left-Fill → same score
- ❌ Extended C++ (25 min) → same score

## ✅ NEXT EXPERIMENT: TRULY EXTENDED OPTIMIZATION (8+ HOURS)

The evaluator is right - we need to run for 8+ HOURS, not 25 minutes.

**SPECIFIC TASK:**
1. Create `experiments/029_overnight_optimization/`
2. Compile bbox3 with OpenMP for maximum parallelization
3. Run with these parameters:
   - `-n 1000000` (1 million iterations per restart)
   - `-r 500` (500 restarts)
   - Use `timeout 28800` (8 hours = 28800 seconds)
4. Monitor progress and save intermediate results
5. After 8 hours, check for ANY improvement

**CODE:**
```bash
cd /home/code/experiments/029_overnight_optimization
cp /home/code/data/external/kernel_outputs/why-not/bbox3.cpp .
g++ -O3 -march=native -std=c++17 -fopenmp -o bbox3_overnight bbox3.cpp
cp /home/submission/submission.csv ./input.csv

# Run for 8 hours
timeout 28800 ./bbox3_overnight -i ./input.csv -o ./optimized.csv -n 1000000 -r 500 2>&1 | tee optimization_log.txt
```

**EXPECTED OUTCOME:**
- If 8 hours finds improvement → we have a path forward
- If 8 hours finds ZERO improvement → the solution is at global optimum for this algorithm

## ALTERNATIVE: ASYMMETRIC SOLUTIONS (IF EXTENDED OPTIMIZATION FAILS)

The discussion "Why the winning solutions will be Asymmetric" suggests that:
- Symmetric solutions (grid-based) may be suboptimal
- Asymmetric arrangements can pack more efficiently

**TASK (if extended optimization fails):**
1. Analyze current solution for symmetry patterns
2. Implement asymmetric placement search
3. Focus on N=2-10 where improvements have highest impact

## SUBMIT CURRENT BEST

**SUBMIT exp_022 (or exp_028) to get LB feedback.**
- We have 95 submissions remaining
- LB feedback is free information
- Even if score doesn't improve, we learn something

## What NOT to Try

- ❌ More SA variations (proven ineffective)
- ❌ More ensemble combinations (all sources exhausted)
- ❌ Short optimization runs (< 1 hour)
- ❌ Any approach that has already been tried

## CRITICAL REMINDER

The target (68.874) IS reachable - top teams have achieved it.
The gap is 1.44 points (2.09%).
The only unexplored avenue is EXTENDED COMPUTE TIME.
Run for 8+ HOURS, not 25 minutes.
