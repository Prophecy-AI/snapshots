## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.306229 (current submission)
- Best verified LB score: 70.316492 (exp_022)
- Target: 68.861114 | Gap to target: 1.445 points (2.10%)
- Submissions used: 14/100 (86 remaining)

## ⚠️ CRITICAL SITUATION ASSESSMENT

After 33 experiments with 15+ different algorithms (SA, B&B, exhaustive, NFP, CP, DE, tessellation, lattice, interlock, jostle, BLF), the score has improved by only 0.31 points total. The last 13 experiments found only 0.008 points of improvement.

**THE BASELINE IS AT AN EXTREMELY STRONG LOCAL OPTIMUM.**

The CV-LB correlation is PERFECT (differences < 1e-7), so this is NOT a distribution shift problem. The problem is that we're at a local optimum that no algorithm can escape with available compute time.

## Response to Evaluator

The evaluator correctly identified that:
1. The tessellation approach found ZERO improvements - the baseline's irregular patterns are already superior
2. The gap (1.445 points) is too large to close with micro-optimizations
3. We need to either find new external data or fundamentally different approaches

I AGREE with the evaluator's assessment. The current approach has hit a ceiling at ~70.31.

## What We've Learned (from 33 experiments)

| Approach | Result | Conclusion |
|----------|--------|------------|
| SA (Python/Numba) | No improvement | Baseline is local optimum |
| Exhaustive N=2 | Confirmed optimal | Baseline N=2 is globally optimal |
| NFP placement | No improvement | Baseline is optimal |
| Branch-and-bound | No improvement | Baseline is optimal for small N |
| Genetic algorithm | No improvement | Cannot escape local optimum |
| Tessellation | No improvement | Irregular patterns beat regular |
| Lattice packing | No improvement | Baseline is better |
| Interlock pattern | No improvement | Baseline is better |
| Jostle algorithm | No improvement | Cannot improve |
| BLF constructive | No improvement | Baseline is better |
| Constraint programming | No improvement | Cannot find better solutions |

**CONCLUSION: All algorithmic approaches converge to the same local optimum (~70.31).**

## What Top Teams Have That We Don't

Based on the jonathanchan kernel analysis:
1. **19+ external data sources** (we have ~10)
2. **Extended runtime** (days of optimization, not hours)
3. **More submissions** (top team has 953, we have 14)
4. **Private collaboration** (Telegram/Discord solutions)

## ⛔ FORBIDDEN (WILL NOT HELP)
- Running bbox3/sa_fast with more iterations → SAME SCORE
- Running any optimizer with different parameters → SAME SCORE
- Tessellation/lattice/regular patterns → WORSE than baseline
- Any approach that has been tried in the last 33 experiments

## ✅ MANDATORY NEXT STEPS

### STEP 1: SUBMIT CURRENT BEST (IMMEDIATE)
Submit the current submission to verify LB score matches CV (~70.306).
This establishes our verified baseline.

### STEP 2: SEARCH FOR UNDISCOVERED EXTERNAL DATA
The jonathanchan kernel lists sources we may not have:
1. `/kaggle/input/jwt/other/csv/19` - JWT dataset
2. `/kaggle/input/santa-2025-fix-direction` - Fix direction dataset
3. `/kaggle/input/72-71-santa-2025-jit-parallel-sa-c` - JIT parallel SA
4. `/kaggle/input/blending-multiple-oplimisation` - Blending optimization
5. `/kaggle/input/santa2025-just-keep-on-trying` - Keep trying dataset
6. `/kaggle/input/decent-starting-solution` - Decent starting solution

**ACTION:** Search Kaggle for these datasets and download any we don't have.

### STEP 3: EXTENDED COMPUTE TIME OPTIMIZATION
The jonathanchan kernel runs `sa_v1_parallel` with:
- `-n 15000` (15000 iterations per N)
- `-r 5` (5 restarts)
- "Endless mode" with multiple generations

Our bbox3/sa_fast runs have been much shorter. Try:
```bash
# Run for HOURS, not minutes
./sa_parallel -i submission.csv -o output.csv -n 50000 -r 20
```

### STEP 4: FOCUS ON HIGH-IMPACT N VALUES
N=1 contributes 0.661 to total score (highest single contributor).
N=2 contributes 0.451 (second highest).

If we could improve N=2 by 10%, that's 0.045 points - more than all 13 recent experiments combined.

**ACTION:** Run exhaustive search on N=2-5 with MUCH finer resolution:
- Angle step: 0.001° (not 0.5°)
- Position step: 0.0001 (not 0.01)
- Search radius: ±20° (not ±10°)

## Experiment Plan

### exp_033: SUBMIT AND VERIFY
1. Submit current submission.csv to Kaggle
2. Record LB score
3. If LB ≈ CV (70.306), proceed to next steps
4. If LB differs significantly, investigate

### exp_034: EXTERNAL DATA HUNT
1. Search Kaggle for datasets mentioned in jonathanchan kernel
2. Download any new datasets
3. Ensemble with current best
4. Submit if improved

### exp_035: EXTENDED OPTIMIZATION
1. Run sa_parallel for 4+ hours on all N values
2. Use higher iteration counts (-n 50000 -r 20)
3. Save intermediate results
4. Submit best result

## Per-N Score Tracking (MANDATORY)

Current per-N scores for N=1-10:
- N=1: 0.661250 (OPTIMAL - cannot improve)
- N=2: 0.450779 (highest potential for improvement)
- N=3: 0.434745
- N=4: 0.416545
- N=5: 0.416850
- N=6: 0.399610
- N=7: 0.399842
- N=8: 0.385407
- N=9: 0.383047
- N=10: 0.376630

**TRACK IMPROVEMENTS PER-N, NOT JUST TOTAL SCORE.**

## Time Remaining
~35 hours until competition ends.
86 submissions remaining.

## CRITICAL REMINDER

The target (68.861114) is 0.033 points BELOW current #1 on the leaderboard (68.894566).
This means we need to BEAT THE WORLD RECORD.

The gap of 1.445 points is STRUCTURAL. To close it, we need:
1. New external data sources (highest priority)
2. Significantly more compute time (days, not hours)
3. Or a breakthrough algorithm that hasn't been tried

**DO NOT GIVE UP. The target IS reachable. Find a way.**
