## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.306229 from 033_best_snapshot_submission
- Best verified LB score: 70.3165 (from exp_022)
- Target: 68.861114 (lower is better)
- Gap to target: 1.445 points (2.10%)

## ⚠️ CRITICAL SITUATION ASSESSMENT

After 33 experiments with 15+ different algorithmic approaches, we are stuck at a VERY STRONG LOCAL OPTIMUM:
- All approaches (SA, B&B, exhaustive, NFP, CP, DE, tessellation, lattice, interlock, jostle, BLF) converge to ~70.31
- The last 13 experiments improved by only 0.008 points TOTAL
- The target (68.86) is 0.03 points BELOW the current #1 on the leaderboard (68.89)

## Response to Evaluator

The evaluator correctly identified:
1. **Tessellation found ZERO improvements** - the baseline uses sophisticated non-regular patterns
2. **We're at a structural ceiling** - not an algorithmic one
3. **The gap is too large for micro-optimizations** - 1.44 points cannot be closed with 0.001 improvements

I AGREE with the evaluator's assessment that:
- We need LB verification of current best
- We need to search for undiscovered external data sources
- Extended compute time may be necessary

However, I DISAGREE that the target is unreachable. The top teams achieved 68.89 with:
- 953 submissions (vs our 14)
- Days of compute time
- Private data sources

## What We've Learned from Research

**From jonathanchan kernel (183 votes):**
- Uses 19+ external data sources (we have ~6)
- Runs sa_v1_parallel in "endless mode" with multiple generations
- Uses opt_v3 → fractional_translation pipeline
- Key sources we may be missing:
  - jwt/other/csv/19
  - santa25-improved-sa-with-translations
  - santa-2025-try3
  - santa25-public
  - santa2025-ver2
  - blending-multiple-oplimisation
  - santa2025-just-keep-on-trying
  - decent-starting-solution

## ⛔ FORBIDDEN (DO NOT DO)
- Running bbox3/sa_fast with "more iterations" - PROVEN NOT TO WORK
- Tessellation patterns - PROVEN NOT TO WORK
- Any approach that gave < 0.01 improvement in last 5 experiments
- Giving up or concluding target is unreachable

## ✅ NEXT EXPERIMENT: EXTENDED MULTI-GENERATION OPTIMIZATION

The jonathanchan kernel shows the winning approach:
1. **Ensemble from ALL available sources** (we're doing this)
2. **Run opt_v3 in endless mode** with multiple generations
3. **Apply fractional_translation** after each optimization pass
4. **Keep best per-N across all generations**

### SPECIFIC TASK FOR exp_033:

**STEP 1: Submit current best (70.306229) to verify on LB**
- Copy 033_best_snapshot_submission/submission.csv to /home/submission/
- This is already done - just need to submit

**STEP 2: Run extended optimization with the jonathanchan approach**

```python
# Key parameters from jonathanchan kernel:
# - sa_v3 with 15000-20000 iterations
# - 5-80 restarts depending on N
# - fractional_translation with steps [0.001, 0.0005, 0.0002, 0.0001, 0.00005, 0.00002, 0.00001]
# - Multiple generations until no improvement

# For N <= 20: 6+ restarts, 1.5x iterations
# For N <= 50: 5+ restarts, 1.3x iterations  
# For N > 150: 4+ restarts, 0.8x iterations
```

**STEP 3: Focus on high-impact N values**
- N=1: 0.661250 (already optimal at 45°)
- N=2: 0.450779 (highest contributor after N=1)
- N=3-10: High individual scores, worth optimizing

**STEP 4: Search for missing external data**
Try to find these datasets that jonathanchan uses:
- santa25-improved-sa-with-translations
- santa-2025-try3
- santa25-public
- blending-multiple-oplimisation

## Expected Outcome

If we can:
1. Find 2-3 more external data sources with better per-N solutions
2. Run extended optimization (hours, not minutes)
3. Accumulate improvements across 50+ submissions

We might close the gap from 70.31 to ~69.5 (0.8 points improvement).

The remaining 0.6 points to target would require either:
- Private data sources (Telegram/Discord)
- Significantly more compute time
- Novel algorithmic breakthroughs

## SUBMIT IMMEDIATELY

Submit 033_best_snapshot_submission to get LB feedback. This is our current best (70.306229) and we need to verify it works on Kaggle before investing more compute time.
