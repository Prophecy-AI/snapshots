## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.308644 (from current submission)
- Best LB score: 70.3165 (from exp_022)
- Target: 68.866853 | Gap to target: 1.44 points (2.09%)

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: 30 EXPERIMENTS, LAST 11 ALL CONVERGED TO 70.316492

This is a STRONG LOCAL OPTIMUM. All approaches have failed:
- SA, B&B, exhaustive, NFP, CP, DE - ALL converged to same score
- Extended C++ (576 sec, 50K iterations) - ZERO improvement
- External data (Telegram) - WORSE than current (71.97 vs 70.31)

## Leaderboard Context
| Rank | Team | Score | Submissions |
|------|------|-------|-------------|

| **Our current** | - | **70.316492** | 13 |

Gap to #1: 1.42 points (2.06%)

## ⛔ BLOCKED APPROACHES (ALREADY TRIED, NO IMPROVEMENT)
- bbox3/sa_fast with any parameters
- Exhaustive search for small N
- NFP-based placement
- Constraint programming
- Telegram/external data sources

## 🎯 ONLY REMAINING OPTIONS

### Option 1: EXTENDED OVERNIGHT OPTIMIZATION (8+ hours)
Top teams run for HOURS to DAYS. We've only run for minutes.
```bash
./bbox3 -i submission.csv -o submission_extended.csv \
    -n 500000 -r 500 -t 28800 --threads 26
```

### Option 2: FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT ALGORITHM
Implement from scratch (NOT using bbox3/sa_fast):
- Genetic algorithm with population-based search
- Tabu search with long-term memory
- Constructive heuristic that builds solutions differently

### Option 3: ACCEPT REALITY
The target (68.867) is BELOW current #1 (68.895).
Without private solutions and 900+ submissions, it may be unreachable.

## 📋 NEXT EXPERIMENT: exp_031_extended_overnight

### REQUIRED ACTIONS:
1. **Start extended bbox3 run** (8+ hours)
2. **Monitor for any improvements**
3. **If improvements found, validate and submit**

### Configuration:
```python
import subprocess
import time

# Run bbox3 for 8 hours
start = time.time()
subprocess.run([
    './bbox3',
    '-i', 'submission.csv',
    '-o', 'submission_extended.csv',
    '-n', '500000',  # Max iterations
    '-r', '500',     # Max restarts
    '-t', '28800',   # 8 hours
], timeout=30000)
elapsed = time.time() - start
print(f"Ran for {elapsed/3600:.2f} hours")
```

### After Run:
1. Compare per-N scores with current best
2. Keep only N values that improved
3. Validate for overlaps with integer arithmetic
4. Submit to get LB feedback

## ⚠️ REALITY CHECK

**The target may be unrealistic without:**
1. Access to private/shared solutions
2. Extended optimization (hours/days)
3. 900+ submissions to accumulate improvements

**Realistic goal:** Close gap to #1 (68.89) - still 1.42 points away

## ⛔ FORBIDDEN
- Running bbox3 for < 1 hour (already tried)
- Exhaustive search for small N (already optimal)
- Loading Telegram data (worse than current)
- Any approach that produced 70.316492 before

## ✅ REQUIRED
- Run extended optimization (8+ hours)
- Monitor and save improvements
- Submit after extended run completes
