## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.306229 (from current submission)
- Best LB score: 70.3165 (exp_022)
- Target: 68.861114 | Gap to target: 1.44 points (2.1%)
- Experiments: 33 completed
- Submissions: 14/100 used (86 remaining)

## CRITICAL STRATEGIC ASSESSMENT

After 33 experiments with 15+ different algorithms (SA, B&B, exhaustive, NFP, CP, DE, tessellation, lattice, interlock, jostle, BLF), ALL approaches have converged to the same local optimum around 70.31.

**The gap is STRUCTURAL, not algorithmic:**
- CV = LB perfectly (differences < 1e-7)
- Every perturbation-based method hits the same ceiling
- The baseline uses sophisticated non-regular patterns that outperform any regular tessellation

**What top teams have that we don't:**
1. **More external data sources**: jonathanchan kernel uses 19+ sources vs our ~10
2. **More submissions**: Top team (Jingle bins) has 953 submissions vs our 14
3. **Extended compute time**: Days of optimization, not hours

## IMMEDIATE PRIORITY: SUBMIT CURRENT BEST

Before any more experiments, we need to verify our current best (70.306) on the leaderboard.

**ACTION**: Submit the current /home/submission/submission.csv to get LB feedback.

## STRATEGY FOR REMAINING TIME

Given the structural nature of the gap, there are only 3 viable paths forward:

### Path 1: EXTENDED OPTIMIZATION (Recommended)
Run the sa_parallel optimizer for MUCH longer (hours, not minutes):
```bash
cd /home/code/experiments
./sa_parallel -i /home/submission/submission.csv -o optimized.csv -n 50000 -r 20
```
This is what top teams do - they run optimization for days.

### Path 2: SEARCH FOR NEW EXTERNAL DATA
The jonathanchan kernel lists sources we might not have:
- /kaggle/input/jwt/other/csv/19 (JWT dataset)
- /kaggle/input/santa-2025-fix-direction
- /kaggle/input/72-71-santa-2025-jit-parallel-sa-c
- /kaggle/input/blending-multiple-oplimisation
- /kaggle/input/santa2025-just-keep-on-trying
- /kaggle/input/decent-starting-solution

Try to find these datasets or similar ones.

### Path 3: ACCUMULATE SUBMISSIONS
Top teams got to 68.89 through 900+ submissions, each keeping best per-N.
With 86 submissions remaining, we should:
1. Submit every experiment that produces a valid file
2. Track which N values each approach does well on
3. Build an ensemble of best per-N from all submissions

## ⛔ WHAT NOT TO DO

- ❌ More tessellation patterns (already tested 7 patterns, 0 improvements)
- ❌ More local search variations (SA, B&B, etc. - all converged)
- ❌ Short optimization runs (need hours, not minutes)
- ❌ Expecting algorithmic breakthroughs (the gap is structural)

## NEXT EXPERIMENT: EXTENDED SA OPTIMIZATION

Create experiments/033_extended_sa/ and run:
```python
# Run sa_parallel for extended time
import subprocess
import time

start = time.time()
subprocess.run([
    '/home/code/experiments/sa_parallel',
    '-i', '/home/submission/submission.csv',
    '-o', 'optimized.csv',
    '-n', '50000',  # 50k iterations
    '-r', '20'      # 20 restarts
], timeout=7200)  # 2 hour timeout
elapsed = time.time() - start
print(f"Optimization took {elapsed/3600:.2f} hours")
```

Then compare per-N scores and keep improvements.

## SUBMISSION STRATEGY

With 86 submissions remaining:
1. **SUBMIT NOW**: Current best (70.306) to verify on LB
2. **SUBMIT AFTER EACH EXPERIMENT**: LB feedback is free information
3. **TRACK PER-N**: Which N values does each submission do well on?
4. **ENSEMBLE**: Final submission = best per-N from all sources

## REALISTIC EXPECTATIONS

- Target 68.861 is 0.03 points BELOW current #1 (68.894)
- This means we need to beat the WORLD RECORD
- Top teams achieved this through 900+ submissions over weeks
- With 86 submissions and ~35 hours remaining, we need to be strategic

**Focus on:**
1. Verifying current best on LB
2. Running extended optimization
3. Accumulating per-N improvements through submissions
