## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.306229 from exp_033_best_snapshot_submission
- Best LB score: 70.3165 (from exp_022)
- Target: 68.861114 | Gap to target: 1.445 points (2.04%)

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: SUBMIT CURRENT BEST IMMEDIATELY

**We have 86 submissions remaining but only 14 used!**
**The current best (70.306229) has NOT been verified on LB!**

FIRST ACTION: Submit exp_033 to verify the score on LB.

## Submission Log
| Exp | Approach | CV | LB | Notes |
|-----|----------|----|----|-------|
| 001 | valid_baseline | 70.615 | 70.615 | CV=LB match confirmed |
| 002 | backward_prop | 70.615 | 70.615 | No improvement |
| 010 | safe_ensemble | 70.365 | 70.365 | Ensemble works |
| 016 | cpp_optimization | 70.354 | 70.354 | C++ optimizer helps |
| 019 | extended_cpp | 70.343 | 70.343 | More iterations help |
| 022 | extended_cpp_opt | 70.317 | 70.317 | Best verified LB |
| 031 | extended_overnight | 70.309 | FAILED | Overlaps detected |
| 033 | best_snapshot | 70.306 | PENDING | **SUBMIT THIS** |

## Response to Evaluator

The evaluator correctly identified:
1. **Overlap validation uncertainty** - Previous submission failed due to overlaps. Current submission passed local validation but needs LB verification.
2. **Gap is too large for incremental improvements** - 1.445 points gap, ~0.01 improvement in last 15 experiments.
3. **Need fundamentally different strategy** - Agreed.

**My response:**
- SUBMIT IMMEDIATELY to verify current best
- If submission succeeds, we have a new baseline at 70.306
- If submission fails, we need to fix overlap validation

## What We've Learned

1. **All external sources are WORSE than current best** - jonathanchan/santa25-public, chistyakov/santa2025-packed all score worse
2. **N=1 is already optimal** - 0.661250 is the theoretical minimum
3. **Top teams use:**
   - Ensemble from multiple sources (per-N best selection)
   - C++ SA optimizer with fractional translation
   - "Endless mode" - running for hours/days
   - 900+ submissions for feedback
4. **Discussion says winning solutions are ASYMMETRIC**

## ⛔ FORBIDDEN (DO NOT DO)
- Running bbox3/sa_fast with "more iterations" - already tried, doesn't work
- Searching for more external data - already exhausted all sources
- Small parameter tweaks - won't close 1.445 point gap

## ✅ REQUIRED: SUBMIT CURRENT BEST

```python
# FIRST: Submit exp_033 to verify on LB
# The submission file is at /home/submission/submission.csv
# Score: 70.306229
```

## Next Experiment: EXTENDED COMPUTE TIME

The jonathanchan kernel shows that top teams run optimization in "endless mode" for hours.
Our experiments run for minutes. This is the key difference.

**Approach:**
1. Compile the C++ SA optimizer from jonathanchan kernel
2. Run it for 4+ hours on the current best solution
3. Use fractional translation (0.001, 0.0005, 0.0001 step sizes)
4. Focus on N=2-20 which have highest score contribution

**Expected improvement:** If we can improve each N by 0.5%, that's ~0.35 points total.

## Alternative: ASYMMETRIC SOLUTIONS

Discussion "Why the winning solutions will be Asymmetric" (41 votes) suggests:
- Symmetric solutions leave gaps
- Asymmetric arrangements can pack tighter
- Top teams use asymmetric configurations

**Test on small N:**
1. For N=10, try asymmetric placements (not grid-like)
2. Compare to current symmetric-looking baseline
3. If improvement found, scale to all N

## Per-N Strategy

| N Range | Current Approach | Potential Improvement |
|---------|------------------|----------------------|
| N=1 | Optimal (45°) | None |
| N=2-10 | Ensemble best | Exhaustive search with finer granularity |
| N=11-50 | Ensemble best | Extended SA with asymmetric init |
| N=51-100 | Ensemble best | Fractional translation refinement |
| N=101-200 | Ensemble best | Pattern-based placement |

## SUBMIT STRATEGY

With 86 submissions remaining:
1. **SUBMIT exp_033** - Verify current best
2. **SUBMIT after each improvement** - LB feedback is free
3. **Track per-N improvements** - Build ensemble of best per-N

## Summary

**IMMEDIATE ACTION:** Submit exp_033 to verify 70.306229 on LB

**NEXT EXPERIMENT:** Extended compute time optimization
- Run C++ SA optimizer for 4+ hours
- Focus on N=2-20 (highest impact)
- Use fractional translation refinement

**GOAL:** Close the 1.445 point gap through:
1. Extended compute time (potential: 0.3-0.5 points)
2. Asymmetric solutions (potential: 0.2-0.3 points)
3. Per-N specialized optimization (potential: 0.2-0.3 points)
4. Accumulation over many submissions (potential: 0.5+ points)
