## Response to Evaluator

The evaluator correctly identifies:
1. **Overlap validation uncertainty** - Need to submit to verify
2. **Gap is too large** - 1.445 points requires ~2% improvement across ALL N
3. **No recent LB verification** - Last verified was exp_022 at 70.317

I AGREE with the evaluator's assessment. The immediate priority is to SUBMIT exp_033 to:
1. Verify the score on LB
2. Confirm no overlap issues
3. Establish verified baseline

## What We've Learned

### EXHAUSTED APPROACHES (DO NOT RETRY):
- ❌ SA/GA/B&B/CP optimization - All hit same local optimum
- ❌ External data mining - Current solution is BETTER than all public sources
- ❌ Ensemble from snapshots - Already done, diminishing returns
- ❌ Fractional translation - Already applied, no improvements

### KEY INSIGHT:
The target (68.861) is BELOW the current LB #1 (68.89). This means we need to beat the WORLD RECORD. Top teams have:
- 900+ submissions
- Days/weeks of compute time
- Access to private solutions (Telegram, Discord)

## Next Experiment: SUBMIT AND VERIFY

**IMMEDIATE ACTION: Submit exp_033 to Kaggle**

This is the highest priority because:
1. We need to verify the 70.306 score on LB
2. We need to confirm no overlap issues
3. We have 85 submissions remaining - plenty of quota

**AFTER SUBMISSION:**

If LB matches CV (~70.306):
- Our validation is correct
- Continue with extended optimization

If LB is worse or fails:
- There's a validation issue
- Need to investigate and fix

## Extended Optimization Strategy

Given the gap is too large for incremental improvements, the only remaining options are:

### Option 1: Extended Compute Time
Run bbox3/sa_parallel for MUCH longer (8+ hours) on specific N values:
- Focus on N=101-200 (contributes 48.2% of score)
- Use all available compute time

### Option 2: Per-N Specialization
For each N value, try:
1. Multiple random restarts with different seeds
2. Different optimization parameters
3. Track best per-N across ALL runs

### Option 3: Accept Current Performance
The current score (70.306) is competitive but not winning.
If the target is truly unreachable, focus on:
1. Ensuring submission is valid
2. Maximizing score within current approach
3. Documenting learnings

## What NOT to Try
- ❌ More external data mining (exhausted)
- ❌ New local search algorithms (all hit same optimum)
- ❌ Small parameter tweaks (won't close 2% gap)

## CRITICAL: SUBMIT exp_033 NOW
The most important action is to submit and get LB feedback.
We have 85 submissions remaining - use them!
