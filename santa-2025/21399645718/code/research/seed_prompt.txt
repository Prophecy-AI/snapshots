## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.316492 from exp_022 (extended C++ optimization)
- Best LB score: 70.3165 (verified, matches CV perfectly)
- Target: 68.870074 | Gap to target: 1.446 points (2.10%)

## CRITICAL REALITY CHECK

**THE TARGET MAY BE UNREALISTIC:**
- Current #1 on leaderboard: 68.894566 (Jingle bins with 953 submissions)
- Our target: 68.870074 (0.024 points BETTER than current #1!)
- This target appears to be based on expected final scores or private solutions

**WHAT WE'VE PROVEN:**
1. 11 consecutive experiments (exp_020 to exp_030) found ZERO meaningful improvement
2. Multiple algorithm families tested: SA, B&B, exhaustive, lattice, interlock, jostle, BLF, extended C++, constraint programming
3. External datasets (Telegram, Saspav, Bucket) provide only 0.008 improvement - 180x less than needed
4. The solution is at an EXTREMELY strong local optimum

## Response to Evaluator

The evaluator correctly identified that:
1. The solution is at a very strong local optimum (confirmed by 11 experiments)
2. External data sources have been partially mined but provide minimal improvement
3. The target may be unrealistic without private solutions or extended compute time

**I AGREE with the evaluator's assessment.** The gap of 1.45 points cannot be closed by:
- Running more iterations of existing optimizers
- Combining external data sources
- Trying different algorithm families (all converge to same score)

**HOWEVER, I WILL NOT GIVE UP.** The rules forbid concluding the target is unreachable.

## Strategy for Next Experiment

Given the constraints, there are only THREE possible paths forward:

### PATH 1: EXTENDED COMPUTE TIME (RECOMMENDED)
Run bbox3 optimizer for 8+ HOURS (overnight) with maximum settings:
- `-n 500000` (500K iterations per N)
- `-r 500` (500 restarts)
- All 26 CPU threads
- Focus on N=2-50 (highest individual scores)

**WHY:** Top competitors run for DAYS. Our longest run was 64 minutes. The optimizer CAN find tiny improvements (0.0001%) that accumulate over time.

### PATH 2: ENSEMBLE THE NEW EXTERNAL DATA
Integrate the Saspav santa-2025.csv improvements (0.008 points):
- N=123: +0.002244
- N=122: +0.001373
- N=124: +0.000889
- Plus 38 other N values with small improvements

**WHY:** Even small improvements count. This is guaranteed improvement.

### PATH 3: SUBMIT CURRENT BEST AND ITERATE
Submit the current 70.316492 solution and use remaining 87 submissions to iterate.

## ⛔ FORBIDDEN (WILL BE REJECTED)
- More Python implementations of SA/B&B/exhaustive search (all converge to same score)
- "Different parameters" on the same optimizer
- Any approach that has already been tried in exp_020 to exp_030

## ✅ REQUIRED: NEXT EXPERIMENT

**EXPERIMENT 031: EXTENDED OVERNIGHT OPTIMIZATION**

1. Create experiments/031_overnight_optimization/
2. Run bbox3 for 8+ hours with maximum settings
3. Focus on N=2-50 (highest individual scores)
4. Track improvements per-N
5. Submit result to get LB feedback

**ALTERNATIVE: EXPERIMENT 031: EXTERNAL DATA ENSEMBLE**

If overnight optimization is not feasible:
1. Create experiments/031_external_ensemble/
2. Integrate Saspav santa-2025.csv improvements
3. Validate for overlaps using strict integer arithmetic
4. Submit to get LB feedback

## What NOT to Try
- More Python SA implementations (exp_003, exp_020-030 all failed)
- More exhaustive search (exp_004, exp_030 found nothing)
- More NFP implementations (exp_005 found nothing)
- More backward propagation (exp_002 found nothing)
- More constraint programming (exp_030 found 0.0000038 improvement)

## CRITICAL: SUBMIT EVERY EXPERIMENT
We have 87 submissions remaining. LB feedback is FREE information.
Even if CV score is worse, submit it! LB might be different.
