    "\n",
    "1. **The gap is 1.45 points (2.1%)** - This requires ~2% improvement across ALL N values\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Top teams have access to private solutions** from Telegram/Discord that we don't have\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **The jonathanchan kernel shows the approach:**\n",
    "   - Ensemble from MANY sources (including private Telegram data)\n",
    "   - C++ compiled SA optimizer running for hours\n",
    "   - Fractional translation refinement\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Our current solution (70.307) is BETTER than all publicly available solutions**\n",
    "   - We've exhausted all public data sources\n",
    "   - The remaining gap requires either:\n",
    "     a) Access to private solutions\n",
    "     b) Fundamentally different algorithms\n",
    "     c) Much longer compute time\n",
    "\n",
    "## Strategy Options:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Submit the fixed version** to verify it passes Kaggle validation\n",
    "2. **Focus on small N optimization** - N=1-20 contribute most to score\n",
    "3. **Implement novel algorithms** - NFP, branch-and-bound, genetic algorithms\n",
    "4. **Accept current performance** - We may have hit the ceiling without private data"
