  "notes": "Constraint Programming / MIP approach for small N values. Tried: (1) Differential Evolution for N=2,3,4 - found 0.0000038 improvement on N=2 only. (2) Exhaustive search with 180-degree constraint for N=2. (3) Gradient-based refinement. (4) Searched 6208 snapshot files for better solutions. Result: NO meaningful improvement found. The current solution is at an extremely strong local optimum that cannot be escaped even with exact methods. The gap to target (68.873) is 1.44 points (2.05%)."
