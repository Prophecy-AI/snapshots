  "notes": "Crystalline packing for large N values (N=100-200). Tested hexagonal, square, rectangular, and alternating-angle lattices with multiple rotation angles (0-90 degrees). Found ZERO improvements. The baseline already uses highly optimized irregular patterns that beat regular lattices. N=101-200 contributes 48.2% of total score (33.88 points), but crystalline packing cannot improve it. The baseline patterns are more efficient than any regular geometric lattice."
