  "notes": "Tessellation-based construction approach. Tested hexagonal, square, diagonal, triangular, interlocking, brick, and spiral patterns for N=2-50. Found ZERO improvements. The baseline is already using sophisticated non-regular patterns with varying rotations that outperform any regular tessellation. N=1 is already optimal at 45 degrees (score 0.661250). The baseline patterns are highly optimized and cannot be improved by regular tessellation approaches."
