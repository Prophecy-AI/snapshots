  "notes": "Tried lattice-based packing approach (egortrushin kernel style) and backward propagation. Lattice approach for N=72 achieved score 0.428 vs baseline 0.349 - WORSE. Backward propagation from N=200 to N=1 found NO improvements. The baseline is at a very tight local optimum that these approaches cannot beat."
