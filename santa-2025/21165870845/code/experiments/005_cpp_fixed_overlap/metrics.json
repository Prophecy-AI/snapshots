  "notes": "Fixed C++ overlap detection and validated with Shapely. Confirmed that the previous experiment (004) had INVALID results due to buggy overlap detection. N=2-7 and N=10 had severe overlaps. After reverting to baseline for overlapping N values, there is NO improvement. The baseline is at a very tight local optimum."
