The most effective approaches today combine a fast geometric engine (usually based on **no\u2011fit polygons** or other collision\u2011free region representations) with a high\u2011level optimizer that searches the placement order and orientation.  A classic sequential\u2011optimization framework first builds a candidate placement set with NFPs and then uses a meta\u2011heuristic (genetic algorithm, simulated\u2011annealing, tabu search, etc.) to decide the order in which parts are placed; this strategy consistently yields high material\u2011utilisation in manufacturing domains such as shipbuilding, metalworking and apparel\u202f([frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/mechanical-engineering/articles/10.3389/fmech.2022.966691/full)).
