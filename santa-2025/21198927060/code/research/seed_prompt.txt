## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.627582 from exp_021 (tessellation approach)
- Best LB score: 70.6276 (confirmed from submission #9)
- Target: 68.919154 | Gap to target: 1.708 points (2.42%)

## CV-LB Relationship Analysis
- This is a DETERMINISTIC optimization problem - CV = LB exactly
- All 9 submissions confirm perfect CV-LB alignment
- No distribution shift issues - pure combinatorial optimization

## Response to Evaluator
The evaluator correctly identified:
1. **File path discrepancy is FIXED** - both /home/code/submission.csv and /home/submission/submission.csv now have score 70.627582
2. **All approaches converge to same local optimum** - This is the CORE PROBLEM
3. **MIP formulation recommended** - Agree this is a promising unexplored direction

The evaluator's key insight is correct: we need a FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT approach, not more iterations of SA/bbox3.

## Key Analysis Findings (Loop 22)

### Efficiency Analysis by N:
- **N=1**: Score 0.661, efficiency 53% (WORST - huge room for improvement)
- **N=2**: Score 0.451, efficiency 78%
- **N=3-10**: Efficiency 80-93%
- **N>50**: Efficiency 97-106% (already near optimal)

### Where the Gap Is:
- Small N (1-10) contributes 4.33 to total score with average 85% efficiency
- If we achieved 95% efficiency for N=1-10, we'd save 0.645 points
- This alone would close 38% of the gap to target!

### Symmetry Analysis:
- 22 N values show 180° rotational symmetry
- Angle diversity varies: N=2 has 2 unique angles, N=100 has 41
- The baseline is NOT purely symmetric - it already uses varied angles

## Recommended Approaches (Priority Order)

### 1. **[HIGHEST PRIORITY] Focus on N=1 Optimization**
N=1 has the WORST efficiency (53%) and contributes 0.661 to total score.
- Current: Single tree at angle 45°, score 0.661250
- Theoretical minimum: ~0.35 (tree area)
- Potential improvement: 0.31 points (18% of gap!)

**Action**: Exhaustively search all angles for N=1 to find optimal orientation.

### 2. **[HIGH PRIORITY] Optimize N=2-5 with Exhaustive Search**
These have 78-84% efficiency with significant room for improvement.
- N=2: Score 0.451, potential improvement ~0.08
- N=3-5: Combined potential improvement ~0.15

**Action**: For each N=2-5, exhaustively search position/angle combinations.

### 3. **[MEDIUM PRIORITY] MIP Formulation for Small N**
Use Mixed Integer Programming to find provably optimal solutions for N=1-20.
- Can PROVE optimality or find improvements
- Focus on N where efficiency is worst

### 4. **[EXPERIMENTAL] Asymmetric Perturbation**
For N values with high symmetry, try breaking symmetry systematically:
- Perturb one tree's position/angle
- Run local optimization from perturbed state
- May escape symmetric local optimum

## What NOT to Try
- ❌ More SA/bbox3 iterations (converges to same optimum)
- ❌ Random restart SA (random configs are worse)
- ❌ Ensemble from public sources (all at same optimum)
- ❌ Gradient descent (baseline is at local minimum)
- ❌ Repairing invalid solutions (overlaps are why they're better)

## Validation Notes
- CV = LB exactly (deterministic problem)
- Use Shapely for overlap detection
- Score formula: sum(S²/N) for N=1-200

## SUBMISSION STRATEGY
- Remaining submissions: 91
- Submit after EVERY experiment that produces a valid improvement
- We have abundant submissions - use them for feedback!

## Concrete Next Experiment
**Experiment 024: Exhaustive N=1 Optimization**

1. For N=1, the score is S²/1 = S² where S is the bounding box side
2. The tree has fixed shape - only angle matters for bounding box
3. Search all angles 0-360° in 0.01° increments
4. Find the angle that minimizes bounding box side

Expected outcome: Should find optimal angle for N=1 (likely around 45° but verify)
