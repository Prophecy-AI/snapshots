      "text": "**What is the history of Christmas trees? What do they have to do with Jesus\u2019 birth?** Although the Christmas tree is full of symbolic meaning for the Christian tradition, there is no immediate connection between Jesus and this particular practice. In fact, the evergreen has a rich history of religious significance among pagan cultures, which is why some Christians have rejected the tradition outright. Despite its pagan beginnings, the symbolism of the evergreen easily finds parallels in the gospel stories, which is why the tree has figured within the Christmas tradition for over 500 years.\n\n**Pagan Worship and Sacred Trees**\n\n**The Solstice Evergreen**\n\nLong before it was incorporated into the Christian tradition, the Solstice Evergreen was a common pagan symbol in many cultures throughout the world. Ranging from prehistoric Japan to Northern Africa, from Native America to Medieval Germany, it signified the persistence of new life amid the darkness of winter. [\\[1\\]](https://gominno.com/gominno.com#_ftn1)\n\nAs the name implies, these \u201cevergreens\u201d never withered or died with the onset of winter. They were therefore perceived by pagan cultures as a metaphor for the undying gods of the natural world: \u201cJust as the Midwinter fires celebrated the longed for return of the sun, so did the evergreen tree signify the continuing presence of burgeoning life in the midst of Winter\u2019s sleep of death.\u201d [\\[2\\]](https://gominno.com/gominno.com#_ftn2)\n\nThe solstice evergreen was therefore a reminder of the life that never dies, and continues \u201ceven when the sun is at its lowest ebb.\u201d [\\[3\\]](https://gominno.com/gominno.com#_ftn3)\n\n**Pagan Harvest Rituals**\n\nIn addition to the rituals surrounding the solstice evergreen, many cultures conducted harvest rituals that included the adornment of trees. For example, during the first two centuries following Christ\u2019s birth, Romans celebrated the festival of \u201cSaturnalia,\u201d honoring Saturnus, the god of agriculture, by decorating trees with trinkets and candles.\u201d To the north, the ancient Druids of England, France and Ireland \u201cdecorated oak trees with fruit and candles to honor their gods of harvest.\u201d [\\[4\\]](https://gominno.com/gominno.com#_ftn4)\n\nOf particular significance to modern day practice is the mythology and practice of the ancient Germanic tribes. The Christmas tree tradition of today is commonly traced back to Germany, an area inhabited by Germanic tribes whose mythology incorporated sacred trees. Among the most notable of these \u201cpatron trees\u201d were Thor\u2019s Oak and the mythological Yggdrasil.\n\nThe festivities associated with these trees were, however, of a darker sort. Consistent with Norse mythology\u2019s emphasis on the number nine, pagan kings are recorded as having sacrificed nine animals or slaves every ninth year by suspending them from the branches of trees. [\\[5\\]](https://gominno.com/gominno.com#_ftn5)\n\n**The History and Legend of Saint Boniface**\n\n**The History**\n\nAs already mentioned, the modern tradition of the Christmas tree traces its roots to Germany. It was in Germany where the Christian tradition famously collided with pagan ritual. In particular, the actions of St. Boniface, an English Bishop who lived from 675 to 754, are often cited as the source of the custom.\n\nKnown as \u201cThe Apostle of the Germans,\u201d St Boniface settled in the German region of Hesse during the eighth century. He arrived as a missionary on behalf of the Church of Rome. After a period of successful ministry, Boniface temporarily left his mission to confer with Pope Gregory II (715-731) in Rome.\n\nUpon his return to Germany for the Christmas of 723, Boniface was appalled to learn that the Germans had reverted to their former idolatrous ways. He found them in the midst of preparing for the Winter Solstice by sacrificing a young man under Odin\u2019s sacred oak tree. In an enraged response reminiscent of Moses at Mount Sinai, Bishop Boniface took up an axe and cut down the mighty tree.\n\nThis event, which is historically documented, has come to symbolize the triumph of Christianity in Germany over the pagan divinities. What follows, however, is more likely to be the result of legend.\n\n**The Legend**\n\nLegend has it that at the first blow of the axe, a strong gust of wind instantly brought down the tree: \u201cThe astounded Germans fearfully recognized the hand of God in this event and humbly asked Boniface how they should celebrate Christmas. The Bishop, the legend continues, pointed to a small fir tree that had miraculously remained upright and intact beside the debris and broken branches of the fallen oak. Boniface was familiar with the popular custom of taking an evergreen plant into the house in winter and asked everyone to take home a fir tree. This tree signifies peace, and as an evergreen it also symbolizes immortality; with its top pointing upwards, it additionally indicates heaven, the dwelling place of God.\u201d [**\\[6\\]**](https://gominno.com/gominno.com#_ftn6)\n\nOther legends also describe St. Boniface as using the shape of the evergreen tree in a lesson on the Christian faith. The cone-shaped evergreens had a triangular appearance, which St. Boniface allegedly referenced to introduce the notion of the Trinity. [\\[7\\]](https://gominno.com/gominno.com#_ftn7)\n\n**The Emergence of a New Christian Tradition**\n\n**The First Christmas Trees**\n\nThe city of Riga, Latvia, claims to be the home of the first Christmas tree. To this day, an octagonal plaque sits in the town square with the following words: \u201cThe First New Years Tree in Riga in 1510.\u201d This declaration appears in eight different languages. [\\[8\\]](https://gominno.com/gominno.com#_ftn8)\n\nAround this same time period, Martin Luther is said to have decorated a small tree in his house to symbolize the way the stars shined at night. There is, however, some debate as to whether this event occurred before or after the Riga holiday tree. [\\[9\\]](https://gominno.com/gominno.com#_ftn9)\n\nIn addition to the history of Riga, our modern custom can also be traced to 16th century Germany. The earliest _recorded_ reference of a Christmas tree comes from a Breme guild chronicle of 1570, describing a small fir erected in the guild house and decorated with apples, nuts, dates, pretzels and paper flowers. The tree was erected for the benefit of the guild members\u2019 children, who collected the treats on Christmas day. Another early reference is from Basel in 1597, where the tailor apprentices decorated a tree with apples and cheese.\n\nAlthough it is difficult to pinpoint the exact birth of the Christmas tree tradition, it is clear that it emerged in the 16th century, in or around Germany. By the 17th century, the custom had spread to the extent that some German families erected trees in their own homes. [\\[10\\]](https://gominno.com/gominno.com#_ftn10)\n\n**The Tradition Spreads Beyond Germany**\n\nBy the early 18th century, the Christmas tree custom had become common in towns of the upper Rhineland, but it had not yet spread to rural areas. The Catholic majority in the lower Rhine regarded the practice as a Protestant custom, but it eventually spread south when Prussian officials were moved there in the wake of the Congress of Vienna in 1815. [\\[11\\]](https://gominno.com/gominno.com#_ftn11) Before the end of the century, the Roman Catholic Church would officially recognize the practice.\n\nIn the early 19th century, Christmas trees became popular among the nobility and spread to royal courts as far as Russia. Princess Henrietta of Nassau-Weilburg introduced the Christmas tree to Vienna in 1816, and the custom spread across Austria in the following years. In France, the first Christmas tree was introduced in 1840 by the duchess of Orleans. [\\[12\\]](https://gominno.com/gominno.com#_ftn12)\n\nAround the same time, King George III\u2019s German wife, Queen Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, introduced the Christmas tree to Britain. However the custom did not spread beyond the royal family for some time. As a child, Queen Victoria was famili...",

In fact their cells contain a structure that looks like Christmas trees. But what is this particular structure? They are rRNA transcription units in chromatin spreads. And what does this mean?****Keep reading to understand it!**\n**In this article we will explain the genetic and transcription bases of this structure.**\n* [DNA and RNA](https://bionomous.ch/articles/christmas-tree-xenopus/#dna)\n* [Christmas tree structure](https://bionomous.ch/articles/christmas-tree-xenopus/#christmas)\n* [Conclusion](https://bionomous.ch/articles/christmas-tree-xenopus/#conclusion)\n* [References](https://bionomous.ch/articles/christmas-tree-xenopus/#ref)\n## DNA and RNA\nAll living organisms are built from deoxyribonucleotide acid (DNA).**In animals, most DNA is localized in the nucleus of the cells and contains the genetic instructions used to build proteins.**The DNA is organized in a double helix with two chains of nucleotides, which are composed of sugars, phosphate groups and nitrogenous bases.**There are four types of nitrogenous base : adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G) and thymine (T).**These four nucleotides are combined and the sequence of these bases determine the genetic information.**The most important thing is the necessity to have complementation between bases.**In fact, A must be in front of T and C must be in front of G. This complementation ensures that no genetic information is lost during transcription.\n![](https://bionomous.ch/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/DNA-.jpg)Figure 1: complementation in DNA\n**To go from DNA to proteins, it is necessary to go through an RNA intermediate.**RNA is a single chain which looks like DNA but the nitrogenous bases are not exactly the same. In fact,**uracil (U) replaces thymine (T).**RNA is obtained from DNA by a process called transcription so RNA is a complementary chain of a DNA chain.\n![](https://bionomous.ch/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ADN-ARN.jpg)Figure 2: ADN (upstairs) and its complementary RNA (downstairs)\nThere are different kinds of RNA (see below) but the one which interests us is rRNA.**rRNA are transcribed to be an essential component of ribosomes.**Ribosomes are the structures in the cells responsible for making proteins.\nIt also exists mRNA, tRNA and other small RNAs that have regulatory functions in transcription.\nDo you want more explanation about mRNA, rRNA and tRNA ?**You can find more information by clicking on the RNA names below.**\nmRNA\nmRNA is a copy of DNA that allows genetic information to leave the cell nucleus. mRNA sequence is read by the ribosome in order to build an amino acid chain specific to each protein(2).\nrRNA\nrRNA is synthesized in a special nucleus region. It is an essential component of ribosomes(3).\ntRNA\ntRNA finds its complementary codon on mRNA and provides amino acid to constitute protein(4).\nRibosomes read the mRNA to assemble the amino acids that make up the proteins.**mRNA is read by codons that are groups with three nitrogenous bases, and the process is called translation.**\n![](https://bionomous.ch/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Ribosome-1024x412.png)Figure 3: scheme of a translation\n## Christmas tree structure\nThe particular structure seen in*Xenopus laevis*is actually present in all eukaryotic cells(1).**Eukaryotes represent organisms with DNA contained in a nucleus****(5).**\n**The Christmas tree structure takes place in the nucleus and represents active rRNA-coding regions (1,6)****.**Indeed, the trunk of the tree is represented by DNA while each branch is a nascent rRNA(1)and the balls are\u00a0 processing complexes, called 5\u2019ETS process complex(1).**This Christmas tree structure is also called \u201cMiller spreads\u201d**in reference to the scientist who visualized this structure for the first time(7).\n![](https://bionomous.ch/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Schema-arbre-de-miller-1024x449.jpg)Figure 3: Scheme of a Miller spreads\nIn 1969, Miller and Beatty visualized the Christmas tree structure for the first time in Xenopus laevis.They developed a method still known today as**Miller chromatin spreading method**.\nThis technique involves the destruction of the cells so that the DNA is released from the nucleus and is dispersed. After centrifugation, the basic nucleosomal structure is conserved(8).They used transmission electron microscopy to see DNA(9).**Transmission electron microscopy is used to generate a highly-magnified image (up to 2 million times)****(10)**. Electrons are propelled into the sample and pass through it until they hit a screen at the bottom of the microscope. An image of the sample appears on the screen(10).\n![TEM composition and a Xenopus laevis sample visualisation](https://bionomous.ch/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/TEM-image-1024x640.jpg)Figure 4: Transmission electron microscopy scheme and the sample visualization (modified from (1))\n## Conclusion\nDNA and RNA combine to form a Christmas tree structure that was visualized for the first time in 1969 by Miller and collaborators. The techniques they used have greatly helped to advance our knowledge in biology.\nThe fact that Miller spreads were visualized in Xenopus laevis cells shows its importance\u00a0 as a model organism.\n## References\n1.

Prospecting, reach/traffic, and retention by the numbers\nOn view\u2011heavy platforms, people often discover you in feed or video and return later via search or direct to purchase.\n**Clicks-Only**records a multi-touch lens, but doesn&#x27;t account for the entire attribution process.\n\u200d**C+DV**(Clicks + Deterministic Views) closes that gap by ingesting verified impression events from participating platforms and matching them one\u2011to\u2011one with orders alongside your first\u2011party click data.\nThat\u2019s**deterministic**(factual), not probabilistic modeling, which allows views to share credit with clicks without guesswork.\n*This article serves as a part companion piece to a webinar I hosted about C+DV. You can see the full recording of the webinar here:*\n[![Embedded YouTube video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/JZuXR7j0zk4/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZuXR7j0zk4)\n### **Three Objectives, Three patterns: Who Benefits Most**\nWhen you compare Clicks\u2011Only vs C+DV and cut results by objective, three consistent patterns emerge.\n1) Prospecting (top\u2011of\u2011funnel) Prospecting campaigns usually gain meaningfully under**C+DV**. They\u2019re the programs designed to generate discovery, so their impact shows up once verified views can carry their share of credit. Expect many \u201cborderline\u201d prospecting lines (under clicks\u2011only) to cross into positive territory when you widen the lens to include deterministic views and longer windows.\nWhat to look for:\n* Campaigns that miss goal on Clicks\u2011Only, but meet or exceed goal under C+DV\u2014especially when their LTV/longer\u2011window ROAS strengthens.\n* First\u2011time customer contribution: it\u2019s a better read on incrementality for view\u2011attributable impact.\n2) Reach/Traffic \u201cReach\u201d and \u201ctraffic\u201d objectives are the classic under\u2011credited lines in a click\u2011centric workflow. Under C+DV, they frequently move from ambiguous to plainly accretive because the model now attributes part of the outcome to verified exposures that didn\u2019t earn an immediate click.\nWhat to look for:\n* A sharp contrast between Clicks\u2011Only and C+DV performance for reach/traffic campaigns, with bigger gains as you extend the attribution window (7/14/30\u2011day).\n* Stronger lifts on video\u2011heavy placements versus static\u2011heavy ones, consistent with how views influence later conversion behavior.\n3) Retention can benefit too, but more modestly: it\u2019s typically a mix of genuine influence and exposures to already\u2011engaged customers. Treat it as a balancing lever, not your primary growth engine. When evaluating retention lift, weight first\u2011time vs returning customer performance differently to separate incrementality from \u201calready going to buy.\u201d\n### **Why These Gains are Real (and Not \u201cView Inflation\u201d)**\nC+DV\u2019s credit rules are deliberately conservative: rapid view\u2011plus\u2011click pairs within 30 seconds are de\u2011duplicated (the click wins),**clicks**retain even weighting, and**views**are pooled by platform and down\u2011weighted as the number of views from the same platform rises\u2014preventing \u201cview flooding\u201d from stealing outsized credit. Position in the funnel doesn\u2019t bias the view; it\u2019s the platform\u2011specific pool size that matters.\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63d10b3d150c60aefd5615d5/69000ce517efc920bdcee853_c%2Bdv-logic-northbeam.avif)\n### **What Gives Up Credit, and How to Plan Around It**\nAs top\u2011of\u2011funnel gains credit, something else gives. You\u2019ll often see \u201cunattributed\u201d shrink as view\u2011driven touchpoints fill clickless gaps. You\u2019ll also see last\u2011click \u201ccredit catchers\u201d (most commonly branded search and shopping) cede some conversions they previously absorbed in a Clicks\u2011Only world. That\u2019s expected and healthy: the model is reallocating to the touchpoints that actually created demand across publishers.\nBudget implication: protect and fund prospecting and reach/traffic programs that strengthen under C+DV; trim the bottom\u2011heavy skew that depended on last\u2011click over\u2011attribution.\n![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/63d10b3d150c60aefd5615d5/69000df4f0826239ce9dc71d_how-we-keep-view-floods-fair-cdv-northbeam.avif)\n### **How to Find Your Objective\u2011level Winners In Minutes**\nHere\u2019s a quick workflow you can run every week to identify which campaigns to protect or scale.\n#### Start broad, then narrow\nOpen the**Model Comparison**view and flip from Clicks\u2011Only to C+DV to see directional changes by source. Then, pivot by objective to pinpoint where lift concentrates (prospecting, reach/traffic, retention). This tells you what deserves protection before you dive into line items.\nSee this clip from the webinar, where I examine the model comparison:\n[![Embedded YouTube video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/JZuXR7j0zk4/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZuXR7j0zk4)\n#### Compare intra\u2011channel at the campaign level\nWithin each platform, compare each campaign under Clicks\u2011Only vs C+DV. Highlight any lines that are weak on clicks but meet/exceed goal under C+DV\u2014especially where LTV/longer\u2011window performance climbs too. Those are \u201cdon\u2019t cut\u2014fund\u201d candidates.\n*Examining how you can compare different models across channels:*\n[![Embedded YouTube video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/JZuXR7j0zk4/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZuXR7j0zk4)\n#### Respect conversion lag on view\u2011heavy channels\nOn TikTok in particular, one\u2011day performance rarely tells the story; it\u2019s common to see large jumps from 1\u2011day to 14/30\u2011day under C+DV as view influence materializes. Make 7/14/30\u2011day comparisons before deciding to scale, hold, or pause.\n#### Triage for Incrementality\nWhen judging prospecting/reach lift, emphasize first\u2011time customer results; you\u2019ll get a truer read on which upper\u2011funnel efforts are adding net\u2011new value.\n### **Concrete Examples (to Anchor the Objective Patterns)**\n* Reach/traffic and prospecting on Pinterest: Omnilux saw a 659% ROAS lift, 728% more transactions, and 671% more revenue on Pin...",

[kmercounterexact from BBMapTools](https://github.com/BioInfoTools/BBMap/blob/master/sh/kmercountexact.sh) might also be an option, but again tricky with long, noisy reads.\n\nThe closest solution [I could find](http://pb-falcon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html#assembly-graph-and-pread-overlaps) was to estimate the genome size from overlap statistics (for the raw reads, the error corrected preassembled reads or by mapping the raw reads to the assembled contigs) by:\n\n1. running an initial assembly using a small seed read length\n2. then plot the pre-assembled read overlap histogram.\n\nWhat do you think of this approach?\n\nI would like to use this kmer analysis to estimate genome size, but for now I could not find much. I do not have companion Illumina reads - if so, I could try the approach proposed by [Carvalho et al. 2016](https://genome.cshlp.org/content/26/12/1710.full.pdf+html)\n\nI have reads & in-house genome assemblies (Canu) from different isolates of the same species of fungus to compare.\n\n- [genome](https://bioinformatics.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/genome)\n- [software-recommendation](https://bioinformatics.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/software-recommendation)\n- [assembly](https://bioinformatics.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/assembly)\n- [k-mer](https://bioinformatics.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/k-mer)\n- [pacbio](https://bioinformatics.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/pacbio)\n\n[Share](https://bioinformatics.stackexchange.com/q/4748)\n\n[Improve this question](https://bioinformatics.stackexchange.com/posts/4748/edit)\n\nFollow\n\n[edited Jul 23, 2018 at 7:26](https://bioinformatics.stackexchange.com/posts/4748/revisions)\n\naechchiki\n\nasked Jul 23, 2018 at 7:19\n\n[![aechchiki's user avatar](https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8e8192ac3ae1983174164fa3a0ea84c8?s=64&d=identicon&r=PG&f=y&so-version=2)](https://bioinformatics.stackexchange.com/users/294/aechchiki)\n\n[aechchiki](https://bioinformatics.stackexchange.com/users/294/aechchiki) aechchiki\n\n2,6761313 silver badges3434 bronze badges\n\n$\\\\endgroup$\n\n[Add a comment](https://bioinformatics.stackexchange.com/questions/4748/estimate-genome-size-kmer-based-approach-from-pacbio-reads)\u00a0\\|\n\n## 2 Answers 2\n\nSorted by:\n[Reset to default](https://bioinformatics.stackexchange.com/questions/4748/estimate-genome-size-kmer-based-approach-from-pacbio-reads?answertab=scoredesc#tab-top)\n\nHighest score (default)Date modified (newest first)Date created (oldest first)\n\n5\n\n$\\\\begingroup$\n\nI don't think there is a method that would estimate a genome size using raw long reads.\n\nThe genome size estimates based on raw reads are done by fitting a model to kmer spectra (for instance [Genomescope](https://github.com/schatzlab/genomescope)). The kmer spectra built from long reads are really messy due to the high error rate of long reads. That makes fitting of a model quite difficult. These methods assume small error rates. If the error rate is as high as 0.1 (which is normal for long reads), then the probability of having one kmer of 23 bases correct is ~8%. Meaning that if the coverage is 100x, just ~8x of homozygous kmers would be the real genomic kmers and it's very likely that kmer peaks of the sequencing errors, heterozygous kmers and homozygous kmers will just blend into one.\n\nI can imagine, that if your coverage would crazy high (like 600x or more) the kmer spectra could separate errors and genomic kmers. You could also try to decrease kmer size to increase the proportion of correct kmers.\n\nAnother option would be to use a trick that they used to generate solid kmers for [genome assembly using generalized de brujin graph using noisy reads](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5206522/). Maybe it would be better to take a look on the newer version of the assembler, that is called [Flye](https://github.com/fenderglass/Flye).\n\nBut to be honest, I think for a long reads, a genome assembly is much more reliable way how to predict a genome size than any of the kmer tricks. I would simply assemble the genome, remap back reads, check the uniformity of coverage and conclude the genome size out it.\n\n\\-\\- edit --\n\nI tried to find some comprehensive evaluation of the assembly sizes compared to genome sizes, but I could not, so I just checked two examples, one big, one small and they both match quite well. _Ammopiptanthus nanus_ was assembled to 823.74 Mb while kmer estimate was 889 Mb ( [ref](https://academic.oup.com/gigascience/article/7/7/giy074/5039704)). _Plasmodium falciparum_ was assembled to [23.5 Mb](https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/3-52/v1) while the original genome size estimate is 22.8 Mb. I know it's just two, but there is also a good reason to think that the genome size will be reasonable, feel free to add here more examples.\n\nIf you would be worried about contamination in the assembly, you can first run it though one of the methods to detect a contamination (like [Blobology](https://github.com/blaxterlab/blobology)).\n\n[Share](https://bioinformatics.stackexchange.com/a/4752)\n\n[Improve this answer](https://bioinformatics.stackexchange.com/posts/4752/edit)\n\nFollow\n\n[edited Aug 26, 2018 at 20:17](https://bioinformatics.stackexchange.com/posts/4752/revisions)\n\nanswered Jul 23, 2018 at 11:12\n\n[![Kamil S Jaron's user avatar](https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/eace82204df7fec8a51dd354acdc20e2?s=64&d=identicon&r=PG)](https://bioinformatics.stackexchange.com/users/57/kamil-s-jaron)\n\n[Kamil S Jaron](https://bioinformatics.stackexchange.com/users/57/kamil-s-jaron) Kamil S Jaron\n\n5,56222 gold badges2626 silver badges5959 bronze badges\n\n$\\\\endgroup$\n\n6\n\n- $\\\\begingroup$ok, I can get genome size from assembly, as discussed. thanks for the input$\\\\endgroup$\n\n\u2013\u00a0[aechchiki](https://bioinformatics.stackexchange.com/users/294/aechchiki)\n\nCommentedJul 24, 2018 at 11:45\n\n- $\\\\begingroup$Using a genome assembly as a way to estimate the genome size is not reliable due to potential contamination causing assembly errors, possible failure to collapse some haplotypes, or assembly errors from inconsistent coverage.$\\\\endgroup$\n\n\u2013\u00a0[conchoecia](https://bioinformatics.stackexchange.com/users/2085/conchoecia)\n\nCommentedAug 25, 2018 at 6:32\n\n- $\\\\begingroup$@conchoecia I do agree, but the contamination problem is in kmer spectra analysis as well. But in my experience, long read assemblies I have seen so far were quite close to flow cytometry estimates and consistent with kmer spectra analysis. I will do some more research.
