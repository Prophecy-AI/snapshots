      "title": "ANSWER",
      "text": "Top\u2011scoring teams reach sub\u201169 results by abandoning the textbook symmetric layouts and instead building **asymmetric packings** that are rigorously validated before submission. The core workflow that consistently appears in the winning notebooks is:\n\n1. **Generate purely asymmetric tree arrangements** \u2013 start from irregular, non\u2011mirrored placements (e.g., offset rows, staggered angles) rather than the symmetric grids shown in most public notebooks.\u202fThese layouts have been shown to outperform symmetric patterns in the latest competition runs\u202f([Result\u202f1](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/santa-2025/discussion/666880)).\n\n2. **Apply a sequential validation pipeline** \u2013 after a candidate layout is created, run it through a step\u2011by\u2011step validator that checks each tree for overlap and boundary violations before moving to the next tree. This \u201cSequential Validation\u201d system catches subtle collisions early and prevents costly re\u2011evaluation later\u202f([Result\u202f4](https://www.kaggle.com/competition-hosting/664804)).\n\n3. **Perform collision auditing** \u2013 during validation, log any detected intersections and automatically adjust the offending tree\u2019s position (e.g., small translation or rotation) until the layout is collision\u2011free. Continuous auditing keeps the packing dense while guaranteeing feasibility\u202f([Result\u202f4](https://www.kaggle.com/competition-hosting/664804)).\n\n4. **Use asymmetric gearing (rotational offsets)** \u2013 rotate individual trees by non\u2011uniform angles and shift rows by fractional units so that the overall shape \u201cgears\u201d together asymmetrically. This technique reduces wasted space in the corners and edges of the square box\u202f([Result\u202f4](https://www.kaggle.com/competition-hosting/664804)).\n\n5. **Target specific\u202fN\u202fvalues with custom asymmetric patterns** \u2013 for problematic counts (e.g.,\u202fN\u202f=\u202f22 or\u202f24) teams craft bespoke asymmetric configurations that have been empirically proven to drop the score dramatically (e.g., a new asymmetric solution for\u202fN\u202f=\u202f22 achieved a score\u202f<\u202f0.36)\u202f([Result\u202f2](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/santa-2025/discussion/664824)).\n\nBy iterating these steps\u2014starting with an irregular layout, validating sequentially, auditing collisions, applying non\u2011uniform rotations, and fine\u2011tuning for each\u202fN\u2014top teams consistently push their total scores well below the 69\u2011point threshold.",

The final solution is evaluated by an ensemble score that combines all cases.\n**Notebook Link**:[Santa 2025 - Christmas Tree Packing Challenge V1](https://www.kaggle.com/code/adityapawar327/santa-2025-christmas-tree-packing-challenge-v1)\n**Public Score**: 85.92\n## Table of Contents\n[](#table-of-contents)\n* Library Imports and Environment Setup\n* Global Configuration and Precision Settings\n* ChristmasTree Class Definition\n* Utility Functions (Scoring/Collision)\n* Simulated Annealing Algorithm (N &lt; 20)\n* Grid Search Algorithm (N &gt;= 20)\n* Hybrid &amp; Ensemble Solvers\n* Main Computation Loop (N = 1 to 200)\n* Submission Formatting and Export\n## Methodology\n[](#methodology)\n* **Small N (&lt; 20):**Uses Simulated Annealing for efficient search in small configuration spaces.\n* **Large N (&gt;= 20):**Uses a tailored Grid Search for tractable solution space exploration.\n* **Hybrid/Ensemble:**Runs multiple seeds and chooses the best solution for each N.\n* **Collision Detection:**Employs Shapely geometry operations to prevent tree overlap.\n* **Performance:**Code leverages parallelization (`ProcessPoolExecutor`) and high-precision (Decimal) arithmetic.\n## Usage\n[](#usage)\n1. Install dependencies:\n* `shapely`,`numpy`,`pandas`,`matplotlib`,`tqdm`\n* Run the notebook or script sequentially to output results and save a`submission.csv`.\n* Check the score on important N cases (e.g., 1, 10, 25, 50, 100, 150, 200).\n## Output\n[](#output)\n* The notebook prints key logs during computation.\n* A`submission.csv`is generated with columns:`id`,`x`,`y`,`deg`(example row:`001\\_0, s-9.146226, s-0.12832, s-224.999647`).\n## License\n[](#license)\nThis project is released under the[Apache 2.0 License](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).\n## Author\n[](#author)\nAditya Pawar ([Kaggle Profile](https://www.kaggle.com/adityapawar327))\nFor questions or collaboration, feel free to reach out via Kaggle discussions or connect on[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adityapawar327).\n## About\nIn this re-defined optimization problem, help Santa fit Christmas tree toys into the smallest (2-dimension) parcel size possible so that ...",
