In the irregular strip packing problem considered in this work a finite number of rotations of convex as well as non-convex polygons with and without holes are permitted. To deal with the geometry of irregular items, direct trigonometry is applied. The focus is on aspects and characteristics that are typical for many affected industries and have been neglected so far. In the mentioned sectors, it is conceivable that items can be created from smaller parts by assembling them using various techniques.

Also, whether the large material, i.e., large object is single-colored or has a particular structure or design is of great importance. In the latter case, special attention must be paid to the rotation of certain items or parts in order to achieve the desired (uniform or non-uniform) appearance of the final product. The utilized data structure is introduced, to address the mentioned aspects in the presented mixed-integer linear model which is an extension of a formulation published by previous authors. Furthermore, the method of calculating \u201ccritical vertices\u201d is introduced, which requires only a reduced number of comparisons between edges and vertices of two items to ensure overlap-free positioning.

A large sheet of material (also called large object) - i.e., fabric, wood, metal, etc. - is available, from which manufacturers want to cut out as many small items (also called pieces) as possible while minimizing waste. Two-dimensional cutting and packing problems with irregular items (nesting problems) deal with the positioning of irregular as well as regular shaped items without overlapping inside the boundaries of one or more large objects whether regular or irregular in shape. Based on the typology of W\u00e4scher, Hau\u00dfner, &amp; Schumann (2007) regarding the number of dimensions considered and the type of items to be produced, the focus in this work is on the two-dimensional irregular open dimension problem (ODP), also known as the irregular strip packing problem. The objective is to minimize the needed length of the rectangular large object with a fixed width. In addition to the above properties that must be met, other aspects are also very important for the mentioned industries. It often happens that items cannot or should not be cut out as a whole. There may be different cutting patterns for an item to choose from. A cutting pattern in this context is a set of smaller parts that together form the desired item. The various cutting patterns for an item contain differently shaped parts that can be cut out independently before they are joined together. Sewing garments together, gluing wooden panels, or welding metal plates are examples. Choosing the right cutting pattern is important because the combination of parts in one cutting pattern may match the large object better than those in another, i.e., result in a shorter overall length of the large object. In the case of a printed large object, special care must be taken when planning the rotation of certain items. Those that need to harmonize with each other for some reason should be cut out in the same orientation so that they show a homogeneous design. Especially in the garment industry, however, it can happen that selected items are to be intentionally provided with non-uniform design and therefore a different rotation must be forced for those. In addition, polygons with holes are considered to represent realistic examples, where the holes can be filled with other items to make the best use of the available large material. A model formulation is introduced that covers these industry-relevant problems.</p><p>Various mathematical models for nesting problems have been presented in the literature. In the following overview, mixed-integer linear programming model formulations for the irregular strip packing problem that allow either no rotation or a small number of orientations for the items are considered in more detail. According to the classification of Leao, Toledo, Oliveira, Carravilla, &amp; Alvarez-Vald\u00e9s (2020) they differ from each other depending on the type of the variables, whether they are continuous, semi-continuous or discrete. While in continuous model formulations the coordinates of the pieces can be freely chosen within the boundaries of the large object, in discrete model formulations a finite set of coordinates are available for positioning. The constraints must ensure that the items do not overlap and that they are positioned within the boundaries of the large object. A large number of authors used the no-fit (NFP) and inner-fit (IFP) polygons to deal with the geometrical properties of the problem (e.g. Alvarez-Vald\u00e9s, Martinez, Tamarit, 2013, Cherri, Mundim, Andretta, Toledo, Oliveira, Carravilla, 2016, Dean, 2002, Fischetti, Luzzi, 2009, Leao, Toledo, Oliveira, Carravilla, 2016, Rodrigues, Toledo, 2017, Toledo, Carravilla, Ribeiro, Oliveira, Gomes, 2013), while the D-function which is a direct trigonometry strategy was only used in the publication of Cherri et\u00a0al.

(2013) presented the first model formulation for the irregular strip packing problem with discrete variables, called the \u201cdotted-board model\u201d. The large object was represented as a grid which is described by its columns and rows and consequently limits the number of possible positions. Based on the \u201cdotted-board model\u201d Rodrigues &amp; Toledo (2017) proposed a \u201cclique covering model\u201d formulation which reduced the number of constraints from the \u201cdotted-board model\u201d and improved the linear relaxation.

It differs from other 2-D C&P problems in the irregular shape of the pieces. This paper proposes a new mixed-integer model in which binary decision variables are associated with each discrete point of the board (a dot) and with each piece type. It is much more flexible than previously proposed formulations and solves to [optimality](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/optimality) larger instances of the nesting problem, at the cost of having its precision dependent on board [discretization](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/discretization). To date no results have been published concerning optimal solutions for nesting problems with more than 7 pieces. We ran computational experiments on 45 problem instances with the new model, solving to [optimality](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/optimality) 34 instances with a total number of pieces ranging from 16 to 56, depending on the number of piece types, grid resolution and the size of the board. A strong advantage of the model is its insensitivity to piece and board geometry, making it easy to extend to more complex problems such as non-convex boards, possibly with defects. Additionally, the number of binary variables does not depend on the total number of pieces but on the number of piece types, making the model particularly suitable for problems with few piece types. The discrete nature of the model requires a trade-off between grid resolution and problem size, as the number of binary variables grows with the square of the selected grid resolution and with board size.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe nesting problem, also known as irregular packing problem, belongs to the more generic class of cutting and packing (C&P) problems. As in all C&P problems, one or more big objects have to be divided into smaller items or pieces so that (1) unused regions of the big object, usually designated as waste, are minimized \u2014 input minimization problems, according to W\u00e4scher typology, or (2) the value of the pieces cut from the big object is maximized \u2014 output maximization problem, according to the same typology (W\u00e4scher et al., 2007). The problem addressed in this paper is a two-dimensional (2D) C&P problem, i.e. only two of the dimensions of the objects are relevant, as the third dimension is equal for all objects and pieces. Moreover, the goal is to minimize the used length of a big rectangular object (the board), of unbound length, making it a 2D Open Dimension Problem. It is often called irregular strip packing.\n\nThe nesting problem differs from other 2D C&P problems in the irregular shape of the pieces. Irregular shapes are those that involve non-trivial handling of the geometry (Bennell and Oliveira, 2008). This leaves out of our scope rectangles and circles, in which the evaluation of the distance between two pieces can be performed by simple coordinate comparison. The most common representation, in the literature, for the irregular shape of a piece is the polygon, and although geometric operations with polygons are not trivial, we will also assume that all pieces are represented by polygons. No additional constraints are imposed on the polygon characteristics, so we deal with the harder to tackle class of non-convex polygons.\n\nNesting problems are not only a scientific challenge, as they add the geometry handling complexity to the combinatorial optimization nature of C&P problems, but they are also most relevant in real-world applications. Indeed they arise in a wide variety of industrial production processes, including textile, garment, metalware, furniture and shoe industries. In all cases saving raw-materials represents an important contribution to the economic and environmental performance of companies.\n\nNesting problems have been addressed by many authors. However, given the problem complexity, to the best of the authors' knowledge there is no published exact mathematical programming based method to solve it, reaching guaranteed optimal solutions for the problem. Although a thorough tutorial on the nesting problem resolution is available (Bennell and Oliveira, 2009), the approaches that more closely relate to the work reported in this paper will be briefly highlighted.\n\nNot surprisingly, heuristic and metaheuristic algorithms are the basis of the overwhelming majority of the published approaches. Among these, the most recent approaches with best performance are from Gomes and Oliveira (2006), Egeblad et al. (2007), Imamichi et al. (2009), Bennell and Song (2010), and Leung et al. (2012). A pioneering work on the exact resolution of non-convex nesting problems (Carravilla et al., 2003) used constraint logic programming as resolution method and has solved to optimality problems with up to 7 pieces. All the other approaches deal with approximations or simpler forms of the nesting problem.\n\nThe first approximation is geometric and consists in considering only rectangular shapes. The first exact solution procedure for the constrained (i.e. with an upper bound on the number of pieces of each type to cut or pack) 2D non-guillotine rectangular problem was proposed by Beasley (1985) and was based on a binary integer programming formulation. The author assumes that all rectangle's lengths and widths are integers, leading to a discrete model, as pieces can only be placed on a set of discrete points of the board.

The classic packing solution is a hybrid algorithm based on heuristic positioning and meta-heuristic sequencing, which has the problems of complex solving rules and high time cost. In this study, the similarity measurement method based on the twin neural network model is used to evaluate the similarity of pieces in the source task and the target task. The reusability evaluation of packing tasks is designed to select appropriate source task knowledge. The transfer operator is used to transfer the piece sequence knowledge from the source task to complete the reuse of packing knowledge in the target task. The bottom-left algorithm is improved to complete the placement of 2D irregular pieces. The computational experiments show that the proposed algorithm for the bin packing problem using knowledge reuse and improved heuristic (KRIH) has good robustness. The KRIH algorithm can obtain 8 equal or better results on 16 instances in a relatively short time compared with some classical heuristic algorithms, which has good application potential.\n\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n\n### [A sampling-based winner determination model and algorithm for logistics service procurement auctions under double uncertainty](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-94748-x?fromPaywallRec=false)\n\nArticleOpen access08 April 2025\n\n### [Optimizing 2D irregular packing via image processing and computational intelligence](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-97202-0?fromPaywallRec=false)\n\nArticleOpen access10 April 2025\n\n### [Multi-objective steel plate cutting optimization problem based on real number coding genetic algorithm](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-27100-2?fromPaywallRec=false)\n\nArticleOpen access28 December 2022\n\n## Introduction\n\nPacking problems are commonly found in industries such as mechanical manufacturing, aviation, clothing, automotive manufacturing, shipbuilding, and furniture manufacturing. The manufacturing process of typical heavy industry products is shown in Fig.\u00a0[1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#Fig1). In actual production, efficient packing algorithms can improve the utilization of raw materials and reduce production costs within an acceptable time. In a sense, the reduction of raw material consumption can have a beneficial impact on the environment[1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#ref-CR1). Packing problems, also known as bin packing problems or nesting problems, can be divided into three categories[2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#ref-CR2): the one-dimensional (1D) packing problem (wire cutting stock problem)[3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#ref-CR3), [4](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#ref-CR4), the two-dimensional (2D) packing problem (planar packing problem)[5](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#ref-CR5), [6](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#ref-CR6) and the three-dimensional (3D) packing problem[7](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#ref-CR7). The 2D packing problem is an interesting combinatorial optimization problem, which is used to place pieces of different shapes on one or more plates according to certain rules to minimize the space occupied by pieces or maximize the utilization of raw materials. The pieces here are general terms. In the metal processing industry, it refers to the pieces to be processed. In the garment manufacturing industry, it refers to the sample to be cut. And in the logistics industry, it refers to the goods to be placed. The packing problem has a large solution space and is an NP-complete (NP-C) problem, and the optimal solution cannot be obtained in polynomial time[8](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#ref-CR8). According to the regularity of piece shape, 2D packing problems can be further divided into 2D regular and 2D irregular packing problems. Among them, 2D irregular packing problems have received widespread attention due to their more diverse piece shapes and complex packing operations. Compared with the rectangular packing problem, the 2D irregular piece packing problem is very different in constraint calculation, solution strategy, overlap detection, so it has a larger solution space and more complicated technical operation. The 2D irregular piece packing has more applications in actual production. For 2D irregular packing problems, the existing research focuses on finding the approximate optimal solution or satisfactory solution within an acceptable time. The solving of the 2D irregular packing problem often involves two stages: sequence optimization and position optimization. In the sequence optimization stage, the sequence of pieces arranged on the plate is optimized. In the position optimization stage, the final placement scheme of pieces on the plate is determined. Early solutions to the irregular packing problem include the polygonal envelope method[9](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#ref-CR9), clustering feature combination method, and fitting method[10](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#ref-CR10), etc. In the late 1970s, researchers began to study contour features based on the real shape of irregular pieces to judge the overlap between pieces. These methods include no-fit polygon (NFP)[11](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#ref-CR11), [12](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#ref-CR12), raster methods (also called pixel methods)[13](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#ref-CR13), linear programming (LP), and mixed-integer linear programming (MIP)[14](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#ref-CR14), [15](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#ref-CR15). Each method has its advantages, but the current mainstream method is NFP[16](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#ref-CR16). Burke E et al.[17](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#ref-CR17) designed an NFP algorithm capable of dealing with circular arcs, improved the track sliding method, and achieved good test results.\n\n**Fig. 1**\n\nThe manufacturing process of typical heavy industry products.\n\n[Full size image](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5/figures/1)\n\nIn the process of piece placement, commonly used positioning algorithms include the bottom-left (BL) algorithm[18](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#ref-CR18), the improving bottom-left (iBL) algorithm[19](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#ref-CR19), etc. Utilizing and improving the BL algorithm becomes one of the research points for solving 2D irregular packing problems. The sequence of piece placement is crucial for the final packing result.

      "text": "Constructive procedures to solve 2-Dimensional Bin Packing\nProblems with Irregular Pieces and Guillotine Cuts\nAntonio Martineza, Ramon Alvarez-Valdesb, Julia Bennella, Jose Manuel Tamaritb\na University of Southampton\nb University of Valencia\nAbstract\nThis paper presents an approach for solving a new real problem in Cutting and Packing. At its\ncore is an innovative mixed integer programme model that places irregular pieces and defines\nguillotine cuts. The two-dimensional irregular shape bin packing problem with guillotine con\u0002straints arises in the glass cutting industry, for example, the cutting of glass for conservatories.\nAlmost all cutting and packing problems that include guillotine cuts deal with rectangles only,\nwhere all cuts are orthogonal to the edges of the stock sheet and a maximum of two angles of\nrotation are permitted. The literature tackling packing problems with irregular shapes largely\nfocused on strip packing i.e. minimizing the length of a single fixed width stock sheet, and\ndoes not consider guillotine cuts. Hence, this problem combines the challenges of tackling the\ncomplexity of packing irregular pieces with free rotation, guaranteeing guillotine cuts that are\nnot always orthogonal to the edges of the stock sheet, and allocating pieces to bins. To our\nknowledge only one other recent paper tackles this problem. We present a hybrid algorithm\nthat is a constructive heuristic that determines the relative position of pieces in the bin and\nguillotine constraints via a mixed integer programme model. We investigate two approaches\nfor allocating guillotine cuts at the same time as determining the placement of the piece, and\na two phase approach that delays the allocation of cuts to provide flexibility in space usage.\nFinally we describe an improvement procedure that is applied to each bin before it is closed.\nThis approach improves on the results of the only other publication on this problem, and gives\ncompetitive results for the classic rectangle bin packing problem with guillotine constraints.\nKeywords: irregular packing, bin packing, guillotine cuts, mixed integer models.\n1 Introduction\nThe paper focuses on the two-dimensional bin packing problem(BBP) with irregular convex\npieces and guillotine cuts. Guillotine cuts arise due to the cutting process of certain materials,\nwhere cuts are restricted to extend from one edge of the stock-sheet to another. This is com\u0002monly found in the glass cutting industry and research has almost exclusively focused on the\ncutting of rectangles where the cuts are orthogonal to the edges of the stock sheet.The prob\u0002lem tackled here is a generalized version of the rectangle single size stock sheet bin packing\nproblem with guillotine constraints, where the pieces to be cut are irregular convex polygons\nand the guillotine cuts are not constrained to be orthogonal to the edges of the bin. We present\n1\na number of constructive heuristics that exploit a mixed integer programming(MIP) model for\nplacing the pieces in the bin while satisfying all the geometric constraints and the guillotine\ncuts and provide comprehensive results for benchmark instances for this problem and the rect\u0002angular bin packing problem with guillotine cuts. The results are compared with the best in the\nliterature and new lower bound is presented.\nThe motivation for tackling this problems arises in the cutting of glass sheets, for example,\nthe glass panes for conservatories. Glass is cut by scoring and snapping the material. Each cut\ndivides the sheet in two and is called a guillotine cut. As a result, only convex pieces can be cut\ndirectly. Since the properties of the material are homogeneous, pieces can be cut at any angle\nof rotation, and in some cases reflected. Typically, cutting plans involve multiple stock sheets.\nAn example solution to this problem is given in Figure 1. Note that the pieces must be removed\nby the guillotine cuts (in bold) in a specific order so that each cut begins and ends at the edge\nof the complete or divided stock sheet.\nThe requirement for guillotine cuts arise in many industries such as glass, wood boards or\nfibre glass for printed circuit boards. Each industrial setting implies a particular class of cutting\nand packing problem. For example, Malaguti et al. (2014) consider a cutting stock problem\nwith multiple stock sheets found in the wood industry, while Cui (2014) tackles the cutting of\nmetal of coils where a stock sheet is considered to have unrestricted length.\nThe literature tackling packing problems with irregular shapes largely focus on strip pack\u0002ing i.e. minimizing the length of a single fixed width stock sheet, see Bennell and Oliveira\n(2009), and does not consider guillotine cuts. Further, almost all cutting and packing problems\nthat include guillotine cuts deal with rectangles only, where all cuts are orthogonal to the edges\nof the stock sheet and a maximum of two angles of rotation of the pieces are permitted. Hence,\nthis problem combines the challenges of tackling the complexity of packing irregular pieces\nwith free rotation, guaranteeing guillotine cuts that may or may not be orthogonal to the edges\nof the stock sheet, and allocating pieces to bins or stock sheets. To our knowledge, Han et al.\n(2012) is the only other paper that tackles this problem. They propose two different construc\u0002tion heuristics. The first heuristic, they call a one-stage algorithm, constructs multiple parallel\nclusters of pieces by iteratively joining two blocks, where a block is either a piece or the convex\nhull of a cluster of pieces. Blocks are combined by matching pairs of edges and selecting the\nbest match according to a dynamic solution evaluation function. Since each accepted match,\nstarting with two individual pieces, is transformed into its convex block by taking the convex\nhull, the guillotine cut structure is always satisfied. The approach uses threshold parameters\nto control the number of blocks generated and as a result the computational time. The second\nconstructive heuristic, a two-stage algorithm, combines pairs of pieces into rectangles by using\nthe phi-functions presented by Bennell et al. (2011), and then uses the guillotine bin packing\nalgorithm developed by Charalambous and Fleszar (2011) to pack the rectangles. The combin\u0002ation of the pieces into rectangles using phi-functions requires significant computational effort,\nup to eighteen hours in the largest instance (149 pieces), although the packing algorithm by\nCharalambous and Fleszar (2011) takes less than one second. Most recently, Fleszar (2013)\ndeveloped an heuristic algorithm based on the insertions of the pieces one at a time obtaining\nslightly worse results but the computational time is much shorter.\nA key theme in the cutting and packing literature for irregular shape packing, is concerned\nwith efficiently identifying overlap between pieces. Bennell and Oliveira (2008) provide a\nuseful review of this aspect of the problem. In recent years the most common approach is to use\nthe Nofit Polygon (NFP). The NFP is a polygon derived from two component polygons in such\n2\n(a) (b) (c) (d)\n(e) (f) (g)\nFigure 1: Real example (J40)\na way that its interior represents all overlapping position between the component polygons, and\nits boundary represents all touching positions. By determining the location of the co-ordinate\npoint arising from the difference between the co-ordinate position of the reference point of\nthe two component polygons and comparing with the correctly located NFP, the overlap test\nreduces to a simple point inclusion test while the NFP has almost exclusively been used for\nplacing polygons, Burke et al. (2010) show that it can be extended to include arced edges.\nIn this paper we present a constructive heuristic that builds a solution by sequentially adding\npieces to the current bin, where a MIP model determines the position of pieces in the bin and the\ncorresponding guillotine constraints. Once a piece is placed in the bin, the relative p...",

An efficient 2D irregular packing algorithm can effectively improve material utilization and reduce processing costs. The reduction in material consumption will also have a beneficial impact on the environment ( [Ke et al., 2020](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B76)). Therefore, research of the packing problem is of great significance for technology and social interest.\n\nThe 2D packing problem is a type of combinatorial optimization problems to locate parts with different shapes compactly in one or more master sheet material to minimize the occupied space or maximize the utilization of the material. The 2D packing problem is currently recognized as a NP problem, which is mainly solved by heuristic algorithms. In recent years, many scholars have conducted research on 2D irregular packing problems with a verity of solutions.\n\nThere exists a number of review articles on packing and cutting problems. We have summarized the main review literature in the field of 2D packing and cutting as shown in [Table 1](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#T1). Brown ( [Brown, 1971](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B17)) introduced an optimum packing and depletion problem with optimization of space and resource usage. Harvey ( [Salkin and De Kluyver, 1975](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B116)) surveyed the application of mathematical optimization models such as linear programming to the knapsack problem. Bruce ( [Golden, 1976](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B50)) surveyed various approaches to the cutting stock problem. Hinxman ( [Hinxman, 1980](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B65)) surveyed the trim-loss and assortment problems, this research paid more attention to cutting and packaging problems in practical applications, and did not mention much about theoretical methods. Garey and Coffman ( [Garey and Johnson, 1981](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B47); [Coffman et al., 1984](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B27)) surveyed the approximation algorithms for bin packing problems. Israni ( [Israni and Sanders, 1982](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B72)) reviewed the 2D cutting stock problem including almost all 2D packaging problems. The author also proposed a rectangular layout method. Sarin ( [Sarin, 1983](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B118)) reviewed methodologies and literature to solve 2D stock cutting problems and introduced an interactive optimization procedure for a general 2D stock cutting problem. Dyckhoff ( [Dyckhoff et al., 1985](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B38)) described a trim loss and related problems and categorized them briefly. Dudzi\u0144ski ( [Dudzi\u0144ski and Walukiewicz, 1987](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B36)) summarized the exact methods for knapsack problems, such as linear programming. Matthias ( [Rode and Rosenberg, 1987](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B114)) analyzed the algorithm for the trim-loss problems. Haessler ( [Haessler and Sweeney, 1991](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B59)) reviewed the solution process of cutting stock problems, including placement algorithm and sequence optimization algorithm. Dowsland ( [Dowsland and Dowsland, 1992](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B34)) reviewed the application of operations research methods to the packing problem and summarized some exact heuristics. Sweeney ( [Sweeney and Paternoster, 1992](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B128)) categorized cutting and packing problems and made application-oriented research records. Cheng ( [Cheng et al., 1994](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B22)) discussed 2D cutting stock problems and their application cases including the pallet loading problem and VLSI placement problem. With the gradual deepening of research on 2D layout problems, typology becomes a common research topic. 2D regular and irregular layout problems are clearly distinguished in practical applications and theoretical methods. Dowsland ( [Dowsland and Dowsland, 1995](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B29)) gave a special review of the 2D irregular nesting problem for the first time. Mavridou ( [Mavridou and Pardalos, 1997](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B98)) summarized applications of the genetic algorithm and simulated annealing algorithm in the optimization of facility layout problems. Dyckhoff ( [Dyckhoff, 1990](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B37)) made a typology of the cutting and packing problems in detail, and W\u00e4scher ( [W\u00e4scher et al., 2007](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B135)) improved the typology later. Hopper ( [Hopper and Turton, 1999](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B67); [Hopper and Turton, 2001a](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B68); [Hopper and Turton, 2001b](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B69)) investigated the application of meta-heuristic and heuristic algorithms in 2D and 3D packing problems.

The sheet width is fixed, while its length is extendable and has to be minimised. In this paper, a new mixed-integer programming (MIP) model is introduced to optimally solve a special case of the problem, where item shapes are polygons with orthogonal edges, named polyominoes. Polyominoes strip packing may be classified as polyominoes tiling; a problem that can also be handled by the proposed model. Reasonable problem sizes (e.g. 45 polyominoes inside a 10 \u00d7 25 sheet) are solvable using an ordinary PC. Larger problem sizes are expected to be solvable when using state-of-the-art computational facilities. The model is also verified via a set of benchmark problems that are collected from the literature and provided optimal solution for all cases.</p>\n<h2>Suggested Citation</h2>\n<div>\n<li> Mohamed N.
