      "strategy": "# Santa 2025 - Christmas Tree Packing Challenge Seed Prompt\n\n## Problem Overview\n\nThis is a 2D irregular polygon packing optimization problem. The goal is to pack N Christmas tree-shaped polygons (N=1 to 200) into the smallest possible square bounding box for each N value.\n\n**Scoring Formula:** `score = sum(side_n^2 / n)` for n=1 to 200\n\nLower scores are better. The target score to beat is **68.882921**.\n\n## \u26d4 ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN (EXPERIMENT WILL BE REJECTED)\n\nThe following are PERMANENTLY FORBIDDEN after baseline:\n- bbox3 - FORBIDDEN\n- sa_fast_v2 - FORBIDDEN  \n- eazy_optimizer - FORBIDDEN\n- tree_packer - FORBIDDEN\n- shake_public - FORBIDDEN\n- subprocess.run() - FORBIDDEN\n- os.system() - FORBIDDEN\n- ANY pre-compiled binary or executable - FORBIDDEN\n- \"Optimizing\" existing CSV files with any tool - FORBIDDEN\n- Running \"more iterations\" on any optimizer - FORBIDDEN\n\nIf your experiment runs ANY binary, it will produce ~70.6.\nThe target is 68.89. BINARIES CANNOT GET THERE.\n\n## \u2705 MANDATORY FIRST TASK: SOLVE N=1-10 OPTIMALLY\n\nBEFORE any other work, implement exhaustive search for small N:\n\nFor N=1 (contributes ~0.66 to score - HIGHEST!):\n- Test EVERY rotation angle from 0\u00b0 to 360\u00b0 in 0.01\u00b0 increments\n- Find the angle that minimizes bounding box\n- This alone can improve score by 0.05-0.1 points\n\nFor N=2-10:\n- Implement branch-and-bound or exhaustive placement search\n- These contribute ~2.5 points total - worth optimizing!\n\n## \u2705 MANDATORY: PER-N SOLUTION TRACKING\n\nTrack best solution for EACH N value separately:\n1. Load baseline per-N scores from existing submission\n2. After your algorithm runs, compare per-N scores\n3. SAVE any N where you improved (even if total is worse)\n4. Accumulate improvements across experiments\n\n## Baseline Solutions Available\n\nPre-optimized solutions exist in `/home/nonroot/snapshots/santa-2025/*/submission/submission.csv`\n- These are already optimized by previous runs\n- Use the BEST one as your starting point\n- Focus on improving specific N values, not starting from scratch\n\n## Tree Geometry (CRITICAL)\n\nThe Christmas tree is a 15-vertex polygon with these coordinates:\n```python\nTX = [0, 0.125, 0.0625, 0.2, 0.1, 0.35, 0.075, 0.075, -0.075, -0.075, -0.35, -0.1, -0.2, -0.0625, -0.125]\nTY = [0.8, 0.5, 0.5, 0.25, 0.25, 0, 0, -0.2, -0.2, 0, 0, 0.25, 0.25, 0.5, 0.5]\n```\n\nKey dimensions:\n- Height: 1.0 (from y=-0.2 trunk bottom to y=0.8 tip)\n- Base width: 0.7 (at y=0)\n- Middle tier width: 0.4 (at y=0.25)\n- Top tier width: 0.25 (at y=0.5)\n- Trunk: 0.15 wide, 0.2 tall\n\nThe reference point (x, y in submission) is at the center-top of the trunk (0, 0).\n\n## Submission Format\n\n```csv\nid,x,y,deg\n001_0,s0.0,s0.0,s90.0\n002_0,s0.0,s0.0,s90.0\n002_1,s0.202736,s-0.511271,s90.0\n...\n```\n\n- `id`: `{n:03d}_{tree_index}` (e.g., \"001_0\" for N=1, tree 0)\n- `x`, `y`: Position coordinates prefixed with 's'\n- `deg`: Rotation angle in degrees prefixed with 's'\n\n## \u2705 REQUIRED: IMPLEMENT ALGORITHM IN PYTHON\n\nWrite YOUR OWN code. Choose ONE:\n1. Bottom-left constructive heuristic (easiest)\n2. Genetic algorithm with crossover (medium)\n3. Custom local search written from scratch (medium)\n4. Branch-and-bound for exact solutions (hardest)\n\nNO BINARIES. NO SUBPROCESS. NO OS.SYSTEM.\nWRITE THE ALGORITHM YOURSELF IN PYTHON.\n\n## Key Algorithms from Research (IMPLEMENT THESE!)\n\n### 1. Bottom-Left Heuristic\nPlace trees one at a time at the lowest-leftmost valid position:\n```python\ndef bottom_left_place(existing_trees, new_tree_angle):\n    # Start from far away, move toward center\n    # Find first non-overlapping position\n    # Use binary search for efficiency\n```\n\n### 2. No-Fit Polygon (NFP) for Fast Overlap Detection\nThe NFP represents all positions where two polygons touch/overlap:\n- Precompute NFP for tree pairs at different rotation combinations\n- Reduces overlap check from O(nm) to O(k) where k = NFP edges\n- Use Minkowski sum to compute NFP\n\n### 3. Rotation Optimization (fix_direction)\nAfter placing trees, optimize the global rotation:\n```python\ndef optimize_rotation(trees):\n    # Get convex hull of all tree vertices\n    # Use scipy.optimize.minimize_scalar to find best rotation angle\n    # Rotate all trees together to minimize bounding box\n```\n\n### 4. Squeeze/Compaction\nMove all trees toward center while maintaining non-overlap:\n```python\ndef squeeze(config, scale_factor=0.9995):\n    # Scale all positions toward centroid\n    # Check for overlaps\n    # Keep best valid configuration\n```\n\n### 5. Local Search\nIteratively improve by small moves:\n```python\ndef local_search(config, steps=[0.01, 0.004, 0.001]):\n    for tree in config.trees:\n        for step in steps:\n            # Try 8 directions + rotation changes\n            # Keep improvements\n```\n\n### 6. Backward Propagation (Novel Technique!)\nUse N+1 solution to improve N solution:\n```python\ndef backward_propagation(configs):\n    for n in range(200, 1, -1):\n        # Try removing each tree from N solution\n        # If resulting (N-1) solution is better than current best for N-1\n        # Save it!\n```\n\n## Insights from Discussions (MANDATORY)\n\n- Discussion \"Why the winning solutions will be Asymmetric\" (40 votes): Asymmetric packings outperform symmetric ones for larger N\n- Discussion \"Symmetric solutions that are apparently optimal\" (43 votes): For small N, symmetric solutions may be optimal\n- Discussion \"Expected Leaderboard Progression\" (20 votes): Staff guidance on expected score progression\n\n## What Discussions Say DOESN'T Work\n- Simple greedy placement without optimization\n- Running binaries with \"more iterations\" - diminishing returns\n- Ignoring small N values (they contribute significantly to score!)\n\n## Unexplored Ideas from Discussions\n- Tessellation patterns for specific N values\n- Backward propagation: Use N+1 solution to improve N solution by removing one tree\n- Lattice-based initial placements\n\n## Score Contribution by N (CRITICAL!)\n\nThe score formula `side^2/n` means:\n- N=1 contributes ~0.66 (HIGHEST single contribution!)\n- N=2 contributes ~0.55\n- N=3 contributes ~0.48\n- Small N values are DISPROPORTIONATELY important!\n\nFocus optimization effort on small N first!\n\n## Collision Detection (Essential)\n\n```python\nfrom shapely.geometry import Polygon\nfrom shapely import affinity\nfrom shapely.strtree import STRtree\n\ndef create_tree_polygon(x, y, deg):\n    TX = [0, 0.125, 0.0625, 0.2, 0.1, 0.35, 0.075, 0.075, -0.075, -0.075, -0.35, -0.1, -0.2, -0.0625, -0.125]\n    TY = [0.8, 0.5, 0.5, 0.25, 0.25, 0, 0, -0.2, -0.2, 0, 0, 0.25, 0.25, 0.5, 0.5]\n    poly = Polygon(zip(TX, TY))\n    rotated = affinity.rotate(poly, deg, origin=(0, 0))\n    return affinity.translate(rotated, x, y)\n\ndef check_overlap(poly1, poly2):\n    return poly1.intersects(poly2) and not poly1.touches(poly2)\n\ndef get_bounding_box_side(trees):\n    from shapely.ops import unary_union\n    all_polys = [create_tree_polygon(t['x'], t['y'], t['deg']) for t in trees]\n    bounds = unary_union(all_polys).bounds\n    return max(bounds[2] - bounds[0], bounds[3] - bounds[1])\n```\n\n## Recommended Experiments (Priority Order)\n\n1. **Load best baseline** - Find best existing solution in snapshots\n2. **Exhaustive search for N=1-5** - Find provably optimal solutions\n3. **Local search with rotation optimization** - Improve existing solutions\n4. **Backward propagation** - Use N+1 to improve N\n5. **Genetic algorithm** - Population-based search for larger N\n6. **Per-N tracking system** - Save best solution for each N separately\n\n## Validation\n\nBefore submitting:\n1. Check all trees for overlaps using Shapely\n2. Verify coordinates are within [-100, 100]\n3. Calculate local score to compare with leaderboard\n4. Track per-N improvements\n\n## Key Files\n\n- Sample submission: `/home/data/sample_submission.csv`\n- Pre-optimized solutions: `/home/nonroot/snapshots/santa-2025/*/submission/submission.csv`\n- Competition description: `/home/code/research/description.md`\n- Getting started kernel: `/home/code/research/kernels/inversion_santa-2025-getting-started/`\n\n## CRITICAL REMINDERS\n\n1. **NO BINARIES** - Write all optimization code in Python\n2. **SMALL N FIRST** - N=1-10 contribute disproportionately to score\n3. **PER-N TRACKING** - Save improvements for each N separately\n4. **OVERLAP VALIDATION** - Always check for overlaps before saving\n5. **ROTATION OPTIMIZATION** - Always apply fix_direction after placement\n6. **USE EXISTING BASELINES** - Don't start from scratch, improve existing solutions\n\n## Mathematical Insights\n\nFor N=1, the optimal rotation minimizes the bounding box of a single tree.\nThe tree is roughly 1.0 tall and 0.7 wide at base.\n- At 0\u00b0 rotation: bbox \u2248 0.7 \u00d7 1.0\n- At 45\u00b0 rotation: bbox changes due to rotation\n- Optimal angle is NOT 0\u00b0 or 90\u00b0 - must be computed!\n\nFor small N, trees can often interlock (tips fitting into gaps between branches).\nThis is why asymmetric solutions often beat symmetric ones.\n",

Seed prompt mandates not followed - **PARTIALLY ADDRESSED**: N=1 is optimal, but N=2-10 optimization still needed\n\n## Key Findings from Analysis\n1. **N=1 is already optimal** at 45\u00b0 rotation - no improvement possible there\n2. **Strict validation is CRITICAL** - must use integer-scaled coordinates for precise overlap detection\n3. **Top kernels use ensemble approach** - collect best per-N from 15+ sources\n4. **Fractional translation** is key technique -

      "feedback": "## What I Understood\n\nThe junior researcher completed the first experiment (001_baseline) to establish a baseline score by finding the best pre-optimized solution from existing snapshots. They correctly identified that the best available solution scores 70.523320, which is 1.64 points above the target of 68.882921. They also correctly analyzed the per-N score contributions, noting that N=1 alone contributes 0.6612 (the highest single contribution) and N=1-10 together contribute 4.2874 points total.\n\n## Technical Execution Assessment\n\n**Validation**: The scoring methodology is sound - the notebook correctly implements the competition's scoring formula (sum of side\u00b2/n for n=1 to 200). The score calculation uses Shapely for polygon operations and properly computes bounding boxes.\n\n**Leakage Risk**: None detected. This is a pure optimization problem, not a prediction task, so traditional leakage concerns don't apply.\n\n**Score Integrity**: Verified in the notebook output. The score of 70.523320 is correctly computed and matches the metrics.json file.\n\n**Code Quality**: The baseline notebook is clean and functional. It correctly:\n- Loads and parses submission files (handling the 's' prefix)\n- Creates tree polygons with proper geometry\n- Calculates per-N scores and total score\n- Saves the best solution to the experiment folder\n\nVerdict: **TRUSTWORTHY**\n\n## Strategic Assessment\n\n**Approach Fit**: The baseline establishment is appropriate as a first step. The researcher correctly identified the best existing solution and documented the per-N score breakdown. This is exactly what the seed prompt recommended.\n\n**Effort Allocation**: This is where I have concerns. The baseline is established, but:\n- **No actual optimization has been attempted yet** - just finding existing solutions\n- The seed prompt MANDATES starting with exhaustive search for N=1-10, which hasn't been done\n- N=1 alone contributes 0.6612 to the score - optimizing this single value could yield significant gains\n\n**Assumptions**: The current approach assumes the pre-optimized solutions are near-optimal. However:\n- The baseline N=1 has side=0.8132, giving score=0.6612\n- For a single tree, the OPTIMAL rotation should give a smaller bounding box\n- The tree is 1.0 tall \u00d7 0.7 wide at base - at certain angles, the bbox could be smaller\n\n**Blind Spots**: Several critical opportunities are being overlooked:\n1. **N=1 exhaustive search**: Testing every angle from 0\u00b0 to 360\u00b0 in 0.01\u00b0 increments could find the true optimal\n2. **Small N optimization**: N=2-10 together contribute ~3.6 points - significant room for improvement\n3. **Per-N tracking system**: Not yet implemented - should save best solution for EACH N separately\n4. **Backward propagation**: Using N+1 solution to improve N solution (mentioned in discussions)\n\n**Trajectory**: This is the very first experiment, so trajectory assessment is premature. However, the direction is correct - establishing a baseline before optimization is sound practice.\n\n## What's Working\n\n1. **Correct problem understanding**: The researcher correctly identified the scoring formula and its implications\n2. **Good baseline selection**: Found the best available pre-optimized solution (70.523320)\n3. **Per-N analysis**: Correctly identified that small N values are disproportionately important\n4. **Clean implementation**: The scoring code is correct and reusable\n\n## Key Concerns\n\n### Concern 1: No Optimization Attempted Yet\n- **Observation**: The experiment only found existing solutions, no new optimization was performed\n- **Why it matters**: The target (68.882921) requires ~1.64 points improvement. Simply finding existing solutions won't get there.\n- **Suggestion**: Implement exhaustive search for N=1 immediately - this is the highest-leverage single improvement\n\n### Concern 2: N=1 Is Not Optimized\n- **Observation**: Current N=1 has side=0.8132, score=0.6612\n- **Why it matters**: A single tree's optimal rotation should minimize bbox. The tree is 1.0\u00d70.7 - at 45\u00b0 or other angles, the bbox might be smaller than 0.8132\n- **Suggestion**: Test ALL angles from 0\u00b0 to 360\u00b0 in 0.01\u00b0 increments. This is ~36,000 evaluations - trivial to compute.\n\n### Concern 3: Missing Per-N Tracking System\n- **Observation**: No system to track and accumulate per-N improvements across experiments\n- **Why it matters**: Different experiments might improve different N values. Without tracking, improvements could be lost.\n- **Suggestion**: Create a \"best_per_n.json\" file that stores the best solution for each N value separately\n\n### Concern 4: Seed Prompt Mandates Not Followed\n- **Observation**: The seed prompt explicitly states \"MANDATORY FIRST TASK: SOLVE N=1-10 OPTIMALLY\" - this hasn't been done\n- **Why it matters**: The seed prompt was designed based on analysis showing small N values are the highest-leverage targets\n- **Suggestion**: Follow the seed prompt's priority order: exhaustive search for N=1-5, then local search for N=6-10\n\n## Top Priority for Next Experiment\n\n**IMPLEMENT EXHAUSTIVE SEARCH FOR N=1**\n\nThis is the single highest-leverage improvement available:\n1. N=1 contributes 0.6612 to the score - the HIGHEST single contribution\n2. For a single tree, finding the optimal rotation is trivial: test all angles\n3. The tree polygon is known exactly - compute bbox for each angle and find minimum\n4. Potential improvement: If optimal bbox is 0.75 instead of 0.8132, that's 0.6612 \u2192 0.5625 = **0.0987 points saved**\n\nImplementation approach:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom shapely.geometry import Polygon\nfrom shapely import affinity\n\nTX = [0, 0.125, 0.0625, 0.2, 0.1, 0.35, 0.075, 0.075, -0.075, -0.075, -0.35, -0.1, -0.2, -0.0625, -0.125]\nTY = [0.8, 0.5, 0.5, 0.25, 0.25, 0, 0, -0.2, -0.2, 0, 0, 0.25, 0.25, 0.5, 0.5]\n\nbest_side = float('inf')\nbest_angle = 0\n\nfor angle in np.arange(0, 360, 0.01):\n    poly = Polygon(zip(TX, TY))\n    rotated = affinity.rotate(poly, angle, origin=(0, 0))\n    bounds = rotated.bounds\n    side = max(bounds[2] - bounds[0], bounds[3] - bounds[1])\n    if side < best_side:\n        best_side = side\n        best_angle = angle\n\nprint(f\"Optimal N=1: angle={best_angle}, side={best_side}, score={best_side**2}\")\n```\n\nAfter N=1, extend to N=2-5 with exhaustive placement search, then N=6-10 with local search.\n\n**The gap to target is 1.64 points. Small N optimization alone could close 0.2-0.5 points of that gap.**\n",

It involves calculating a set of feasible positions where one polygon can be placed relative to another without overlapping. The NFP essentially represents the boundary of all positions where the polygons would touch or intersect if placed in any configuration, thus helping to identify valid placements efficiently ([ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0305054806000669), [ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0377221706001639)).\n\nThe core of the NFP technique often involves the use of Minkowski sums, a mathematical operation that combines two shapes to produce a new shape representing all possible translations of one shape around the other. By computing the Minkowski sum of the two polygons, the NFP can be derived, which delineates the boundary of all positions where the polygons are just touchi",
