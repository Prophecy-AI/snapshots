      "strategy": "# Santa 2025 - Christmas Tree Packing Challenge Seed Prompt\n\n## Problem Overview\n\nThis is a 2D irregular polygon packing optimization problem. The goal is to pack N Christmas tree-shaped polygons (N=1 to 200) into the smallest possible square bounding box for each N value.\n\n**Scoring Formula:** `score = sum(side_n^2 / n)` for n=1 to 200\n\nLower scores are better. The target score to beat is **68.882921**.\n\n## \u26d4 ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN (EXPERIMENT WILL BE REJECTED)\n\nThe following are PERMANENTLY FORBIDDEN after baseline:\n- bbox3 - FORBIDDEN\n- sa_fast_v2 - FORBIDDEN  \n- eazy_optimizer - FORBIDDEN\n- tree_packer - FORBIDDEN\n- shake_public - FORBIDDEN\n- subprocess.run() - FORBIDDEN\n- os.system() - FORBIDDEN\n- ANY pre-compiled binary or executable - FORBIDDEN\n- \"Optimizing\" existing CSV files with any tool - FORBIDDEN\n- Running \"more iterations\" on any optimizer - FORBIDDEN\n\nIf your experiment runs ANY binary, it will produce ~70.6.\nThe target is 68.89. BINARIES CANNOT GET THERE.\n\n## \u2705 MANDATORY FIRST TASK: SOLVE N=1-10 OPTIMALLY\n\nBEFORE any other work, implement exhaustive search for small N:\n\nFor N=1 (contributes ~0.66 to score - HIGHEST!):\n- Test EVERY rotation angle from 0\u00b0 to 360\u00b0 in 0.01\u00b0 increments\n- Find the angle that minimizes bounding box\n- This alone can improve score by 0.05-0.1 points\n\nFor N=2-10:\n- Implement branch-and-bound or exhaustive placement search\n- These contribute ~2.5 points total - worth optimizing!\n\n## \u2705 MANDATORY: PER-N SOLUTION TRACKING\n\nTrack best solution for EACH N value separately:\n1. Load baseline per-N scores from existing submission\n2. After your algorithm runs, compare per-N scores\n3. SAVE any N where you improved (even if total is worse)\n4. Accumulate improvements across experiments\n\n## Baseline Solutions Available\n\nPre-optimized solutions exist in `/home/nonroot/snapshots/santa-2025/*/submission/submission.csv`\n- These are already optimized by previous runs\n- Use the BEST one as your starting point\n- Focus on improving specific N values, not starting from scratch\n\n## Tree Geometry (CRITICAL)\n\nThe Christmas tree is a 15-vertex polygon with these coordinates:\n```python\nTX = [0, 0.125, 0.0625, 0.2, 0.1, 0.35, 0.075, 0.075, -0.075, -0.075, -0.35, -0.1, -0.2, -0.0625, -0.125]\nTY = [0.8, 0.5, 0.5, 0.25, 0.25, 0, 0, -0.2, -0.2, 0, 0, 0.25, 0.25, 0.5, 0.5]\n```\n\nKey dimensions:\n- Height: 1.0 (from y=-0.2 trunk bottom to y=0.8 tip)\n- Base width: 0.7 (at y=0)\n- Middle tier width: 0.4 (at y=0.25)\n- Top tier width: 0.25 (at y=0.5)\n- Trunk: 0.15 wide, 0.2 tall\n\nThe reference point (x, y in submission) is at the center-top of the trunk (0, 0).\n\n## Submission Format\n\n```csv\nid,x,y,deg\n001_0,s0.0,s0.0,s90.0\n002_0,s0.0,s0.0,s90.0\n002_1,s0.202736,s-0.511271,s90.0\n...\n```\n\n- `id`: `{n:03d}_{tree_index}` (e.g., \"001_0\" for N=1, tree 0)\n- `x`, `y`: Position coordinates prefixed with 's'\n- `deg`: Rotation angle in degrees prefixed with 's'\n\n## \u2705 REQUIRED: IMPLEMENT ALGORITHM IN PYTHON\n\nWrite YOUR OWN code. Choose ONE:\n1. Bottom-left constructive heuristic (easiest)\n2. Genetic algorithm with crossover (medium)\n3. Custom local search written from scratch (medium)\n4. Branch-and-bound for exact solutions (hardest)\n\nNO BINARIES. NO SUBPROCESS. NO OS.SYSTEM.\nWRITE THE ALGORITHM YOURSELF IN PYTHON.\n\n## Key Algorithms from Research (IMPLEMENT THESE!)\n\n### 1. Bottom-Left Heuristic\nPlace trees one at a time at the lowest-leftmost valid position:\n```python\ndef bottom_left_place(existing_trees, new_tree_angle):\n    # Start from far away, move toward center\n    # Find first non-overlapping position\n    # Use binary search for efficiency\n```\n\n### 2. No-Fit Polygon (NFP) for Fast Overlap Detection\nThe NFP represents all positions where two polygons touch/overlap:\n- Precompute NFP for tree pairs at different rotation combinations\n- Reduces overlap check from O(nm) to O(k) where k = NFP edges\n- Use Minkowski sum to compute NFP\n\n### 3. Rotation Optimization (fix_direction)\nAfter placing trees, optimize the global rotation:\n```python\ndef optimize_rotation(trees):\n    # Get convex hull of all tree vertices\n    # Use scipy.optimize.minimize_scalar to find best rotation angle\n    # Rotate all trees together to minimize bounding box\n```\n\n### 4. Squeeze/Compaction\nMove all trees toward center while maintaining non-overlap:\n```python\ndef squeeze(config, scale_factor=0.9995):\n    # Scale all positions toward centroid\n    # Check for overlaps\n    # Keep best valid configuration\n```\n\n### 5. Local Search\nIteratively improve by small moves:\n```python\ndef local_search(config, steps=[0.01, 0.004, 0.001]):\n    for tree in config.trees:\n        for step in steps:\n            # Try 8 directions + rotation changes\n            # Keep improvements\n```\n\n### 6. Backward Propagation (Novel Technique!)\nUse N+1 solution to improve N solution:\n```python\ndef backward_propagation(configs):\n    for n in range(200, 1, -1):\n        # Try removing each tree from N solution\n        # If resulting (N-1) solution is better than current best for N-1\n        # Save it!\n```\n\n## Insights from Discussions (MANDATORY)\n\n- Discussion \"Why the winning solutions will be Asymmetric\" (40 votes): Asymmetric packings outperform symmetric ones for larger N\n- Discussion \"Symmetric solutions that are apparently optimal\" (43 votes): For small N, symmetric solutions may be optimal\n- Discussion \"Expected Leaderboard Progression\" (20 votes): Staff guidance on expected score progression\n\n## What Discussions Say DOESN'T Work\n- Simple greedy placement without optimization\n- Running binaries with \"more iterations\" - diminishing returns\n- Ignoring small N values (they contribute significantly to score!)\n\n## Unexplored Ideas from Discussions\n- Tessellation patterns for specific N values\n- Backward propagation: Use N+1 solution to improve N solution by removing one tree\n- Lattice-based initial placements\n\n## Score Contribution by N (CRITICAL!)\n\nThe score formula `side^2/n` means:\n- N=1 contributes ~0.66 (HIGHEST single contribution!)\n- N=2 contributes ~0.55\n- N=3 contributes ~0.48\n- Small N values are DISPROPORTIONATELY important!\n\nFocus optimization effort on small N first!\n\n## Collision Detection (Essential)\n\n```python\nfrom shapely.geometry import Polygon\nfrom shapely import affinity\nfrom shapely.strtree import STRtree\n\ndef create_tree_polygon(x, y, deg):\n    TX = [0, 0.125, 0.0625, 0.2, 0.1, 0.35, 0.075, 0.075, -0.075, -0.075, -0.35, -0.1, -0.2, -0.0625, -0.125]\n    TY = [0.8, 0.5, 0.5, 0.25, 0.25, 0, 0, -0.2, -0.2, 0, 0, 0.25, 0.25, 0.5, 0.5]\n    poly = Polygon(zip(TX, TY))\n    rotated = affinity.rotate(poly, deg, origin=(0, 0))\n    return affinity.translate(rotated, x, y)\n\ndef check_overlap(poly1, poly2):\n    return poly1.intersects(poly2) and not poly1.touches(poly2)\n\ndef get_bounding_box_side(trees):\n    from shapely.ops import unary_union\n    all_polys = [create_tree_polygon(t['x'], t['y'], t['deg']) for t in trees]\n    bounds = unary_union(all_polys).bounds\n    return max(bounds[2] - bounds[0], bounds[3] - bounds[1])\n```\n\n## Recommended Experiments (Priority Order)\n\n1. **Load best baseline** - Find best existing solution in snapshots\n2. **Exhaustive search for N=1-5** - Find provably optimal solutions\n3. **Local search with rotation optimization** - Improve existing solutions\n4. **Backward propagation** - Use N+1 to improve N\n5. **Genetic algorithm** - Population-based search for larger N\n6. **Per-N tracking system** - Save best solution for each N separately\n\n## Validation\n\nBefore submitting:\n1. Check all trees for overlaps using Shapely\n2. Verify coordinates are within [-100, 100]\n3. Calculate local score to compare with leaderboard\n4. Track per-N improvements\n\n## Key Files\n\n- Sample submission: `/home/data/sample_submission.csv`\n- Pre-optimized solutions: `/home/nonroot/snapshots/santa-2025/*/submission/submission.csv`\n- Competition description: `/home/code/research/description.md`\n- Getting started kernel: `/home/code/research/kernels/inversion_santa-2025-getting-started/`\n\n## CRITICAL REMINDERS\n\n1. **NO BINARIES** - Write all optimization code in Python\n2. **SMALL N FIRST** - N=1-10 contribute disproportionately to score\n3. **PER-N TRACKING** - Save improvements for each N separately\n4. **OVERLAP VALIDATION** - Always check for overlaps before saving\n5. **ROTATION OPTIMIZATION** - Always apply fix_direction after placement\n6. **USE EXISTING BASELINES** - Don't start from scratch, improve existing solutions\n\n## Mathematical Insights\n\nFor N=1, the optimal rotation minimizes the bounding box of a single tree.\nThe tree is roughly 1.0 tall and 0.7 wide at base.\n- At 0\u00b0 rotation: bbox \u2248 0.7 \u00d7 1.0\n- At 45\u00b0 rotation: bbox changes due to rotation\n- Optimal angle is NOT 0\u00b0 or 90\u00b0 - must be computed!\n\nFor small N, trees can often interlock (tips fitting into gaps between branches).\nThis is why asymmetric solutions often beat symmetric ones.\n",

      "feedback": "## What I Understood\n\nThe junior researcher completed the first experiment (001_baseline) to establish a baseline score by finding the best pre-optimized solution from existing snapshots. They correctly identified that the best available solution scores 70.523320, which is 1.64 points above the target of 68.882921. They also correctly analyzed the per-N score contributions, noting that N=1 alone contributes 0.6612 (the highest single contribution) and N=1-10 together contribute 4.2874 points total.\n\n## Technical Execution Assessment\n\n**Validation**: The scoring methodology is sound - the notebook correctly implements the competition's scoring formula (sum of side\u00b2/n for n=1 to 200). The score calculation uses Shapely for polygon operations and properly computes bounding boxes.\n\n**Leakage Risk**: None detected. This is a pure optimization problem, not a prediction task, so traditional leakage concerns don't apply.\n\n**Score Integrity**: Verified in the notebook output. The score of 70.523320 is correctly computed and matches the metrics.json file.\n\n**Code Quality**: The baseline notebook is clean and functional. It correctly:\n- Loads and parses submission files (handling the 's' prefix)\n- Creates tree polygons with proper geometry\n- Calculates per-N scores and total score\n- Saves the best solution to the experiment folder\n\nVerdict: **TRUSTWORTHY**\n\n## Strategic Assessment\n\n**Approach Fit**: The baseline establishment is appropriate as a first step. The researcher correctly identified the best existing solution and documented the per-N score breakdown. This is exactly what the seed prompt recommended.\n\n**Effort Allocation**: This is where I have concerns. The baseline is established, but:\n- **No actual optimization has been attempted yet** - just finding existing solutions\n- The seed prompt MANDATES starting with exhaustive search for N=1-10, which hasn't been done\n- N=1 alone contributes 0.6612 to the score - optimizing this single value could yield significant gains\n\n**Assumptions**: The current approach assumes the pre-optimized solutions are near-optimal. However:\n- The baseline N=1 has side=0.8132, giving score=0.6612\n- For a single tree, the OPTIMAL rotation should give a smaller bounding box\n- The tree is 1.0 tall \u00d7 0.7 wide at base - at certain angles, the bbox could be smaller\n\n**Blind Spots**: Several critical opportunities are being overlooked:\n1. **N=1 exhaustive search**: Testing every angle from 0\u00b0 to 360\u00b0 in 0.01\u00b0 increments could find the true optimal\n2. **Small N optimization**: N=2-10 together contribute ~3.6 points - significant room for improvement\n3. **Per-N tracking system**: Not yet implemented - should save best solution for EACH N separately\n4. **Backward propagation**: Using N+1 solution to improve N solution (mentioned in discussions)\n\n**Trajectory**: This is the very first experiment, so trajectory assessment is premature. However, the direction is correct - establishing a baseline before optimization is sound practice.\n\n## What's Working\n\n1. **Correct problem understanding**: The researcher correctly identified the scoring formula and its implications\n2. **Good baseline selection**: Found the best available pre-optimized solution (70.523320)\n3. **Per-N analysis**: Correctly identified that small N values are disproportionately important\n4. **Clean implementation**: The scoring code is correct and reusable\n\n## Key Concerns\n\n### Concern 1: No Optimization Attempted Yet\n- **Observation**: The experiment only found existing solutions, no new optimization was performed\n- **Why it matters**: The target (68.882921) requires ~1.64 points improvement. Simply finding existing solutions won't get there.\n- **Suggestion**: Implement exhaustive search for N=1 immediately - this is the highest-leverage single improvement\n\n### Concern 2: N=1 Is Not Optimized\n- **Observation**: Current N=1 has side=0.8132, score=0.6612\n- **Why it matters**: A single tree's optimal rotation should minimize bbox. The tree is 1.0\u00d70.7 - at 45\u00b0 or other angles, the bbox might be smaller than 0.8132\n- **Suggestion**: Test ALL angles from 0\u00b0 to 360\u00b0 in 0.01\u00b0 increments. This is ~36,000 evaluations - trivial to compute.\n\n### Concern 3: Missing Per-N Tracking System\n- **Observation**: No system to track and accumulate per-N improvements across experiments\n- **Why it matters**: Different experiments might improve different N values. Without tracking, improvements could be lost.\n- **Suggestion**: Create a \"best_per_n.json\" file that stores the best solution for each N value separately\n\n### Concern 4: Seed Prompt Mandates Not Followed\n- **Observation**: The seed prompt explicitly states \"MANDATORY FIRST TASK: SOLVE N=1-10 OPTIMALLY\" - this hasn't been done\n- **Why it matters**: The seed prompt was designed based on analysis showing small N values are the highest-leverage targets\n- **Suggestion**: Follow the seed prompt's priority order: exhaustive search for N=1-5, then local search for N=6-10\n\n## Top Priority for Next Experiment\n\n**IMPLEMENT EXHAUSTIVE SEARCH FOR N=1**\n\nThis is the single highest-leverage improvement available:\n1. N=1 contributes 0.6612 to the score - the HIGHEST single contribution\n2. For a single tree, finding the optimal rotation is trivial: test all angles\n3. The tree polygon is known exactly - compute bbox for each angle and find minimum\n4. Potential improvement: If optimal bbox is 0.75 instead of 0.8132, that's 0.6612 \u2192 0.5625 = **0.0987 points saved**\n\nImplementation approach:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom shapely.geometry import Polygon\nfrom shapely import affinity\n\nTX = [0, 0.125, 0.0625, 0.2, 0.1, 0.35, 0.075, 0.075, -0.075, -0.075, -0.35, -0.1, -0.2, -0.0625, -0.125]\nTY = [0.8, 0.5, 0.5, 0.25, 0.25, 0, 0, -0.2, -0.2, 0, 0, 0.25, 0.25, 0.5, 0.5]\n\nbest_side = float('inf')\nbest_angle = 0\n\nfor angle in np.arange(0, 360, 0.01):\n    poly = Polygon(zip(TX, TY))\n    rotated = affinity.rotate(poly, angle, origin=(0, 0))\n    bounds = rotated.bounds\n    side = max(bounds[2] - bounds[0], bounds[3] - bounds[1])\n    if side < best_side:\n        best_side = side\n        best_angle = angle\n\nprint(f\"Optimal N=1: angle={best_angle}, side={best_side}, score={best_side**2}\")\n```\n\nAfter N=1, extend to N=2-5 with exhaustive placement search, then N=6-10 with local search.\n\n**The gap to target is 1.64 points.

      "feedback": "## What I Understood\n\nThe junior researcher completed experiment 002_valid_baseline after the first submission (exp_000) was rejected by Kaggle with \"Overlapping trees in group 002\". They investigated the overlap issue, implemented strict validation using integer-scaled coordinates (Kaggle's method), and discovered that the \"best\" pre-optimized solution (70.523320) had **69 N values with overlaps**. They then found a truly valid submission with score 70.615102 and verified that N=1 is already optimal at 45\u00b0 rotation (side=0.813173, score=0.661250).\n\n## Technical Execution Assessment\n\n**Validation**: Excellent work. The researcher correctly identified that Kaggle uses strict integer-scaled coordinate validation. They implemented proper validation using `Decimal` with 30 digits precision and SCALE=10^18. This is critical for avoiding future submission rejections.\n\n**Leakage Risk**: Not applicable - this is a pure optimization problem.\n\n**Score Integrity**: Verified. The score of 70.615102 is correctly computed and matches the metrics.json file. The per-N breakdown is comprehensive and accurate.\n\n**Code Quality**: The analysis notebook is well-structured and thorough:\n- Correctly identified the overlap issue in the first submission\n- Implemented strict validation that matches Kaggle's approach\n- Exhaustively searched for optimal N=1 rotation (36,000 angles tested)\n- Found and validated the best available solution from snapshots\n\nVerdict: **TRUSTWORTHY**\n\n## Strategic Assessment\n\n**Approach Fit**: The researcher correctly prioritized fixing the validation issue before proceeding. This was the right call - submitting invalid solutions wastes submissions and provides no useful feedback.\n\n**Effort Allocation**: Good prioritization. The researcher:\n1. \u2705 Fixed the critical validation issue\n2. \u2705 Verified N=1 is already optimal (no improvement possible there)\n3. \u2705 Found the best valid baseline (70.615102)\n4. \u26a0\ufe0f Has not yet implemented any optimization algorithms\n\n**Assumptions Validated**:\n- N=1 optimal rotation is 45\u00b0 - **CONFIRMED** by exhaustive search\n- Pre-optimized solutions may have overlaps - **CONFIRMED** (69 N values had overlaps)\n\n**Blind Spots**:\n1. **No optimization attempted yet**: The gap to target is 1.732 points. Finding valid baselines is necessary but not sufficient.\n2. **Top kernels use ensemble + SA + fractional translation**: The research shows top solutions combine:\n   - Per-N ensemble from 15+ sources\n   - Simulated annealing (SA) optimization\n   - Fractional translation (tiny step sizes: 0.001, 0.0005, 0.0001, etc.)\n3. **C++ binaries are forbidden**: The seed prompt explicitly forbids using pre-compiled binaries. The researcher must implement optimization in Python.\n4. **Per-N tracking system not implemented**: Different experiments may improve different N values. Need to track and accumulate improvements.\n\n**Trajectory**: This is solid foundational work. The researcher has:\n- Established a valid baseline\n- Verified N=1 is optimal\n- Implemented strict validation\n- Analyzed per-N score contributions\n\nNow they need to pivot from \"finding existing solutions\" to \"implementing optimization algorithms.\"\n\n## What's Working\n\n1. **Strict validation implementation**: Critical for avoiding rejected submissions\n2. **Exhaustive N=1 search**: Confirmed 45\u00b0 is optimal - no more time needed here\n3. **Per-N score analysis**: Correctly identified score contributions by N range\n4. **Valid baseline found**: 70.615102 is a solid starting point\n\n## Key Concerns\n\n### Concern 1: No Optimization Algorithms Implemented Yet\n- **Observation**: Both experiments so far have only searched for existing solutions\n- **Why it matters**: The target (68.881647) requires ~1.73 points improvement. Existing solutions won't get there.\n- **Suggestion**: Implement fractional translation in Python for N=2-20 (highest leverage). The algorithm is well-documented in the top kernels.\n\n### Concern 2: Need to Submit Valid Baseline for LB Feedback\n- **Observation**: The valid baseline (70.615102) hasn't been submitted yet\n- **Why it matters**: LB feedback is essential for understanding the CV-LB relationship\n- **Suggestion**: Submit candidate_001.csv immediately to get LB score\n\n### Concern 3: Per-N Tracking System Missing\n- **Observation**: No system to track best solution for each N separately\n- **Why it matters**: Different optimization runs may improve different N values. Without tracking, improvements could be lost.\n- **Suggestion**: Create `best_per_n.json` that stores the best solution for each N value with source tracking\n\n### Concern 4: Optimization Strategy Not Clear\n- **Observation**: The seed prompt mandates implementing algorithms in Python, but no algorithm has been implemented yet\n- **Why it matters**: The gap to target is 1.73 points - significant optimization is needed\n- **Suggestion**: Prioritize implementing:\n  1. Fractional translation (tiny movements to shrink bbox)\n  2. Local search with rotation optimization\n  3. Backward propagation (use N+1 to improve N)\n\n## Score Gap Analysis\n\nCurrent: 70.615102\nTarget: 68.881647\nGap: **1.733 points**\n\nScore contribution by N range:\n- N=1-10: 4.329 points (6.1%) - N=1 is optimal, N=2-10 have room for improvement\n- N=11-50: 14.704 points (20.8%) - Large contribution, worth optimizing\n- N=51-100: 17.606 points (24.9%)\n- N=101-150: 17.134 points (24.3%)\n- N=151-200: 16.842 points (23.9%)\n\n**Key insight**: Improvements need to come from ALL N values, not just small N.

      "feedback": "## What I Understood\n\nThe junior researcher implemented fractional translation optimization in pure Python for N=2-50, following my previous recommendation. They tested multiple step sizes (0.01 down to 0.00001) in 8 directions plus rotation optimization. They also tried a \"squeeze\" approach (scaling toward centroid). The result: **NO IMPROVEMENTS FOUND**. The baseline solutions are already at local optima that cannot be escaped through local search methods.\n\n## Technical Execution Assessment\n\n**Validation**: Sound. The researcher correctly implemented:\n- Shapely-based polygon creation and overlap detection\n- Bounding box calculation using `unary_union`\n- Proper reversion of moves that don't improve\n\n**Leakage Risk**: Not applicable - this is a pure optimization problem.\n\n**Score Integrity**: Verified. The score of 70.615102 is unchanged because no improvements were found.\n\n**Code Quality**: The implementation is correct:\n- Step sizes match those used in top kernels (0.001, 0.0005, etc.)\n- 8 directions + rotation optimization\n- Proper overlap checking before accepting moves\n- Multiple iterations with early stopping when no improvement\n\nVerdict: **TRUSTWORTHY** - The experiment was executed correctly. The finding that \"no improvements found\" is a valid and important result.\n\n## Strategic Assessment\n\n**Approach Fit**: The approach was technically correct but **strategically insufficient**. Here's the key insight from analyzing the top kernel (jonathanchan):\n\nThe top kernels use fractional translation as a **FINAL POLISH STEP**, not the main optimization. Their pipeline is:\n1. **Per-N ensemble from 15+ sources** - collect best solution for each N\n2. **Simulated annealing with perturbation** - escape local optima\n3. **Fractional translation** - final polish only\n\nThe junior researcher tried step 3 directly on a local optimum. This is like trying to polish a rough stone without first shaping it.\n\n**Effort Allocation**: Misallocated. The researcher spent effort on local search when the baseline is already at a local optimum. The key insight is:\n\n> **Local search cannot escape local optima. The baseline IS a local optimum.**\n\n**Assumptions**: The implicit assumption was that the baseline has room for improvement through tiny movements. This assumption is FALSE - the baseline was already optimized by similar methods.\n\n**Blind Spots**:\n\n1. **Per-N Ensemble Not Tried**: There are **116 snapshots** available in `/home/nonroot/snapshots/santa-2025/`. The top kernels collect the BEST solution for each N from many sources. This is the lowest-hanging fruit!\n\n2. **Simulated Annealing Not Implemented**: SA with perturbation can escape local optima by accepting worse moves probabilistically. The top kernels use SA as their main optimization, not just local search.\n\n3. **Backward Propagation Not Tried**: Use N+1 solution to improve N solution by removing one tree. This is a novel technique mentioned in discussions.\n\n4. **Global Rotation Optimization Not Tried**: After placing trees, rotate ALL trees together to minimize bounding box. This is different from per-tree rotation.\n\n**Trajectory**: The experiment confirmed that local search alone won't work. This is valuable information! But now we need to pivot to approaches that can escape local optima.\n\n## What's Working\n\n1. **Correct implementation of fractional translation** - the code is sound\n2. **Proper validation** - overlap checking is correct\n3. **Important finding**: baseline is at a local optimum\n4. **Valid baseline established** - 70.615102 is a solid starting point\n\n## Key Concerns\n\n### Concern 1: Per-N Ensemble is the Obvious Next Step\n- **Observation**: 116 snapshots are available, but not being used for ensemble\n- **Why it matters**: Top kernels achieve their scores by collecting BEST per-N from many sources. Different optimization runs may have found better solutions for different N values.\n- **Suggestion**: Implement per-N ensemble:\n```python\n# For each N, find best solution across all 116 snapshots\nbest_per_n = {}\nfor snapshot_dir in snapshots:\n    df = load_and_validate(snapshot_dir)\n    for n in range(1, 201):\n        score = compute_score_for_n(df, n)\n        if n not in best_per_n or score < best_per_n[n]['score']:\n            best_per_n[n] = {'score': score, 'data': df[df['n']==n]}\n```\n\n### Concern 2: Need Global Search, Not Local Search\n- **Observation**: Fractional translation is local search - it can only find nearby solutions\n- **Why it matters**: The baseline is already at a local optimum. Local search will never escape it.\n- **Suggestion**: Implement simulated annealing with perturbation:\n```python\ndef perturb(trees, magnitude=0.1):\n    \"\"\"Randomly perturb tree positions to escape local optima.\"\"\"\n    for tree in trees:\n        tree['x'] += random.uniform(-magnitude, magnitude)\n        tree['y'] += random.uniform(-magnitude, magnitude)\n        tree['deg'] += random.uniform(-10, 10)\n    return trees\n\ndef simulated_annealing(trees, T_start=1.0, T_end=0.001, cooling=0.995):\n    \"\"\"SA can accept worse moves to escape local optima.\"\"\"\n    T = T_start\n    best = trees.copy()\n    best_score = compute_score(best)\n    current = trees.copy()\n    current_score = best_score\n    \n    while T > T_end:\n        # Try a random move\n        candidate = perturb(current.copy(), magnitude=T*0.1)\n        if is_valid(candidate):\n            candidate_score = compute_score(candidate)\n            delta = candidate_score - current_score\n            # Accept if better, or probabilistically if worse\n            if delta < 0 or random.random() < math.exp(-delta/T):\n                current = candidate\n                current_score = candidate_score\n                if current_score < best_score:\n                    best = current.copy()\n                    best_score = current_score\n        T *= cooling\n    return best, best_score\n```\n\n### Concern 3: Backward Propagation is Unexplored\n- **Observation**: The N+1 solution might contain a better N solution\n- **Why it matters**: If we remove one tree from the N+1 solution, we might get a better N solution than the current best\n- **Suggestion**: Try backward propagation:\n```python\nfor n in range(200, 1, -1):\n    trees_n_plus_1 = get_trees(n+1)\n    for i in range(n+1):\n        # Try removing tree i\n        candidate = [t for j, t in enumerate(trees_n_plus_1) if j != i]\n        score = compute_score(candidate)\n        if score < best_score_for_n[n]:\n            print(f\"Found better N={n} by removing tree {i} from N={n+1}\")\n            save_improvement(n, candidate)\n```\n\n## Score Gap Analysis\n\nCurrent: 70.615102\nTarget: 68.881647\nGap: **1.733 points (2.5%)**\n\nThis is a significant gap that requires:\n1.

The finding that backward propagation yields negligible improvement is valid and important.\n\n## Strategic Assessment\n\n**Approach Fit**: The approach was technically correct but **the baseline is already at an extremely strong local optimum**. This is now a confirmed pattern:\n- exp_002: Fractional translation \u2192 NO improvement\n- exp_003: Backward propagation \u2192 NO improvement\n\n**Effort Allocation**: The researcher is systematically testing approaches, which is good. However, we're now 2 experiments deep with zero meaningful improvement. This suggests we need to **pivot to fundamentally different strategies**.\n\n**Assumptions Being Challenged**:\n1. \u274c \"Local search can improve the baseline\" - DISPROVEN by exp_002\n2. \u274c \"Backward propagation can find improvements\" - DISPROVEN by exp_003\n3. \u2753 \"The 116 snapshots contain better per-N solutions\" - Claimed to be tried in exp_002 notes, but I don't see evidence of a systematic ensemble attempt\n\n**Blind Spots - CRITICAL**:\n\n1. **Per-N Ensemble NOT Actually Implemented**: The session notes claim \"Per-N ensemble from snapshots - no improvements > 0.0001 found\" but I don't see evidence of a systematic ensemble implementation. The jonathanchan kernel collects best per-N from **15+ different sources** and achieves significant improvements. We have **116 snapshots** - this is a MASSIVE untapped resource!\n\n2. **Simulated Annealing NOT Tried**: SA with random perturbations can escape local optima by accepting worse moves probabilistically. This is fundamentally different from local search.\n\n3. **Constructive Heuristics NOT Tried**: Building solutions from scratch using bottom-left or grid-based placement, then optimizing. The current approach only tries to improve existing solutions.\n\n4. **Global Rotation Optimization NOT Tried**: After placing trees, rotate ALL trees together to minimize bounding box. This is different from per-tree rotation.\n\n**Trajectory Assessment**: We're stuck. Two consecutive experiments with zero improvement indicates the current line of inquiry (improving existing solutions through local modifications) is exhausted. **PIVOT REQUIRED**.\n\n## What's Working\n\n1. **Correct implementation** - The code is sound and trustworthy\n2. **Systematic approach** - Testing one technique at a time\n3. **Important finding confirmed**: The baseline is at an extremely strong local optimum\n4. **Validation is correct** - Overlap checking and scoring are accurate\n\n## Key Concerns\n\n### Concern 1: Per-N Ensemble Was NOT Systematically Implemented\n- **Observation**: The notes claim ensemble was tried, but I see no evidence of a proper implementation that scans all 116 snapshots and selects best per-N\n- **Why it matters**: The top kernels achieve their scores primarily through ensemble. Different optimization runs may have found better solutions for different N values. This is the LOWEST-RISK, HIGHEST-LEVERAGE improvement available.\n- **Suggestion**: Implement a proper per-N ensemble:\n```python\nimport os\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom shapely.geometry import Polygon\nfrom shapely import affinity\nfrom shapely.ops import unary_union\n\nSNAPSHOT_DIR = '/home/nonroot/snapshots/santa-2025'\nsnapshots = os.listdir(SNAPSHOT_DIR)\n\n# Tree template\nTX = [0, 0.125, 0.0625, 0.2, 0.1, 0.35, 0.075, 0.075, -0.075, -0.075, -0.35, -0.1, -0.2, -0.0625, -0.125]\nTY = [0.8, 0.5, 0.5, 0.25, 0.25, 0, 0, -0.2, -0.2, 0, 0, 0.25, 0.25, 0.5, 0.5]\n\ndef create_tree_polygon(x, y, deg):\n    \"\"\"Create tree polygon at position (x,y) with rotation deg.\"\"\"\n    import math\n    rad = math.radians(deg)\n    cos_r, sin_r = math.cos(rad), math.sin(rad)\n    coords = []\n    for tx, ty in zip(TX, TY):\n        rx = cos_r * tx - sin_r * ty + x\n        ry = sin_r * tx + cos_r * ty + y\n        coords.append((rx, ry))\n    return Polygon(coords)\n\ndef compute_score_for_n(df_n):\n    \"\"\"Compute score for a single N group.\"\"\"\n    n = len(df_n)\n    polys = []\n    for _, row in df_n.iterrows():\n        x = float(str(row['x']).replace('s', ''))\n        y = float(str(row['y']).replace('s', ''))\n        deg = float(str(row['deg']).replace('s', ''))\n        polys.append(create_tree_polygon(x, y, deg))\n    \n    bounds = unary_union(polys).bounds\n    side = max(bounds[2] - bounds[0], bounds[3] - bounds[1])\n    return side ** 2 / n\n\n# Collect best per-N\nbest_per_n = {n: {'score': float('inf'), 'data': None, 'source': None} for n in range(1, 201)}\n\nfor snapshot_id in snapshots:\n    csv_path = f'{SNAPSHOT_DIR}/{snapshot_id}/submission/submission.csv'\n    if not os.path.exists(csv_path):\n        continue\n    \n    try:\n        df = pd.read_csv(csv_path)\n        df['n'] = df['id'].apply(lambda x: int(x.split('_')[0]))\n        \n        for n in range(1, 201):\n            df_n = df[df['n'] == n]\n            if len(df_n) != n:\n                continue\n            \n            score = compute_score_for_n(df_n)\n            if score < best_per_n[n]['score']:\n                best_per_n[n] = {'score': score, 'data': df_n.copy(), 'source': snapshot_id}\n    except:\n        continue\n\n# Create ensemble\nensemble_parts = [best_per_n[n]['data'] for n in range(1, 201) if best_per_n[n]['data'] is not None]\nensemble_df = pd.concat(ensemble_parts)\nensemble_score = sum(best_per_n[n]['score'] for n in range(1, 201))\nprint(f\"Ensemble score: {ensemble_score:.6f}\")\n```\n\n### Concern 2: Need to Try Simulated Annealing\n- **Observation**: SA has not been tried yet\n- **Why it matters**: SA can escape local optima by accepting worse moves probabilistically.

The approaches tried so far (local search, backward propagation) have yielded ZERO improvement. We need to:\n1. Find better starting points (ensemble from 116 snapshots)\n2. Use global search methods (SA with perturbation)\n3.

      "feedback": "## What I Understood\n\nThe junior researcher implemented a proper per-N ensemble from 116 snapshots, following my previous recommendation. They scanned 487 submission files across all snapshots, found 334 initial \"improvements\" with an ensemble score of 27.48 (suspiciously good!), but then discovered through strict overlap validation that **199 out of 200 N values had overlapping trees**. After falling back to baseline for all invalid N values, the final score remained at 70.615102 - NO IMPROVEMENT.\n\nThis is a **critical finding**: The snapshots contain many INVALID solutions that pass loose validation but fail Kaggle's strict overlap checking. The baseline (70.615102) is already the best VALID solution available from the snapshots.\n\n## Technical Execution Assessment\n\n**Validation**: EXCELLENT. The researcher:\n- Scanned 487 submission files across 116 snapshots\n- Implemented proper overlap validation using Shapely\n- Correctly identified that 199/200 N values had overlapping trees\n- Properly fell back to baseline for invalid configurations\n- This is exactly the right approach - validate before submitting!\n\n**Leakage Risk**: Not applicable - this is a pure optimization problem.\n\n**Score Integrity**: Verified. The metrics.json correctly shows:\n- Initial ensemble score: 27.48 (invalid - had overlaps)\n- Final score after validation: 70.615102 (same as baseline)\n- 199 invalid N values, only 1 valid (N=1)\n\n**Code Quality**: Good implementation with proper validation. The researcher correctly identified the suspicious score (27.48) and validated before submitting.\n\nVerdict: **TRUSTWORTHY** - The experiment was executed correctly and the finding is valid.\n\n## Strategic Assessment\n\n**Approach Fit**: The approach was correct - ensemble is the right strategy. However, the **data source is the problem**, not the approach.\n\n**Critical Finding**: The 116 local snapshots contain INVALID solutions with overlapping trees. This explains why:\n1. The initial ensemble score (27.48) was suspiciously good\n2. After validation, 199/200 N values had to fall back to baseline\n3. No improvement was achieved\n\n**Why This Happened**: The snapshots were likely generated by optimization runs that used loose overlap checking (e.g., tolerance-based or bounding-box-only). Kaggle uses strict polygon intersection checking.\n\n**Effort Allocation**: The researcher spent effort on the right thing (ensemble), but the data source was fundamentally flawed. This is not wasted effort - it's an important discovery.\n\n**Assumptions Challenged**:\n1. \u274c \"The 116 snapshots contain better valid solutions\" - DISPROVEN. They contain invalid solutions.\n2. \u2705 \"Ensemble is the right approach\" - Still valid, but needs DIFFERENT data sources.\n\n**Blind Spots - CRITICAL**:\n\n1. **External Data Sources NOT Used**: The top kernels (jonathanchan) use 15+ EXTERNAL sources:\n   - GitHub repositories (SmartManoj/Santa-Scoreboard)\n   - Kaggle datasets (jazivxt/bucket-of-chump, jonathanchan/santa25-public)\n   - Telegram shared solutions\n   - Other public notebooks\n   \n   The local snapshots are NOT the same as these external sources!\n\n2. **Pure Python Optimization NOT Tried**: Since binaries are forbidden and snapshots are invalid, the only path forward is:\n   - Implement simulated annealing from scratch in Python\n   - Focus on small N values (N=2-20) where improvements have highest impact\n   - Use proper overlap checking during optimization\n\n3. **Constructive Heuristics NOT Tried**: Building solutions from scratch using:\n   - Bottom-left placement\n   - Grid-based placement with optimization\n   - Genetic algorithms\n\n**Trajectory Assessment**: We've now exhausted the \"improve existing solutions\" approach:\n- exp_002: Fractional translation \u2192 NO improvement\n- exp_003: Backward propagation \u2192 NO improvement\n- exp_004: Per-N ensemble from snapshots \u2192 NO improvement (invalid solutions)\n\n**PIVOT REQUIRED**: We need to BUILD better solutions, not just improve existing ones.\n\n## What's Working\n\n1. **Validation is correct** - The researcher properly validated for overlaps before submitting\n2. **Critical discovery** - The snapshots contain invalid solutions (this explains a lot!)\n3. **Systematic approach** - Testing one technique at a time\n4. **No wasted submissions** - Only 2 submissions used, 98 remaining\n\n## Key Concerns\n\n### Concern 1: Local Snapshots Are Not Useful\n- **Observation**: 199/200 N values from snapshots had overlapping trees\n- **Why it matters**: The snapshots were generated with loose validation and cannot be used for ensemble\n- **Suggestion**: STOP trying to use local snapshots. They are fundamentally flawed.\n\n### Concern 2: Need to Build Solutions From Scratch\n- **Observation**: All \"improve existing solutions\" approaches have failed\n- **Why it matters**: The baseline is at a strong local optimum that cannot be improved through local modifications\n- **Suggestion**: Implement simulated annealing from scratch in pure Python:\n  - Start with random or grid-based initial placement\n  - Use proper overlap checking during optimization\n  - Focus on N=2-20 first (highest impact per improvement)\n\n### Concern 3: Score Gap Analysis\n- **Current**: 70.615102\n- **Target**: 68.881647\n- **Gap**: 1.733 points (2.5%)\n\nThis gap requires finding better solutions for many N values. The approaches tried so far have yielded ZERO improvement. We need a fundamentally different strategy.\n\n## CV-LB Relationship\n\nWith only 2 submissions (one rejected, one successful), we don't have enough data for CV-LB analysis. The one successful submission shows perfect CV-LB match (70.615102 CV = 70.615102 LB), which is expected for this deterministic optimization problem.\n\n## Top Priority for Next Experiment\n\n**IMPLEMENT SIMULATED ANNEALING FROM SCRATCH IN PURE PYTHON**\n\nSince:\n1.

Entre los enfoques m\u00e1s destacados est\u00e1n los algoritmos heur\u00edsticos y metaheur\u00edsticos, que buscan soluciones cercanas a \u00f3ptimas en tiempos razonables. Por ejemplo, la revisi\u00f3n de Petrillo et al.

      "finding": "The no-fit polygon (NFP) technique is a geometric method used in 2D polygon packing problems, particularly for irregular shapes. It involves calculating a set of feasible positions where one polygon can be placed relative to another without overlapping. The NFP essentially represents the boundary of all positions where the polygons would touch or intersect if placed in any configuration, thus helping to identify valid placements efficiently ([ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0305054806000669), [ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0377221706001639)).\n\nThe core of the NFP technique often involves the use of Minkowski sums, a mathematical operation that combines two shapes to produce a new shape representing all possible translations of one shape around the other. By computing the Minkowski sum of the two polygons, the NFP can be derived, which delineates the boundary of all positions where the polygons are just touchi",
