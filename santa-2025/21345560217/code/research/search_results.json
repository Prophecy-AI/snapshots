I am given a single polygon as a boundary (convex or concave may also contain holes) and a single \"fill\" polygon (may also be convex or concave, does not contain holes) and I need to fill the boundary polygon with a specified number of fill polygons. (I'm working in 2D).\n\nMany of the polygon packing heuristics I've found assume that the boundary and/or filling polygons will be rectangular and also that the filling polygons will be of different sizes. In my case, the filling polygons may be non-rectangular, but all will be exactly the same.\n\nMaybe this is a particular type of packing problem? If somebody has a definition for this type of polygon packing I'll gladly google away, but so far I've not found anything which is similar enough to be of great use.\n\nThanks.\n\n- [algorithm](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/algorithm)\n- [polygon](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/polygon)\n- [heuristics](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/heuristics)\n- [packing](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/packing)\n\n[Share](https://stackoverflow.com/q/6864382)\n\n[Improve this question](https://stackoverflow.com/posts/6864382/edit)\n\nFollow\n\nasked Jul 28, 2011 at 19:12\n\n[![Craig's user avatar](https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/015502b5e2de5fa52ffa72f5b2bbbd75?s=64&d=identicon&r=PG)](https://stackoverflow.com/users/863506/craig)\n\n[Craig](https://stackoverflow.com/users/863506/craig) Craig\n\n56411 gold badge55 silver badges2020 bronze badges\n\n4\n\n- No, this doesn't look like some well-known special case of the packing problem. Anything that works with distinct shapes should trivially work with identical shapes too. If you have an algorithm that works well for a rectangular boundary, you can try to adapt it for an arbitrary boundary. Modify it so that you can at a flip opre-fill your boundary with some shapes that cannot be moved or deleted (e.g. there's only one way to place them). Solve for a rectangular boundary, pre-filled with some shapes that just leave your original boundary unfilled. Not all algorithms can be adapted like this.\n\n\u2013\u00a0[n. m. could be an AI](https://stackoverflow.com/users/775806/n-m-could-be-an-ai)\n\nCommentedJul 28, 2011 at 20:22\n\n- The case with only one kind of filling polygon is definitely a special case of the general situation with different filling polys. I believe most heuristics for solving this kind of cutting/packing problem uses the no-fit polygon, so googling \"no-fit irregular packing\"' or something like that could be a good start.\n\n\u2013\u00a0[Anders Forsgren](https://stackoverflow.com/users/678410/anders-forsgren)\n\nCommentedJul 28, 2011 at 23:05\n\n- I think you should as this in the theoretical cs version of SO.\n\n\u2013\u00a0[Ira Baxter](https://stackoverflow.com/users/120163/ira-baxter)\n\nCommentedAug 31, 2011 at 5:25\n\n- for the algorithm: this is commonly called \"nesting\", which means to pack irregular, potentially non-convex, 2D/3D shapes into some piece of \"stock\" that is then cut. things need not be nested literally, but they could be.\n\n\u2013\u00a0[Christoph Rackwitz](https://stackoverflow.com/users/2602877/christoph-rackwitz)\n\nCommentedJun 26, 2023 at 19:18\n\n\n[Add a comment](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6864382/packing-arbitrary-polygons-within-an-arbitrary-boundary)\u00a0\\|\n\n## 4 Answers 4\n\nSorted by:\n[Reset to default](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6864382/packing-arbitrary-polygons-within-an-arbitrary-boundary?answertab=scoredesc#tab-top)\n\nHighest score (default)Trending (recent votes count more)Date modified (newest first)Date created (oldest first)\n\n4\n\nThe question you ask is very hard. To put this in perspective, the (much) simpler case where you're packing the interior of your bounded polygon with non-overlapping disks is already hard, and disks are the simplest possible \"packing shape\" (with any other shape you have to consider orientation as well as size and center location).\n\nIn fact, I think it's an open problem in [computational geometry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_geometry) to determine for an arbitrary integer N and arbitrary bounded polygonal region (in the Euclidean plane), what is the \"optimal\" (in the sense of covering the greatest percentage of the polygon interior) packing of N inscribed non-overlapping disks, where you are free to choose the radius and center location of each disk. I'm sure the \"best\" answer _is_ known for certain special polygonal shapes (like rectangles, circles, and triangles), but for arbitrary shapes your best \"heuristic\" is probably:\n\n1. Start your shape counter at N.\n2. Add the largest \"packing shape\" you can fit completely inside the polygonal boundary without overlapping any other packing shapes.\n3. Decrement your shape counter.\n4. If your shape counter is > 0, go to step 2.\n\nI say \"probably\" because \"largest first\" isn't always the best way to pack things into a confined space. You can dig into that particular flavor of craziness by reading about the [bin packing problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bin_packing_problem) and [knapsack problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem).\n\n**EDIT:** Step 2 by itself is hard. A reasonable strategy would be to pick an arbitrary point on the interior of the polygon as the center and \"inflate\" the disk until it touches either the boundary or another disk (or both), and then \"slide\" the disk while continuing to inflate it so that it remains inside the boundary without overlapping any other disks until it is \"trapped\" - with at least 2 points of contact with the boundary and/or other disks. But it isn't easy to formalize this \"sliding process\". And even if you get the sliding process right, this strategy doesn't guarantee that you'll find the biggest \"inscribable disk\" - your \"locally maximal\" disk could be trapped in a \"lobe\" of the interior which is connected by a narrow \"neck\" of free space to a larger \"lobe\" where a larger disk would fit.\n\n[Share](https://stackoverflow.com/a/7342898)\n\n[Improve this answer](https://stackoverflow.com/posts/7342898/edit)\n\nFollow\n\n[edited Feb 27, 2013 at 20:29](https://stackoverflow.com/posts/7342898/revisions)\n\nanswered Sep 8, 2011 at 3:46\n\n[![Peter's user avatar](https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f031e9e9b7476fc5d3674fe4a9c59ef2?s=64&d=identicon&r=PG)](https://stackoverflow.com/users/227491/peter)\n\n[Peter](https://stackoverflow.com/users/227491/peter) Peter\n\n2,53611 gold badge2323 silver badges3232 bronze badges\n\n[Add a comment](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6864382/packing-arbitrary-polygons-within-an-arbitrary-boundary)\u00a0\\|\n\n3\n\nThanks for the replies, my requirements were such that I was able to further simplify the problem by not having to deal with orientation and I then even further simplified by only really wor...",

      "text": "Online Packing to Minimize Area or Perimeter\nMikkel Abrahamsen !\nBARC, University of Copenhagen, Denmark\nLorenzo Beretta !\nBARC, University of Copenhagen, Denmark\nAbstract\nWe consider online packing problems where we get a stream of axis-parallel rectangles. The rectangles\nhave to be placed in the plane without overlapping, and each rectangle must be placed without\nknowing the subsequent rectangles. The goal is to minimize the perimeter or the area of the\naxis-parallel bounding box of the rectangles. We either allow rotations by 90\u25e6or translations only.\nFor the perimeter version we give algorithms with an absolute competitive ratio slightly less\nthan 4 when only translations are allowed and when rotations are also allowed.\nWe then turn our attention to minimizing the area and show that the competitive ratio of any\nalgorithm is at least \u2126(\u221an), where n is the number of rectangles in the stream, and this holds with\nand without rotations. We then present algorithms that match this bound in both cases and the\ncompetitive ratio is thus optimal to within a constant factor. We also show that the competitive\nratio cannot be bounded as a function of Opt. We then consider two special cases.\nThe first is when all the given rectangles have aspect ratios bounded by some constant. The\nparticular variant where all the rectangles are squares and we want to minimize the area of the\nbounding square has been studied before and an algorithm with a competitive ratio of 8 has been\ngiven [Fekete and Hoffmann, Algorithmica, 2017]. We improve the analysis of the algorithm and\nshow that the ratio is at most 6, which is tight.\nThe second special case is when all edges have length at least 1. Here, the \u2126(\u221an) lower bound\nstill holds, and we turn our attention to lower bounds depending on Opt. We show that any\nalgorithm for the translational case has a competitive ratio of at least \u2126(\u221aOpt). If rotations are\nallowed, we show a lower bound of \u2126(\u221a4 Opt). For both versions, we give algorithms that match\nthe respective lower bounds: With translations only, this is just the algorithm from the general\ncase with competitive ratio O(\n\u221a\nn) = O(\n\u221a\nOpt). If rotations are allowed, we give an algorithm with\ncompetitive ratio O(min{\n\u221a\nn, \u221a4 Opt}), thus matching both lower bounds simultaneously.\n2012 ACM Subject Classification Theory of computation \u2192 Computational geometry; Theory of\ncomputation \u2192 Packing and covering problems; Theory of computation \u2192 Online algorithms\nKeywords and phrases Packing, online algorithms\nDigital Object Identifier 10.4230/LIPIcs.SoCG.2021.6\nRelated Version Full Version: https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.09024\nFunding Research of both authors partly supported by Investigator Grant 16582, Basic Algorithms\nResearch Copenhagen (BARC), from the VILLUM Foundation.\nLorenzo Beretta: receives funding from the European Union\u2019s Horizon 2020 research and innovation\nprogram under the Marie Sk\u0142odowska-Curie grant agreement No 801199.\n1 Introduction\nProblems related to packing appear in a plethora of big industries. For instance, two\u0002dimensional versions of packing arise when a given set of pieces have to be cut out from a\nlarge piece of material so as to minimize waste. This is relevant to clothing production where\ncutting patterns are cut out from a roll of fabric, and similarly in leather, glass, wood, and\nsheet metal cutting.\n\u00a9 Mikkel Abrahamsen and Lorenzo Beretta;\nlicensed under Creative Commons License CC-BY 4.0\n37th International Symposium on Computational Geometry (SoCG 2021).\nEditors: Kevin Buchin and \u00c9ric Colin de Verdi\u00e8re; Article No. 6; pp. 6:1\u20136:15\nLeibniz International Proceedings in Informatics\nSchloss Dagstuhl \u2013 Leibniz-Zentrum f\u00fcr Informatik, Dagstuhl Publishing, Germany\n6:2 Online Packing to Minimize Area or Perimeter\nIn some applications, it is important that the pieces are placed in an online fashion. This\nmeans that the pieces arrive one by one and we need to decide the placement of one piece\nbefore we know the ones that will come in the future. This is in contrast to offline problems,\nwhere all the pieces are known in advance. Problems related to packing were some of the\nfirst for which online algorithms were described and analyzed. Indeed, the first use of the\nterms \u201conline\u201d and \u201coffline\u201d in the context of approximation algorithms was in the early\n1970s and used for algorithms for bin-packing problems [14].\nIn this paper, we study online packing problems where the pieces can be placed anywhere\nin the plane as long as they do not overlap. The goal is to minimize the region occupied by the\npieces. The pieces are axis-parallel rectangles, and they may or may not be rotated by 90\u25e6. We\nwant to minimize the size of the axis-parallel bounding box of the pieces, and the size of the\nbox is either the perimeter or the area. This results in four problems: PerimeterRotation,\nPerimeterTranslation, AreaRotation, and AreaTranslation.\nCompetitive analysis\nThe competitive ratio of an online algorithm is the equivalent of the approximation ratio of\nan (offline) approximation algorithm. The usual definitions [7, 9, 11] of competitive ratio (or\nworst case ratio, as it may also be called [11]) can only be used to describe that the cost of\nthe solution produced by an online algorithm is at most some constant factor higher than the\ncost Opt of the optimal (offline) solution. In the study of approximation algorithms, it is\noften the case that the approximation ratio is described not just as a constant, but as a more\ngeneral function of the input. In the same way, we generalize the definition of competitive\nratios to support such statements about online algorithms.\nConsider an algorithm A for one of the packing problems studied in this paper. Let L be\nthe set of non-empty streams of rectangular pieces. For a stream L \u2208 L, we define A(L) to\nbe the cost of the packing produced by A and let Opt(L) be the cost of the optimal (offline)\npacking. We say that A has a competitive ratio of f(L), for some function f : L \u2212\u2192 R\n+\nwhich may just be a constant, if\nsup\nL\u2208L\nA(L)\nOpt(L)f(L)\n\u2264 1.\nIn this paper, the functions f(L) that we consider will be (i) constants, (ii) functions of the\nnumber of pieces n = |L|, (iii) functions of Opt(L).\nResults and structure of the paper\nWe develop online algorithms for the perimeter versions PerimeterRotation and Peri\u0002meterTranslation, both with a competitive ratio slightly less than 4. These algorithms\nare described in Section 2. The idea is to partition the positive quadrant into bricks, which\nare axis-parallel rectangles with aspect ratio \u221a2. In each brick, we build a stack of pieces\nwhich would be too large to place in a brick of smaller size. Online packing algorithms using\nhigher-dimensional bricks were described by Januszewski and Lassak [15] and our algorithms\nare inspired by an algorithm of Fekete and Hoffmann [13].\nIn Section 3, we study the area versions AreaRotation and AreaTranslation. We\nshow in Section 3.1 that any algorithm A processing a stream of n pieces cannot achieve a\nbetter competitive ratio than \u2126(\u221an), and this holds for all online algorithms and with and\nwithout rotations allowed. It also holds in the special case where all the edges of pieces have\nlength at least 1. We furthermore show that when the pieces can be arbitrary, no bound on\nM. Abrahamsen and L. Beretta 6:3\nthe competitive ratio as a function of Opt for AreaRotation nor AreaTranslation. In\nSection 3.2 we describe the algorithms DynBoxTrans and DynBoxRot, which achieve a\nO(\n\u221a\nn) competitive ratio for AreaTranslation and AreaRotation, respectively, for an\narbitrary stream of n pieces. This is thus optimal up to a constant factor when measuring\nthe competitive ratio as a function of n. Both algorithms use a row of boxes of exponentially\nincreasing width and dynamically adjusted height. In these boxes, we pack pieces using a\nnext-fit shelf algorithm, which is a classic online strip packing algorithm first described by\nBaker and Schwartz [6].\nWe then turn our attention to two special cas...",

Unfortunately many of them are believed to be hard\nto solve efficiently (i.e. they cannot be solved in polynomial time unless P=NP).\nAn approximation algorithm is one of the ways to tackle these hard optimization\nproblems. These algorithms have polynomial running time and guarantee a fea\u0002sible solution whose value is within a proven factor of the optimal solution value.\nThe field of approximation algorithms has grown fast over the last few decades,\nand many techniques have been developed to handle these hard problems. How\u0002ever, there are still many problems for which substantial progress is needed. The\nultimate goal for any optimization problem is an approximation algorithm with a\nperformance guarantee along with a matching hardness of approximation result.\nIn this thesis we address two fundamental geometric packing problems: Strip\nPacking and two-dimensional Geometric Knapsack. In the Strip Packing problem\nwe are given a set of rectangles and the goal is to place them into a rectangu\u0002lar region of fixed width W so that they do not overlap while minimizing the\ntotal height of the spanned region. On the other hand, in the two-dimensional\nGeometric Knapsack problem we are given a set of rectangles with associated\nprofits and a square region of fixed height and width N, and the goal is to select\nand pack inside the region a subset of the rectangles of maximum profit so that\nthey do not overlap. Both problems are NP-hard and have many interesting real\u0002world applications, so they have been studied through the lens of approximation\nalgorithms in the past.\nWe start by describing our results on the Strip Packing problem, where we\ndevelop improved approximation algorithms for some important special cases.\nIn the first case we show a pseudo-polynomial time (PPT) \n4\n3 + \"\n\u0001\n-approximation\nwhich improves and simplifies the previous best \n7\n5 + \"\n\u0001\n-approximation from Nadi\u0002radze and Wiese [2016]. In the second case we show that there exists a tight\n\n3\n2 + \"\n\u0001\n-approximation for the problem in the special case where no rectangle is\n\u201clarge\u201d in both dimensions (compared to the dimensions of the optimal solution).\nBoth these results try to give new insights in order to approach the important\nvii\nviii\nopen problem of improving the approximability of Strip Packing.\nIn the second part we describe our results for the two-dimensional Geometric\nKnapsack problem and some of their known variants. For this problem we im\u0002prove upon the best known approximation ratios for the cases with and without\n90 degree rotations, and give refined approximation algorithms for the case of\nuniform weights. These are the first algorithms that break the approximation\nbarrier of 2 for the aforementioned problems. As an important development we\nintroduce the notion of L-packings which turns out to be crucial to achieve the\npreviously mentioned results in the settings without rotations, and may be of\nindependent interest to address related problems.\nAcknowledgements\nTBA\nix\nx\nContents\nContents xi\n1 Introduction 1\n1.1 Basic definitions . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2\n1.2 Two-dimensional Rectangle Packing Problems . . . . . . . . . . . . 4\n1.3 Outline of the Thesis . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 6\n2 Standard Tools 9\n2.1 Useful Procedures under Size/Area Guarantees . . . . . . . . . . . . 9\n2.1.1 Steinberg Algorithm . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 9\n2.1.2 Next-Fit Decreasing Height . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10\n2.2 Container Packings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 11\n2.2.1 Rounding the Container Dimensions . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 12\n2.2.2 Packing Rectangles into Containers . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 14\n2.3 Turning Fractional Packings into Feasible Solutions . . . . . . . . . 17\n2.4 Including Small Rectangles into a Container Packing . . . . . . . . 20\n2.5 Packing Rectangles with Resource Augmentation . . . . . . . . . . . 22\n3 Improved Approximation Algorithms for Strip Packing 23\n3.0.1 Prior work . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 23\n3.1 Strip Packing without Large Rectangles . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 25\n3.1.1 Preliminaries . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 25\n3.1.2 Hardness of Approximation . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 26\n3.1.3 Existence of a Structured Solution . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 27\n3.1.4 Algorithm . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 33\n3.2 A PPT (4/3 + \")-approximation for Strip Packing . . . . . . . . . . . 35\n3.2.1 Preliminaries . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 37\n3.2.2 Overview of the Algorithm . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 38\n3.2.3 A Repacking Lemma . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 42\n3.2.4 A refined Structural Lemma . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 45\nxi\nxii Contents\n3.2.5 The Final Algorithm . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 49\n3.2.6 Extension to the Case with Rotations . . . . . . . . . . . . . 50\n3.3 Conclusions . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 50\n4 On the Two-Dimensional Geometric Knapsack problem 53\n4.0.1 Description of the Results . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 54\n4.0.2 Other related work . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 57\n4.1 Preliminaries . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 58\n4.1.1 Item classification . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 58\n4.1.2 Corridors, Spirals and Rings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 59\n4.2 Our approach: Search for L&C Packings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 62\n4.2.1 Main algorithm . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 63\n4.3 A PTAS for L-packings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 64\n4.4 2DK without Rotations . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 72\n4.4.1 A Simple Improved Approximation for Cardinality 2DK . . 73\n4.4.2 Weighted Case without Rotations . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 75\n4.5 2DK with Rotations . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 84\n4.5.1 Cardinality 2DKR . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 84\n4.5.2 Weighted 2DKR . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 90\n4.6 Open Problems . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 95\nA Two-Dimensional Geometric Knapsack with Resource Augmentation 97\nA.1 Containers for Short-High Items . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 100\nA.2 Fractional Packing with O(1) Containers . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 101\nA.2.1 Existence of an Integral Packing . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 102\nA.3...",

In this post we&#x27;ll have a look what goes into collision detection as well as a strategy to pack any arbitrary shape in 2D.\n#### By[Ahmad Moussa](https://www.gorillasun.de/author/ahmad/)\nPublished on July 22, 2022\nLast Updated on August 28, 2024\n21 min read\n![A Simple Solution for Shape Packing in 2D](https://www.gorillasun.de/content/images/size/w1200/2023/03/banner2.jpg)\nThis blog post is about the age-old creative coding problem of shape packing! Even though it might seem like a simple task at first, it is actually quite an involved undertaking. It also usually entails having a broader look at how collision detection algorithms work. In the following sections we'll work our way up to an algorithm with which you can essentially pack any sort of geometric shapes, and combinations thereof.\n![](https://www.gorillasun.de/content/images/2023/03/example1.jpg)\n![](https://www.gorillasun.de/content/images/2023/03/example2.jpg)\nBefore we begin, I want to point out that I had a first encounter with this algo back in February of 2022. I never completed that particular idea, but it led to an interesting packing scheme. You can see some of the artworks my code produced above.\n![](https://www.gorillasun.de/content/images/2023/03/maplands.jpg)\nI also recently learned that a few others have made their own version of this idea. In June I faced a packing problem where I had to draw all sorts of geometric shapes to the canvas. I was left scratching my head at first and it took me quite a while to find a solution. While researching different methods I came across[Amy Goodchild\u2019s](https://twitter.com/amygoodchild?ref=gorillasun.de)[writeup](https://www.amygoodchild.com/blog/maplands?ref=gorillasun.de)on a wonderful sketch of hers called \"Maplands\" where she used a similar strategy to what I ultimately did to implement my idea.\n![](https://www.gorillasun.de/content/images/2023/03/fruitpacking.jpg)\nLater on I also re-discovered[Tarwin Stroh-Spijer's](https://twitter.com/tarwin?ref=gorillasun.de)[fruit salad packing sketch](https://openprocessing.org/sketch/1533577?ref=gorillasun.de), which initially evolved from[Jeff's (aka ippsketch)](https://twitter.com/ippsketch?ref=gorillasun.de)[banana packing sketch](https://ippsketch.com/posts/non-circular-packing/?ref=gorillasun.de). I had a thorough look at Tarwin's beautifully written packing library, and a lot of the code in later sections of this post are based on Tarwin's method. Go check out the folks mentioned above, they're all awesome creative individuals!\n### Discussion:\n1. [Packing Algorithms in Generative Art](#packing-algorithms-in-generative-art)\n2.

[Closing Notes](#closing-notes)## Packing Algorithms in Generative Art\n![](https://www.gorillasun.de/content/images/2023/03/tripack.jpg)\nPacking problems come in various flavours, but generally their overarching concern is positioning items as densely as possible within a given area. Despite its deceptive simplicity, bin packing is actually an[NP-Hard problem](https://stackoverflow.com/a/19510170?ref=gorillasun.de), with it's associated decision problem (checking if the items to be packed fit in a certain area), is[NP-Complete](https://gorillasun.de/blog/rectangle-packing-an-incredibly-difficult-problem?ref=gorillasun.de). Understanding this is not necessary for what follows however. I just find it incredibly interesting though, I keep finding myself coming back to this problem thinking: \"Surely this can't be this difficult!\"\nPacking algorithms are useful for a range of real life scenarios, such as packing boxes in a warehouse, or positioning shapes on a sheet of laser cutting material such that the amount of wasted material is minimised. Packing is a heavily researched area of mathematics and fairly advanced algorithms have been developed to solve different variations of it. In generative art the primary goal of packing algorithms is often the creation of visually pleasing and interesting packing patterns. We also often don't start with shapes that have a pre-determined size (usually real life objects have a pre-determined size duh), but make them up on the go.\nHence gen-art packing algorithms vary a little in that regard. I'd like to show off a few artworks that have in one another or another been made with packing algorithms. Here's two stunning artworks from[Caleb Ogg](https://twitter.com/iso_hedron?ref=gorillasun.de):\n![](https://www.gorillasun.de/content/images/2023/03/Colorshift2.jpg)\n![](https://www.gorillasun.de/content/images/2023/03/Lens3.jpg)\nCaleb's pieces[Lens 3](https://superrare.com/0x6125e13fc97f6fc97ea14cf925211e4dc0e99f0f/lens-3-18?ref=gorillasun.de)and[Colorshift 2](https://superrare.com/0x6125e13fc97f6fc97ea14cf925211e4dc0e99f0f/colorshift-2-12?ref=gorillasun.de), part of his ongoing 'Coalesce' series, are some of the most interesting circle packing sketches I've seen in a while. Note that the images shown here (2000x2000px) don't do the originals justice which are absolutely gigantic (16000x16000px). Built on a system of circles and rings, Caleb makes use of an underlying noise field for a nifty creative effect. I especially like how Lens conveys the illusion of multiple overlapping lenses that appear to contort the coloration of the underlying circles, which is done by scaling and multiplying the underlying noise field. Excited to see where this series is heading, always a pleasure when Caleb's sketches bless my timeline.\nA little less recent[example](https://www.infinite.center/2015/08/08/circles-inside-circles/?ref=gorillasun.de)of a circle packing sketch is by none other than Jared Tarbell:\n![](https://www.gorillasun.de/content/images/2023/03/javadpack.jpg)\nAs well as this[beautiful homage](https://www.reddit.com/r/generative/comments/ibk6pf/circle_packing_\u00e0_la_tarbell/?ref=gorillasun.de)to Jared's sketch by prolific creative coder[Dmitri Cherniak](https://twitter.com/dmitricherniak?ref=gorillasun.de):\n![](https://www.gorillasun.de/content/images/2023/03/dimitripack-1.webp)\nIf you like these patterns you should also check out the[Appolonian Gasket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollonian_gasket?ref=gorillasun.de)(alternatively Appolonian circle packing). And for good measure we also need to mention[Yann LeGalle](https://twitter.com/Yann_LeGall?ref=gorillasun.de)who just utterly blows my mind on a regular basis:\nAnd one of the earliest ones that captivated me and initially motivated me to explore circle packing for myself was this sketch by Piter Pasma's:\n> [> > > > > > > > View this post on Instagram\n> > > > > > > > > > > > ](https://www.instagram.com/p/CLEl7WGH6j8/?utm_source=ig_embed&utm_campaign=loading)\n[> A post shared by Piter Pasma (@piterpasma)\n](https://www.instagram.com/p/CLEl7WGH6j8/?utm_source=ig_embed&utm_campaign=loading)\nI really love this one.

Using the two-dimensional packing model of Baker, Coffman, and Rivest, a finite list L of rectangles is to be packed into a rectangular bin of finite width but infinite height, so as to minimize the total height used. An algorithm which packs the list in the order given without looking ahead or moving pieces already packed is called an on-line algorithm. Since the problem of finding an optimal packing is NP-hard, previous work has been directed at finding approximation algorithms. Most of the approximation algorithms which have been studied are on-line except that they require the list to have been previously sorted by height or width. This paper examines lower bounds for the worst-case performance of on-line algorithms for both non-preordered lists and for lists preordered by increasing or decreasing height or width.\n\nThis is a preview of subscription content, [log in via an institution](https://wayf.springernature.com?redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1007%2FBF00264439%3Ferror%3Dcookies_not_supported%26code%3De12dbb6c-164f-4122-abdc-ceba742a70a6) to check access.\n\n## Access this article\n\n[Log in via an institution](https://wayf.springernature.com?redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1007%2FBF00264439%3Ferror%3Dcookies_not_supported%26code%3De12dbb6c-164f-4122-abdc-ceba742a70a6)\n\nBuy article PDF USD 39.95\n\nPrice excludes VAT (USA)\n\nTax calculation will be finalised during checkout.\n\nInstant access to the full article PDF.\n\nRent this article via DeepDyve\n\n[Institutional subscriptions](https://www.springernature.com/gp/librarians/licensing/agc/journals)\n\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n\n![](https://media.springernature.com/w215h120/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10878-017-0140-2/MediaObjects/10878_2017_140_Figa_HTML.gif)\n\n### [Bin packing under linear constraints](https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10878-017-0140-2?fromPaywallRec=true)\n\nArticle25 May 2017\n\n![](https://media.springernature.com/w92h120/springer-static/cover-hires/book/978-3-319-08019-2?as=webp)\n\n### [Online Bin Packing: Old Algorithms and New Results](https://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-319-08019-2_38?fromPaywallRec=true)\n\nChapter\u00a9 2014\n\n![](https://media.springernature.com/w215h120/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs00453-014-9943-z/MediaObjects/453_2014_9943_Fig1_HTML.gif)\n\n### [New Approximability Results for Two-Dimensional Bin Packing](https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00453-014-9943-z?fromPaywallRec=true)\n\nArticle25 October 2014\n\n## References\n\n01.

Similar to the _Tetris game_, the rectangles arrive from the top and, once placed, cannot be moved again. The rectangles are moved inside the bin to reach their place. For the case in which rotations are allowed, we design an algorithm whose performance ratio is constant. In contrast, if rotations are not allowed, we show that no algorithm of constant ratio exists. For this case we design an algorithm with performance ratio of _O_(log(1/\u03b5)), where \u03b5 is the minimum width of any rectangle. We also show that no algorithm can achieve a better ratio than\u03a9(log(1/\u03b5))for this case.\n\nRecommended articles\n\n- Y.

Most notably, online strip packing has been considered; for prominent examples, see Azar and Epstein \\[40\\], who employ shelf packing, and Epstein and van Stee \\[36\\]. Offline packing of rectangles into a unit square or rectangle has also been considered in different variants; for examples, see \\[41\\], as well as \\[42\\].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow abstract\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the presence of dynamic insertions and deletions into a partially reconfigurable FPGA, fragmentation is unavoidable. This poses the challenge of developing efficient approaches to dynamic defragmentation and reallocation. One key aspect is to develop efficient algorithms and data structures that exploit the two-dimensional geometry of a chip, instead of just one. We propose a new method for this task, based on the fractal structure of a quadtree, which allows dynamic segmentation of the chip area, along with dynamically adjusting the necessary communication infrastructure. We describe a number of algorithmic aspects, and present different solutions. We also provide a number of basic simulations that indicate that the theoretical worst-case bound may be pessimistic.\n\n- ### [Two-dimensional strip packing with unloading constraints](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166218X13003600)\n\n\n\n2014, Discrete Applied Mathematics\n\n\n\nShow abstract\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this paper we present approximation algorithms for the two-dimensional strip packing problem with unloading constraints. In this problem, we are given a strip S of width 1 and unbounded height, and n items of C different classes, each item ai with height h(ai), width w(ai) and class c(ai). As in the strip packing problem, we have to pack all items, minimizing the height used, but now we have the additional constraint that items of higher classes cannot block the way out of items of lower classes. For the case in which horizontal and vertical movements for removing the items are allowed, we design an algorithm whose asymptotic performance bound is 3. For the case in which only vertical movements are allowed, we design a bin packing based algorithm with an asymptotic approximation ratio of 5.745. Moreover, we also design approximation algorithms for restricted cases of both versions of the problem. These problems have practical applications in dealing with routing problems with loading/unloading constraints.\n\n- ### [Heuristics for the strip packing problem with unloading constraints](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305054812002353)\n\n\n\n2013, Computers and Operations Research\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitation Excerpt :\n\n\n\nSome other papers also achieved similar results \\[5,11,8\\]. In \\[3\\], Azar and Epstein proposed an online 4-competitive algorithm to a version of the strip packing problem, where while packing one item there must be a free way from the top of the bin until the position where the item is packed. In this model, a rectangle arrives from the top of S, and it should be moved continuously using only the free space until it reaches its place, as in the well known TETRIS game.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow abstract\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis article addresses the Strip Packing Problem with Unloading Constraints (SPU). In this problem, we are given a strip of fixed width and unbounded height, and _n_ items of _C_ different classes. As in the well-known two-dimensional Strip Packing problem, we have to pack all items minimizing the used height, but now we have the additional constraint that items of hig...",
