This problem is approached with an heuristic based on simulated annealing. Traditional \" external penalization\" techniques are avoided through the application of the no-fit polygon, that determinates the collision-free region for each small item before its placement.

Three possibilities to define the sequence on which the small items are placed are studied: larger-first, random permutation and weight sorted. The proposed algorithm is suited for non-convex small items and large objects.\n**Keywords:**knapsack problem, cutting and packing, optimization\n**Introduction**\nThe knapsack problem arises in the industry whenever one must place multiple small items inside a large object such that there is no collision between the small items, while either minimizing the size of the large object or maximizing the volume occupied by the small items. High material utilization is of particular interest to mass production industries since small improvements of the layout can result in large savings of material and considerably reduce production cost.\nThe knapsack problem belongs to the more general class of combinatorial problems known as cutting and packing problems. According to Dyckhoff (1990), the cutting and packing problems are mainly characterized by the number of relevant dimensions, the regularity and irregularity of the shapes of the small items and large objects and the problem assignment. Considering assignment, it is possible to identify two situations: output maximization and input minimization. In the input minimization, the set of large objects is sufficient to accommodate all small items, and there is no selection regarding the small items. In the case of output maximization, the set of large objects is not sufficient to accommodate all the small items and a set of small items has to be assigned to a given set of large objects. The survey made by Wascher et al. (2005) improved the typology of cutting and packing problems proposed by Dyckhoff (1990). According to Wascher et al. (2005), the problem studied in this work can be defined as: \" ... the knapsack problem represents a problem category which is characterized by a strongly heteroge-neous assortment of small items which have to be allocated to a given set of large objects. Again, the availability of the large objects is limited such that not all small items can be accommodated. The value of the accommodated small items is to be maximized\" . In this survey, Wascher et al. (2005) identified 294 papers containing material relevant to cutting and packing. Only 5...",

Tsuzuki\nAdditional information is available at the end of the chapter\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5772/50302\n1. Introduction\nSimulated annealing has been applied to a wide range of problems: combinatorial and\ncontinuous optimizations. This work approaches a new class of problems in which the\nobjective function is discrete but the parameters are continuous. This type of problem arises in\nrotational irregular packing problems. It is necessary to place multiple items inside a container\nsuch that there is no collision between the items, while minimizing the items occupied area.\nA feedback is proposed to control the next candidate probability distribution, in order to\nincrease the number of accepted solutions. The probability distribution is controlled by\nthe so called crystallization factor. The proposed algorithm modifies only one parameter\nat a time. If the new configuration is accepted then a positive feedback is executed to\nresult in larger modifications. Different types of positive feedbacks are studied herein. If\nthe new configuration is rejected, then a negative feedback is executed to result in smaller\nmodifications. For each non-placed item, a limited depth binary search is performed to find a\nscale factor that, when applied to the item, allows it to be fitted in the layout. The proposed\nalgorithm was used to solve two different rotational puzzles. A geometrical cooling schedule\nis used. Consequently, the proposed algorithm can be classified as simulated quenching.\nThis work is structured as follows. Section 2 presents some simulated annealing and\nsimulated quenching key concepts. In section 3 the objective function with discrete values and\ncontinuous parameters is explained. Section 4 explains the proposed adaptive neighborhood\nbased on the crystallization factor. Section 5 explains the computational experiments and\nsection 6 presents the results. Finally, section 7 rounds up the work with the conclusions.\n2. Background\nSimulated annealing is a probabilistic meta-heuristic with a capacity of escape from local\nminima. It came from the Metropolis algorithm and it was originally proposed in the area\nof combinatorial optimization [9], that is, when the objective function is defined in a discrete\n\u00a92012 Tsuzuki et al., licensee InTech.

The simulated annealing was modified in order to apply to the optimization of\nmultimodal functions defined on continuous domain [4]. The choices of the cooling schedule\nand of the next candidate distribution are the most important decisions in the definition of a\nsimulated annealing algorithm [13]. The next candidate distribution for continuous variables\nis discussed herein.\nIn the discrete domain, such as the traveling salesman and computer circuit design problems,\nthe parameters must have discrete values; the next point candidate xk+1 corresponds to a\npermutation in the list of cities to be visited, interchanges of circuit elements, or other discrete\noperation. In the continuous application of simulated annealing a new choice of the next point\ncandidate must be executed. Bohachevsky et al. [1] proposed that the next candidate xk+1 can\nbe obtained by first generating a random direction vector u, with |u| = 1, then multiplying it\nby a fixed step size \u0394r, and summing the resulting vector to the current candidate point xk.\nBrooks & Verdini [2] showed that the selection of \u0394r is a critical choice. They observed that an\nappropriate choice of this parameter is strictly dependent on the objective function F(x), and\nthe appropriate value can be determined by presampling the objective function.\nThe directions in [1] are randomly sampled from the uniform distribution and the step size is\nthe same in each direction. In this way, the feasible region is explored in an isotropic way and\nthe objective function is assumed to behave in the same way in each direction. But this is not\noften the case. The step size to define the next candidate point xk+1 should not be equal for all\nthe directions, but different directions should have different step sizes; i.e. the space should\nbe searched in an anisotropic way. Corana et al. [4] explored the concept of anisotropic search;\nthey proposed a self-tuning simulated annealing algorithm in which the step size is configured\nin order to maintain a number of accepted solutions. At each iteration k, a single variable of\nxk is modified in order to obtain a new candidate point xk+1, and iterations are subdivided\ninto cycles of n iterations during which each variable is modified. The new candidate point is\nobtained from xk in the following form xk+1 = xk + v \u00b7 \u0394ri \u00b7 ei. Where v is a uniform random\nnumber in [\u22121, 1], and \u0394ri is the step size along direction ei of the i-th axis. The anisotropy is\nobtained by choosing different values of \u0394ri for all the directions. The step size is kept fixed\nfor a certain number of cycles of variables, and the fraction of accepted moves in direction ei\nis calculated. If the fraction of accepted moves generated in the same direction is below 0.4,\nthen the step size \u0394ri along ei is decreased. It is assumed that the algorithm is using too large\nsteps along ei thus causing many moves to be rejected. If the fraction is between 0.4 and 0.6\nthe step size is left unchanged. If the fraction is above 0.6 then \u0394ri is increased. It is assumed\nthat the step size is too small thus causing many moves to be accepted.\nThis procedure may not be the best possible to process the different behavior of the objective\nfunction along different axes. Ingber [7] proposed that the random variable should follow a\nCauchy distribution with different sensitivities at different temperatures. The maximum step\nsize is kept constant during the algorithm and it allows escaping from local minima even at\nlow temperatures. The parameter space can have completely different sensitivities for each\ndimension, therefore the use of different temperatures for each dimension is suggested. This\nmethod is often referred to as very fast simulated re-annealing (VFSR) or adaptive simulated\nannealing (ASA). The sensitivity of each parameter is given by the partial derivative of the\nfunction with relation to the i-th dimension [3].\n4 Simulated Annealing \u2013 Advances, Applications and Hybridizations\nAdaptive Neighborhood Heuristics for Simulated Annealing over Continuous Variables 3\n3. Integer objective function with float parameters\nIrregular packing problems arise in the industry whenever one must place multiple items\ninside a container such that there is no collision between the items, while minimizing the\narea occupied by the items. It can be shown that even restricted versions of this problem (for\ninstance, limiting the polygon shape to rectangles only) are NP complete, which means that\nall algorithms currently known for optimal solutions require a number of computational steps\nthat grow exponentially with the problem size rather than according to a polynomial function\n[5]. Usually probabilistic heuristics relax the original constraints of the problem, allowing the\nsearch to go through points outside the space of valid solutions and applying penalization to\ntheir cost. This technique is known as external penalization. The most adopted penalization\nheuristic for external solutions of packing problems is to apply a penalization based on\nthe overlapping area of colliding items. While this heuristic leads to very computationally\nefficient iterations of the optimization process, the layout with objective function in minimum\nvalue may have overlapped items [6].\nFig. 1 shows an example in which the c...",

The proposed algorithm has\ntwo hierarchical levels: core level with a simulated annealing algorithm, and the external level\ncontrolling the container length. The simulated annealing algorithm controls the ordered list of\nitems and the placement of the items.

INTRODUCTION\nCutting and packing are classic problems of finding the\nmost efficient layout for a set of input items out of a\ngiven container with the objective of minimizing the waste\nmaterial. The applications of cutting and packing, e.g.\nclothing, shipbuilding, and furniture industry are numer\u0002ous. W\u00a8ascher et al. (2007) have developed a typology that\nclassifies the nesting problems according to dimension,\nobjective, assortment of item type, as well as the number\nand nature of the container where the items are to be\nallocated. In this paper, we consider the irregular shape\npacking problem, classified as a two-dimensional irregular\nopen dimension problem (ODP).\nThe problem is NP-complete (Fowler et al., 1981) and\nas a result solution methodologies predominantly utilize\nheuristics. Although there are many different solution\napproaches presented in the literature, there appears to\nbe two key strategies for representing and searching the\nsolution space. The first approach represents the solution\nas an ordered list of items and applies a placement rule\nto construct the solution (Babu and Babu, 2001; Gomes\nand Oliveira, 2002; Burke et al., 2007, 2006). The second\napproach represents the solution as a physical layout on\nthe container and moves items within the layout (Bennell\n1 e-mail: andre.kubagawa@gmail.com. This author was partially\nsupported by CNPq.\n2 e-mail: thiago@usp.br. This author was partially supported by\nFAPESP (grant 2009/14699-0).\n3 e-mail: mtsuzuki@usp.br. This author was partially supported by\nCNPq (grant 304258/2007-5) and FAPESP (grant 2009/07173-2).\nand Dowsland, 1999; Gomes and Oliveira, 2006; Egeblad\net al., 2007). The former strategy is dependent on two\ncritical characteristics of the algorithm; the placement rule\nand the placement order of the items.\nWhen irregular shaped items are involved an extra di\u0002mension of complexity is generated by the geometry. The\nno-fit polygon is the principal approach for handling the\ngeometry in cutting and packing problems with irregular\nshaped items (Burke et al., 2007; Bennell and Song, 2008;\nCosta et al., 2009). The no-fit polygon is used to ensure\nfeasible layouts; i.e. layouts where the items do not overlap\nand fit inside the container.\nIn this paper, the solution is represented as an ordered\nlist of items and a constructive heuristic is applied se\u0002quentially. A simulated annealing algorithm controls how\nthe items are ordered in the list and where the items are\nconstructively placed. The proposed algorithm has two\nhierarchical levels. The inner level solves the placement\nproblem where the container has fixed dimensions. The\nexternal level reduces or increases the container dimen\u0002sion that must be minimized. Experiments show that the\nproposed method is very efficient compared with other\npublished methods.\n2. PREVIOUS WORKS\nThe no-fit polygon alone has limited utility in cutting\nand packing problems. Some recent works are using the\ncollision free region to determine feasible layouts in con\u0002tainers with fixed dimensions. Martins and Tsuzuki (2006)\nproposed a constructive heuristic where the collision free\nPreprints of the 18th IFAC World Congress\nMilano (Italy) August 28 - September 2, 2011\nCopyright by the\nInternational Federation of Automatic Control (IFAC)\n3968\nFig. 1. Cost function behavior when the container has fixed\ndimensions. The cost function assumes only discrete\nvalues, while the rotating angle \u03b8 is continuous.\nregion represents feasible placements for a moveable item\nconsidering the already placed items and the container.\nThe cost function is the non occupied area inside the\ncontainer with fixed dimensions. As the non occupied\narea can change only by adding or removing areas of\nitems, the cost function can assume only a finite set of\nvalues, becoming discontinuous (see Fig. 1). A simulated\nannealing algorithm with adaptive neighborhood (Martins\nand Tsuzuki, 2008, 2009a) controls the sequence of items\nand the placement on the collision free region boundary.\nThe collision free region was calculated using regularized\nBoolean operations implemented with limited precision\n(Hobby, 1999).\nMartins and Tsuzuki (2007) combined the simulated an\u0002nealing with deterministic heuristics (larger first and bot\u0002tom left). They showed that it is possible to create problem\ninstances where deterministic heuristics cannot reach the\nlayout associated with the global optimum.\nSato et al. (2010) implemented a robust algorithm to\ndetermine the collision free region with two dimension\nnon manifold Boolean operations. They created a problem\ninstance where the the global optimum can not be reached\nby placing the moveable item exclusively on collision free\nregion vertices. Such situation rarely occurs considering\nstudied and practical problems. They showed several re\u0002sults where the area of the container was exactly equal\nto the total area of the items. The layout associated with\nglobal optimum was reached in averagely 15 times fewer\niterations when compared to previously published results\n(Martins and Tsuzuki, 2009b, 2010) where the area of the\ncontainer was larger than the total area of the items.

NO-FIT POLYGONS AND COLLISION FREE\nREGION\nNo-fit polygons represent set of translations of an item\nand are mathematically represented by a set of vectors.\nFor a better understanding of the properties of the no-fit\npolygons, the set of translations of an item is represented\nby polygons in the plane. Every item has a reference point\nthat can be internal or external to it. The no-fit polygon\nrepresents a set of forbidden translations, as shown in\nFig. 2. For an item P, let i(P) be its interior, \u2202P be its\nboundary and c(P) be its complement.\nFig. 2.

The no-fit polygon induced by item Pi to\nitem Pj , denoted by \u03a5(Pi, Pj ), is the set of translation\nvectors applied to Pj that leads it to a collision with Pi.\nThus,\n\u03a5(Pi, Pj ) = i(Pi) \t i(Pj ) (1)\n= {v | \u2203 a \u2208 i(Pj ), a + v \u2208 i(Pi)}\nThe no-fit polygon can be obtained by the Minkowski\nsum algorithm (Agarwal et al., 2002), that can be calcu\u0002lated very efficiently for convex polygons.

This problem is approached with an heuristic based on Simulated Annealing (SA) with adaptive neighborhood. Traditional \u201cexternal penalization\u201d techniques are avoided through the application of the no\u2013fit polygon, that determinates the collision-free area for each polygon before its placement. The SA controls continuous and discrete parameters. The rotation applied and the translation of the polygon are continuous parameters, and the sequence of placement is represented as a set of discrete parameters. For each non\u2013placed item, a limited depth binary search is performed to find a scale factor that when applied to the item, would allow it to be fitted in the container.\n\n- [Previous article in issue](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1474667015355488)\n- [Next article in issue](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1474667015355506)\n\n## Keywords\n\nSimulated Annealing\n\nPlacement Problems\n\nOptimization\n\nProbabilistic Heuristics\n\n[View PDF](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S147466701535549X/pdf?md5=7bca88c33d2daef044751913b4156e2b&pid=1-s2.0-S147466701535549X-main.pdf)\n\nSpecial issue articlesRecommended articles\n\n## References\n\n01.

The purpose of RPAMP is to ensure maximum use of the materials used in industries and minimize the trim loss. The yield from materials is significant issue. Because a small change in placement can result in a significant reduction in production costs and material savings. In this study, 2D-RPAMP, which is widely seen in the manufacturing industry, has been investigated. The solution approaches have been developed by using heuristic methods such as no-fit polygon and bottom-left fill and metaheuristic method such as Simulated Annealing (SA). In experimental studies, the bottom-left fill method is used for the placement process, no-fit polygon method is used in order to avoid overlapping between the parts placed, and the [SA algorithm](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/mathematics/simulated-annealing-algorithm) is employed for the faster and efficient packing process. As a result of experiments using the hybrid methodology consisting of the [SA algorithm](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/simulated-annealing-algorithm) can reach reasonable level of the trim loss varies that is between 0,21% and 9,1% for most industry. The experimental results show the efficiency of the packing process with hybrid methodology.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe 2D rectangle packing area minimization problem (2D-RPAMP) is the placement of multiple shapes on a broad surface or material without overlapping smoothly. This problem is encountered in a wide range of industries, such as glass (Wei, Zhu, Lim, Liu, & Chen, 2018), steel (Gon\u00e7alves, 2007), paper (Oliveira, Neuenfeldt J\u00fanior, Silva, & Carravilla, 2016), sheet (Leung, Zhang, & Sim, 2011), metal (Valvo, 2017), textile (Thomas & Chaudhari, 2013), leather (\u015eenel, G\u00f6k\u00e7e, Y\u00fcksel, & Yi\u011fit, 2018), apparel (He & Wu, 2013), automotive (Wu et al., 2016), etc. The RPAMP can provide increasing of profitability for many industrial areas by reducing profitaiblity. The main objective is minimizing the trim loss of used materials and placing all parts while fulfilling the constraints specific to problems. The 2D-RPAMP consists two types that are strip packing problem (SPP) and rectangle packing problem (RPP) (Wu et al., 2016). The SSP and RPP are determined as open and two dimensional knapsack problem respectively (W\u00e4scher, Hau\u00dfner, & Schumann, 2007).\n\n2D-RPAMP is widely worked by many researchers. This problem is a kind of numerical optimization problem. Because, 2D-RPAMP doesn\u2019t have exact or analytical mathematical model. Furthermore many un-modeled components affect the optimization process. For this reason, heuristic and meta-heuristic optimization algorithms can be used for increasing yield of the material usage with 2D-RPAMP. The bottom-left (Jakobs, 1996), improved bottom-left (Liu & Teng, 1999) and no-fit polygon (F\u0131rat and Alpaslan, 2019, F\u0131rat et al., 2019) are examples of heuristic algorithms. The genetic algorithms (Thomas & Chaudhari, 2013), simulated annealing (Zhan, Lin, Zhang, & Zhong, 2016), tabu search (Wei, Oon, Zhu, & Lim, 2011), a new artificial bee colony (Topta\u015f & Hanbay, 2019), novel chaotic bat algorithm (Hong, Li, Geng, & Zhang, 2019), dragonfly algorithm (Pant, Han, & Wang, 2019; Z. Zhang & Hong, 2019) and particle swarm optimization (Guo et al., 2016, Kundra and Sadawarti, 2015) are the examples of meta-heuristic algorithms.\n\nThe bottom-left (BL) heuristic algorithm was proposed by Baker, Coffman, and Rivest (1980), and then Chazelle (1983). Jakobs (1996) proposed a genetic algorithm-based methodology to place polygons on a rectangular sheet. The first part is placed in the bottom-left corner of the main part, and parts are moved from the top-right corner of the main part to the bottom-left as far as possible. Hopper and Turton (2001b) investigated the strength of the various packing algorithms, such as simulated annealing (SA), genetic algorithm, naive evolution, hill climbing, and random search. It has been seen that the SA produces better solutions for the absolute majority of test cases. A rapid and novel heuristic recursive algorithm is proposed to find a minimum height is presented by D. Zhang, Kang, and Deng (2006). E. K. Burke, Kendall, and Whitwell (2004) and Edmund K. Burke, Kendall, and Whitwell (2009) demonstrated that by combining bottom-left-fill and simulated annealing algorithms with best-fit heuristic methods will increase the solution quality of packing process. A novel heuristic approach is proposed based on two essential concepts, which are named the corner-occupying action and caving degree by Huang, Chen, and Xu (2007). A novel heuristic recursive structure combined with branch-and-bound techniques based method is proposed by Cui, Yang, Cheng, and Song (2008). The effectiveness of the packing processes is evaluated according to a specific fitness function after the packing is performed with heuristic methods. In many RPAMP, height or trim loss is usually utilized as fitness value. It is quite challenging to find the right set of input parameters required for packing problems. Accordingly, it is known that meta-heuristic algorithms are sufficient to find the optimal solution with a smart search procedure (V...",

In the past, very large combinatorial optimization problems have been solved using this technique. It has also been shown that this method is effective in obtaining close-to-optimal solutions for problems known to be NP complete. Further, this technique is applicable to a whole class of problems that satisfy a few requirements.\n\nThe purpose of this paper is to illustrate an efficient version of the simulated annealing method as applied to a variant of the bin-packing problem. The computational complexity of the method is linear in input size similar to various well-known heuristic methods for the problem. The solutions obtained, however, are much better than any of the heuristic methods. The particular variant of the bin-packing problem we consider has several practical applications such as static task allocation in process scheduling and batch processing. At the time of this writing, we have not yet seen a stochastic solution to the bin-packing problem in the literature.\n\nOne of the distinguishing features of our research is the high quality of solutions obtained by our method. Extensive simulation experiments we have carried out show that the solutions obtained by the stochastic method show a significant improvement over those obtained by any of the well-known heuristic methods.\n\n- [Previous article in issue](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0898122194900760)\n- [Next article in issue](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0898122194900787)\n\n## Keywords\n\nBin-Packing\n\nCombinatorial optimization\n\nGlobal minimum\n\nMonte Carlo methods\n\nNP completeness\n\nSimulated annealing\n\nStatistical cooling\n\n[View PDF](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0898122194900779/pdf?md5=30492ae375a8dc570527f689a4f3bffb&pid=1-s2.0-0898122194900779-main.pdf)\n\nRecommended articles\n\n## References\n\n01.

High material utilization is of particular interest to mass production industries since small improvements of the layout can result in large savings of material and considerably reduce production cost. In this work the Simulated Annealing is combined with deterministic heuristics (larger first (LF), bottom left (BL) and translations only (Tr)) and compared. The rotational generic approach has discrete (sequence of placement) and continuous (angle and position) parameters. It is very important to notice that the cost function (non occupied space) has only discrete values.\n\n- [Previous article in issue](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1474667016340174)\n- [Next article in issue](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1474667016340198)\n\n## Keywords\n\nComputer vision\n\nmatched filter\n\ninvariant mapping\n\n[View PDF](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1474667016340186/pdf?md5=8b357149307a0ecbdb40b0d6add2590e&pid=1-s2.0-S1474667016340186-main.pdf)\n\nSpecial issue articlesRecommended articles\n\n## References\n\n01.

The hybrid simulated annealing algorithm uses the modified penalty algorithm to generate an initial solution and then improves it using simulated annealing. It is tested on single-row layout problems with facilities of unequal area and multi-row layout problems with facilities of equal area. The algorithm produced solutions better than those previously reported in the literature for two of the larger single-row problems and five multi-row layout problems. For all the other single-row problems and eight of ten multi-row layout test problems, it produced the best known solutions. The hybrid simulated annealing algorithm appears to produce better quality solutions than the simulated annealing and tabu navigation algorithms, but requires more computation time than simulated annealing.\n\nSpecial issue articlesRecommended articles\n\n- R.E.

Many heuristic algorithms can apply the 2-opt local search to find better solutions. In complete 2-opt local search, every valid neighboring solutions of swapping mechanism will be compared, which is very time consuming especially when a sequential algorithm is adopted. Nowadays, graphic processing units (GPUs) have evolved into powerful and flexible parallel computation platforms that have been widely used to accelerate the solving of NP-hard problems. Therefore, in this study, we focus on how to use GPUs to solve the single-row facility layout problem (SRFLP) with the 2-opt-based simulated annealing (SA) heuristic algorithm. As far as we know, this study is the first to solve SRFLP by using a GPU. After analyzing the fitness function and the move gains calculation between parent and child solutions, we propose a prefix-sum formula table to eliminate a large amount of replicated computation. To calculate move gains for the 2-opt local search during each iteration, many GPU threads are created and they construct and lookup the table in parallel. According to experimental results, if the prefix-sum formula table is not adopted, the GPU version outperforms the sequential CPU counterpart with the best speedup of 123. However, if the table is used in the GPU version, the best speedup can reach up to 3208. Because the proposed parallelization approach with the prefix-sum formula table is based on the features of the 2-opt local search and the SRFLP fitness function, it can be applied to any 2-opt-based heuristic algorithm for solving SRFLP even though the SA algorithm is used in this study.\n\n- ### [A GRASP algorithm for solving large-scale single row facility layout problems](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305054819300486)\n\n\n\n2019, Computers and Operations Research\n\n\n\nShow abstract\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe single-row facility layout problem (SRFLP) is an NP-hard problem, which consists of arranging facilities along a straight line in order to minimize the weighted sum of distances between all pairs of facilities. In this paper, an implementation of the Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP) meta-heuristic is presented to solve large-scale instances of the problem. The novelty of the proposed implementation is that it is endowed with a diversification phase based on frequency memory. The algorithm was tested on 93 instances with sizes up to one thousand facilities. To date, in the literature, there is only one work, which has considered instances of such magnitude. Computational experiments demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm, which improved the best-known values for 29 out of 93 instances.\n\n- ### [Mathematical modeling and multi-start search simulated annealing for unequal-area facility layout problem](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417417305274)\n\n\n\n2018, Expert Systems with Applications\n\n\n\nShow abstract\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this paper, a mixed integer nonlinear programming model (MINLP) is ...",
