This is highly likely to be optimal due to the tree's triangular shape (interlocking).\n- **Strategy:**\n    1.  Optimize the \"Unit Cell\" (1 or 2 trees) to minimize area.\n    2.  Variables: Rotation $\\theta$, Lattice vectors $\\vec{v}_1, \\vec{v}_2$.\n    3.  Generate $N$ trees using this lattice.\n    4.  Crop/adjust the lattice to fit a square aspect ratio.\n\n### 2.

Santa needs the dimensions of the smallest possible square box that fits shipments of between 1-200 trees. \n\n**The Goal**\n\nFind the optimal packing solution to help Santa this season and win Rudolph's attention by being one of the first to post your solution! \n\nHappy packing!  \n\n## Evaluation\n\nSubmissions are evaluated on sum of the normalized area of the square bounding box for each puzzle. For each `n`-tree configuration, the side `s` of square box bounding the trees is squared and divided by the total number `n` of trees in the configuration. The final score is the sum of all configurations. Refer to the [metric notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/metric/santa-2025-metric) for exact implementation details.\n\n$$ \\text{score} = \\sum_{n=1}^{N} \\frac{s_{n}^2}{n}$$\n\n## Submission File\nFor each `id` in the submission (representing a single tree in a `n`-tree configuration), you must report the tree position given by `x`, `y`, and the rotation given by `deg`. To avoid loss of precision when saving and reading the files, the values must be converted to a string and prepended with an `s` before submission. Submissions with any overlapping trees will throw an error. To avoid extreme leaderboard scores, location values must be constrained to \\\\(-100 \\le x, y \\le 100\\\\).\n\nThe file should contain a header and have the following format:\n\n    id,x,y,deg\n    001_0,s0.0,s0.0,s20.411299\n    002_0,s0.0,s0.0,s20.411299\n    002_1,s-0.541068,s0.259317,s51.66348\n    etc.\n\n## Timeline\n\n* **November 17, 2025** - Start Date.\n\n* **January 23, 2026** - Entry Deadline. You must accept the competition rules before this date in order to compete.\n\n* **January 23, 2026** - Team Merger Deadline. This is the last day participants may join or merge teams.\n\n* **January 30, 2026** - Final Submission Deadline.\n\nAll deadlines are at 11:59 PM UTC on the corresponding day unless otherwise noted. The competition organizers reserve the right to update the contest timeline if they deem it necessary.\n\n## data-description\n\nThe objective of this challenge is to arrange Christmas tree toys into the smallest packing arrangement possible&mdash;as defined by the size of a square bounding box around the trees&mdash;for toy counts of 1-200.\n\n## Files\n\n**sample_submission.csv** - a sample submission in the correct format\n - `id` - a combination of the `n`-tree count for the puzzle and the individual tree index within the puzzle\n - `x`, `y` - the 2-d coordinates of the tree; this point is defined at the center of the top of the trunk\n - `deg` - the rotation angle of the tree\n\n\nThis [Getting Started Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/inversion/santa-2025-getting-started) implements a basic greedy algorithm (which was used to construct the `sample_submission.csv`), demonstrates collision detection, and provides a visualization function.\n\n**Note:** The [metric](https://www.kaggle.com/code/metric/santa-2025-metric) for this competition has been designed to reasonably maximize floating point precision during calculations, but cannot guarantee precision beyond what is displayed on the leaderboard.\n\n## Prizes\n\n- First Prize: $12,000\n- Second Prize: $10,000\n- Third Prize: $10,000\n- Fourth Prize: $8,000\n\n**Rudolph Prize** - $10,000: Awarded to the team holding 1st place on the leaderboard for the longest period of time between November 17, 2025 12:00 AM UTC and January 30, 2026 11:59 PM UTC. In the event the competition needs to be restarted, the Rudolph Prize dates shall be the new start and deadline of the competition.\n\nAs a condition to being awarded a Prize, a Prize winner must provide a detailed write-up on their solution in the competition forums within 14 days of the conclusion of the competition.\n\n",

The values are strings prefixed with `s`.\n\nThe strategy suggests starting with a baseline. Since I don't have the tree geometry yet, I need to define it. The problem description mentions \"Christmas Tree toys\". I suspect the geometry is defined in a notebook or I need to infer it. Wait, the description says \"identical irregular polygons\". It doesn't give the vertices.\n\nHowever, the strategy mentions: \"The kernel uses `shapely.strtree.STRtree`\". And \"Tree shape has 'tiers'\".\n\nI need to find where the tree geometry is defined. It's likely in a \"Getting Started\" notebook or similar. The description mentions: \"This [Getting Started Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/inversion/santa-2025-getting-started) implements a basic greedy algorithm\".\n\nI don't have internet access to download the notebook. But usually, the data folder contains all necessary files. I only see `description.md` and `sample_submission.csv`.\n\nIs it possible the tree geometry is hardcoded in the sample submission or I need to reverse engineer it? No, that's unlikely.\n\nWait, looking at the `sample_submission.csv` again. It just has positions.\n\nLet me check if there are any other files. `ls -R /home/data` only showed those two.\n\nMaybe the tree geometry is standard? Or maybe I can extract it from the `sample_submission.csv` if I assume the trees in the sample submission are valid and non-overlapping? No, that's too hard.\n\nLet me check `session_state.json` again. It mentions \"The kernel uses...\". This implies there might be a kernel I can reference. But I can only read files in `/home/code` or `/home/data`.\n\nAh, I missed something. \"Reference existing notebooks - The strategy will mention which notebooks to read\". The strategy mentions `exploration/eda.ipynb`. I should check if that exists.\n\nLet me list files in `/home/code`. maybe there are pre-existing notebooks there.]"

This is the most critical step for large N, which dominates the score (since score is sum of s^2/n, and s^2 grows with n). Wait, score is $\\sum s_n^2/n$. Area $A \\approx n \\cdot \\text{Area}_{tree}$. $s^2 \\approx A$. So $s_n^2/n \\approx \\text{Area}_{tree}$. The term is constant-ish. So all N are equally important?\nActually, $s^2$ is the area of the bounding box. $s^2/n$ is the area per tree. Minimizing this is maximizing packing density.\nSince we sum over $n=1..200$, improving density for any $n$ helps. But for large $n$, boundary effects matter less, so lattice packing is more effective. For small $n$, boundary effects dominate.\n\nI will start with the Lattice Search as requested by the strategy.\n\nI need to define the tree polygon in the notebook. I'll use `shapely`.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  Create `experiments/lattice_optimization.ipynb`.\n2.  Define `Tree` class/functions using `shapely`.\n3.  Implement a function to calculate density of a lattice defined by vectors $v_1, v_2$ and rotations.\n    -   Since it's a square box problem, we might want a rectangular lattice that can be cropped to a square.\n    -   Or just finding the densest periodic packing (hexagonal-like) and then fitting it.\n    -   The strategy says: \"Optimize the 'Unit Cell' (1 or 2 trees) to minimize area.\"\n4.  Use `scipy.optimize.minimize` to find optimal lattice vectors and rotations.\n    -   Variables: $v_{1x}, v_{1y}, v_{2x}, v_{2y}$ (lattice vectors), $\\theta_1, \\theta_2$ (rotations).\n    -   Constraint: No overlap.\n    -   Objective: Minimize determinant of lattice basis (area of unit cell).\n\nLet's refine the \"Unit Cell\" optimization.\nIf we have a double lattice (2 trees per cell), we have trees at $(0,0)$ with $\\theta_1$ and $(dx, dy)$ with $\\theta_2$. The lattice vectors are $\\vec{a}, \\vec{b}$.\nWe want to minimize $|\\vec{a} \\times \\vec{b}|$.\nSubject to:\n- Tree 1 at $(0,0)$ doesn't overlap with Tree 2 at $(dx, dy) + i\\vec{a} + j\\vec{b}$.\n- Tree 1 doesn't overlap with Tree 1 at $i\\vec{a} + j\\vec{b}$ (except $(0,0)$).\n- Tree 2 doesn't overlap with Tree 2 at $i\\vec{a} + j\\vec{b}$ (except $(0,0)$).\n\nThis seems complex to optimize directly with gradients because \"overlap\" is non-differentiable (boolean).\nHowever, we can use the \"No-Fit Polygon\" concept implicitly or use a penalty method.\nOr, simpler: Fix the rotation (e.g., 0 and 180), and just optimize the spacing.\nThe strategy suggests: \"Inverted trees (180 deg) likely fit into the gaps of upright trees.\"\n\nLet's try a grid search or simple optimization for:\n- Case 1: All trees 0 deg. Lattice vectors $(dx, 0)$ and $(shift, dy)$. (Row shift).\n- Case 2: Trees 0 and 180 deg alternating.\n\nI'll create the notebook to explore this.]"

Or just use the lattice and crop it?\n    -   For N=1, just place at (0,0).\n    -   For N=2, place optimally.\n    -   The strategy says \"SA Solver for N=1..50\".\n2.  **Large N (51-200):** Use the optimized lattice.\n    -   Generate a large grid of the lattice.\n    -   Find a square crop that contains exactly N trees.\n    -   Or generate slightly more than N trees in a square-ish shape, and pick the best N.\n    -   Actually, we need to pack N trees into the *smallest square*.\n    -   So we should generate a lattice patch that is roughly square and contains >= N trees.\n    -   Then take the best N trees (closest to center?) and compute the bounding box.\n    -   Then shrink the box until it hits the trees.\n\n**Implementation Plan:**\nI'll create a submission script `experiments/generate_baseline.ipynb`.\nIt will:\n1.  Define the best lattice parameters found.\n2.  For each N:\n    -   Generate a large lattice patch.\n    -   Select N trees that form the most \"square-like\" cluster.\n    -   Center them.\n    -   Compute bounding box side $s$.\n    -   Store result.\n3.  For very small N (1-10), maybe hardcode or use a simple greedy placement.\n    -   Actually, the sample submission has valid placements. I should check if my lattice is better than sample submission for large N.\n    -   Sample submission score? I don't know it. But I can calculate it if I evaluate the sample submission.\n    -   I'll stick to generating my own.\n\n**Refining \"Select N trees\":**\n-   Generate a grid of $M \\times M$ unit cells where $2 \\cdot M \\cdot M \\approx N$.\n-   Actually, generate a large cloud.\n-   Sort trees by distance from center.\n-   Take first N.\n-   This tends to form a circle. We want a square.\n-   Sort trees by Chebyshev distance ($max(|x|, |y|)$) from center? Yes, that forms a square.\n-   Take first N.\n-   Compute bounding box.\n\n**Handling Rotation:**\n-   The lattice uses 0 and 180.\n-   The problem requires `deg` in string format.\n\nI'll create the submission notebook.]"

      "strategy": "# Seed Prompt: Santa 2025 Tree Packing\n\n## Problem Definition\n- **Goal:** Pack $n$ identical irregular polygons (\"Christmas Trees\") into the smallest square box.\n- **Instances:** $n = 1$ to $200$.\n- **Metric:** Minimize $\\sum_{n=1}^{200} \\frac{s_n^2}{n}$.\n- **Key Characteristic:** All items are **IDENTICAL**. This enables specific \"Lattice Packing\" techniques.\n\n## Top Approaches\n\n### 1. Lattice Packing (Periodic Packing) - CRITICAL for Large $N$\nSince trees are identical, the optimal packing in the limit ($N \\to \\infty$) is a periodic lattice.\n- **Single-Lattice:** All trees have rotation $\\theta$. Placed at $i \\cdot \\vec{v}_1 + j \\cdot \\vec{v}_2$.\n- **Double-Lattice:** Trees alternate rotations (e.g., $\\theta$ and $\\theta + 180^\\circ$). This is highly likely to be optimal due to the tree's triangular shape (interlocking).\n- **Strategy:**\n    1.  Optimize the \"Unit Cell\" (1 or 2 trees) to minimize area.\n    2.  Variables: Rotation $\\theta$, Lattice vectors $\\vec{v}_1, \\vec{v}_2$.\n    3.  Generate $N$ trees using this lattice.\n    4.  Crop/adjust the lattice to fit a square aspect ratio.\n\n### 2. Global Optimization (Small/Medium $N$)\n- **Simulated Annealing (SA):**\n    -   State: Positions $(x_i, y_i)$ and Rotations $\\theta_i$.\n    -   Moves: Translate single tree, Rotate single tree, Swap two trees.\n    -   Objective: Minimize bounding box + Penalty for overlap.\n    -   Cooling: Slow cooling allows settling into dense configurations.\n- **Guided Local Search (GLS):** Penalize specific overlaps to force the solver to explore new configurations.\n\n### 3. Physics-Based \"Shaking\" (Refinement)\n- **Jostle Heuristic:**\n    -   Apply \"gravity\" towards the center.\n    -   Resolve overlaps by moving trees apart (repulsion).\n    -   Iterate until stable.\n    -   Use this to \"tighten\" a loose lattice packing into a square box.\n\n## Technical Implementation\n- **Collision Detection:** The kernel uses `shapely.strtree.STRtree`. This is efficient enough for $N=200$. Stick with it.\n- **No-Fit Polygon (NFP):** Conceptually useful for understanding valid placements, but exact computation might be complex. Use `STRtree` for practical collision checking.\n- **Precision:** Use `Decimal` as in the kernel to avoid floating point errors, or high-precision float libraries if performance allows.\n\n## Recommended Experiments\n1.  **Lattice Search:** Write a script to find the optimal density for:\n    -   Same rotation (0 deg).\n    -   Alternating rotation (0 and 180 deg).\n    -   Free rotation (optimize $\\theta$).\n2.  **SA Solver:** Implement a Simulated Annealing solver using `shapely` to solve for $N=1..50$ where boundary effects dominate.\n3.  **Hybrid:** For $N=51..200$, generate a lattice patch, then compress it using the \"Jostle\" method.\n\n## Data Insights\n- Tree shape has \"tiers\". Interlocking is key.\n- Inverted trees (180 deg) likely fit into the gaps of upright trees.\n- The problem asks for a *square* box, so we must arrange the lattice to form a square (e.g., $\\sqrt{N} \\times \\sqrt{N}$ grid).\n",
