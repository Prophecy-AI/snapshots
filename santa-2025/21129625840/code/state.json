      "finding": "Packing irregular polygons into the smallest possible container is a classic NP\u2011hard problem, so most practical approaches rely on either exact branch\u2011and\u2011bound schemes or on approximation/heuristic methods that give good solutions quickly.  For convex polygons without rotation, recent work provides polynomial\u2011time algorithms with provably better approximation ratios than earlier results, using height\u2011based sorting and shelf\u2011packing ideas to handle area, perimeter, strip\u2011 and bin\u2011packing objectives\u202f([arxiv](https://export.arxiv.org/pdf/2308.08523v1.pdf)).  When rotations are allowed and the pieces are truly irregular, exact methods such as the branch\u2011and\u2011bound algorithm of Agarwal\u202fet\u202fal. systematically explore placement trees and prune infeasible branches, delivering optimal solutions for modest instance sizes\u202f([ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0925527313001692)).\n\nFor larger industrial instances, the most effective strategies combine a fast constru",
