      "query": "What are the best algorithms for packing irregular polygons into a minimal container?",
      "finding": "Packing irregular polygons into the smallest possible container is a classic NP\u2011hard problem, so most practical approaches rely on either exact branch\u2011and\u2011bound schemes or on approximation/heuristic methods that give good solutions quickly.  For convex polygons without rotation, recent work provides polynomial\u2011time algorithms with provably better approximation ratios than earlier results, using height\u2011based sorting and shelf\u2011packing ideas to handle area, perimeter, strip\u2011 and bin\u2011packing objectives\u202f([arxiv](https://export.arxiv.org/pdf/2308.08523v1.pdf)).  When rotations are allowed and the pieces are truly irregular, exact methods such as the branch\u2011and\u2011bound algorithm of Agarwal\u202fet\u202fal. systematically explore placement trees and prune infeasible branches, delivering optimal solutions for modest instance sizes\u202f([ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0925527313001692)).\n\nFor larger industrial instances, the most effective strategies combine a fast constru",

      "finding": "Packing identical non\u2011convex polygons is usually tackled by first converting the geometric relationship between two pieces into a **No\u2011Fit Polygon (NFP)**, which encodes all relative placements that avoid overlap.  Once the NFP is available, the layout problem can be searched with powerful meta\u2011heuristics\u2014most notably evolutionary algorithms or ant\u2011colony methods\u2014that explore the combinatorial space of translations (and optionally rotations) while respecting the NFP constraints.  Burke and Kendall\u2019s recent work combines a robust NFP construction with a meta\u2011heuristic/evolutionary search and reports state\u2011of\u2011the\u2011art results on benchmark nesting instances of identical non\u2011convex shapes\u3010link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-0-85729-345-9_17.pdf\u3011.  \n\nA key prerequisite for this approach is a fast, reliable NFP generator that handles degenerate cases such as holes, interlocking concavities, and jigsaw\u2011type pieces.  The \u201corbital\u201d method introduced by Burke\u202fet\u202fal. provides exactly that: i",
