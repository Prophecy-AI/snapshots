      "text": "Packing identical non\u2011convex polygons is usually tackled by first converting the geometric relationship between two pieces into a **No\u2011Fit Polygon (NFP)**, which encodes all relative placements that avoid overlap.  Once the NFP is available, the layout problem can be searched with powerful meta\u2011heuristics\u2014most notably evolutionary algorithms or ant\u2011colony methods\u2014that explore the combinatorial space of translations (and optionally rotations) while respecting the NFP constraints.  Burke and Kendall\u2019s recent work combines a robust NFP construction with a meta\u2011heuristic/evolutionary search and reports state\u2011of\u2011the\u2011art results on benchmark nesting instances of identical non\u2011convex shapes\u3010link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-0-85729-345-9_17.pdf\u3011.  \n\nA key prerequisite for this approach is a fast, reliable NFP generator that handles degenerate cases such as holes, interlocking concavities, and jigsaw\u2011type pieces.  The \u201corbital\u201d method introduced by Burke\u202fet\u202fal. provides exactly that: it builds NFPs in two simple geometric stages, works for all irregular shapes, and scales to dozens of benchmark problems\u3010www.graham-kendall.com/papers/bhkw2007.pdf\u3011.  An alternative that has also shown good performance is the **two\u2011level algorithm with a collision\u2011free region**; it first identifies large safe zones on the sheet and then refines placements within those zones using a local search, offering a deterministic constructive heuristic for irregular polygons\u3010www.academia.edu/104990563/IRREGULAR_PLACEMENT_PROBLEM_Solved_with_a_2_Level_Algorithm_and_Collision_Free_Region\u3011.  \n\nIn practice, the best\u2011performing strategy for identical non\u2011convex polygons today is to generate accurate NFPs with the orbital technique and then drive a population\u2011based meta\u2011heuristic (e.g., evolutionary algorithm) to explore feasible packings.  This combination balances computational efficiency with the ability to navigate the highly non\u2011convex search space, and it consistently outperforms earlier pure\u2011constructive or simple heuristic methods on standard nesting benchmarks.",

A link will be provided\nin a future version of this document.\narXiv:2308.08523v1 [cs.CG] 16 Aug 2023\n2 Improved Approximations for Translational Packing of Convex Polygons\n1 Introduction\nMany real-life situations require us to make decisions about optimally packing a collection\nof objects into a specific container. One particular category of these packing problems is\ntwo-dimensional packing, which is encountered in everyday scenarios like arranging items\non a shelf and in industrial applications such as cutting cookies from rolled-out dough\nor manufacturing sets of tiles from standard-sized panels made of wood, glass, or metal.\nAnother intriguing example involves cutting fabric pieces for clothing production. In this\ncase, the pieces often cannot be rotated freely, as they must adhere to a desired pattern\nin the final product, which is tailored of multiple elements. The widespread applicability\nof two-dimensional packing problems has led to a surge of interest in designing efficient\nalgorithms to address them. In this paper, we follow the line of research and study the\nproblem of packing convex polygons without rotations in various settings depending on the\ntype of containers used.\nPast research focusing on theoretical considerations of two-dimensional packings mainly\nconcentrates on the scenario when all objects are axis-parallel rectangles. In this paper, we\nwill discuss packing without rotations, in which only translations are permitted. There are\ntwo main classes of the problem depending on whether the size of the container is fixed and\nwe want to minimize the number of containers used or whether we want to minimize the\ncontainer\u2019s size with respect to some objective function.\nA seminal example of the first class is the Geometric Bin Packing problem in which\na number of unit size squared bins to pack is to be minimized. The problem is arguably\nthe most natural generalization of the regular (1D) Bin Packing to two dimensions, and\nits absolute approximability has been fully understood. Unless P = N P, the best possible\nefficient constant factor approximation is 2 [15], and such an algorithm is known [10].\nIn the second class, there are several variants to be considered. An example is the\nStrip Packing Problem which is concerned with packing objects into a strip of width\n1 and infinite height in such a way that the maximum of all the heights of the placed\nobjects is minimized. Like Geometric Bin Packing, Strip Packing generalizes (1D)\nBin Packing. The best known efficient constant factor approximation for Strip Packing\nhas approximation factor (5/3 + \u03f5) [9]. It is known that there can not exist a polynomial\ntime algorithm with an approximation ratio of (3/2 \u2212 \u03f5) for any \u03f5 > 0 unless P = N P, which\nfollows directly from the approximation hardness of (1D) Bin Packing. Both classes of\nproblems have been also considered in the asymptotic setting, see e.g. [11, 5, 12].\nIn younger time, there was also an increase of interest in cases where the objects in\nquestion are general convex polygons. Alt, de Berg and Knauer [2, 3] considered the problem\nof packing an instance consisting of a number of convex polygons of the form p \u2282 [0, 1]2into\na minimum area axis-parallel rectangular container. We refer to this problem as Polygon\nArea Minimization throughout this paper. In the special case where the instance consists\nof rectangles only, the problem is known to admit a PTAS [4]. They proved the existence of\nthe following efficient algorithm:\nA 23.78-approximation for Polygon Area Minimization.\nRecently, Aamand, Abrahamsen, Beretta and Kleist [1] showed that the algorithm of Alt,\nde Berg and Knauer can be leveraged to obtain also efficient approximation algorithms of\nfurther problems:\nA 7-approximation for Polygon Perimeter Minimization.\nA 51-approximation for Polygon Strip Packing.\nAn 11-approximation for Polygon Bin Packing for polygons with diameter at most 1\n10 .\nA. Kurpisz and S. Suter 3\n1.1 Our results\nThe results of Alt, de Berg and Knauer [2, 3] and Aamand et al. [1] are heavily based on\nso-called shelf packing algorithms. In shelf packing algorithms, the objects are first placed\non the shelves, possibly ordered by height, which are later stacked on one another to build\na final solution. Compared to axis-parallel rectangles, the main challenge in designing an\napproximation algorithm for polygon packing problems is that objects cannot be sorted by\nheight and orientation simultaneously. As a result, the algorithm and its analysis in [2, 3]\nhave such a large approximation guarantee. In this paper, we provide new insight into how\nshelf packing algorithms should be applied to polygon packing problems. We introduce a\nsequence of transformations of the objects that allow us first to sort them by height and later\nby orientation to build a solution of a much better approximation guarantee. More precisely,\nwe design polynomial-time algorithms with the following factors:\nA 9.45-approximation for Polygon Area Minimization.\nUsing this algorithm as a subroutine, we build upon the methods from Aamand et al. [1] to\nobtain the following efficient approximation algorithms:\nA (3.75 + \u03f5)-approximation for Polygon Perimeter Minimization.\nA 21.89-approximation for Polygon Strip Packing.\nA 5.09-approximation for Polygon Bin Packing for polygons which have their diameter\nbounded by 1\n10 .\nThe results are proved in Sections 4, 5, 6, and 7 respectively. Furthermore, in Section 8\nwe show the following results, which make progress towards solving an open question of a\nO(1)-approximation algorithm for Polygon Bin Packing for arbitrary polygons.\nThere is an efficient O(\n1\n\u03b4\n)-approximation algorithm for Polygon Bin Packing for\ninstances where each polygon has width or height at most 1 \u2212 \u03b4.\nThere is an efficient O(1)-approximation algorithm for Polygon Bin Packing for\ninstances with the property that all polygons share a spine (up to translation) with height\nat least 3\n4\n.\n2 Preliminaries\nWe start out considerations by recalling a classical and well-known problem in theoretical\ncomputer science, the Bin Packing problem: Given a list of numbers s1, . . . , sn \u2208 (0, 1] \u2229 Q,\nrepresenting the sizes of n objects, the goal is to find the minimum number of bins of size 1,\nso that we can pac...",

In addition, we present efficient approximation algorithms for special cases of the Polygon Bin Packing problem, progressing toward solving an open question concerning an O(1)-approximation algorithm for arbitrary polygons.\n Comments: This is the full version of the same-named paper which will be presented at ESA 2023 conference\n Subjects: Computational Geometry (cs.CG)  \n MSC classes: 68Q25  \n ACM classes: F.2.2  \n Cite as: arXiv:2308.08523 [cs.CG]  \n (or arXiv:2308.08523v1 [cs.CG] for this version) \n https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2308.08523 \n Focus to learn more  \n arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite \n \n\n Submission history\n\n From: Silvan Suter [view email]\n [v1] Wed, 16 Aug 2023 17:20:46 UTC (2,689 KB)\n Full-text links:\n\n Access Paper:\n\n Download a PDF of the paper titled Improved Approximations for Translational Packing of Convex Polygons, by Adam Kurpisz and Silvan Suter\n * Download PDF\n * PostScript\n * Other Formats\n (view license)\n Current browse context:\n cs.CG\n < prev | next >\n new | recent | 2308\n Change to browse by:\n cs\n\n References & Citations\n\n * NASA ADS\n * Google Scholar\n * Semantic Scholar\n a export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n BibTeX formatted citation\n\n \u00d7\n loading...\n Data provided by:\n\n Bookmark\n\n Bibliographic Tools\n\n Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\n Bibliographic Explorer Toggle\n Bibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n Litmaps Toggle\n Litmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n scite.ai Toggle\n scite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n Code, Data, Media\n\n Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\n Links to Code Toggle\n CatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n DagsHub Toggle\n DagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n Links to Code Toggle\n Papers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n ScienceCast Toggle\n ScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n Demos\n\n Demos\n\n Replicate Toggle\n Replicate (What is Replicate?)\n Spaces Toggle\n Hugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n Related Papers\n\n Recommenders and Search Tools\n\n Link to Influence Flower\n Influence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n Connected Papers Toggle\n Connected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n Core recommender toggle\n CORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n About arXivLabs\n\n arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\n arXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\n Both individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\n Have an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

The container has a fixed width, while its length can change so that all items are placed in it. The objective is to find a layout of the set of polygons that minimizes the length of the container. The proposed algorithm constructively creates layouts from an ordered list of items and a placement heuristic. The placement determines the collision free region (represents the set of translations to create a feasible layout) for the item to be placed. It is shown that the collision free region must be calculated using non-regularized Boolean operations, as contours of no-fit polygons should be ignored. The proposed algorithm to solve the placement problem has two levels, in the internal level the container has fixed dimensions, and the external level reduces or increases the variable dimension. The placement heuristic searches for degenerated vertices and edges as they represent local maximum compaction. Computational comparisons on benchmark problems show that the proposed algorithm generated highly competitive solutions. Moreover, our algorithm updated some best known results.\n...Read more\n## Key takeaways\n![sparkles](https://a.academia-assets.com/images/icons/sparkle.svg)\nAI\n1.

This problem is approached with an heuristic based on simulated annealing. Traditional &quot;external penalization&quot; techniques are avoided through the application of the no-fit polygon, that determinates the collision-free region for each small item before its placement. The simulated annealing controls: the rotation applied and the placement of the small item. For each non-placed small item, a limited depth binary search is performed to find a scale factor that when applied to the small item, would allow it to be fitted in the large object. Three possibilities to define the sequence on which the small items are placed are studied: larger-first, random permutation and weight sorted. The proposed algorithm is suited for non-convex small items and large objects.\ndownloadDownload free PDF[View PDFchevron\\_right](https://www.academia.edu/58884840/Rotational_Placement_of_Irregular_Polygons_over_Containers_with_Fixed_Dimensions_using_Simulated_Annealing_and_No_Fit_Polygons)\n[An effective heuristic for the two-dimensional irregular bin packing problem](https://www.academia.edu/69875946/An_effective_heuristic_for_the_two_dimensional_irregular_bin_packing_problem)\n[Gabriela Ochoa](https://independent.academia.edu/GabrielaOchoa10)\nAnnals of Operations Research, 2013\nThis paper proposes an adaptation, to the two-dimensional irregular bin packing problem of the Djang and Finch heuristic (DJD), originally designed for the one-dimensional bin packing problem.

Therefore, DJD as a selection heuristic has to be paired with a placement heuristic to completely construct a solution to the underlying packing problem.

In this problem, one is given a number of rectangular sheets and an order for a specified number of each of certain types of two-dimensional regular and irregular shapes. The aim is to cut the shapes out of the sheets in such a way as to minimize the amount of waste produced. A two-stage solution is proposed in which the problem is converted from one of placing irregularly shaped pieces to one of allocating rectangular modules. The clustering algorithm used in the first stage to produce rectangular modules is presented and the results obtained when it was applied to some typical layout problems are described.\nRecommended articles\n## References(11)\n* M.Adamowicz### The optimum two-dimensional allocation of irregular, multiple-connected shapes with linear, logical and geometric constraints\n* M.J.Haims*et al.*### A multistage solution of the template layout problem\n### IEEE Transactions on System Science and Cybernetics\n(1970)\n* M.Adamowicz*et al.*### A two-stage solution of the cutting stock problem\n* H.Freeman### Computer processing of line drawing images\n### Comput.

A particular case of the nesting problem occurs when congruent copies of one single shape have to fill, as much as possible, a limited sheet. Traditional approaches to the nesting problem have difficulty to tackle with high number of pieces to place. Additionally, if the orientation of the given shape is not a constraint, the general nesting approaches are not particularly successful. This problem arises in practice in several industrial contexts such as footwear, metalware and furniture. A possible approach is the periodic placement of the shapes, in a lattice way. In this paper, we propose three heuristic approaches to solve this particular case of nesting problems. Experimental results are compared with published results in literature and additional results obtained from new instances are also provided.\n## Introduction\nNesting has been widely studied (Dowsland and Dowsland, 1992), as it is a common problem in several industrial production processes (textile, garment, footwear, metalware, furniture, etc.). Most of the published papers impose orientation constraints: the shape can only be rotated a predetermined number of fixed angles (the most common is 180\u00b0 and, less commonly, 90\u00b0) or it cannot be rotated at all. However, in certain particular cases, orientation constraints do not arise. Additionally, some industries frequently need to cut big quantities of each type of shape. In these two situations, the periodic packing of the shapes (lattice packing) proved to be a very competitive approach, because:\n* \u2013good cutting patterns, with very small waste, can be obtained;\n* \u2013the automatic cutting process is more efficient when a periodic placement is considered;\n* \u2013reduced computational time (when compared with general nesting approaches, where each piece has to be treated individually), which allows to tackle problems of greater dimension.\nIn this section, we start by describing the problem and refer to related works in a brief review. In Section 2, we point out the geometric considerations necessary to understand this work. Section 3 describes the underlying rules and criteria used to build the three heuristic approaches, which are proposed in the fourth section. In Section 5, the instances used to evaluate the quality of the proposed approaches are defined and the results obtained with all the three heuristics are presented and compared. Finally, in the last section, we draw conclusions and make some comments about future work.\nThe periodic placement of congruent copies of one shape can be found in literature under the keywords \u201cperiodic packing\u201d, \u201cregular packing\u201d or \u201clattice packing\u201d. The lattice packing may be defined over an infinite plane or a limited sheet. If it is the plane, the main objective is to regularly place the shapes so that the density obtained is maximised. When lattice packing on a limited stock sheet, the goal is to maximise the percentage of stock sheet utilisation, which is equivalent to maximise the number of shapes placed inside the plate. As will be shown later, these two \u201capparently\u201d similar objectives are not quite equivalent. However, the definition of a lattice is identical in the two situations. A lattice is generated by two linearly independent vectors,*v*0and*v*1, whose linear combinations will produce a grid that guarantees that pieces do not overlap. The shapes are located in each node of the grid.\nThe problem we propose to solve does not considerer orientation constraints, so, any rotation of the given shape can be allowed. However, after a specific orientation is chosen, all the shapes must follow the same orientation (*Single-Lattice*\u2013 Fig. 1a) or be alternately rotated 180\u00b0 (*Double-Lattice*\u2013 Fig. 1b). According to the typology by W\u00e4scher et al. (2007), the problem described in this paper is a 2-dimensional irregular IIPP (Identical Item Packing Problem).\nThe orientation of the shapes is not relevant when lattice packing on the plane, as maximum density remains unchanged. However, when stock sheet borders need to be taken into account, the orientation of the shapes may be extremely important as will be shown in the following sections.\nIn this work, we propose to solve the problem of Periodic Packing of Irregular Shapes (PPIS) on a limited stock sheet (a rectangle) by heuristic methods.\nThere are references in the literature to the Lattice Packing Problem since the fifties, the first results concerning only theoretical aspects of the lattice packing of a single convex polygon on the plane (Rogers, 1951). However, only a few publications during the next 30 years can be found, and some of them are just marginally related to lattice packing. O\u2019Rourke et al. (1986) have considered the problem of finding minimal enclosing triangles and Dori and Ben Bassat (1983) have dealt with the problem of finding minimal enclosing convex polygons with fewer sides. Those approaches can be seen as a pre-processing to lattice packing, as regular convex polygons can be easily packed than the original ones.\nBetween 1990 and 2000, essentially theoretical results on lattice lacking have been published, mostly considering unlimited sheets and convex shapes (Mount and Silverman, 1990, Mount, 1991, Kuperberg and Kuperberg, 1990, Stoyan and Patsuk, 2000).\nMore recently, results concerning real industrial problems, with limited sheets, irregular shapes and no orientation constraints, have been published. Prasad et al. (1995) describe a nesting problem of irregular shaped metal blanks and propose a heuristic search, considering the variation in the or...",

Previously, the no-fit polygon (NFP) has not been widely applied\nbecause of the perception that it is difficult to implement and because of the lack of generic approaches that can cope with\nall problem cases without specific case-by-case handling. This paper introduces a robust orbital method for the creation of\nno-fit polygons which does not suffer from the typical problem cases found in the other approaches from the literature.\nFurthermore, the algorithm only involves two simple geometric stages so it is easily understood and implemented. We\ndemonstrate how the approach handles known degenerate cases such as holes, interlocking concavities and jigsaw type\npieces and we give generation times for 32 irregular packing benchmark problems from the literature, including real world\ndatasets, to allow further comparison with existing and future approaches.\n\u0002 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Introduction\nThe irregular two-dimensional variant of the cutting and packing problem impacts upon several important\nmanufacturing industries such as textiles, plastics, metal cutting and others. These problems usually consist of\na number of irregular pieces that are to be placed onto one or more sheets of material in the most efficient\nlayout possible, so that all pieces are assigned and do not overlap. Additionally, there are usually rotational\nconstraints enforced on the pieces due to the physical properties of the problem such as grain on the material,\npatterns on textiles and the cutting technology being employed. Sometimes rotational constraints may be used\nfor non-physical reasons such as to restrict pieces to a finite set of rotations thus simplifying layout construc\u0002tion procedures and allowing for faster solutions to be obtained.

There\nhave been many different strategies for producing solutions to the irregular stock cutting problem. These\ninclude linear programming approaches, heuristic placement methods, metaheuristic guided search techniques\nand other novel approaches such as the iterative jostling of pieces (Dowsland et al., 1998). Survey papers can\nbe found in (Dowsland and Dowsland, 1992; Sweeney and Paternoster, 1992; Dyckhoff, 1990). However, the\nfeature that connects all of the approaches is that they are all required to cope with the geometry of the prob\u0002lem. This can be especially complicated when highly irregular shapes are used which may include holes or con\u0002cavities. The implementation of robust and efficient geometry routines can be laborious and can often take\nconsiderably longer than the packing strategies themselves. In particular, the geometry must handle all of\nthe interactions between shapes such as detecting whether two shapes are overlapping and calculating the\ntranslation distance required in a given direction so that the overlap is resolved. As we show in the following\nsection, although these tests can be implemented using trigonometric techniques, the no-fit polygon represents\na considerably more efficient solution.\nWhilst the generation of the no-fit polygon is academically challenging, it is a \u2018tool\u2019 and not a \u2018solution\u2019 and\nthis is perhaps one of the reasons why there are many publications in the literature which state that the no-fit\npolygon is used but which provide relatively little or no details on its implementation. In this paper we con\u0002centrate specifically on the no-fit polygon and provide an overview of the previous techniques that have been\nused for its creation. Furthermore, we describe and provide full implementation details for a new robust orbi\u0002tal approach that can cope with the traditional problem cases that many other approaches cannot handle.\nHopefully this will help in the further dissemination of the benefits of using the no-fit polygon (as opposed\nto traditional trigonometry based approaches) within both the industrial and the academic communities.\n2. The no-fit polygon \u2013 an overview\nIn this section we describe the functionality of the no-fit polygon and we compare it to the more traditional\ntrigonometric based overlap and intersection tests. We also give brief overviews of the many techniques that\nhave been used to generate no-fit polygons within the previous literature.\n2.1. The no-fit polygon\nThe first application of no-fit polygon techniques within the field of cutting and packing was presented by\nArt (1966), although the term \u2018\u2018shape envelop\u2019\u2019 was used. It was ten years later that the term \u2018\u2018no-fit polygon\u2019\u2019\nwas introduced by Adamowicz and Albano who approached the irregular stock cutting problem by using no\u0002fit polygons to pack shapes together using their minimum enclosing rectangles (Adamowicz and Albano,\n1976). The term \u2018\u2018configuration space obstacle\u2019\u2019 is often used to denote the NFP within the field of engineering\nand robot motion planning but the term has also been used with respect to cutting and packing in (Cuningh\u0002ame-Green, 1989). The \u2018\u2018hodograph\u2019\u2019 is often used to describe the no-fit polygon within the mathematics com\u0002munity (Stoyan and Ponomarenko, 1977; Scheithauer and Terno, 1993; Bennell et al., 2001). The main\nfunction of the no-fit polygon is to describe the region in which two polygons intersect. The following example\ngives an overview of the NFP construct.\nGiven two polygons, A and B, the no-fit polygon can be found by tracing one shape around the boundary\nof another. One of the polygons remains fixed in position and the other traverses around the fixed polygon\u2019s\nedges whilst ensuring that the polygons always touch but never intersect. Throughout this paper we adopt the\nconvention of the first polygon being fixed and the second being the traversing/orbiting polygon. Therefore,\nwhen polygon B traces around the fixed polygon A, the resulting no-fit polygon is denoted by NFPAB. In order\nto create the NFPAB object we must choose a reference point from B which will be traced as B moves around\nA. In our implementations we use the first vertex, within the shape vertex list, as the reference point (see\nFig. 1). The reference point can be any arbitrary point providing it follows the movements of the orbiting poly\u0002gon. It is also important to maintain the relative position of the reference point with respect to polygon B as\nthis is required when using the NFP to test for overlap.\nIn order to test whether polygon B overlaps polygon A we use NFPAB and B\u2019s reference point. If polygon B\nis positioned so that its reference point is inside the polygon NFPAB then it overlaps with polygon A. If the\n28 E.K. Burke et al. / European Journal of Operational Research 179 (2007) 27\u201349\nreference point is on the boundary of NFPAB then polygon B touches polygon A. Finally, if the reference point\nis outside of NFPAB then polygons A and B do not overlap or touch (see Fig. 2). The no-fit polygon is used\nwithin the following papers from the literature (Grinde and Cavalier, 1995; Ramkumar, 1996; Cheng and Rao,...",
