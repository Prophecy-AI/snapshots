A link will be provided\nin a future version of this document.\narXiv:2308.08523v1 [cs.CG] 16 Aug 2023\n2 Improved Approximations for Translational Packing of Convex Polygons\n1 Introduction\nMany real-life situations require us to make decisions about optimally packing a collection\nof objects into a specific container. One particular category of these packing problems is\ntwo-dimensional packing, which is encountered in everyday scenarios like arranging items\non a shelf and in industrial applications such as cutting cookies from rolled-out dough\nor manufacturing sets of tiles from standard-sized panels made of wood, glass, or metal.\nAnother intriguing example involves cutting fabric pieces for clothing production. In this\ncase, the pieces often cannot be rotated freely, as they must adhere to a desired pattern\nin the final product, which is tailored of multiple elements. The widespread applicability\nof two-dimensional packing problems has led to a surge of interest in designing efficient\nalgorithms to address them. In this paper, we follow the line of research and study the\nproblem of packing convex polygons without rotations in various settings depending on the\ntype of containers used.\nPast research focusing on theoretical considerations of two-dimensional packings mainly\nconcentrates on the scenario when all objects are axis-parallel rectangles. In this paper, we\nwill discuss packing without rotations, in which only translations are permitted. There are\ntwo main classes of the problem depending on whether the size of the container is fixed and\nwe want to minimize the number of containers used or whether we want to minimize the\ncontainer\u2019s size with respect to some objective function.\nA seminal example of the first class is the Geometric Bin Packing problem in which\na number of unit size squared bins to pack is to be minimized. The problem is arguably\nthe most natural generalization of the regular (1D) Bin Packing to two dimensions, and\nits absolute approximability has been fully understood. Unless P = N P, the best possible\nefficient constant factor approximation is 2 [15], and such an algorithm is known [10].\nIn the second class, there are several variants to be considered. An example is the\nStrip Packing Problem which is concerned with packing objects into a strip of width\n1 and infinite height in such a way that the maximum of all the heights of the placed\nobjects is minimized. Like Geometric Bin Packing, Strip Packing generalizes (1D)\nBin Packing. The best known efficient constant factor approximation for Strip Packing\nhas approximation factor (5/3 + \u03f5) [9]. It is known that there can not exist a polynomial\ntime algorithm with an approximation ratio of (3/2 \u2212 \u03f5) for any \u03f5 > 0 unless P = N P, which\nfollows directly from the approximation hardness of (1D) Bin Packing. Both classes of\nproblems have been also considered in the asymptotic setting, see e.g. [11, 5, 12].\nIn younger time, there was also an increase of interest in cases where the objects in\nquestion are general convex polygons. Alt, de Berg and Knauer [2, 3] considered the problem\nof packing an instance consisting of a number of convex polygons of the form p \u2282 [0, 1]2into\na minimum area axis-parallel rectangular container. We refer to this problem as Polygon\nArea Minimization throughout this paper. In the special case where the instance consists\nof rectangles only, the problem is known to admit a PTAS [4]. They proved the existence of\nthe following efficient algorithm:\nA 23.78-approximation for Polygon Area Minimization.\nRecently, Aamand, Abrahamsen, Beretta and Kleist [1] showed that the algorithm of Alt,\nde Berg and Knauer can be leveraged to obtain also efficient approximation algorithms of\nfurther problems:\nA 7-approximation for Polygon Perimeter Minimization.\nA 51-approximation for Polygon Strip Packing.\nAn 11-approximation for Polygon Bin Packing for polygons with diameter at most 1\n10 .\nA. Kurpisz and S. Suter 3\n1.1 Our results\nThe results of Alt, de Berg and Knauer [2, 3] and Aamand et al. [1] are heavily based on\nso-called shelf packing algorithms. In shelf packing algorithms, the objects are first placed\non the shelves, possibly ordered by height, which are later stacked on one another to build\na final solution. Compared to axis-parallel rectangles, the main challenge in designing an\napproximation algorithm for polygon packing problems is that objects cannot be sorted by\nheight and orientation simultaneously. As a result, the algorithm and its analysis in [2, 3]\nhave such a large approximation guarantee. In this paper, we provide new insight into how\nshelf packing algorithms should be applied to polygon packing problems. We introduce a\nsequence of transformations of the objects that allow us first to sort them by height and later\nby orientation to build a solution of a much better approximation guarantee. More precisely,\nwe design polynomial-time algorithms with the following factors:\nA 9.45-approximation for Polygon Area Minimization.\nUsing this algorithm as a subroutine, we build upon the methods from Aamand et al. [1] to\nobtain the following efficient approximation algorithms:\nA (3.75 + \u03f5)-approximation for Polygon Perimeter Minimization.\nA 21.89-approximation for Polygon Strip Packing.\nA 5.09-approximation for Polygon Bin Packing for polygons which have their diameter\nbounded by 1\n10 .\nThe results are proved in Sections 4, 5, 6, and 7 respectively. Furthermore, in Section 8\nwe show the following results, which make progress towards solving an open question of a\nO(1)-approximation algorithm for Polygon Bin Packing for arbitrary polygons.\nThere is an efficient O(\n1\n\u03b4\n)-approximation algorithm for Polygon Bin Packing for\ninstances where each polygon has width or height at most 1 \u2212 \u03b4.\nThere is an efficient O(1)-approximation algorithm for Polygon Bin Packing for\ninstances with the property that all polygons share a spine (up to translation) with height\nat least 3\n4\n.\n2 Preliminaries\nWe start out considerations by recalling a classical and well-known problem in theoretical\ncomputer science, the Bin Packing problem: Given a list of numbers s1, . . . , sn \u2208 (0, 1] \u2229 Q,\nrepresenting the sizes of n objects, the goal is to find the minimum number of bins of size 1,\nso that we can pac...",

In this paper we make a systematic study of the problem and develop an exact Branch &amp; Bound Algorithm. The initial existing mixed integer formulations are reviewed, tested and used as a starting point to develop a new and more efficient formulation. We also study several branching strategies, lower bounds and procedures for fixing variables, reducing the size of the problem to be solved at each node. An extensive computational study allows us first to determine the best strategies to be used in the Branch &amp; Bound Algorithm and then to explore its performance and limits. The results show that the algorithm is able to solve instances of up to 16 pieces to[optimality](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/optimality).\n## Introduction\nNesting problems are two-dimensional cutting and packing problems involving irregular shapes. These problems arise in a wide variety of industries like garment manufacturing, sheet metal cutting, furniture making and shoe manufacturing. The wide range of applications implies many different variants of the problem. The placement areas into which the pieces have to be packed or cut can be rectangular, as in the case of materials provided in rolls, or can have irregular shapes, as in the case of leather hides for making shoes. This placement area can have a uniform quality or different qualities depending on the region, including sometimes defective parts that cannot be used for pieces. The pieces to be cut can be described as polygons, convex or not, or can include curved edges. Depending on the real application, the pieces can be rotated freely, at specific angles only (90\u00b0, 180\u00b0, \u2026), or not rotated at all. There may also be different objectives, usually involving the minimization of the area required for cutting the pieces or the maximization of the value of the pieces cut. Using the typology proposed by W\u00e4scher et al. (2007), nesting problems, in general, are open-dimension problems with irregular pieces.\nIn this paper we consider a nesting problem in which we have to arrange a set of two-dimensional irregular shapes without overlapping in a rectangular stock sheet of a fixed width, where the objective is to minimize the required length. We will consider the pieces to be described as polygons, not necessarily convex, which cannot be rotated.\nThe main difficulty of nesting problems is to ensure that the pieces have a non-overlapping configuration. This question has been studied extensively in recent years and there are several approaches which determine when two polygons overlap. Bennell and Oliveira (2008) give a tutorial on the different approaches which study the geometry of nesting problems. The problem is NP-complete and as a result solution methodologies predominantly utilize heuristics.\n*Pixel/Raster*methods transform the continuous stock sheet into a discrete grid represented by a matrix, and the position of each piece adds a given coded value to each matrix element. Identifying possible overlapping comes down to checking the matrix values. There are three known codification schemes the first one proposed by Segenreich and Braga (1986), the second one by Oliveira and Ferreira (1993), and the last one by Babu and Babu (2001).\nWhen pieces are represented (or approximated) using polygons, there are tests for edge intersection and for point inclusion that can be used for identifying overlapping (Konopasek, 1981, Ferreira et al., 1998). The most widely used tool for checking whether two polygons overlap is the No-Fit Polygon (NFP). It can be used, along with the vector difference of the position of the two polygons, to determine whether these polygons overlap, touch or are separated, by conducting a simple test to identify whether the resulting vector is inside the NFP. There are three approaches to generating the NFP the orbiting algorithm by Mahadevan (1984), improved by Burke et al. (2007); the Minkowski sums used by Milenkovic et al. (1991) and Bennell and Dowsland (2001); and the decomposition into star-shaped polygons (Daniels et al., 1994) or convex polygons (Watson and Tobias, 1999, Agarwal et al., 2002).\nA more general tool that generalizes the NFP is the*Phi-function*. Its purpose is to represent all the mutual positions of two polygons. The*Phi-functions*for cutting and packing were conceived of and applied by Stoyan et al., 2001, Stoyan et al., 2004, Scheithauer et al. (2005). Bennell et al. (2010) provide a good explanation of how the*Phi-functions*can be built, as well as some applications for them.\nMany different heuristic and metaheuristic approaches have been proposed for solving nesting problems. Simple heuristic rules are used for building a solution step by step, placing one piece at a time, using different placement procedures and different piece sequences. Metaheuristic procedures are used for working with complete solutions and modifying them iterat...",

It is based on a simple local search scheme in which the neighborhood is any horizontal or vertical translation of a given polygon from its current position. To escape local minima we apply the meta-heuristic method*Guided Local Search*.\nThe strength of our solution method comes from a new algorithm which is capable of searching the neighborhood in polynomial time. More precisely, given a single polygon with*m*edges and a set of polygons with*n*edges the algorithm can find a translation with minimum overlap in time O(*mn*log(*mn*)). Solutions for standard test instances are generated by an implementation and a comparison is done with recent results from the literature. The solution method is very robust and most of the best solutions found are also the currently best results published.\nOur approach to the problem is*very*flexible regarding problem variations and special constraints, and as an example we describe how it can handle materials with quality regions.\nFinally, we generalize the algorithm for the fast neighborhood search and present a solution method for three-dimensional nesting problems.\n## Introduction\nNesting is a term used for many related problems. The most common problem is strip-packing where a number of irregular shapes must be placed within a rectangular strip such that the strip-length is minimized and no shapes overlap. The clothing industry is a classical example of an application for this problem. Normally, pieces of clothes are cut from a roll of fabric. A high utilization is desirable and it requires that as little of the roll is used as possible. The width of the roll is fixed, hence the problem is to minimize the length of the fabric. Other nesting problem variations exist, but in the following the focus is on the strip-packing variant. Using the typology of W\u00e4scher et al. (2006) this is a two-dimensional irregular open dimension problem (ODP).\nIn the textile industry the shapes of the pieces of clothes are usually referred to as*markers*or*stencils*. In the following we will use the latter term except when the pieces need to be defined more precisely e.g. as polygons.\nIn order to state the problem formally we first define the associated decision problem:\n**Nesting Decision Problem**\nGiven a set of stencilsSand a piece of material, position the stencilsSsuch that\n* \u2022No pair of stencils overlap.\n* \u2022All stencils are contained within the boundaries of the material.\nThe strip-packing variant can now be stated as\n**Strip Nesting Problem**\nGiven a set of stencilsSand a strip (the material) with width*w*find the minimal length*l*for which the Nesting Decision Problem can be solved (Fig. 1).\nThe Strip Nesting Problem is NP-hard (e.g. Nielsen and Odgaard, 2003).\nIn this paper we present a new solution method for the Strip Nesting Problem. After a short analysis of some of the existing approaches to the problem (Section 2) we present a short outline of the new solution method in Section 3. In short, the approach is a local search method (Section 4) using the meta-heuristic*Guided Local Search*(Section 5) to escape local minima. A very efficient search of the neighborhood in the local search is the subject of Section 6.\nIn the definitions above we have ignored the additional constraints which are often given for a nesting problem e.g. whether rotating and/or flipping the stencils is allowed. In Section 7 a discussion on how we handle such problem variations emphasizes the flexibility of our solution method.\nExperiments show that our solution method is very efficient compared with other published methods. Results are presented in Section 8. Finally, in Section 9, it is shown that our solution method is quite easily generalized to three-dimensional nesting problems.\n## Section snippets\n## Existing approaches to nesting problems\nThere exists numerous solution methods for nesting problems. A thorough survey by Dowsland and Dowsland (1995) exists, but a more recent survey has also been done by Nielsen and Odgaard (2003). Meta-heuristics are one of the most popular tools for solving nesting problems. A detailed discussion of these can be found in the introductory sections of Bennell and Dowsland (1999).\nThe following is a brief discussion of some of the most interesting approaches to nesting problems previously presented\n## Solution method outline\nIn this section we will give a brief outline of our solution method. Our method is a relaxed placement method and it can handle irregular polygons with holes. A new geometric approach is utilized and the*Guided Local Search*meta-heuristic is used to escape local minima. This approach is inspired by a paper by Faroe et al. (2003) which presented a similar approach for the two-dimensional Bin Packing Problem for rectangles.\nThe following describes the basic algorithm for the Strip Nesting Problem.\n* (1)\n## Placement\nFirst we define a*placement*formally. LetS={s1,\u2026,sn}be a set of polygons. A placement ofs\u2208Scan be described by the tuple(sx,sy,s\u03b8,sf)\u2208R\u00d7R\u00d7[0,2\u03c0)\u00d7{false,true}where (*s**x*,*s**y*) is the position,*s**\u03b8*is the rotation angle and*s**f*states whether*s*is flipped. Now the mapp:S\u2192R\u00d7R\u00d7[0,2\u03c0)\u00d7{false,true}is a placement of the polygonsS.\n## Objective function\nGiven a set of polygonsS={s1,\u2026,sn}and a fixed-length strip with length*l*and width*w*, letPbe the space of possible placements. We now wish to minimize the objective\n## Guided local search\nTo escape local minima encountered during local search we apply the meta-heuristic*Guided Local Search*(*GLS*). GLS was introduced by Voudouris and Tsang (1995) and has previously been successfully applied to e.g. the*Traveling Salesman Problem*(Voudouris and Tsang, 1999) and two- and thre...",

The container has a fixed width, while its length can change so that all items are placed in it. The objective is to find a layout of the set of polygons that minimizes the length of the container. The proposed algorithm constructively creates layouts from an ordered list of items and a placement heuristic. The placement determines the collision free region (represents the set of translations to create a feasible layout) for the item to be placed. It is shown that the collision free region must be calculated using non-regularized Boolean operations, as contours of no-fit polygons should be ignored. The proposed algorithm to solve the placement problem has two levels, in the internal level the container has fixed dimensions, and the external level reduces or increases the variable dimension. The placement heuristic searches for degenerated vertices and edges as they represent local maximum compaction. Computational comparisons on benchmark problems show that the proposed algorithm generated highly competitive solutions. Moreover, our algorithm updated some best known results.\n...Read more\n## Key takeaways\n![sparkles](https://a.academia-assets.com/images/icons/sparkle.svg)\nAI\n1. The proposed two-level algorithm effectively minimizes container length for irregular polygon packing.\n2. Collision free regions (CFRs) are determined using non-regularized Boolean operations to avoid contour interference.\n3.

This problem is approached with an heuristic based on simulated annealing. Traditional &quot;external penalization&quot; techniques are avoided through the application of the no-fit polygon, that determinates the collision-free region for each small item before its placement. The simulated annealing controls: the rotation applied and the placement of the small item. For each non-placed small item, a limited depth binary search is performed to find a scale factor that when applied to the small item, would allow it to be fitted in the large object. Three possibilities to define the sequence on which the small items are placed are studied: larger-first, random permutation and weight sorted.

In the two-dimensional case, not only is it the case that the piece&#39;s size is important but its shape also has a significant influence. Therefore, DJD as a selection heuristic has to be paired with a placement heuristic to completely construct a solution to the underlying packing problem. A successful adaptation of the DJD requires a routine to reduce computational costs, which is also proposed and successfully tested in this paper. Results, on a wide variety of instance types with convex polygons, are found to be significantly better than those produced by more conventional selection heuristics.\ndownloadDownload free PDF[View PDFchevron\\_right](https://www.academia.edu/69875946/An_effective_heuristic_for_the_two_dimensional_irregular_bin_packing_problem)\n[Irregular rotational placement of shapes over non-convex containers with fixed dimensions](https://www.academia.edu/104990568/Irregular_rotational_placement_of_shapes_over_non_convex_containers_with_fixed_dimensions)\n[Thiago de Castro Martins](https://independent.academia.edu/ThiagodeCastroMartins)\n8th IFAC International Workshop on Intelligent Manufacturing Systems, 2007, 2007\nThis work deals with the problem of minimize the waste of space that occurs on a placement of a set of bi-dimensional items inside a bi-dimensional container with fixed dimensions.

High material utilization is of particular interest to mass production industries since small improvements of the layout can result in large savings of material and considerably reduce production cost.\nThe knapsack problem belongs to the more general class of combinatorial problems known as cutting and packing problems. According to Dyckhoff (1990), the cutting and packing problems are mainly characterized by the number of relevant dimensions, the regularity and irregularity of the shapes of the small items and large objects and the problem assignment. Considering assignment, it is possible to identify two situations: output maximization and input minimization. In the input minimization, the set of large objects is sufficient to accommodate all small items, and there is no selection regarding the small items. In the case of output maximization, the set of large objects is not sufficient to accommodate all the small items and a set of small items has to be assigned to a given set of large objects. The survey made by Wascher et al. (2005) improved the typology of cutting and packing problems proposed by Dyckhoff (1990). According to Wascher et al. (2005), the problem studied in this work can be defined as: \" ... the knapsack problem represents a problem category which is characterized by a strongly heteroge-neous assortment of small items which have to be allocated to a given set of large objects. Again, the availability of the large objects is limited such that not all small items can be accommodated. The value of the accommodated small items is to be maximized\" . In this survey, Wascher et al. (2005) identified 294 papers containing material relevant to cutting and packing. Only 5...",

In this problem, one is given a number of rectangular sheets and an order for a specified number of each of certain types of two-dimensional regular and irregular shapes. The aim is to cut the shapes out of the sheets in such a way as to minimize the amount of waste produced. A two-stage solution is proposed in which the problem is converted from one of placing irregularly shaped pieces to one of allocating rectangular modules. The clustering algorithm used in the first stage to produce rectangular modules is presented and the results obtained when it was applied to some typical layout problems are described.\nRecommended articles\n## References(11)\n* M.Adamowicz### The optimum two-dimensional allocation of irregular, multiple-connected shapes with linear, logical and geometric constraints\n* M.J.Haims*et al.*### A multistage solution of the template layout problem\n### IEEE Transactions on System Science and Cybernetics\n(1970)\n* M.Adamowicz*et al.*### A two-stage solution of the cutting stock problem\n* H.Freeman### Computer processing of line drawing images\n### Comput.

In the two-dimensional case, not only is it the case that the piece\u2019s size is important but its shape also has a significant influence. Therefore, DJD as a selection heuristic has to be paired with a placement heuristic to completely construct a solution to the underlying packing problem. A successful adaptation of the DJD requires a routine to reduce computational costs, which is also proposed and successfully tested in this paper. Results, on a wide variety of instance types with convex polygons, are found to be significantly better than those produced by more conventional selection heuristics.\n\nThis is a preview of
