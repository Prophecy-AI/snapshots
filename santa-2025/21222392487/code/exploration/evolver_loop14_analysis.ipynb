    "- Best score: 70.630478 (from saspav_best.csv ensemble)\n",
    "- Target: 68.919154\n",

    "This means:\n",
    "1. We already have an excellent solution\n",
    "2. The target (68.919) is SIGNIFICANTLY below any public score\n",

    "1. Ensemble from 25+ public sources ✓\n",
    "2. bbox3 optimization (produces overlaps)\n",
    "3. sa_v1_parallel (produces overlaps)\n",
    "4. Grid-based approaches (zaburo, tessellation) - worse\n",

    "7. Long-running SA (15 generations) - no improvement\n",
    "8. Basin hopping - no improvement\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The target of 68.919 requires approximately 71% packing efficiency, while our current solution achieves about 70% efficiency. This is a very small gap in terms of efficiency (1 percentage point), but it translates to a 1.7 point gap in score.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The key insight is that we are already at a VERY STRONG local optimum:**\n",
    "1. Our score is BETTER than the public LB leader\n",
    "2. Tree removal found only 0.000013 improvement\n",
    "3. All optimization approaches converge to the same solution\n",
    "4. All bounding boxes are perfectly square\n",
    "\n",
    "**What might help:**\n",
    "1. **Rebuild from corners technique** - Extract subsets of trees from larger N layouts\n",
    "2. **Deeper tree removal search** - Search ALL depths, ALL trees (not just bbox-touching)\n",
    "3. **Per-N focused optimization** - Focus on specific N values with worst efficiency\n",
    "4. **Asymmetric packing** - Try fundamentally different arrangements\n",
    "\n",
    "**However, the gap to target (1.7 points) is MASSIVE compared to the improvements we've found (0.000013).**\n",
    "\n",
    "The target may not be achievable with current techniques."
