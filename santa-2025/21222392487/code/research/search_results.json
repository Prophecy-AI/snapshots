      "title": "ANSWER",
      "text": "Top teams in the Kaggle Santa 2025 Christmas Tree Packing competition employ advanced optimization techniques, notably the \"deletion cascade\" approach, to achieve scores below 69. This approach involves iteratively removing less promising packing configurations or parts of the packing arrangement to refine the solution and improve packing efficiency ([GitHub](https://github.com/adityapawar327/Christmas-Tree-Packing-Kaggle-Challenge-Santa-25-), [CompeteHub](https://www.competehub.dev/en/competitions/kagglesanta-2025)). Such methods help in narrowing down the search space and honing in on the most compact packings.\n\nAdditionally, these teams utilize mathematical modeling, machine learning, and heuristic algorithms to optimize packing arrangements, especially for irregular shapes like Christmas trees. For example, Calvin Chang's project involved creating a mathematical model to pack irregular shapes tightly within the smallest possible square, achieving a high ranking ([Calvin Chang Portfolio](https://calvinchang1.com/projects/kaggle-santa-packing)). The deletion cascade technique specifically refers to a process where less optimal packing configurations are systematically eliminated in successive iterations, leading to more efficient packings and lower scores ([Kaggle discussion](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/santa-2025/discussion/666880)).",

Participants are tasked with determining the optimal way to pack Christmas tree toys into the smallest possible square box, allowing Santa Claus to mail them efficiently around the globe. The challenge is to find the dimensions of the smallest square box that can fit between 1 to 200 trees.\nThe competition is designed to encourage innovation and problem-solving skills, with a focus on packing efficiency. Participants are encouraged to submit their solutions, which will be evaluated based on the normalized area of the square bounding box for each puzzle configuration.\n### Description\nThe challenge is inspired by Santa&#x27;s need for the smallest box to fit all the tiny trees for his Christmas deliveries. Participants are required to find the best packing solution to help Santa Claus and win the competition&#x27;s prize.\n### Evaluation\nSubmissions are evaluated on the sum of the normalized area of the square bounding box for each puzzle. The formula for the score is:\n```\n`score = \u2211(sn^2/n)`\n```\nwhere`sn`is the side of the square box bounding the trees and`n`is the total number of trees in the configuration.\n### Submission File\nEach submission must include the tree position (`x`,`y`) and rotation (`deg`) for each`id`in the submission. The values must be converted to a string and prepended with an`s`before submission. Submissions with overlapping trees will result in an error. Location values must be constrained to -100 \u2264x, y \u2264100.\nThe file should have the following format:\n```\n`id,x,y,deg\n001\\_0,s0.0,s0.0,s20.411299\n002\\_0,s0.0,s0.0,s20.411299\n002\\_1,s-0.541068,s0.259317,s51.66348\netc.`\n```\n### Timeline\n* **November 17, 2025**: Start Date\n* **January 23, 2026**: Entry Deadline\n* **January 23, 2026**: Team Merger Deadline\n* **January 30, 2026**: Final Submission Deadline\nAll deadlines are at 11:59 PM UTC unless otherwise noted.\n### Prizes\n* **First Prize**: $12,000\n* **Second Prize**: $10,000\n* **Third Prize**: $10,000\n* **Fourth Prize**: $8,000\nAdditionally, a**Rudolph Prize**of $10,000 is awarded to the team holding 1st place on the leaderboard for the longest period of time between November 17, 2025, and January 30, 2026.\n### Citation\nWalter Reade and Ashley Oldacre.
