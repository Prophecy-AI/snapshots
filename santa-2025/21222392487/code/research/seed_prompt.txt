## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.624381 from exp_025/026/027
- Best LB score: 70.6261 (exp_024)
- Target: 68.919154 | Gap to target: 1.705 points (2.47%)

## Critical Analysis After 27 Experiments

### THE PROBLEM: We're Stuck at a Strong Local Optimum
After 27 experiments, ALL optimization approaches converge to the same score (~70.624):
- SA (Python and C++): No improvement
- bbox3: Produces overlaps, no valid improvement
- Genetic algorithm: No improvement
- Gradient descent: Zero gradient at local minimum
- Iterative SA + guided refinement: No improvement
- Basin hopping: No improvement
- Constraint programming: No improvement

**The baseline is at an EXTREMELY STRONG LOCAL OPTIMUM.**

### KEY INSIGHT FROM RESEARCH
Top teams use a **HYBRID strategy**:
- **N < 58**: Unstructured SA for chaotic packings
- **N >= 58**: Crystalline/lattice packing

The gap from 70.6 to 68.9 requires **FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT PACKING STRUCTURES**, not more optimization iterations.

## Response to Evaluator

The evaluator correctly identified that:
1. All local search approaches have been exhausted
2. Asymmetric solutions in exp_019 were implemented WRONG (tried random patterns from scratch instead of asymmetric perturbations of good solutions)
3. SparroWASM external solver has NOT been tried
4. MIP for small N (1-5) could prove optimality

I agree with all these points. The key insight is that we need to generate solutions with **FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT STRUCTURES**, not optimize existing ones.

## Recommended Approaches (Priority Order)

### 1. **[HIGHEST PRIORITY] Implement Correct Asymmetric Perturbations**
The research clearly states asymmetric solutions outperform symmetric ones. But exp_019 tried the WRONG thing.

**Correct approach:**
- Start with the BASELINE solution (not from scratch)
- Apply asymmetric PERTURBATIONS:
  - Offset every other row by 0.1-0.3 units
  - Vary angles slightly (not just 0°/180°, try 0°/175°/185°/180°)
  - Non-uniform spacing between trees
- Validate with Shapely
- Compare to baseline

**Implementation:**
```python
# For each N, take baseline positions
# Apply small asymmetric perturbations
# - Shift every other tree by small offset
# - Add small angle variations (±5°)
# - Use SA to optimize the perturbed configuration
```

### 2. **[HIGH PRIORITY] Try Different Tessellation Patterns for Large N**
The jiweiliu kernel shows that for large N, grid-based tessellation with SA can work well.

**Key insight from jiweiliu:**
- Use 2-tree unit cells (trees at 0° and 180°)
- Optimize translation vectors (a, b) with SA
- Add noise to translation lengths
- Rotate all unit cell trees by same angle simultaneously

**Implementation:**
- For N >= 50, try different unit cell configurations
- Optimize translation vectors with SA
- Compare to baseline

### 3. **[HIGH PRIORITY] Focus on High-Leverage N Values**
Score breakdown shows:
- N=1: 0.661 (highest single contribution) - ALREADY OPTIMAL
- N=2: 0.451
- N=3: 0.435
- N=4: 0.417
- N=5: 0.417

For N=2-10, try exhaustive search with finer angle resolution (0.1° instead of 1°).

### 4. **[MEDIUM PRIORITY] Try MIP for N=2-5**
For very small N, MIP can PROVE optimality:
- N=2: 2 trees, 6 variables (x1, y1, θ1, x2, y2, θ2)
- N=3-5: Still tractable with modern solvers

If the baseline is not optimal for these N values, MIP will find the true optimum.

### 5. **[MEDIUM PRIORITY] Analyze What Makes Top Solutions Different**
The gap from 70.6 to 68.9 is 2.47%. This means:
- If we could improve each N by 2.47%, we'd reach target
- But some N values may have more room for improvement than others

**Analysis needed:**
- Which N values have the most "slack" in current solution?
- Are there N values where the current solution is clearly suboptimal?

## What NOT to Try
- ❌ More SA iterations on current baseline (proven to not work)
- ❌ bbox3 optimization (produces overlaps)
- ❌ Random restart SA (random configs are worse)
- ❌ Genetic algorithm (no improvement found)
- ❌ Gradient descent (zero gradient at local minimum)
- ❌ Random asymmetric patterns from scratch (exp_019 showed this doesn't work)

## SUBMISSION STRATEGY
- Remaining submissions: 90
- Submit after this experiment? YES - we have abundant submissions
- Even if the experiment doesn't improve, LB feedback is valuable

## Validation Notes
- CV scheme: Direct score calculation (S²/N summed over all N)
- This is a deterministic optimization problem - CV = LB
- Validate all solutions with Shapely overlap detection before submission

## CRITICAL: The Target IS Achievable
The target of 68.919 is the top LB score. Top teams have achieved it. The gap is 2.47%.
We need to find what they did differently - likely:
1. Different packing structures (not just optimized versions of public solutions)
2. Asymmetric layouts that exploit the tree shape better
3. Per-N specialized approaches

**DO NOT GIVE UP. The solution exists. Find it.**
