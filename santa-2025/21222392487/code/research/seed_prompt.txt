## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.624381 from exp_025 (iterative_refinement)
- Best LB score: 70.6261 (exp_024)
- Target: 68.919154 | Gap to target: 1.705 points (2.41%)

## CRITICAL SITUATION: 8 CONSECUTIVE EXPERIMENTS WITH ZERO IMPROVEMENT

After 33 experiments, we are COMPLETELY STUCK at a local optimum:
- Last 8 experiments: ZERO improvement
- All optimization approaches (SA, bbox3, tree_packer, outer_chain) converge to same score
- Comprehensive ensemble from 107 CSV sources found NO improvements
- Our score (70.624) is 0.567 points BETTER than public LB leader (71.191)

## Key Insights from Loop 32 Analysis

1. **N=1 is ALREADY OPTIMAL**: Score 0.661250 is the theoretical minimum (bounding box of single tree at 45°)
2. **Required efficiency improvement**: From 69.86% to 71.61% for N=2-200 (2.5% relative improvement)
3. **Small N (2-30) has worst efficiency** - these are priority targets
4. **Large N (100-200) has best efficiency** (~72-74%)
5. **Tree area = 0.245625, but minimum bounding box for 1 tree = 0.661250**

## Response to Evaluator

The evaluator correctly identified we are completely stuck. The comprehensive ensemble confirmed all available solution sources have been exhausted. I agree with the evaluator's assessment that we need fundamentally different approaches.

**Evaluator recommendations addressed:**
1. ✅ Per-N gap analysis - DONE: N=1 is optimal, improvement must come from N=2-200
2. ⚠️ Extended optimization - TRIED but doesn't escape local optimum
3. ❌ Manual optimization - NOT TRIED (labor-intensive)
4. ❌ SparroWASM - NOT ACCESSIBLE (kernel fetch failed)
5. ✅ Random restart - TRIED: Random configs are worse than baseline

## What Has Been Tried (ALL FAILED to improve beyond 70.624):
- ❌ SA optimization (multiple variants, including fractional translation)
- ❌ bbox3 optimization (various parameters, extended runs)
- ❌ tree_packer and outer_chain binaries
- ❌ Zaburo grid-based solutions
- ❌ Tessellation approaches (hexagonal, crystalline)
- ❌ Basin hopping, beam search, genetic algorithms
- ❌ Chistyakov and jiweiliu deletion cascades
- ❌ Corner rebuild approaches
- ❌ Asymmetric perturbations
- ❌ Ensemble from 107 CSV sources

## Recommended Approaches (Priority Order)

### 1. **[HIGHEST PRIORITY] Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) for Small N**

Research indicates MIP with big-M constraints can find GLOBAL optima. This is fundamentally different from local search:

```python
# Use OR-Tools CP-SAT solver for small N (2-10)
from ortools.sat.python import cp_model

# For each N:
# - Variables: x_i, y_i (scaled integers), theta_i (discrete angles)
# - Constraints: No overlap between any pair of trees
# - Objective: Minimize max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y)

# Start with N=2, N=3, N=4 where exhaustive search is feasible
# If MIP finds better solutions, scale up
```

### 2. **[HIGH PRIORITY] Exhaustive Search for N=2,3,4**

For very small N, we can try ALL possible configurations:
- N=2: Try all angle pairs (0-359) × (0-359) with optimal positioning
- N=3: Grid search over angles with local optimization
- N=4: Similar approach

Current scores:
- N=2: 0.450779 (54.5% efficiency)
- N=3: 0.434745 (56.5% efficiency)
- N=4: 0.416545 (59.0% efficiency)

Even small improvements here add up.

### 3. **[HIGH PRIORITY] Asymmetric Packing from Scratch**

Web search confirms asymmetric solutions outperform symmetric ones. Generate NEW configurations:
- Staggered/offset patterns (not grid-based)
- Diagonal arrangements
- Random initial positions with local optimization
- Focus on N=10-50 where efficiency is worst

### 4. **[MEDIUM PRIORITY] Constraint Programming with Global Optimization**

Use CP-SAT or similar to find globally optimal arrangements:
- Discretize positions to integer grid
- Use interval variables for tree positions
- Add no-overlap constraints
- Minimize bounding box

### 5. **[MEDIUM PRIORITY] Very Long Optimization Runs**

As a last resort, try MILLIONS of iterations on specific N values:
- Focus on N=2-10 where efficiency is worst
- Use multiple random restarts
- Run overnight if needed

## What NOT to Try
- ❌ More SA/bbox3 variations (8 experiments showed no improvement)
- ❌ More ensemble combinations (107 sources exhausted)
- ❌ Grid-based initial solutions (always worse than baseline)
- ❌ Deletion cascade approaches (already tried extensively)

## SUBMISSION STRATEGY
- Remaining submissions: 89
- Submit after this experiment? YES if ANY improvement found
- Even small improvements (0.001) are worth submitting for LB feedback

## Validation Notes
- CV = LB for this problem (deterministic, no train/test split)
- All solutions must pass Shapely overlap validation
- Score = sum over N of (side^2 / N)

## CRITICAL REMINDER
The target IS achievable. Top teams have scores below 69. We need to find what they're doing differently:
1. Asymmetric solutions beat symmetric ones
2. MIP/CP can find global optima for small N
3. Professional nesting software uses different algorithms

**NEXT EXPERIMENT: Implement MIP/CP solver for N=2,3,4,5 to find globally optimal configurations. If these beat baseline, we've found a new approach that can be scaled up.**

DO NOT GIVE UP. The solution exists - we just haven't found it yet.
