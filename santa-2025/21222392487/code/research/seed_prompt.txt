## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.624381 from exp_030
- Best LB score: 70.626088 from exp_024
- Target: 68.919154 | Gap to target: 1.707 points (2.41%)
- **Our score beats public LB leader (71.191) by 0.567 points!**

## CRITICAL SITUATION ASSESSMENT

After 30 experiments, we have hit a HARD LOCAL OPTIMUM:
- ALL local search approaches (SA, bbox3, basin hopping, beam search) converge to ~70.624
- The ONLY successful strategy was ENSEMBLE from different sources
- ALL available sources (85 snapshots, all public kernels) have been EXHAUSTED
- Last 5 experiments showed ZERO improvement

**THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM:**
We cannot improve by optimizing existing solutions. We need to GENERATE NEW SOLUTIONS from fundamentally different algorithms.

## Response to Evaluator

The evaluator correctly identifies that:
1. All local search methods have failed to escape the local optimum
2. SparroWASM workflow has NOT been systematically tried
3. MIP/CP for small N has NOT been tried
4. The baseline is at an EXTREMELY STRONG local optimum

I AGREE with the evaluator's assessment. The path forward is NOT more SA/optimization but FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT ALGORITHMS.

## Score Analysis

Score breakdown by N range:
- N=1-10: 4.33 (6.13%) - WORST efficiency (42-74%)
- N=11-20: 3.72 (5.27%)
- N=21-50: 10.98 (15.55%)
- N=51-100: 17.61 (24.94%)
- N=101-150: 17.14 (24.26%)
- N=151-200: 16.84 (23.85%)

To close the 1.705 gap, we need ~2.4% improvement across ALL N values.

## Recommended Approaches (Priority Order)

### 1. **[HIGHEST PRIORITY] Implement jiweiliu's Grid-Based SA with Unit Cells**

The jiweiliu kernel shows a DIFFERENT approach that claims 0.15+ improvement:
- Uses unit cells (2 trees per cell) instead of random initialization
- Grid configurations with ncols x nrows
- SA optimization with translations
- Tree deletion cascade to propagate good configs to smaller N
- Numba acceleration for speed

**Implementation steps:**
1. Copy the jiweiliu kernel approach
2. Generate grid configurations for N=1-200
3. Run SA optimization with their parameters
4. Apply deletion cascade
5. Ensemble with current best

This is the most promising because:
- It's a CONSTRUCTIVE approach (builds from scratch)
- It's been shown to work (0.15+ improvement claimed)
- It generates DIFFERENT solutions than our current ones

### 2. **[HIGH PRIORITY] Try Different Tessellation Patterns**

The current baseline uses specific tessellation patterns. Try:
- Different unit cell configurations (3 trees, 4 trees)
- Different rotation patterns (not just 0°/180°)
- Offset rows (staggered grid)
- Hexagonal packing patterns

### 3. **[MEDIUM PRIORITY] MIP/CP for Small N (N=1-10)**

Small N has the WORST efficiency (42-74%). Use exact solvers:
- OR-Tools MIP formulation
- Big-M constraints for no-overlap
- Focus on N=1-5 first (highest leverage)

### 4. **[LOWER PRIORITY] SparroWASM for N=1-50**

The sacuscreed kernel shows the workflow:
1. Generate JSON config with tree shape
2. Run SparroWASM at https://jeroengar.github.io/sparroWASM/
3. Parse SVG output to extract positions
4. Validate and compare to baseline

This requires manual web interaction but may find novel solutions.

## What NOT to Try

- ❌ More SA iterations on current solutions (converged to local optimum)
- ❌ Different SA parameters (same result)
- ❌ bbox3 optimization (produces overlapping trees)
- ❌ Basin hopping (no improvement)
- ❌ Beam search (all worse than baseline)
- ❌ Ensemble from existing snapshots (all exhausted)

## SUBMISSION STRATEGY

- Remaining submissions: 90
- **SUBMIT after this experiment** - we have abundant submissions
- Even if the new approach doesn't beat current best, LB feedback is valuable

## Validation Notes

- CV scheme: Calculate total score for N=1-200
- Overlap check: Use Shapely to verify no tree overlaps
- Score = sum(side_length^2 / N) for all N

## CRITICAL: The target IS achievable

The gap is 2.41%. Top teams have achieved sub-69 scores. The key is:
1. Different STRUCTURE (not just optimization)
2. Asymmetric layouts that break symmetry
3. Constructive algorithms that build from scratch
4. Combining multiple fundamentally different approaches

DO NOT GIVE UP. The solution exists. Find it.
