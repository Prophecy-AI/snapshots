## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.624381 from exp_025 (025_iterative_refinement)
- Best LB score: 70.6261 (exp_024)
- Target: 68.919154 | Gap to target: 1.705 points (2.41%)

**CRITICAL CONTEXT**: Our score (70.624) is 0.567 points BETTER than the public LB leader (71.191). We are already ahead of all public solutions!

## Response to Evaluator

The evaluator correctly identified that:
1. **7 consecutive experiments with ZERO improvement** - We are completely stuck at a local optimum
2. **ALL optimization approaches exhausted** - SA, bbox3, basin hopping, beam search, corner rebuild, hexagonal packing - ALL converge to the same local optimum
3. **ONLY ensemble methods have worked** - The 0.023 improvement over 32 experiments came ENTIRELY from combining solutions from different sources

**I AGREE with the evaluator's assessment.** The current strategy has completely stalled. We need to:
1. Find NEW solution sources (not optimize existing ones)
2. Try fundamentally different algorithms (not variations of SA)
3. Use tools we haven't fully exploited (outer_chain, tree_packer, SparroWASM)

## Key Insights from Research

### From jiweiliu kernel (super-fast-simulated-annealing):
- Uses **deletion cascade**: Propagates improvements from large N to smaller N
- Grid-based approach with SA optimization
- This is the source of the best public score

### From sacuscreed kernel (solutions-guided-refinement):
- Shows **SparroWASM workflow** - a web-based packing optimizer
- Can generate fundamentally different solutions
- Compares against Paul Jurczak and Stanislav Chistyakov reference scores
- Identifies specific N values with room for improvement

### From discussion 666880 (36 votes):
- "Why the winning solutions will be Asymmetric"
- Asymmetric layouts outperform symmetric patterns
- This is a fundamentally different approach we haven't fully explored

## Recommended Approaches (Priority Order)

### 1. **[HIGHEST PRIORITY] Run outer_chain and tree_packer binaries**

These binaries exist in `/home/code/exploration/datasets/seowoohyeon/` but haven't been used on our current best:

```bash
cd /home/code/exploration/datasets/seowoohyeon
./outer_chain < /home/submission/submission.csv > outer_chain_improved.csv
./tree_packer < /home/submission/submission.csv > tree_packer_improved.csv
```

Then ensemble the results with current best.

### 2. **[HIGH PRIORITY] Comprehensive ensemble from ALL CSV sources**

We have many CSV files that may not have been fully ensembled:
- `/home/code/exploration/datasets/santa25_public/*.csv` (17 files)
- `/home/code/exploration/datasets/seowoohyeon/*.csv` (2 files)
- `/home/code/exploration/datasets/saspav_csv/*.csv`
- `/home/code/exploration/datasets/solutions/*.csv`
- All other CSVs in datasets/

For each N=1-200, pick the BEST valid (no overlap) solution from ALL sources.

### 3. **[HIGH PRIORITY] Implement deletion cascade from jiweiliu kernel**

The deletion cascade technique propagates improvements from large N to smaller N:
1. Start with N=200 solution
2. For each N from 200 down to 2:
   - Try deleting each tree
   - Keep the deletion that gives the smallest bounding box
   - Use this as the N-1 solution
3. This can find better solutions for smaller N values

### 4. **[MEDIUM PRIORITY] Generate asymmetric solutions**

Based on discussion 666880, asymmetric layouts outperform symmetric ones:
- Don't force mirror symmetry
- Try offset rows, staggered angles
- Use different rotation patterns

### 5. **[MEDIUM PRIORITY] Per-N gap analysis**

Identify which specific N values have the most room for improvement:
- Compare our scores against Paul Jurczak reference scores
- Focus optimization on N values with largest gaps
- This is more targeted than broad optimization

## What NOT to Try
- ❌ More SA iterations (converges to same local optimum)
- ❌ Different SA parameters (same result)
- ❌ bbox3 with more iterations (already exhausted)
- ❌ Corner rebuild (just tried - 0 improvements)
- ❌ Hexagonal packing (much worse than baseline)

## SUBMISSION STRATEGY
- Remaining submissions: 89
- **SUBMIT after this experiment** - We have abundant submissions
- Even if no improvement, LB feedback confirms our approach

## Validation Notes
- This is a deterministic optimization problem
- Local score matches LB score exactly (verified across 11 submissions)
- No CV-LB gap to worry about

## CRITICAL REMINDER
The target (68.919) requires 1.705 more points of improvement (2.41%).
Our score already beats the public LB leader by 0.567 points.
The gap is achievable but requires finding NEW solution sources, not optimizing existing ones.
