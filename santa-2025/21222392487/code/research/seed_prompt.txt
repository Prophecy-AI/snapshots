## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.624381 from exp_030
- Best LB score: 70.626088 from exp_024 (submitted and verified)
- Target: 68.919154 | Gap to target: 1.705 (2.47%)
- **CRITICAL**: Our score (70.624) BEATS the public LB leader (71.191) by 0.567 points!

## CV-LB Relationship Analysis
- CV and LB scores match almost exactly (within 0.002)
- This is a deterministic optimization problem - no distribution shift
- 10 submissions made, 8 successful, all verify local scores match LB

## Response to Evaluator

The evaluator correctly identifies that:
1. **All local search methods have converged to the same optimum** - SA, bbox3, beam search, asymmetric perturbations all fail to improve
2. **The ONLY successful strategy was ensemble** - combining solutions from DIFFERENT SOURCES yielded 0.021 improvement
3. **SparroWASM has NOT been systematically tried** - this is a professional 2D nesting solver

I AGREE with the evaluator's assessment. The baseline is at an EXTREMELY STRONG LOCAL OPTIMUM. After 30 experiments with 5 consecutive experiments showing ZERO improvement, we must try fundamentally different approaches.

However, I note a CRITICAL DISCOVERY: **Our score (70.624) already BEATS the public LB leader (71.191) by 0.567 points!** This suggests:
1. We have one of the best publicly available solutions
2. The target (68.919) may require proprietary techniques not in public kernels
3. Top teams likely use approaches not shared publicly

## What Has Been Exhaustively Tried (DO NOT REPEAT)
1. ❌ SA optimization (Python and C++) - converges to same local optimum
2. ❌ bbox3 optimization - produces overlapping trees
3. ❌ Grid-based initial solutions (zaburo) - 25% worse than baseline
4. ❌ Random restart SA - random configs are worse
5. ❌ Basin hopping - no improvement
6. ❌ Gradient descent - zero gradient at local minimum
7. ❌ Iterative SA + guided refinement - no improvement
8. ❌ Asymmetric perturbations + SA - no improvement
9. ❌ Greedy beam search - ALL worse than baseline
10. ❌ Ensemble from 85 snapshots - exhausted, no more improvements

## Recommended Approaches (Priority Order)

### 1. **[HIGHEST PRIORITY] Try OR-Tools CP-SAT for Small N**

The evaluator recommends SparroWASM, but it requires manual web interface interaction. Instead, try OR-Tools CP-SAT (Constraint Programming) which can be run programmatically:

```python
from ortools.sat.python import cp_model

# For small N (1-10), formulate as constraint satisfaction:
# - Variables: x_i, y_i (scaled to integers), angle_i (discrete: 0, 45, 90, 135, 180, 225, 270, 315)
# - Constraints: No overlap (using interval variables and no_overlap_2d)
# - Objective: Minimize bounding box side

# This can find EXACT optimal solutions for small N where efficiency is lowest (37-65%)
```

Focus on N=1-10 first where efficiency is lowest and improvements have highest leverage.

### 2. **[HIGH PRIORITY] Generate Solutions from Different Initial Configurations**

The problem is that ALL our solutions start from the same basin. Try:
- Random initial placements (not optimized baseline)
- Different rotation patterns (not just 0°/180°)
- Spiral placement patterns
- Hexagonal grid patterns

Then optimize with SA from these DIFFERENT starting points.

### 3. **[MEDIUM PRIORITY] Implement High-Precision Arithmetic**

Research indicates top teams use Decimal type with 25+ digits precision. This could:
- Find solutions that fail validation with standard float precision
- Enable more precise overlap detection
- Allow tighter packings that standard floats reject

### 4. **[MEDIUM PRIORITY] Per-N Specialized Algorithms**

Different N values may benefit from different approaches:
- N=1-10: Exact solver (CP-SAT)
- N=11-50: Tessellation patterns
- N=51-200: SA with different initial configs

## What NOT to Try
- ❌ More SA iterations on current baseline (converges to same optimum)
- ❌ Different SA parameters (same result)
- ❌ bbox3 with any parameters (produces overlaps)
- ❌ Ensemble from existing snapshots (exhausted)
- ❌ Grid-based solutions (25% worse)

## Validation Notes
- Score computation is exact and verified
- LB scores match local scores within floating-point precision
- No overlap validation using Shapely is correct

## SUBMISSION STRATEGY
- Remaining submissions: 90
- **SUBMIT after this experiment** - we have abundant submissions
- Even if the new approach doesn't beat baseline, LB feedback is valuable
- Our current best (70.624) is already better than public LB leader (71.191)

## Key Insight for Next Experiment

The gap to target (1.705 points, 2.47%) is significant. At the current rate of improvement (0.0008 per experiment from ensemble), we would need 2000+ experiments to reach target.

**THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM**: All public solutions are in the SAME BASIN. Local search cannot escape. We need solutions from a DIFFERENT BASIN.

**RECOMMENDED EXPERIMENT**: Implement OR-Tools CP-SAT for N=1-10 to find exact optimal solutions. If this works, extend to larger N. This is a fundamentally different approach that doesn't rely on local search.
