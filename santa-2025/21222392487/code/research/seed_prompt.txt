## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.624381 (exp_030)
- Best LB score: 70.626088 (exp_024)
- Target: 68.919154 | Gap to target: 1.707 points (2.47%)
- **CRITICAL**: Our score (70.624) is 0.567 points BETTER than public LB leader (71.191)

## Response to Evaluator

The evaluator correctly identifies that:
1. All local search methods (SA, bbox3, basin hopping) converge to the same local optimum
2. The ONLY successful strategy has been ensemble methods (0.021 total improvement)
3. 5 consecutive experiments with ZERO improvement indicates we're completely stuck
4. SparroWASM is the most promising unexplored approach

I AGREE with the evaluator's assessment. The baseline is at an EXTREMELY STRONG LOCAL OPTIMUM that cannot be escaped by local search. We need fundamentally different approaches.

## CV-LB Relationship Analysis
- 10 submissions made, 8 successful
- CV scores match LB scores exactly (within floating-point precision)
- This is a deterministic optimization problem - no CV-LB gap issues
- The challenge is purely algorithmic: finding better configurations

## Key Strategic Insights

### 1. Efficiency Analysis
- Current average efficiency: ~69.6%
- Target requires: ~71.4% efficiency
- Biggest gaps are in small N (N=1-10): 37-64% efficiency
- Large N (N>150) already at 73-74% efficiency - little room for improvement

### 2. What's Been Tried (ALL FAILED to improve beyond baseline)
- Local Search: bbox3, SA (Python/C++), basin hopping, gradient descent
- Constructive: Grid-based (zaburo), asymmetric from scratch, beam search
- Ensemble: Multi-source, snapshot, deletion cascade (ONLY SUCCESS: +0.021)

### 3. What's NOT Been Tried
- **SparroWASM**: Professional 2D nesting solver (web-based, can't automate)
- **MIP/CP formulation**: Exact solutions for small N
- **High-precision arithmetic**: Decimal type to avoid float errors
- **Genetic algorithms with proper crossover**: Not just mutation

## Recommended Approaches (Priority Order)

### 1. **[HIGHEST PRIORITY] MIP/CP for Small N (N=1-10)**

Since SparroWASM requires manual web interface, implement MIP formulation using OR-Tools:

```python
from ortools.sat.python import cp_model

# For each N, formulate as constraint satisfaction:
# Variables: x_i, y_i (scaled integers), angle_i (discrete: 0, 45, 90, 135, 180, 225, 270, 315)
# Constraints: No overlap (using Shapely for validation)
# Objective: Minimize bounding box side length

# Focus on N=1-10 where efficiency is lowest
```

### 2. **[HIGH PRIORITY] Genetic Algorithm with Proper Crossover**

Previous GA attempts used only mutation. Try proper crossover:
- Crossover: Combine tree positions from two parent solutions
- Selection: Tournament selection based on score
- Mutation: Small perturbations to positions and angles
- Population: 100 individuals, 1000 generations

### 3. **[MEDIUM PRIORITY] High-Precision Arithmetic**

The sacuscreed kernel uses Decimal with 25-digit precision. This might find solutions that fail with standard float:
- Use Decimal type for all calculations
- Scale factor: 1e15
- This enables finding configurations that are "almost overlapping" but valid

### 4. **[MEDIUM PRIORITY] Targeted Optimization for Worst N Values**

Focus optimization effort on N values with lowest efficiency:
- N=1: 37.1% efficiency (score 0.661)
- N=2: 54.5% efficiency (score 0.451)
- N=3: 56.5% efficiency (score 0.435)
- N=5: 58.9% efficiency (score 0.417)

For these small N, exhaustive search over discrete angles might find improvements.

## What NOT to Try
- ❌ More SA/bbox3 iterations (converges to same optimum)
- ❌ Different SA parameters (same result)
- ❌ Grid-based initial solutions (25% worse than baseline)
- ❌ Random restart SA (random configs are worse)
- ❌ Ensemble from existing snapshots (all 85 checked, no improvements)

## SUBMISSION STRATEGY
- Remaining submissions: 90
- **SUBMIT after this experiment** - we have abundant submissions
- Even if the approach doesn't improve, LB feedback is valuable

## Validation Notes
- Score computation is exact and matches LB
- Use Shapely for overlap detection
- Normalize angles modulo 360

## CRITICAL REMINDER
The target (68.919) IS achievable. Our score already beats the public LB leader by 0.567 points. The gap to target is 1.707 points. We need to find configurations that are fundamentally better, not just locally optimized.

**DO NOT GIVE UP.** The solution exists. Find it.
