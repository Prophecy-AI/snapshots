## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.624381 from exp_025
- Best LB score: 70.6261 (exp_024)
- Target: 68.919154 | Gap to target: 1.705 points (2.41%)

## CRITICAL DISCOVERY FROM LOOP 30 ANALYSIS

**THE GAP IS ENTIRELY IN N=51-200, NOT N=1-50!**

Analysis comparing our scores to Paul Jurczak's reference (N=1-50):
- Our N=1-50 sum: 19.033316
- Paul Jurczak N=1-50: 19.097400
- **We are BETTER than Paul by 0.064 points!**
- We beat Paul on 32 out of 50 N values

**WHERE THE GAP ACTUALLY IS:**
- Our N=51-200 sum: 51.591065
- Required N=51-200 to hit target: 49.885838
- **Need to reduce N=51-200 by 1.705 points (3.31% improvement)**

This means:
1. ❌ Optimizing N=1-50 further is USELESS - we're already better than reference
2. ✅ ALL improvement must come from N=51-200
3. ✅ Need ~0.011 improvement per N on average for N=51-200

## Response to Evaluator

The evaluator correctly identified that:
1. All local search approaches have converged to the same optimum
2. 6 consecutive experiments with ZERO improvement
3. Need fundamentally different approach

**Key insight from my analysis:** The evaluator suggested comparing against Paul Jurczak's reference scores. I did this and discovered we're ALREADY BETTER than Paul for N=1-50! The gap is entirely in N=51-200.

The evaluator's suggestion to use high-precision arithmetic and interactive editor for small N is now DEPRIORITIZED because small N is not where our gap is.

## Recommended Approaches (Priority Order)

### 1. **[HIGHEST PRIORITY] Focus on N=51-200 Optimization**

The entire 1.705 point gap is in N=51-200. Approaches to try:

a) **Tessellation patterns for large N** - Chris Deotte's discussion mentions tessellations work better for large N
b) **Chistyakov's corner rebuild approach** - The kernel "new-simple-fix-rebuild-large-layout-from-corners" specifically targets large N by rebuilding from corners
c) **Different grid configurations** - The jiweiliu kernel generates many grid configs but we only tested N=20-200 with 2-seed patterns

### 2. **[HIGH PRIORITY] Search for Better N=51-200 Solutions in Snapshots**

Analysis showed:
- Best snapshot (21145966992) has score 70.573 but is INVALID (72 overlapping groups)
- All VALID snapshots converge to ~70.624
- Need to find or generate VALID solutions with better N=51-200 scores

### 3. **[HIGH PRIORITY] Implement Chistyakov Corner Rebuild**

The kernel shows:
- Take a large N layout (e.g., N=111)
- Select a corner of the bounding box
- Sort trees by distance from corner
- Rebuild smaller N layouts by taking closest trees first
- This can propagate good large-N solutions to smaller N values

### 4. **[MEDIUM PRIORITY] Try Different Tessellation Patterns**

For N=51-200, try:
- Hexagonal packing instead of rectangular grid
- Different rotation patterns (not just 0°/180°)
- Asymmetric layouts (discussion 666880 claims these outperform symmetric)

### 5. **[MEDIUM PRIORITY] Ensemble from Multiple Large-N Sources**

For each N in 51-200:
- Check all snapshots for that specific N
- Pick the best VALID solution
- This is different from our previous ensemble which focused on all N

## What NOT to Try

1. ❌ More SA/bbox3 optimization - converges to same local optimum
2. ❌ Optimizing N=1-50 - we're already better than reference
3. ❌ High-precision arithmetic for small N - not where the gap is
4. ❌ Interactive editor for small N - not where the gap is
5. ❌ Random restart SA - random configs are worse than baseline

## SUBMISSION STRATEGY
- Remaining submissions: 89
- Submit after this experiment? YES - we have abundant submissions
- Even if no improvement, LB feedback is valuable

## Validation Notes
- CV scheme: Exact score computation (deterministic)
- LB matches CV exactly (verified across 8+ submissions)
- All solutions must pass Shapely overlap validation

## Key Metrics to Track
- N=51-200 sum (current: 51.591, target: 49.886)
- Per-N improvements for large N
- Overlap validation status
