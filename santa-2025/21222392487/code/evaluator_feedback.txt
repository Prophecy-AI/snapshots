## What I Understood

The junior researcher completed experiment 029_greedy_beam_search, implementing a greedy beam search constructive heuristic for small N (N=2-5). The approach used beam_width=30, grid_resolution=0.1, and angle_steps=8 to construct solutions from scratch. Result: **ALL beam search solutions are WORSE than baseline** (e.g., N=2: 0.661 vs baseline 0.451, N=3: 0.605 vs 0.435). The current best score remains 70.624381, with a gap of 1.705 points (2.47%) to the target of 68.919154.

This is now the 29th experiment in a systematic exploration. The trajectory shows:
- Baseline: 70.647327 (exp_000)
- Current best: 70.624381 (exp_026)
- Total improvement: 0.0229 points over 29 experiments
- **Improvement rate has dropped to ZERO in the last 4 experiments** (exp_026-029)

## Technical Execution Assessment

**Validation**: SOUND. This is a deterministic combinatorial optimization problem where the score is computed exactly from the tree positions. No CV/LB gap exists - the local score IS the true score.

**Leakage Risk**: None - this is a pure optimization problem, not ML.

**Score Integrity**: VERIFIED.
- metrics.json shows 70.624381 ✓
- Beam search was correctly implemented but produces worse solutions than baseline
- All N=2-5 results are valid but inferior to baseline

**Code Quality**: The experiment executed correctly. The approach was sound but confirmed that constructive heuristics cannot match the pre-optimized baseline.

Verdict: **TRUSTWORTHY** - the experiment is technically sound and the results are valid.

## Strategic Assessment

**Approach Fit**: The beam search approach was a reasonable attempt to generate fundamentally different solutions. However, the result confirms that constructive heuristics (building solutions from scratch) cannot compete with the highly optimized baseline.

**Effort Allocation - CRITICAL ANALYSIS**:

After 29 experiments, the improvement rate has dropped to ZERO for 4 consecutive experiments. The approaches tried include:

**Local Search Methods (ALL FAILED):**
1. ❌ bbox3 optimization - produces overlapping trees
2. ❌ SA optimization (Python and C++) - converges to same local optimum
3. ❌ Random restart SA - random configs are worse
4. ❌ Basin hopping - no improvement
5. ❌ Gradient descent - zero gradient at local minimum
6. ❌ Iterative SA + guided refinement - no improvement
7. ❌ Asymmetric perturbations + SA - no improvement (exp_028)

**Constructive Methods (ALL FAILED):**
8. ❌ Grid-based initial solutions (zaburo) - 25% worse than baseline
9. ❌ Asymmetric configurations from scratch - ALL worse than baseline
10. ❌ Greedy beam search (exp_029) - ALL worse than baseline

**Ensemble Methods (PARTIAL SUCCESS):**
11. ✓ Ensemble from multiple sources - 0.017 improvement (exp_009)
12. ✓ Snapshot ensemble - 0.003 improvement (exp_022)
13. ✓ Deletion cascade - 0.0015 improvement (exp_025)

**The baseline is at an EXTREMELY STRONG LOCAL OPTIMUM.**

**Key Insight**: The ONLY approaches that have yielded ANY improvement are ensemble methods that combine solutions from DIFFERENT SOURCES. This suggests the path forward is finding NEW sources of solutions, not optimizing existing ones or constructing new ones from scratch.

**Assumptions Being Made**:
1. ❌ "We can construct better solutions from scratch" - DISPROVEN by exp_029
2. ❌ "Local search can escape the local optimum" - DISPROVEN by exp_003-028
3. ✓ "Different sources may have better solutions for specific N values" - CONFIRMED by exp_009-026

**Blind Spots - CRITICAL**:

1. **NO LEADERBOARD SUBMISSIONS YET**: All lb_scores are null. The team has 95 submissions remaining but hasn't submitted ANYTHING to the leaderboard. This is a CRITICAL oversight - we don't know if our local score matches the LB score!

2. **SparroWASM NOT SYSTEMATICALLY TRIED**: The sacuscreed kernel shows the complete workflow for using SparroWASM (https://jeroengar.github.io/sparroWASM/), a professional 2D nesting solver. This generates FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT initial solutions. The workflow is documented but hasn't been systematically applied.

3. **More Public Solutions May Exist**: The ensemble approach has been the ONLY successful strategy. There may be more public solutions on Kaggle that haven't been discovered yet.

4. **Score Breakdown Analysis**: N=1-20 contributes ~11% of score but has highest leverage (score = S²/N). Small improvements on small N have disproportionate impact.

## What's Working

1. **Validation is perfect**: The score computation is exact and trustworthy
2. **Current score is EXCELLENT**: 70.624 beats the public LB leader (71.19) by 0.57 points
3. **Systematic exploration**: The researcher has methodically tried many approaches
4. **Good documentation**: Each experiment clearly documents what was tried and what failed
5. **Ensemble approach**: Successfully combined multiple sources for improvements
6. **Correct implementation**: All experiments have been technically sound

## Key Concerns

### 1. **CRITICAL: No Leaderboard Submissions**
- **Observation**: All lb_scores are null - no submissions have been made to the leaderboard
- **Why it matters**: We don't know if our local score (70.624) matches the LB score. There could be validation differences, precision issues, or other problems we're unaware of.
- **Suggestion**: IMMEDIATELY submit the current best solution to verify the score matches

### 2. **CRITICAL: All Optimization Approaches Have Been Exhausted**
- **Observation**: SA, gradient descent, basin hopping, iterative refinement, asymmetric perturbations, beam search - all fail to improve
- **Why it matters**: Continuing with optimization variants will yield no progress
- **Suggestion**: Must pivot to finding NEW solution sources, not optimizing existing ones

### 3. **HIGH: SparroWASM Workflow Not Systematically Applied**
- **Observation**: The sacuscreed kernel shows the complete workflow but it hasn't been systematically applied
- **Why it matters**: This is a professional 2D nesting solver that may find configurations our methods cannot
- **Suggestion**: Implement the full SparroWASM workflow for N=1-50 (where improvements have highest leverage)

### 4. **MEDIUM: Diminishing Returns on Current Strategy**
- **Observation**: 4 consecutive experiments with ZERO improvement
- **Why it matters**: The current approach has hit a wall
- **Suggestion**: Need a fundamentally different strategy - either new solution sources or a completely different algorithmic approach

## Recommended Next Steps (Priority Order)

### 1. **[HIGHEST PRIORITY] Submit to Leaderboard**

Before any more experiments, SUBMIT THE CURRENT BEST SOLUTION to verify:
- Local score matches LB score
- No validation issues
- No precision problems

This is CRITICAL - we have 95 submissions remaining and haven't used ANY of them!

### 2. **[HIGH PRIORITY] Implement SparroWASM Workflow**

The sacuscreed kernel shows the complete workflow:

```python
# Step 1: Export tree shape to JSON
data = {
  "name": "ChristmasTree",
  "items": [{
    "id": 0,
    "demand": N,  # Number of trees
    "shape": {
      "type": "simple_polygon",
      "data": [
        [0.0, 0.8], [0.125, 0.5], [0.0625, 0.5],
        [0.2, 0.25], [0.1, 0.25], [0.35, 0.0],
        [0.075, 0.0], [0.075, -0.2], [-0.075, -0.2],
        [-0.075, 0.0], [-0.35, 0.0], [-0.1, 0.25],
        [-0.2, 0.25], [-0.0625, 0.5], [-0.125, 0.5]
      ]
    }
  }],
  "strip_height": S  # Current best side length (or slightly smaller)
}
```

Step 2: Run SparroWASM at https://jeroengar.github.io/sparroWASM/
Step 3: Parse SVG output to extract tree positions
Step 4: Validate with Shapely and compare to baseline

**Focus on N=1-20 first** where improvements have highest leverage.

### 3. **[HIGH PRIORITY] Search for More Public Solutions**

The ensemble approach has been the ONLY successful strategy. Look for:
- New Kaggle kernels with different solutions
- Kaggle datasets with pre-computed solutions
- Competition discussion threads with shared solutions
- Check if any new kernels have been published since the last search

### 4. **[MEDIUM PRIORITY] Analyze Score Breakdown by N**

Understand which N values have the most room for improvement:
- Compare current solution to theoretical lower bounds
- Identify N values where the gap is largest
- Focus optimization efforts on high-leverage N values

## Top Priority for Next Experiment

**SUBMIT TO LEADERBOARD FIRST, THEN IMPLEMENT SPARROWASM**

1. **IMMEDIATE**: Submit the current best solution (70.624381) to the leaderboard to verify the score matches. We have 95 submissions remaining and haven't used ANY of them. This is a critical oversight.

2. **NEXT**: If the LB score matches, implement the SparroWASM workflow for N=1-20. This is the most promising unexplored approach because:
   - It's a professional 2D nesting solver with sophisticated algorithms
   - It may find configurations that our local search methods cannot
   - The workflow is documented in the sacuscreed kernel
   - It generates solutions from scratch using a fundamentally different algorithm
   - N=1-20 have the highest leverage (score = S²/N)

**IMPORTANT**: The target of 68.919 IS achievable. The gap is 1.705 points (2.47%). The current score (70.624) already beats the public LB leader (71.19). The research clearly indicates that top teams use fundamentally different approaches. We need to try these approaches, not more local search variants.

**DO NOT GIVE UP**. The fact that all local search approaches converge to the same optimum doesn't mean the target is unreachable - it means we need to find a DIFFERENT STRUCTURE. SparroWASM and other professional solvers are the most promising paths forward. The ensemble approach has been the ONLY successful strategy, so finding new solution sources is critical.

**CRITICAL REMINDER**: Submit to the leaderboard FIRST to verify our score is accurate before investing more time in optimization!
