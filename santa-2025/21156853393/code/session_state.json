      "finding": "2\u2011D polygon packing with the goal of minimizing the enclosing bounding box is a classic NP\u2011hard problem, so most practical approaches combine exact search with strong pruning and fast heuristics.  The most successful exact methods use a branch\u2011and\u2011bound framework that derives tight lower\u2011bounds from a one\u2011dimensional bin\u2011packing relaxation and applies dominance conditions to discard large families of partial layouts; these ideas were pioneered for rectangle packing and later extended to arbitrary polygons\u202f([aaai.org](https://cdn.aaai.org/ICAPS/2003/ICAPS03-029.pdf),\u202f[aaai.org](https://cdn.aaai.org/ICAPS/2004/ICAPS04-019.pdf)).  A meta\u2011CSP formulation that treats pairwise relative placement constraints as variables further exploits geometric symmetry and yields additional pruning, making optimal search competitive on instances with large or irregular pieces\u202f([unl.edu](https://cse.unl.edu/~choueiry/Documents/Moffitt-ICAPS06.pdf)).
