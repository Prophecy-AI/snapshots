A link will be provided\nin a future version of this document.\narXiv:2308.08523v1 [cs.CG] 16 Aug 2023\n2 Improved Approximations for Translational Packing of Convex Polygons\n1 Introduction\nMany real-life situations require us to make decisions about optimally packing a collection\nof objects into a specific container. One particular category of these packing problems is\ntwo-dimensional packing, which is encountered in everyday scenarios like arranging items\non a shelf and in industrial applications such as cutting cookies from rolled-out dough\nor manufacturing sets of tiles from standard-sized panels made of wood, glass, or metal.\nAnother intriguing example involves cutting fabric pieces for clothing production. In this\ncase, the pieces often cannot be rotated freely, as they must adhere to a desired pattern\nin the final product, which is tailored of multiple elements. The widespread applicability\nof two-dimensional packing problems has led to a surge of interest in designing efficient\nalgorithms to address them. In this paper, we follow the line of research and study the\nproblem of packing convex polygons without rotations in various settings depending on the\ntype of containers used.\nPast research focusing on theoretical considerations of two-dimensional packings mainly\nconcentrates on the scenario when all objects are axis-parallel rectangles. In this paper, we\nwill discuss packing without rotations, in which only translations are permitted. There are\ntwo main classes of the problem depending on whether the size of the container is fixed and\nwe want to minimize the number of containers used or whether we want to minimize the\ncontainer\u2019s size with respect to some objective function.\nA seminal example of the first class is the Geometric Bin Packing problem in which\na number of unit size squared bins to pack is to be minimized. The problem is arguably\nthe most natural generalization of the regular (1D) Bin Packing to two dimensions, and\nits absolute approximability has been fully understood. Unless P = N P, the best possible\nefficient constant factor approximation is 2 [15], and such an algorithm is known [10].\nIn the second class, there are several variants to be considered. An example is the\nStrip Packing Problem which is concerned with packing objects into a strip of width\n1 and infinite height in such a way that the maximum of all the heights of the placed\nobjects is minimized. Like Geometric Bin Packing, Strip Packing generalizes (1D)\nBin Packing. The best known efficient constant factor approximation for Strip Packing\nhas approximation factor (5/3 + \u03f5) [9]. It is known that there can not exist a polynomial\ntime algorithm with an approximation ratio of (3/2 \u2212 \u03f5) for any \u03f5 > 0 unless P = N P, which\nfollows directly from the approximation hardness of (1D) Bin Packing. Both classes of\nproblems have been also considered in the asymptotic setting, see e.g. [11, 5, 12].\nIn younger time, there was also an increase of interest in cases where the objects in\nquestion are general convex polygons. Alt, de Berg and Knauer [2, 3] considered the problem\nof packing an instance consisting of a number of convex polygons of the form p \u2282 [0, 1]2into\na minimum area axis-parallel rectangular container. We refer to this problem as Polygon\nArea Minimization throughout this paper. In the special case where the instance consists\nof rectangles only, the problem is known to admit a PTAS [4]. They proved the existence of\nthe following efficient algorithm:\nA 23.78-approximation for Polygon Area Minimization.\nRecently, Aamand, Abrahamsen, Beretta and Kleist [1] showed that the algorithm of Alt,\nde Berg and Knauer can be leveraged to obtain also efficient approximation algorithms of\nfurther problems:\nA 7-approximation for Polygon Perimeter Minimization.\nA 51-approximation for Polygon Strip Packing.\nAn 11-approximation for Polygon Bin Packing for polygons with diameter at most 1\n10 .\nA. Kurpisz and S. Suter 3\n1.1 Our results\nThe results of Alt, de Berg and Knauer [2, 3] and Aamand et al. [1] are heavily based on\nso-called shelf packing algorithms. In shelf packing algorithms, the objects are first placed\non the shelves, possibly ordered by height, which are later stacked on one another to build\na final solution. Compared to axis-parallel rectangles, the main challenge in designing an\napproximation algorithm for polygon packing problems is that objects cannot be sorted by\nheight and orientation simultaneously. As a result, the algorithm and its analysis in [2, 3]\nhave such a large approximation guarantee. In this paper, we provide new insight into how\nshelf packing algorithms should be applied to polygon packing problems. We introduce a\nsequence of transformations of the objects that allow us first to sort them by height and later\nby orientation to build a solution of a much better approximation guarantee. More precisely,\nwe design polynomial-time algorithms with the following factors:\nA 9.45-approximation for Polygon Area Minimization.\nUsing this algorithm as a subroutine, we build upon the methods from Aamand et al. [1] to\nobtain the following efficient approximation algorithms:\nA (3.75 + \u03f5)-approximation for Polygon Perimeter Minimization.\nA 21.89-approximation for Polygon Strip Packing.\nA 5.09-approximation for Polygon Bin Packing for polygons which have their diameter\nbounded by 1\n10 .\nThe results are proved in Sections 4, 5, 6, and 7 respectively. Furthermore, in Section 8\nwe show the following results, which make progress towards solving an open question of a\nO(1)-approximation algorithm for Polygon Bin Packing for arbitrary polygons.\nThere is an efficient O(\n1\n\u03b4\n)-approximation algorithm for Polygon Bin Packing for\ninstances where each polygon has width or height at most 1 \u2212 \u03b4.\nThere is an efficient O(1)-approximation algorithm for Polygon Bin Packing for\ninstances with the property that all polygons share a spine (up to translation) with height\nat least 3\n4\n.\n2 Preliminaries\nWe start out considerations by recalling a classical and well-known problem in theoretical\ncomputer science, the Bin Packing problem: Given a list of numbers s1, . . . , sn \u2208 (0, 1] \u2229 Q,\nrepresenting the sizes of n objects, the goal is to find the minimum number of bins of size 1,\nso that we can pac...",

      "text": "Optimal Rectangle Packing: Initial Results\nRichard E. Korf\nComputer Science Department\nUniversity of California, Los Angeles\nLos Angeles, CA 90095\nkorf@cs.ucla.edu\nAbstract\nGiven a set of rectangles with fixed orientations, we want to\nfind an enclosing rectangle of minimum area that contains\nthem all with no overlap. Many simple scheduling tasks can\nbe modelled by this NP-complete problem. We use an any\u0002time branch-and-bound algorithm to solve the problem op\u0002timally. Our main contributions are a lower-bound on the\namount of wasted space in a partial solution, based on a re\u0002laxation of the problem to one-dimensional bin packing, and\na dominance condition that allows us to ignore many par\u0002tial solutions. For our experiments, we choose a class of in\u0002creasingly difficult square-packing problems as a simple and\neasily-specified benchmark. The square-packing problem of\nsize N is to find the smallest rectangle that contains the 1x1,\n2x2, etc. up to NxN square. We find optimal solutions to\nthese problems up to size N=22. For comparison, we also\nfind the best slicing solutions, a popular approximation al\u0002gorithm. Our approach is rather general, and many of our\ntechniques can be applied to packing non-rectangular shapes\nin non-rectangular enclosing regions, and higher-dimensional\npacking problems as well.\nIntroduction and Overview\nConsider the following very simple scheduling problem: We\nhave a set of independent jobs, each of which requires a cer\u0002tain number of workers for a certain amount of time. We as\u0002sume that the jobs are indivisible, meaning they can\u2019t be bro\u0002ken down into smaller subtasks. If they can be decomposed,\nwe break them down into their indivisible components, and\nthen consider the components as jobs. All workers work the\nsame hours, and are paid for their whole shift, whether they\nare busy or idle. We can adjust the number of workers, and\nthe total amount of time. We\u2019d like to minimize the total\nlabor cost to complete all the jobs, which is proportional to\nthe number of workers times the number of hours they are\nat work. Alternatively, we may want to complete all jobs as\nquickly as possible, using as many workers as necessary. As\nanother alternative, we may want to minimize the number of\nworkers, and complete all the jobs as soon as possible given\nthat number of workers. A closely related problem is how to\nschedule a set of tasks that require a certain resource level,\nsuch as electric power on a spacecraft, for a given amount\nCopyright \u0001c 2003, American Association for Artificial Intelli\u0002gence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved.\nof time, so that all tasks are completed as soon as possible\nwithout exceeding a maximum resource capacity.\nWe can model these problems as rectangle-packing prob\u0002lems. Each job is represented by a rectangle, where one\ndimension is the number of workers needed, and the other\nis the amount of time required. The total number of work\u0002ers is the height of an enclosing rectangle, and the length\nof time is the width. All the job rectangles must be packed\ninto the enclosing rectangle, with no overlap. Minimizing\nthe total labor cost amounts to finding the enclosing rect\u0002angle of minimum area that contains all the job rectangles.\nTo minimize the number of workers, we want an enclosing\nrectangle of minimum width, whose height is the maximum\nnumber of workers needed for any job. Similarly, to mini\u0002mize the amount of time, we want an enclosing rectangle of\nminimum height, whose width is the amount of time needed\nfor the longest job.\nOf course, in reality there will be other constraints on the\njobs, such as precedence constraints between jobs. Such\nconstraints can be easily added to our solution algorithm, re\u0002sulting in the pruning of partial solutions that don\u2019t satisify\nthe constraints. This pruning will make it easier to deter\u0002mine that a particular enclosing rectangle can\u2019t contain all\nthe job rectangles, but potentially more difficult to find a\nfeasible solution within a particular enclosing rectangle. For\nsimplicity, we consider the unconstrained case here, which\nis a subproblem of the more general case.\nRectangle packing has other applications as well. In the\ndesign of VLSI chips, circuit blocks such as processors,\nmemory, and I/O drivers must be assigned to physical re\u0002gions of the chip. Another application is cutting a set of\nrectangles out of a single piece of stock material. A re\u0002lated problem is loading a set of rectangular objects onto a\ncargo pallet. An important difference between the schedul\u0002ing problem described above and these other applications\nis that in the scheduling problem the orientation of the job\nrectangles is fixed, since workers and time are often not in\u0002terchangeable. In VLSI design or cutting-stock problems,\nhowever, we can rotate our rectangles by ninety degrees. In\nthis paper, we consider the fixed-orientation problem, and\nonly briefly discuss the extension to unoriented rectangles.\nWe focus here on optimal solutions, but develop an any\u0002time algorithm. In other words, our algorithm finds an ap\u0002proximate solution immediately, and as it continues to run it\nICAPS 2003 287 \nFrom: ICAPS-03 Proceedings. Copyright \u00a9 2003, AAAI (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved. \nfinds better solutions, until it eventually finds and verifies an\noptimal solution. This eliminates solution quality as a vari\u0002able in comparisons with other work. Furthermore, finding\noptimal solutions allows us to characterize the quality of ap\u0002proximate solutions. For example, we evaluate the quality\nof slicing solutions in our experiments.\nWe first show that rectangle-packing problem is NP\u0002complete, and then briefly consider related work. We then\nconsider how to pack a set of rectangles into an enclosing\nrectangle of fixed dimensions, using a branch-and-bound al\u0002gorithm. In particular, we introduce a lower-bound on the\namount of wasted space in a partial solution, based on a\nrelaxation of the problem to one-dimensional bin packing.\nWe also introduce a dominance condition that allows us to\nprune parts of the search space. We then show how to ef\u0002ficiently search the two-dimensional space of different en\u0002closing rectangles to find one with the smallest area that will\ncontain all the given rectangles. To test our algorithm, we we\nfind the enclosing rectangle of smallest area that will con\u0002tain a 1x1, 2x2, 3x3, etc., up to n \u00d7 n square. We choose\nthe special case of square packing because we can specify\na set of increasingly difficult problem instances with just a\nsingle parameter n, making it easier for other researchers to\ncompare their results to ours. Our algorithms, however, do\nnot take advantage of the fact that our rectangles are squares,\nwith one minor exception. We present optimal solutions for\nall problems up to size n = 22, and also the best of a class\nof approximate solutions. Finally, we conclude with further\nideas to improve the performance of our algorithms and gen\u0002eralize our techniques.\nRectangle Packing is NP-Complete\nThe specific decision problem we consider in this section is\ngiven a set of rectangles with fixed orientation, and a specific\nenclosing rectangle, can all the given rectangles fit within the\nboundaries of the enclosing rectangle without any overlap?\nWe show that this problem is NP-complete, by showing that\nthe problem is in NP, and that it is NP-hard.\nIt is clear that this problem can be solved in non\u0002deterministic polynomial time. Given an assignment of the\nrectangles to positions within the enclosing rectangle, it is\neasy to check in polynomial time that no rectangle extends\nbeyond the boundary of the enclosing rectangle, and that no\ntwo rectangles overlap.\nTo show that rectangle packing is NP-hard, we demon\u0002strate that bin packing can be reduced in polynomial time to\nrectangle packing. In other words, if rectangle packing can\nbe solved in polynomial time, then so can bin packing. An\ninstance of the bin-packing decision problem consists of a\nset of numbers, along with a fixed set of bins, each with the\nsame fi...",

      "text": "Optimal Rectangle Packing: A Meta-CSP Approach\nMichael D. Moffitt and Martha E. Pollack\nDepartment of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science\nUniversity of Michigan\nAnn Arbor, MI 48109, USA\n{mmoffitt, pollackm}@eecs.umich.edu\nAbstract\nWe present a new approach to optimal rectangle packing, an\nNP-complete problem that can be used to model many sim\u0002ple scheduling tasks. Recent attempts at incorporating artifi\u0002cial intelligence search techniques to the problem of rectangle\npacking have focused on a CSP formulation, in which partial\nassignments are defined to be the fixed placement of a sub\u0002set of rectangles. Our technique takes a significant departure\nfrom this search space, as we instead view partial assignments\nas subsets of relative pairwise relationships between rectan\u0002gles. This approach recalls the meta-CSP commonly con\u0002structed in constraint-based temporal reasoning, and is thus a\ncandidate for several pruning techniques that have been de\u0002veloped in that field. We apply these to the domain of rect\u0002angle packing, and develop a suite of new techniques that ex\u0002ploit both the symmetry and geometry present in this partic\u0002ular domain. We then provide experimental results demon\u0002strating that our approach performs competitively compared\nto the previous state-of-the-art on a series of benchmarks,\nmatching or surpassing it in speed on nearly all instances.\nFinally, we conjecture that our technique is particularly ap\u0002propriate for problems containing large rectangles, which are\ndifficult for the fixed-placement formulation to handle effi\u0002ciently.\nIntroduction\nThe problem of rectangle packing is one that has drawn at\u0002tention from several diverse fields of computer science. For\ninstance, in the context of scheduling, it can be used to rep\u0002resent scenarios where jobs require a fixed amount of time\nand resources, which compose the two dimensions of a sin\u0002gle rectangle. The task of packing many such rectangles into\nan enclosing space, so as to minimize the width, height, or\narea of this space, allows for the minimization of makespan,\nresources needed, or total wasted resource. In VLSI design,\nrectangles represent actual physical modules that need to be\nplaced in a spatial arrangement such that no two modules\noverlap.\nOne of the more recent approaches (Korf 2003) has cast\noptimal rectangle packing as a constraint satisfaction prob\u0002lem (CSP). In this formulation, a variable is created for each\nrectangle, whose legal values are the positions that rectan\u0002gle could occupy without exceeding the boundaries of the\nenclosing space. In addition, there is a binary constraint\nbetween each pair of rectangles, requiring that they do not\nCopyright \u0001c 2006, American Association for Artificial Intelli\u0002gence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved.\noverlap. To solve this CSP, Korf developed a backtracking\nalgorithm, where each partial assignment is defined to be\nthe fixed placement of a subset of rectangles. By obtaining\nlower bounds on the amount of wasted space at each node in\nthe search, an efficient algorithm is constructed, which was\nlater refined (Korf 2004) into the fastest known algorithm\nfor optimal rectangle packing.\nIn this paper, we present a new approach to rectangle\npacking. Specifically, we cast the problem of optimally\npacking a set of rectangles with fixed orientations as a meta\u0002CSP. In this formulation, we create a meta-variable for each\npair of rectangles, whose values are the four pairwise re\u0002lationships (i.e., above, below, left of, right of) that pre\u0002vent that pair from overlapping. As such, commitment to\nthe exact placement of any rectangle is not established un\u0002til a consistent solution has been generated. In this regard,\nour approach resembles graph-based methods for optimal\nrectangle packing (Onodera, Taniguchi, & Tamaru 1991),\nwhich have previously been unable to cope with more than a\nsmall handful of rectangles. The key difference in our meta\u0002CSP formulation is the introduction of modern artificial\u0002intelligence search techniques that greatly increase the effi\u0002ciency of exploring this alternative space. Some of these are\ndrawn from literature on constraint-based temporal reason\u0002ing (Dechter, Meiri, & Pearl 1991; Stergiou & Koubarakis\n1998; Tsamardinos & Pollack 2003), while others are en\u0002tirely new techniques that exploit the symmetry and geom\u0002etry present in this particular domain. We combine these\nmethods to create the BLUEBLOCKER solver, and provide ex\u0002perimental results demonstrating that our approach performs\ncompetitively compared to the previous state-of-the-art on a\nseries of benchmarks. Finally, we conjecture that our tech\u0002nique is particularly appropriate for problems containing\nlarge rectangles, which are difficult for the fixed-placement\nformulation to handle efficiently.\nBackground\nRectangle Packing\nConsider the following problem: we are given a set of N\njobs, where each job j requires a specific number of workers\n(or machines) mj and a specific amount of uninterrupted\nprocessing time pj . Assuming that all workers are paid the\nsame salary and work the same hours, one may wish to find\na schedule that minimizes the total cost of labor (which is\nproportional to the product of number of workers and the\ntotal hours worked).\n93\nThis problem can be approximated as a rectangle pack\u0002ing problem.1 Specifically, each job can be represented by a\nrectangle, with width wj being equal to the time required pj ,\nand height hj being equal to the required number of work\u0002ers mj . Minimizing the total labor cost is then equivalent to\nfinding an enclosing rectangle of dimensions W \u00d7 H whose\ntotal area is minimal. We refer to this as the Minimal Bound\u0002ing Box Problem. The decision variant of this, where the di\u0002mensions of the enclosing space are specified, we refer to as\nthe Containment Problem.\nPrevious work on rectangle packing has primarily focused\non generating approximate or suboptimal solutions, using\ntechniques such as genetic algorithms and simulated anneal\u0002ing. To facilitate these approaches, a number of data struc\u0002tures have been developed to represent a layout of rectangles\nincluding sequence pairs (Murata et al. 1995), BSG struc\u0002tures (Nakatake et al. 1996), and O-Trees (Guo, Cheng, &\nYoshimura 1999). We omit the details of such structures, as\nthey are largely unrelated to our formulation.\nThe first line of research to consider optimal two\u0002dimensional compactions of rectangles (Onodera,\nTaniguchi, & Tamaru 1991) applied a branch-and-bound\napproach, using a graph algorithm to maintain consistency\nat each step of the backtracking search. Extensions of\nthis method have been largely avoided, as it was shown to\nhandle no more than six rectangles tractably. More recently,\nan algorithm using the O-Tree representation was able\nto surpass this record by efficiently handling up to nine\nrectangles (Chan & Markov 2004).\nRectangle Packing as a CSP\nOne of the more distinctive approaches to rectangle packing\n(Korf 2003) applied artificial intelligence search techniques\nwith great success. In this work, rectangle packing is mod\u0002eled as a binary constraint satisfaction problem. There is a\nvariable for each rectangle, whose legal values are the po\u0002sitions it could occupy without exceeding the boundaries of\nthe enclosing space. In addition, there is a binary constraint\nbetween each pair of rectangles that they cannot overlap.\nTo solve this CSP, a backtracking algorithm is used. At\neach node in the search, a rectangle is given a fixed posi\u0002tion within the enclosing space. This is accomplished by\n\u201cdrawing\u201d the rectangle (or an outline of the rectangle) onto\na bitmap representing the entire area. For example, one such\npartial assignment is depicted in Figure 1. Here, two rect\u0002angles (in fact, squares) have been given assignments. The\nupper-left corner of the 6\u00d76 square has been placed at (0, 0),\nand the upper-left corner of the 5\u00d75 square has been placed\nat (6, 0). Suppose we have four more squares remaining,\nwith dimensions 4\u00d74, 3\u00d73, 2\u00d72, and 1\u00d71; by visual in\u0002spection...",

      "text": "Optimal Rectangle Packing: New Results\nRichard E. Korf\nComputer Science Department\nUniversity of California, Los Angeles\nLos Angeles, CA 90095\nkorf@cs.ucla.edu\nAbstract\nWe present new results on the problem of finding an enclos\u0002ing rectangle of minimum area that will contain a given a set\nof rectangles. Many simple scheduling tasks can be mod\u0002elled by this NP-complete problem. We present a new lower\nbound on the amount of wasted space in a partial solution, a\nnew dominance condition that prunes many partial solutions,\nand extend our algorithms to packing unoriented rectangles.\nFor our experiments, we consider the set of squares of size\n1x1, 2x2,...,NxN, and find the smallest rectangle that can con\u0002tain them for a given value of N. While previously we solved\nthis problem up to N=22, we extend this to N=25. Overall,\nour new program is over an order of magnitude faster than\nour previous program running on the same machine. We also\nshow that for the larger problems, our optimal algorithm is\nfaster than one that finds the best slicing solution, a popular\napproximation algorithm. In addition, we solve an open prob\u0002lem dating to 1966, concerning packing the set of consecutive\nsquares up to 24x24 in a square of size 70x70.\nIntroduction\nAn Open Square-Packing Problem\nIf we take a 1x1 square, a 2x2 square, etc. up to a 24x24\nsquare, the sum of the areas of these squares is 4900, which\nis 702. This is the only nontrivial sum of consecutive\nsquares starting with one which is a perfect square(Wat\u0002son 1918). (Bitner & Reingold 1975) showed by a com\u0002puter search that these 24 squares cannot all be packed into\na 70x70 square with no overlap. In his Sept. 1966 Scien\u0002tific American Mathematical Games column (Gardner 1966;\n1975), Martin Gardner asked his readers what is the largest\narea of the 70x70 square that can be covered by these\nsquares, a problem he attributes to Richard B. Britton.\nTwenty-seven readers sent in very similar solutions that left\n49 square units uncovered, leaving out the 7x7 square. We\nshow here for the first time that this is the best one can do.\nRectangle Packing\nConsider the following simple scheduling problem: We have\na set of independent and indivisible jobs, each requiring a\ncertain number of workers for a certain time. All workers\nCopyright \rc 2004, American Association for Artificial Intelli\u0002gence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved.\nwork the same hours, and are paid for the total time, whether\nthey are busy or idle. We can adjust the number of workers,\nand the total time, to minimize the total labor cost, which\nis proportional to the product of the number of workers and\nthe total time. Alternatively, we may want to complete all\njobs as quickly as possible, using as many workers as nec\u0002essary, or minimize the number of workers, taking as much\ntime as needed. A closely-related problem is scheduling a\nset of tasks that require a certain resource, such as electric\npower on a spacecraft, for a given amount of time, so that all\ntasks are completed as soon as possible without exceeding\nthe maximum resource capacity.\nWe can model these problems as rectangle-packing prob\u0002lems. Each job is represented by a rectangle, whose height is\nthe amount of resource needed, and whose width is the time\nrequired. The total amount of resource is the height of an en\u0002closing rectangle, and the total time is the width. All the job\nrectangles must be packed into the enclosing rectangle, with\nno overlap. To minimize the total cost, we want an enclosing\nrectangle of minimum area. To minimize the amount of re\u0002source, we want an enclosing rectangle of minimum width,\nwhose height is the maximum amount of resource needed\nfor any job. Similarly, to minimize the time, we want an\nenclosing rectangle of minimum height, whose width is the\ntime needed for the longest job.\nIn practice there may be other considerations, such as\nprecedence constraints between jobs. These can be added to\nour solution algorithm, pruning partial solutions that don\u2019t\nsatisfy the constraints. This will make it easier to determine\nthat a particular enclosing rectangle can\u2019t contain all the job\nrectangles, but more difficult to find a feasible solution with\na particular enclosing rectangle. For simplicity, we consider\nthe unconstrained case here.\nRectangle packing has other applications as well. One\nis loading a set of rectangular objects onto a cargo pallet,\nwithout stacking objects. In the design of VLSI chips, cir\u0002cuit blocks must be assigned to physical regions of the chip.\nAnother application is cutting a set of rectangles out of a\nrectangular piece of stock material.\nIn scheduling, the orientation of job rectangles is fixed,\nsince resources and time are rarely interchangeable. In VLSI\ndesign, however, we can usually rotate the rectangles ninety\ndegrees. Cargo-loading also involves unoriented rectangles,\nwhile in cutting-stock problems the rectangles may be ori\u0002142 ICAPS 2004 \nFrom: ICAPS-04 Proceedings.

We consider both cases here.\nRelated Work\nMost work on rectangle packing deals with approximate\nrather than optimal solutions. Our previous paper on this\nsubject (Korf 2003) represents the current state of the art,\nand contains comparisons to prior work. We showed that\noptimal rectangle-packing is NP-complete. We also intro\u0002duced the benchmark of finding the enclosing rectangle of\nsmallest area that will contain the 1x1, 2x2,...,NxN square,\nand solved the problem for N up to 22.\nOverview\nWe first consider packing a set of rectangles into a fixed en\u0002closing rectangle, and then describe how to search the space\nof enclosing rectangles for one of minimum area. We then\nconsider slicing solutions, a popular approximation method.\nWe describe our experimental results, and present further\nwork and conclusions. This paper repeats some of the mate\u0002rial from (Korf 2003), in order to make it self-contained.\nThe three main contributions of this paper are a new lower\nbound on the space wasted in any partial solution, an ad\u0002ditional dominance condition that allows us to prune more\npartial solutions, and the extension to unoriented rectangles.\nWe extend the set of problems we can solve optimally from\nN=22 to N=25, and solve the open problem proposed by\nGardner. Our new program is over an order of magnitude\nfaster than our previous program. It is also faster than our\nprogram for finding slicing solutions, which is only an ap\u0002proximation algorithm.\nAll our experiments involve packing squares, which pro\u0002vides an infinite number of increasingly difficult problem in\u0002stances, each characterized by a single parameter. However,\nour techniques are applicable to the more general rectangle\u0002packing problem as well. Where we take advantage of the\nsymmetry of squares, we also explain the generalization to\nrectangles. We also explain some additional details omitted\nfrom our previous paper, and correct several errors.\nRectangle Packing as a Binary CSP\nFirst we consider the problem of given a fixed enclosing\nrectangle, can we pack a given set of oriented rectangles into\nit? The enclosing rectangle must be at least as wide as the\nmaximum width of any rectangle, and at least as tall as the\nmaximum height of any rectangle. Furthermore, the area of\nthe enclosing rectangle must equal or exceed the sum of the\nareas of the given rectangles.\nThis can be modelled as a binary constraint-satisfaction\nproblem. There is a variable for each rectangle, whose legal\nvalues are the positions it could occupy without exceeding\nthe boundaries of the enclosing rectangle. There is a binary\nconstraint between each pair of rectangles that they cannot\noverlap. This suggests a backtracking algorithm.\nWe place the rectangles in decreasing order of size, in\norder to avoid rearranging smaller rectangles if there is no\nlegal position for the largest unplaced rectangle. We can\ndefine the size of a rectangle by its area, or its maximum di\u0002mension. The latter definition may be better...",

Introduction\nThe two-dimensional (2D) rectangular packing problem is an optimization problem of allocating a set of\nrectangular items to larger containers with the objective of minimizing the waste. The 2D rectangular packing\nproblem has been widely studied in recent decades, as it has numerous applications in the cutting and packing\nindustry, e.g. wood, glass and cloth industries, newspapers paging, VLSI floor planning and so on, with dif\u0002ferent applications incorporating different constraints and objectives (Chan & Markov, 2004; Hifi & Ouafi,\n1998; Lee & Sewell, 1999; Lesh, Marks, & Mcmahon, 2004; Lodi, Martello, & Monaci, 2002). The 2D rect\u0002angular packing problem belongs to a subset of classical cutting and packing problems and has been shown to\nbe an NP hard problem (Hochbaum & Maass, 1985). Therefore, various approximation or heuristic algo\u0002rithms have been proposed for approaching the problem.\nIn rectangle packing, one of the earliest approaches is the so-called bottom-left (BL) heuristic (Baker, Coff\u0002man, & Rivest, 1980). In BL, the rectangles to be placed are, starting from the top-right corner of the con\u0002tainer, first slide vertically downward as far as possible, followed by sliding horizontally as far as possible\nto the left, so as to reduce the number of possible packing patterns. One improved variant of BL is the\n0360-8352/$ - see front matter \u0002 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Both BL and BLF are later used in meta-heuristic based algorithms. Hybrid algorithms\ncombining genetic algorithm (GA) and deterministic methods were proposed by Jakobs (1996), Liu and Teng\n(1999), and Dagli and Poshyanonda (1997). An empirical investigation of the result of different combinations\nof simulated annealing (SA) and GA with various heuristics such as BL or BLF was given by Hopper and\nTurton (2001).\nInspired by enhancing some working experience of professional masons in their everyday work, a Less\nFlexibility First (LFF) packing principle was proposed in Tam et al. (1998); Wu, Huang, and Lau (2002)\nfor solving the rectangular packing problem. Recently, by introducing a tightness measure to represent the\ndegree of fitting between rectangles and placement locations, an enhanced version of LFF, called LFFT,\nwas proposed in Wu, Chan, and SAGA (2005). More recently, a fast heuristic recursive (HR) algorithm based\non divide-and-conquer and greedy strategies was proposed in Zhang, Kang, and Deng (2006), and an effective\nGA, called SPGAL, was proposed in Bortfeldt (2006) for the four subtypes of the 2D strip packing problem.\nBased on the previous studies (Huang, Li, Akeb, & Li, 2005; Tam et al., 1998; Wu et al., 2002), we will\npropose a quite different class of efficient heuristic for the 2D rectangular packing problem in this paper. Dif\u0002ferent from the stochastic search methods where the researches are mainly focused on finding the efficient data\nstructures for presenting packing results so that the search space and the processing time of the underling\nsearch engine can be minimized, our algorithm is a deterministic algorithm and no data structure is needed.\nSimilar to LFF, our algorithm packs the rectangles into the container one by one and each rectangle should be\npacked at a position occupying an empty corner in the container. The computational results of our proposed\nalgorithm is very encouraging in terms of both packing density and running time.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 gives the problem definition. Section 3 describes the\ndetails of the algorithm. Section 4 presents our experimental results for two sets of test instances. We draw our\nconclusions in Section 5.\n2. Problem definition\nWe consider the following rectangular packing problem: given a rectangular empty container with fixed\nwidth and infinite height and a set of rectangles with various sizes, the rectangle packing problem is to pack\neach rectangle into the container such that no two rectangles overlap and the used height of the container is\nminimized. From this optimization problem, an associated decision problem can be formally stated as follows:\nGiven a rectangular board with given width W and given height H, and n rectangles with length li and width\nwi, 1 6 i 6 n, take the origin of the two-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system at the bottom-left corner of\nthe container (see Fig. 1). The aim of this problem is to determine if there exist a solution composed of n sets of\nFig. 1. Cartesian coordinate system.\n124 M. Chen, W. Huang / Computers & Industrial Engineering 53 (2007) 123\u2013136\nquadruples {x11, y11, x12, y12},..., {xn1, yn1, xn2, yn2}, where (xi1, yi1) denotes the bottom-left corner coordi\u0002nates of rectangle i, and (xi2, yi2) denotes the top-right corner coordinates of rectangle i. For all 1 6 i 6 n, the\ncoordinates of rectangle i satisfy the following conditions:\n(1) xi2 \u0002 xi1 = li ^ yi2 \u0002 yi1 = wi or xi2 \u0002 xi1 = wi ^ yi2 \u0002 yi1 = li;\n(2) For all 1 6 i, j 6 n, j5i, rectangle i and j cannot overlap, i.e., one of the following conditions should be\nmet: xi1 P xj2 or xj1 P xi2 or yi1 P yj2 or yj1 P yi2;\n(3) 0 6 xi1, xi2 6 W and 0 6 yi1, yi2 6 H.\nIn our packing process, each rectangle is free to rotate and its orientation h can be 0 (for \u2018\u2018not rotated\u2019\u2019) or 1\n(for \u2018\u2018rotated by p/2\u2019\u2019). It is noted that the orthogonal rectangular packing problems denote that the packing\nprocess has to ensure the edges of each rectangle are parallel to the x- and y-axis, respectively.\nObviously, if we can find an efficient algorithm to solve this decision problem, we can then solve the original\noptimization problem by using some search strategies. For example, we first apply dichotomous search to rap\u0002idly get a \u2018\u2018good enough\u2019\u2019 upper bound for the height, then from this upper bound we gradually reduce it until\nthe algorithm no longer finds a successful solution.

Grandoni, E. Husi\u0107, M. Mari and A. Tinguely XX:1\n1 Introduction\nThe Maximum Independent Set of Convex Polygons problem (MISP) is a natural geometric\npacking problem with many applications in map labeling [13, 39], cellular networks [34],\nunsplittable flow [6], chip manufacturing [27], or data mining [18, 33]. Given a set of n\nconvex polygons in the plane, the goal is to select a maximum number of them such that the\npolygons are pairwise non-overlapping.\nMISP is NP-hard [16, 28], hence it makes sense to design approximation algorithms for it.\nDisappointingly, the best (polynomial-time) approximation ratio for MISP (more precisely\nfor k-intersecting curves) has been n\n\u03b5\n[17], for any fixed constant \u03b5 > 0. This ratio has\nrecently been improved to OPT\u03b5[12].\nApproximation Schemes. Interestingly, there is a quasi-polynomial time approximation\nscheme (QPTAS) for MISP [1] (if the polygons have at most quasi-polynomially many\nvertices in total). Thus, the problem is not APX-Hard, assuming NP \u2288 DTIME(2polylog(n)),\nsuggesting that it should be possible to obtain a polynomial time approximation scheme\n(PTAS) for the problem.\nIf we assume that we are allowed to shrink the polygons by a factor 1\u2212\u03b4 for an arbitrarily\nsmall constant \u03b4, then there is a PTAS for the problem [40]. Note that here the output is\ncompared to the optimal solution without shrinking.\nWhen the input polygons are fat, e.g., regular polygons, then PTASes are known [9, 15].\nAxis-parallel rectangles. A prominent special case of MISP that has attracted a lot of\nattention over the years is the maximum independent set of axis-parallel rectangles (MISR),\nwhere all the polygons are rectangles with their edges parallel with the axes. An O(log n)\napproximation for MISR was given in [30, 38]. This was slightly improved to O(log n/ log log n)\nin [10], and substantially improved to O(log log n) in [7]. In a recent breakthrough result,\nMitchell [36] presented the first constant factor approximation algorithm with approximation\nratio 10, and later 3 + \u03b5 in an updated version [37] with a considerably shorter case analysis.\nSubsequently, his approach was simplified and improved to a (2 +\u03b5)-approximation algorithm\nby G\u00e1lvez, Khan, Mari, M\u00f6mke, Reddy, and Wiese [21, 22]. These approaches rely on a\ndynamic program that considers all the partitions of a bounding box containing the instance\ninto a number of containers with constant complexity (constant number of line segments).\nOur contribution. With the goal of better understanding the approximability of MISP, in\nthis paper, we consider the following natural special case of MISP: d-MISP is the special case of\nMISP where the edges of the input polygons are parallel to a given set D of d = |D| directions.\nNotice that MISR is equivalent to 2-MISP. Our main result is a constant approximation for\nd-MISP when d is a constant.\n\u25b6 Theorem 1. There exists an 8d/3-approximation algorithm for d-MISP running in time\nO((nd)\nO(d4\nd\n)\n).\nOur result builds on the approaches in [21, 22, 37], however we have to face several additional\ncomplications. In particular, already for d = 3 the algorithm and its analysis deviates\nsubstantially from the known (polynomial-time) results in the literature about axis-aligned\nrectangles. An overview of our approach is given in Section 3.\nRelated Work. One can consider a natural weighted version of MISP, where each convex\npolygon has a positive weight, and the goal is to find an independent set of maximum total\nweight. The weighted version of MISR was studied in the literature, and the current-best\npolynomial time approximation factor is O(log log n) [8]. We remark that our approach,\nlikewise the approaches in [21, 22, 36], does not seem to extend to the weighted case.

The edge e3(P) is degenerate.\nparticular, finding a constant approximation for weighted MISR remains a challenging open\nproblem. We remark that the QPTAS in [1] extends to the weighted case, hence suggesting\nthat the weighted version of MISP might also admit a PTAS.\nMISR was also studied in terms of parameterized algorithms. Marx [35] proved that\nthe problem is W[1]-hard, which rules out the existence of an EPTAS. A parameterized\napproximation scheme for the problem is given in [23].\nA rectangle packing problem related to MISR is the 2D Knapsack problem. Here we\nare given an axis-parallel square (the knapsack) and a collection of axis-parallel rectangles.\nThe goal is to pack a maximum cardinality (or weight) subset of rectangles in the knapsack\n(without rotations). 2D Knapsack admits a QPTAS [2] and a few constant approximation\nalgorithms are known [19, 20, 29]. Here as well, finding a PTAS is a challenging open\nproblem.\nBonsma et al. [6] established an intriguing connection between MISR and the Unsplittable\nFlow on a Path problem. A PTAS for the latter problem was recently obtained [24], closing\na very long line of research (see, e.g., [3, 4, 5, 6, 25, 26]).\n2 Preliminaries\nIn this paper, a (possibly closed) curve is always assumed to be a polygonal chain (or a\nsingleton point) and a polygon S is a bounded set with non-empty interior int(S) and whose\nboundary \u2202S is a closed curve. We denote the closure of S as S\u00af, so S\u00af = \u2202S \u222a int(S). We say\nthat two polygons S, T (with non-empty interior) touch if int(S)\u2229int(T) = \u2205 but \u2202S\u2229\u2202T \u0338= \u2205\nand intersect if int(S) \u2229 int(T) \u0338= \u2205.

The polygons and container may be nonconvex. The containment algorithm consists of new algorithms for restriction, evaluation, and subdivision of two-dimensional configuration spaces. The restriction and evaluation algorithms both depend heavily on linear programming; hence we call our algorithm an LP containment algorithm. Our LP containment algorithm is distinguished from previous containment algorithms by the way in which it applies principles of mathematical programming and also by its tight coupling of the evaluation and subdivision algorithms. Our new evaluation algorithm finds a local overlap minimum. Our distance-based subdivision algorithm eliminates a \"false\" (local but not global) overlap minimum and all layouts near that overlap minimum, a...\n\n![ResearchGate Logo](https://www.researchgate.net/images/icons/svgicons/researchgate-logo-white.svg)\n\n**Discover the world's research**\n\n- 25+ million members\n- 160+ million publication pages\n- 2.3+ billion citations\n\n[Join for free](https://www.researchgate.net/signup.SignUp.html)\n\n## No full-text available\n\n![Request Full-text Paper PDF](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAYAAAAfFcSJAAAADUlEQVR42mN89OjNfwAJDwOxHEacwgAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)\n\nTo read the full-text of this research,\n\nyou can request a copy directly from the authors.\n\nRequest full-text PDF\n\n... In our algorithms, the key to detecting infeasibility is the range intersection P (\u03b1, \u03b2), of a polygon P : the intersection of P with itself as it rotates through the ranges of angles from \u03b1 to \u03b2 about the origin.

The rotational containment/enclosure algorithm uses a \"branch and bound\" approach which generalizes our previous practical translational containment algorithm \\[28,33\\].

A version of the algorithm and implementation also solves rotational minimum enclosure: givenaclass C of container polygons, find a container C in C of minimum area for which containment has a solution. The minimum enclosure is approximate: it bounds the minimum area between (1-epsilon)A and A. Experiments indicate that finding the minimum enclosure is practical for k = 2, 3 but not larger unless optimality is sacrificed or angles ranges are limited (although these solutions can still be useful). Important applications for these algorithm to industrial problems are discussed. The paper also gives practical algorithms and numerical techniques for robustly calculating polygon set intersection, Minkowski sum, and range in...\n\n[View](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2815314_Rotational_polygon_containment_and_minimum_enclosure_using_only_robust_2D_constructions)\n\nShow abstract\n\n...
