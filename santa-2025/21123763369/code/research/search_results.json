      "text": "Two\u2011dimensional irregular polygon packing \u2013 often called nesting or irregular strip\u2011packing \u2013 asks how to place a set of arbitrarily shaped polygons inside a rectangular sheet (or a set of sheets) while minimizing waste or the number of sheets used.  The problem appears in sheet\u2011metal cutting, textile, furniture, ship\u2011building and many other industries, and is NP\u2011hard, so exact methods are only practical for very small instances\u202f([frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmech.2022.966691/full)).\n\nA large body of work therefore relies on **heuristic and meta\u2011heuristic algorithms** that balance solution quality with computational speed.  The most widely used constructive heuristics are the **bottom\u2011left (BL) placement** and its variants (BL\u2011F, BL\u2011S), as well as **shelf\u2011 and skyline\u2011based methods** that sort polygons by height or width before packing\u202f([taylorfrancis.com](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.1201/9781351236423-33/practical-algorithms-two-dimensional-packing-general-shapes-yannan-hu-hideki-hashimoto-shinji-imahori-mutsunori-yagiura)).  For larger or more complex instances, **local\u2011search** refinements (e.g., jostle or swap moves) improve an initial BL solution, and have been shown to outperform many other heuristics\u202f([eprints.soton.ac.uk](https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/415314)).  Among **meta\u2011heuristics**, genetic algorithms (GA), simulated annealing (SA), tabu search (TS) and **particle\u2011swarm optimisation (PSO)** are the most frequently reported; GA and PSO in particular have produced competitive results on benchmark irregular\u2011strip datasets\u202f([springer.com](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1012590107280), [semanticscholar.org](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/ffde/6265dfb61c0be38b1259a451269bb06b006b.pdf)).  **Hyper\u2011heuristics**, which automatically combine simple placement rules (e.g., BL, first\u2011fit, best\u2011fit) into higher\u2011level strategies, have also demonstrated robust performance across both regular and irregular shapes\u202f([ideas.repec.org](https://ideas.repec.org/a/spr/annopr/v179y2010i1p369-39210.1007-s10479-008-0475-2.html)).  For convex polygons without rotation, recent **approximation algorithms** achieve provable constant\u2011factor guarantees by sorting polygons and applying enhanced shelf\u2011packing schemes\u202f([arxiv.org](https://export.arxiv.org/pdf/2308.08523v1.pdf)).\n\nIn practice, the \u201cbest\u201d algorithm depends on the specific industrial constraints (e.g., allowed rotations, heterogeneous bin sizes, real\u2011time requirements).  A common successful workflow combines a fast constructive heuristic (BL or shelf) to generate an initial layout, followed by a meta\u2011heuristic such as GA or PSO for sequence optimisation, and a local\u2011search phase to eliminate gaps\u202f([frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmech.2022.966691/full)).  This hybrid approach consistently yields high\u2011quality nestings while remaining tractable for the large problem instances encountered in modern manufacturing.",

An efficient 2D irregular packing algorithm can effectively improve material utilization and reduce processing costs. The reduction in material consumption will also have a beneficial impact on the environment ([Ke et al., 2020](#B76)). Therefore, research of the packing problem is of great significance for technology and social interest.\nThe 2D packing problem is a type of combinatorial optimization problems to locate parts with different shapes compactly in one or more master sheet material to minimize the occupied space or maximize the utilization of the material. The 2D packing problem is currently recognized as a NP problem, which is mainly solved by heuristic algorithms. In recent years, many scholars have conducted research on 2D irregular packing problems with a verity of solutions.\nThere exists a number of review articles on packing and cutting problems. We have summarized the main review literature in the field of 2D packing and cutting as shown in[Table 1](#T1). Brown ([Brown, 1971](#B17)) introduced an optimum packing and depletion problem with optimization of space and resource usage. Harvey ([Salkin and De Kluyver, 1975](#B116)) surveyed the application of mathematical optimization models such as linear programming to the knapsack problem. Bruce ([Golden, 1976](#B50)) surveyed various approaches to the cutting stock problem. Hinxman ([Hinxman, 1980](#B65)) surveyed the trim-loss and assortment problems, this research paid more attention to cutting and packaging problems in practical applications, and did not mention much about theoretical methods. Garey and Coffman ([Garey and Johnson, 1981](#B47);[Coffman et al., 1984](#B27)) surveyed the approximation algorithms for bin packing problems. Israni ([Israni and Sanders, 1982](#B72)) reviewed the 2D cutting stock problem including almost all 2D packaging problems. The author also proposed a rectangular layout method. Sarin ([Sarin, 1983](#B118)) reviewed methodologies and literature to solve 2D stock cutting problems and introduced an interactive optimization procedure for a general 2D stock cutting problem. Dyckhoff ([Dyckhoff et al., 1985](#B38)) described a trim loss and related problems and categorized them briefly. Dudzi&#x00144;ski ([Dudzi&#x00144;ski and Walukiewicz, 1987](#B36)) summarized the exact methods for knapsack problems, such as linear programming. Matthias ([Rode and Rosenberg, 1987](#B114)) analyzed the algorithm for the trim-loss problems. Haessler ([Haessler and Sweeney, 1991](#B59)) reviewed the solution process of cutting stock problems, including placement algorithm and sequence optimization algorithm. Dowsland ([Dowsland and Dowsland, 1992](#B34)) reviewed the application of operations research methods to the packing problem and summarized some exact heuristics. Sweeney ([Sweeney and Paternoster, 1992](#B128)) categorized cutting and packing problems and made application-oriented research records. Cheng ([Cheng et al., 1994](#B22)) discussed 2D cutting stock problems and their application cases including the pallet loading problem and VLSI placement problem. With the gradual deepening of research on 2D layout problems, typology becomes a common research topic. 2D regular and irregular layout problems are clearly distinguished in practical applications and theoretical methods. Dowsland ([Dowsland and Dowsland, 1995](#B29)) gave a special review of the 2D irregular nesting problem for the first time. Mavridou ([Mavridou and Pardalos, 1997](#B98)) summarized applications of the genetic algorithm and simulated annealing algorithm in the optimization of facility layout problems. Dyckhoff ([Dyckhoff, 1990](#B37)) made a typology of the cutting and packing problems in detail, and W&#x000e4;scher ([W&#x000e4;scher et al., 2007](#B135)) improved the typology later. Hopper ([Hopper and Turton, 1999](#B67);[Hopper and Turton, 2001a](#B68);[Hopper and Turton, 2001b](#B69)) investigated the application of meta-heuristic and heuristic algorithms in 2D and 3D packing problems. Lodi ([Lodi et al., 2002a](#B90);[Lodi et al., 2002b](#B91)) reviewed algorithms proposed in the 1990s of 2D packing problems. Bennell et al. ([Bennell and Oliveira, 2008](#B10);[Bennell and Oliveira, 2009](#B9)) discussed 2D irregular packing problems and related geometric problems. Leao ([Leao et al., 2020](#B81)) introduced the mathematical models in the 2D irregular packing problem.\nTABLE 1\n[![www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/966691/fmech-08-966691-HTML/image_m/fmech-08-966691-t001.jpg)](https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/966691/fmech-08-966691-HTML/image_m/fmech-08-966691-t001.jpg)\n**TABLE 1**.

A link will be provided\nin a future version of this document.\narXiv:2308.08523v1 [cs.CG] 16 Aug 2023\n2 Improved Approximations for Translational Packing of Convex Polygons\n1 Introduction\nMany real-life situations require us to make decisions about optimally packing a collection\nof objects into a specific container. One particular category of these packing problems is\ntwo-dimensional packing, which is encountered in everyday scenarios like arranging items\non a shelf and in industrial applications such as cutting cookies from rolled-out dough\nor manufacturing sets of tiles from standard-sized panels made of wood, glass, or metal.\nAnother intriguing example involves cutting fabric pieces for clothing production. In this\ncase, the pieces often cannot be rotated freely, as they must adhere to a desired pattern\nin the final product, which is tailored of multiple elements. The widespread applicability\nof two-dimensional packing problems has led to a surge of interest in designing efficient\nalgorithms to address them. In this paper, we follow the line of research and study the\nproblem of packing convex polygons without rotations in various settings depending on the\ntype of containers used.\nPast research focusing on theoretical considerations of two-dimensional packings mainly\nconcentrates on the scenario when all objects are axis-parallel rectangles. In this paper, we\nwill discuss packing without rotations, in which only translations are permitted. There are\ntwo main classes of the problem depending on whether the size of the container is fixed and\nwe want to minimize the number of containers used or whether we want to minimize the\ncontainer\u2019s size with respect to some objective function.\nA seminal example of the first class is the Geometric Bin Packing problem in which\na number of unit size squared bins to pack is to be minimized. The problem is arguably\nthe most natural generalization of the regular (1D) Bin Packing to two dimensions, and\nits absolute approximability has been fully understood. Unless P = N P, the best possible\nefficient constant factor approximation is 2 [15], and such an algorithm is known [10].\nIn the second class, there are several variants to be considered. An example is the\nStrip Packing Problem which is concerned with packing objects into a strip of width\n1 and infinite height in such a way that the maximum of all the heights of the placed\nobjects is minimized. Like Geometric Bin Packing, Strip Packing generalizes (1D)\nBin Packing. The best known efficient constant factor approximation for Strip Packing\nhas approximation factor (5/3 + \u03f5) [9]. It is known that there can not exist a polynomial\ntime algorithm with an approximation ratio of (3/2 \u2212 \u03f5) for any \u03f5 > 0 unless P = N P, which\nfollows directly from the approximation hardness of (1D) Bin Packing. Both classes of\nproblems have been also considered in the asymptotic setting, see e.g. [11, 5, 12].\nIn younger time, there was also an increase of interest in cases where the objects in\nquestion are general convex polygons. Alt, de Berg and Knauer [2, 3] considered the problem\nof packing an instance consisting of a number of convex polygons of the form p \u2282 [0, 1]2into\na minimum area axis-parallel rectangular container. We refer to this problem as Polygon\nArea Minimization throughout this paper. In the special case where the instance consists\nof rectangles only, the problem is known to admit a PTAS [4]. They proved the existence of\nthe following efficient algorithm:\nA 23.78-approximation for Polygon Area Minimization.\nRecently, Aamand, Abrahamsen, Beretta and Kleist [1] showed that the algorithm of Alt,\nde Berg and Knauer can be leveraged to obtain also efficient approximation algorithms of\nfurther problems:\nA 7-approximation for Polygon Perimeter Minimization.\nA 51-approximation for Polygon Strip Packing.\nAn 11-approximation for Polygon Bin Packing for polygons with diameter at most 1\n10 .\nA. Kurpisz and S. Suter 3\n1.1 Our results\nThe results of Alt, de Berg and Knauer [2, 3] and Aamand et al. [1] are heavily based on\nso-called shelf packing algorithms. In shelf packing algorithms, the objects are first placed\non the shelves, possibly ordered by height, which are later stacked on one another to build\na final solution. Compared to axis-parallel rectangles, the main challenge in designing an\napproximation algorithm for polygon packing problems is that objects cannot be sorted by\nheight and orientation simultaneously. As a result, the algorithm and its analysis in [2, 3]\nhave such a large approximation guarantee. In this paper, we provide new insight into how\nshelf packing algorithms should be applied to polygon packing problems. We introduce a\nsequence of transformations of the objects that allow us first to sort them by height and later\nby orientation to build a solution of a much better approximation guarantee. More precisely,\nwe design polynomial-time algorithms with the following factors:\nA 9.45-approximation for Polygon Area Minimization.\nUsing this algorithm as a subroutine, we build upon the methods from Aamand et al. [1] to\nobtain the following efficient approximation algorithms:\nA (3.75 + \u03f5)-approximation for Polygon Perimeter Minimization.\nA 21.89-approximation for Polygon Strip Packing.\nA 5.09-approximation for Polygon Bin Packing for polygons which have their diameter\nbounded by 1\n10 .\nThe results are proved in Sections 4, 5, 6, and 7 respectively. Furthermore, in Section 8\nwe show the following results, which make progress towards solving an open question of a\nO(1)-approximation algorithm for Polygon Bin Packing for arbitrary polygons.\nThere is an efficient O(\n1\n\u03b4\n)-approximation algorithm for Polygon Bin Packing for\ninstances where each polygon has width or height at most 1 \u2212 \u03b4.\nThere is an efficient O(1)-approximation algorithm for Polygon Bin Packing for\ninstances with the property that all polygons share a spine (up to translation) with height\nat least 3\n4\n.\n2 Preliminaries\nWe start out considerations by recalling a classical and well-known problem in theoretical\ncomputer science, the Bin Packing problem: Given a list of numbers s1, . . . , sn \u2208 (0, 1] \u2229 Q,\nrepresenting the sizes of n objects, the goal is to find the minimum number of bins of size 1,\nso that we can pac...",

It explores the procedure of applying the bottom-left strategy to a given order the bottom-left algorithm. The chapter explains the irregular strip packing problem and introduces some practical algorithms for irregular packing problems. It focuses on the problem of packing irregular shapes represented in bitmap format and analyses the rectilinear block packing problem and also introduces various schemes used to represent solutions to the rectilinear block packing problem and algorithms based on such coding schemes. The chapter considers two-dimensional irregular packing problems, which have been actively studied in the last decade. It provides some basic techniques including bottom-left strategy, clustering strategy, and no-fit polygons. The chapter shows that various algorithms proposed for the irregular strip packing and bin packing problems and their variants. T.

We also discuss the effect of different groups of stock sheet sizes.\n\nText\n\n**ICCL17\\_paper\\_43**\n**\\- Accepted Manuscript**\n\n[Download](https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/415314/1/ICCL17_paper_43.pdf) (729kB)\n\n## More information\n\ne-pub ahead of print date: October 2017\n\nPublished date: October 2017\n\nKeywords:\nIrregular shapes, Multiple bin size bin packing, Jostle Algorithm\n\n## Identifiers\n\nLocal EPrints ID: 415314\n\nURI: http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/id/eprint/415314\n\nDOI: [doi:10.1007/978-3-319-68496](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-68496)\n\nPURE UUID: e654d0b7-af4b-43c1-86e1-635828997331\n\nORCID for Antonio Martinez Sykora: [orcid.org/0000-0002-2435-3113](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2435-3113)\n\n## Catalogue record\n\nDate deposited: 07 Nov 2017 17:30\n\nLast modified: 16 Mar 2024 05:53\n\n## Export record\n\nASCII CitationAtomBibTeXData Cite XMLDublin CoreDublin CoreEP3 XMLEndNoteHTML CitationHTML CitationHTML ListJSONMETSMODSMPEG-21 DIDLOpenURL ContextObjectOpenURL ContextObject in SpanRDF+N-TriplesRDF+N3RDF+XMLRIOXX2 XMLReferReference ManagerSimple Metadata\n\n## Altmetrics\n\n## Share this record\n\n[Share this on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/415314/) [Share this on Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Efficient%20local%20search%20heuristics%20for%20packing%20irregular%20shapes%20in%20two%2Ddimensional%20heterogeneous%20bins+https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/415314/) [Share this on Weibo](http://service.weibo.com/share/share.php?url=Efficient%20local%20search%20heuristics%20for%20packing%20irregular%20shapes%20in%20two%2Ddimensional%20heterogeneous%20bins+https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/415314/)\n\n## Contributors\n\nAuthor:Ranga, Prasad Abeysooriya\n\nAuthor:Julia Bennell\n\nAuthor: [Antonio Martinez Sykora](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/business-school/about/staff/am1u10.page)\n\nEditor:Tolga Bektas\n\nEditor:Stefano Coniglio\n\nEditor:Antonio Martinez-Sykora\n\nEditor:Stefan Boss\n\n## Download statistics\n\nDownloads from ePrints over the past year.

To be worthwhile, such a combination should outperform the single heuristics. This article presents a GA-based method that produces general hyper-heuristics that solve two-dimensional regular (rectangular) and irregular (convex polygonal) bin-packing problems. A hyper-heuristic is used to define a high-level heuristic that controls low-level heuristics. The hyper-heuristic should decide when and where to apply each single low-level heuristic, depending on the given problem state. In this investigation two kinds of heuristics were considered: for selecting the figures (pieces) and objects (bins), and for placing the figures into the objects. Some of the heuristics were taken from the literature, others were adapted, and some other variations developed by us. We chose the most representative heuristics of their type, considering their individual performance in various studies and also in an initial experimentation on a collection of benchmark problems. The GA included in the proposed model uses a variable-length representation, which evolves combinations of condition-action rules producing hyper-heuristics after going through a learning process which includes training and testing phases. Such hyper-heuristics, when tested with a large set of benchmark problems, produce outstanding results for most of the cases. The testbed is composed of problems used in other similar studies in the literature. Some additional instances for the testbed were randomly generated.

The problem is to assign, a \nset of 2-D irregular-shaped items to a rectangular sheet. The width of the sheet is fixed, while its length is extendable \nand has to be minimized. A sequence-based approach is developed and tested. The approach involves two phases; opti\u0002mization phase and placement phase. The optimization phase searches for the packing sequence that would lead to an \noptimal (or best) solution when translated to an actual pattern through the placement phase. A Particle Swarm Optimi\u0002zation algorithm is applied in this optimization phase. Regarding the placement phase, a combined algorithm based on \ntraditional placement methods is developed. Competitive results are obtained, where the best solutions are found to be \nbetter than, or at least equal to, the best known solutions for 10 out of 31 benchmark data sets. A Statistical Design of \nExperiments and a random generator of test problems are also used to characterize the performance of the entire algo\u0002rithm. \nKeywords: Cutting and Packing; Irregular Strip Packing; Nesting; Placement Procedures; Particle Swarm Optimization \n1. Introduction \nThe problem of packing or cutting out shapes with \nminimal waste is a classical problem that exists in many \nindustrial fields. Common applications are found in sheet \nmetal, leather, furniture, shipbuilding, and textile Indus\u0002tries. Cutting stock, trim loss, bin packing, strip packing, \npallet loading, nesting, and knapsack problems, are all \nrelated names for cutting and packing problems. The first \ngeneral classification for cutting and packing problems is \nintroduced in Dychkoff [1]. Dychkoff developed a spe\u0002cial classification for cutting and packing problems in \nwhich he called it a typology. Recently, an improved \ntypology was developed by W\u00e4scher [2], which is par\u0002tially based on Dyckhoff\u2019s original one, but it adopts new \ncategorization criteria. \nThe scope of this research is the two-dimensional Ir\u0002regular Strip Packing Problem which is classified as an \nOpen Dimension Problem (ODP), according to W\u00e4scher\u2019s \nimproved typology. The problem is to assign (cut or \npack), a set of two-dimensional irregular-shaped items to \na rectangular object (sheet for cutting or container for \npacking). The width of the object is fixed, while its \nlength is extendable and has to be minimized. A typical \napplication for this problem is found in the textile Indus\u0002try under the name \u201cMarker-Making\u201d. Another popular \nname is \u201cNesting\u201d which has been, and still, used by \nmany authors for the Irregular Strip Packing Problems, \nand even for other irregular cutting and packing prob\u0002lems in general. The problem is schematically demon\u0002strated in Figure 1, where the best arrangement for the \ngiven items into the strip to minimize the pattern length \nis sought. \nThe 2-D rectangular packing problem has been shown \nby Fowler et al. [3] to be NP-complete. As the irregular \ncase is more complex, hence it could also be considered \nas NP-complete, and as a result they are practically tack\u0002led through heuristic approaches. Two main heuristic \napproaches are applied; sequence-based approach and \ndirect approach. The first approach utilizes an optimiza\u0002tion technique to find the packing sequence of items that \nwould lead to the best possible pattern when employed \nunder a certain placement method (Babu and Babu [4], \nFischer and Dagli [5], Takahara et al. [6], and Burke et al. \n[7]). While the second approach heuristically builds an \ninitial pattern that may not be a feasible one, and an op\u0002timization technique is directly applied to the items posi\u0002tions seeking the best possible feasible pattern (Bennell \nand Dowsland [8], Gomes and Oliveira [9], Immamichi \net al. [10], and Umetani et al. [11]). \nOther solution approaches are found in the literature \nthat could not be categorized under any of the two main \napproaches mentioned above. These approaches involve; \nmathematical programming approach followed by Grinde \nCopyright \u00a9 2013 SciRes. AJOR\nM. A. SHALABY, M. KASHKOUSH 269\nSheet Width \nSheet Length (Open) Pattern length \nFigure 1. A schematic illustration for the 2-D irregular strip \npacking problem. \nand Daniels [12] and Fischetti and Luzzi [13], Constraint \nLogic Programming (CLP) approach followed by Carra\u0002villa et al. [14], and dynamic sequence-based approach \nfollowed by Oliveira et al. [15], and Bennell and Song \n[16]. \nDeveloping a geometrical technique for handling the \ngraphical aspects of irregular shapes is used to be the \nmain obstacle among extending the research in this \nproblem, compared to the regular cutting and packing \none. Three geometry handling techniques are widely \nused in the literature. Pixel or Raster Method is an ap\u0002proximate method that is employed by Jain and Gea [17], \nBabu and Babu [4], and Fischer and Dagli [5]. Direct \ntrigonometry techniques are used by Hifi and M\u2019Hallah \n[18], Takahara et al. [6], and Burke et al. [7]. A more \nsophisticated technique is the no-fit polygon which is \napplied by Oliveira et al. [15], Bennell and Song [16], \nand Imamichi et al. [10]. \nMany authors used to incorporate meta-heuristic \nsearch techniques in their solution algorithms. Three \nmain meta-heuristics are commonly used with irregular \ncutting and packing problems, they are; Genetic Algo\u0002rithm (Jakobs [19], Hifi and M\u2019Hallah [18], and Hu-yao \nand Yuan-jun [20]), Simulated Annealing (Oliveira and \nFerreira [21], Han and Na [22], Heckmann and Lengauer \n[23], and Gomes and Oliveira [9]), and Tabu Search \n(Blazewicz et al. [24], Bennell and Dowsland [8], and \nBurke et al. [7]). \nFrom the above review, much interest could be noticed \nin the Irregular Strip Packing Problem for the last few \nyears. This could be attributed to two main reasons; \nfirstly, until now, no optimal solution could be found for \na real-sized problem, a very small improvement in a \ngiven arrangement in a cutting or packing operation \ncould save a considerably large amount of money. Sec\u0002ondly, is the significant increase in the capabilities of \nmodern computational engines, which made it available \nto apply techniques that would be impractical to apply 15 \nyears ago. Several heuristic and meta-heuristic optimiza\u0002tion techniques have been applied and investigated with \nthe problem. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algo\u0002rithm, originally introduced by Kennedy and Eberhart \n[25], is a lately developed stochastic optimization tech\u0002nique that has proved good performance in various opti\u0002mization fields, but has not been applied to a Strip Pack\u0002ing Problem or any cutting or packing problem. This \nresearch investigates the performance of PSO to find a \ncompetitive (or even better) performance to the existing \napproaches. \n2. Proposed Solution Approach \nThe solution approach proposed in this paper, which is \ngiven the name \u201cSwarmNest\u201d, is a sequence-based ap\u0002proach that consists of two phases; optimization phase \nand placement phase. SwarmNest assumes only hole-free \npolygons that are allowed to rotate by increments of 90\u02da. \nFor the optimization phase, a Particle Swarm Optimi\u0002zation (PSO) algorithm is employed to search for the \noptimal packing sequence. Up to our knowledge, this is \nthe first time Particle Swarm is utilized in tackling an \nirregular packing problem. A proposed Local Search \nroutine is also used to enhance the algorithm perform\u0002ance. As to the placement phase, a combined placement \nalgorithm is develop...",

Irregular shape packing is one of the most recent variants to be widely researched and its history extends over 40 years. The evolution of solution approaches to this problem can be attributed to increased computer power and advances in geometric techniques as well as more sophisticated and insightful algorithm design. In this paper we will focus on the latter. Our aim is not to give a chronological account or an exhaustive review, but to draw on the literature to describe and evaluate the core approaches. Irregular packing is combinatorial and as a result solution methods are heuristic, save a few notable exceptions. We will explore different ways of representing the problem and mechanisms for moving between solutions. We will also propose where we see the future challenges for researchers in this area.\n\n## Suggested Citation\n\nJ A Bennell & J F Oliveira, 2009.\n\" **[A tutorial in irregular shape packing problems](https://ideas.repec.org/a/pal/jorsoc/v60y2009i1d10.1057_jors.2008.169.html)**,\"\n[Journal of the Operational Research Society](https://ideas.repec.org/s/pal/jorsoc.html), Palgrave Macmillan;The OR Society, vol. 60(1), pages 93-105, May.\nHandle: _RePEc:pal:jorsoc:v:60:y:2009:i:1:d:10.1057\\_jors.2008.169_\n\nDOI: 10.1057/jors.2008.169\n\nas\n\nHTMLHTML with abstractplain textplain text with abstractBibTeXRIS (EndNote, RefMan, ProCite)ReDIFJSON\n\n## Download full text from publisher\n\n**File URL:** http://link.springer.com/10.1057/jors.2008.169\n\n**File Function:** Abstract\n\n**Download Restriction:** Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.\n\n* * *\n\n**File URL:** https://libkey.io/10.1057/jors.2008.169?utm\\_source=ideas\n\n**LibKey link**: if access is restricted and if your library uses this service, LibKey will redirect you to where you can use your library subscription to access this item\n\n---><---\n\nAs the access to this document is restricted, you may want to [search](https://ideas.repec.org/cgi-bin/htsearch2?q=%22A+tutorial+in+irregular+shape+packing+problems%22) for a different version of it.\n\n## References listed on IDEAS\n\nas\n\nHTMLHTML with abstractplain textplain text with abstractBibTeXRIS (EndNote, RefMan, ProCite)ReDIFJSON\n\n01.
