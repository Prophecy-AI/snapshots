    "notes": "Implemented jonathanchan's sa_v1_parallel.cpp optimizer with SA, local search, fractional translation, and population-based optimization. Also tried random start optimizer. None of the optimizers could improve the score. The santa-2025.csv submission is at a very deep local optimum. Key insight: The starting submission has already been extensively optimized by competition participants. Standard optimization techniques (SA, local search, fractional translation) cannot escape this local optimum. Need fundamentally different approaches or much longer compute time."
