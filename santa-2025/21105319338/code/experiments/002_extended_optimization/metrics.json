Starting submission is already at a very strong local optimum. tree_packer_v21, backward propagation, and aggressive SA all failed to improve the score. Only fractional translation found 1-2 tiny improvements that don't show in the score. The pre-optimized submission appears to be the result of extensive optimization already."
