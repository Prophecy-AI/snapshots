Recent work on **approximation algorithms** for translational (no\u2011rotation) packing of convex polygons shows that sorting pieces by height and applying shelf\u2011style packing yields provably\u2011good bounds on the container area, perimeter or strip length, improving earlier\u202fO(1)\u2011approximation results\u202f([export.arxiv.org](https://export.arxiv.org/pdf/2308.08523v1.pdf)).  When rotations are allowed, the **no\u2011fit polygon (NFP)** is a central geometric tool; an improved sliding\u2011window algorithm for constructing NFPs speeds up collision checks and enables tighter placements of highly irregular shapes\u202f([mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2227-7390/10/16/2941)).\n\nFor practical, large\u2011scale instances the most effective approaches are **local\u2011search and evolutionary meta\u2011heuristics**.
