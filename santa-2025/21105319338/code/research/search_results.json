      "text": "Kaggle\u2019s \u201cSanta\u201d contests (e.g.,\u202fPacking\u202fSanta\u2019s\u202fSleigh\u202fand the 2025 Christmas\u2011Tree Packing Challenge) are essentially two\u2011dimensional bin\u2011packing problems with extra constraints such as delivery order or a fixed\u2011size square envelope.  Winners therefore treat the task as a geometric packing problem and apply a mix of classic heuristic packers, problem\u2011specific refinements, and meta\u2011heuristic search.\n\nThe most common baseline is a **shelf\u2011or Guillotine\u2011based algorithm**: items are placed in rows (shelves) and each new rectangle splits the remaining free space with a guillotine cut, after which a simple **height\u2011compaction step** slides rows downward to reduce wasted vertical space.  This approach mirrors the method described by a 2014 Kaggle participant, who linked the technique to the Jyl\u00e4nki rectangle\u2011bin\u2011packing paper and achieved a mid\u2011leaderboard score\u202f([dsgeek.com](http://dsgeek.com/2014/02/26/KagglePackingSantaSleighChallenge.html)).  Many top solutions extend this core with **local\u2011search refinements** (e.g., swapping or rotating a small set of items), **skyline or maximal\u2011rectangle heuristics**, and **mixed\u2011integer programming** to fine\u2011tune the final layout for the smallest square bounding box.\n\nBeyond deterministic heuristics, competitors have experimented with **meta\u2011heuristics** such as simulated annealing, genetic algorithms, and particle\u2011swarm optimisation to escape local minima, while **reinforcement\u2011learning agents** have been tried but generally under\u2011perform, as noted in a 2025 Medium analysis that called RL \u201cfailing\u201d for this type of packing task\u202f([medium.com](https://hmnshudhmn24.medium.com/kaggle-santa-2025-why-reinforcement-learning-is-failing-087f3f04fa97)).  The winning pipelines therefore combine fast greedy packers for an initial solution, followed by aggressive local optimisation and, when needed, exact solvers for small sub\u2011problems, yielding the tightest possible square configurations evaluated by the competition\u2019s normalized\u2011area metric\u202f([competehub.dev](https://www.competehub.dev/en/competitions/kagglesanta-2025)).",

      "text": "###### February 26, 2014\n\n#### [Kaggle Packing Santa Sleigh Challenge](https://dsgeek.com/2014/02/26/KagglePackingSantaSleighChallenge.html)\n\nOver the holidays, I participated in Kaggle\u2019s [Packing Santa\u2019s Sleigh](http://www.kaggle.com/c/packing-santas-sleigh)\nchallenge. Developing a solution was a lot of fun but I didn\u2019t have\nthe chance to post about it until now.\n\nThe challenge consisted of packing one million presents of varying\nsizes into Santa\u2019s sleigh. The sleigh had a fixed width and length but\ncould grow as tall as necessary to fit the presents. The goal was to\npack the presents with the smallest height and in delivery order. The\nevaluation metric was a score that increased with height and the\n\u201cdistance\u201d presents were packed from the optimal order.\n\nThat second constraint, packing in delivery order, was both a blessing\nand a curse. It was a blessing because it meant that the solution\ndidn\u2019t have to consider packing all one million presents at the same\ntime. However, it was also a curse because it limited the freedom to\nre-order presents to achieve an optimal packing.\n\nI hadn\u2019t solved a problem like this before so I started off doing some\nresearch. I eventually decided that the problem was essentially a [bin\\\npacking problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bin_packing_problem) with the ordering constraint making it more like a\n[cutting stock problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting_stock_problem). A Kaggle forum post referenced an [excellent\\\npaper](http://clb.demon.fi/files/RectangleBinPack.pdf) by Jukka Jylanki on two dimensional bin packing that was really\nhelpful.\n\nWith that initial research done, I started out by implementing a\nsimple shelf algorithm. I packed the presents in delivery order using\na simple Guillotine partitioning scheme. This result achieved a score\nclose to that of the provided example solution (which used a\nsimilar approach). I added code to do height compaction and got\na score good enough to fall in the middle of the leaderboard.\n\nAfter this initial success, I spent a few days pursuing a queue\nbased algorithm that added empty space back as the bottom of\neach packed present was reached. This required implementing a\ndefragmentation algorithm based on finding a minimal cover of\na set of overlapping rectilinear rectangles. I had a lot of\nfun implementing [an algorithm](http://eprints.cs.vt.edu/archive/00000102/01/TR-88-17.pdf) but the queue approach performed\nworse than the initial shelf approach. Unfortunately, I ventured\non this tangent during the last week of the competition.\n\nAt this point, I realized that the most important thing was to pack\neach shelf as densely as possible. I experimented with different\nmethods but began to run out of time. My final solution essentially\nconsisted of:\n\n- Selecting the next N presents, in delivery order, that\nwould fill a shelf if packed optimally.\n- Packing these presents in largest to smallest order.\n- Checking to see if the packed presents had gaps in\ndelivery order.\n- If not, commit to the packing and perform height compaction\nbased on the heights of the presents packed on the previous shelf.\n- If there were gaps, use a binary-ish search algorithm to find\nthe subset of presents that could be packed in decreasing size\norder that didn\u2019t result in any gaps.\n\nThis algorithm worked well but was very slow. As a result, I didn\u2019t\nhave time to investigate other approaches. Although I\u2019ve learned this\nlesson before, this is further evidence that I need to start Kaggle\ncompetitions sooner. My final score was within 16% of the winning\nresult and was good enough to put me in 92nd place out of 362 teams.\nI\u2019m happy with that but hope to place higher in future competitions.\n\nAs an added challenge, I decided to implement my solution in [Julia](http://julialang.org), a\nnew technical computing language that has been getting a lot of\nattention. Like [R](http://www.r-project.org), Julia\u2019s design is heavily influence by [LISP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)), one of\nmy favorite programming languages. This was my first experience with\nJulia and, overall, I enjoyed it. It\u2019s ability to dynamically compile\nto native machine code was the feature I was most interested as I\u2019ve\nhad runtime speed issues with R and Python while working on past\nKaggle competitions. Julia seemed to perform well but I don\u2019t have a\nbaseline to compare it to. Unlike [Common Lisp](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_lisp) implementations that\nI\u2019ve used in the past, Julia doesn\u2019t appear to use [late-binding](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_binding) for\ncompiled routines. This meant that any time I updated a routine all\ncallers of that routine also needed to be re-compiled. The essentially\ndevolved into an edit-compile-run development cycle reminiscent of\nstatic languages. But, Julia is still in early days so perhaps this\nwill change (or, equally likely, I wasn\u2019t doing it right).\n\nAs an additional challenge, I also implemented a solution viewer\nin [Processing](http://processing.org). Here\u2019s a screenshot,\n\nI\u2019ve been looking for an excuse to learn Processing and this seemed\nlike an ideal opportunity. The viewer was only able to visualize\nsolutions with thousands of presents. However, this was sufficient\nduring early development using small subsets of presents.\n\nWrapping up, I had a lot of fun with this challenge. I enjoyed\nlearning about computational geometry problems and algorithms. Using\nJulia was a fun experiment and I look forward to using it to solve\nother problems. Building the Processing solution viewer was also fun.\nThis is why I like doing Kaggle competitions. They provide opportunities\nto learn new tools, topics, etc, as well as improve one\u2019s skill. In this\nregard, it really doesn\u2019t matter where you end up in the leaderboard\n(but I still want to do better next time).\n\nThe source code for my final solution and Processing solution viewer\nare available [on GitHub](https://github.com/jcardente/kaggle_packingSantasSleigh). The repository also includes additional code\nthat I wrote while investigating other approaches, including the\nminimal rectangle cover algorithm (see the routine `mincoverrects()` in the file `experimental.jl`).\n\nTags:\u00a0 [Kaggle](https://dsgeek.com/tags/kaggle.html) , [Julia](https://dsgeek.com/tags/julia.html)",

We expect a fun puzzle. We get a nightmare of Combinatorial Optimization.\nThis year\u2019s edition,**\u201cSanta 2025: The Christmas Tree Packing Challenge,\u201d**is no exception. The goal? Pack $N$ irregular \u201cTree Polygons\u201d into the smallest possible square bounding box for $N=1$ to $200$.\nIf you checked the leaderboard today (Dec 21), you noticed a trend:**Reinforcement Learning (RL) is getting crushed.**\nDespite the massive hype around \u201cReasoning Models\u201d and PPO agents this year, the top 100 teams aren\u2019t using neural networks. They are using 1980s physics simulations. Here is why the \u201cOld School\u201d is winning, and how the pros are using LLMs to cheat the system.\n## The Problem: Why RL Hates \u201cPacking\u201d\nOn paper, this looks like a game.*Place a tree, check for overlap, repeat.*Perfect for a DQN agent, right?\nWrong. The geometry kills the gradient.\n1. **Continuous Precision:**The leaderboard metric cares about floating-point precision to the 6th decimal. RL agents (which output discrete actions or probability distributions) struggle to make the \u201cmicro-adjustments\u201d needed to squeeze a tree into a 0.001mm gap.\n2. **The \u201cCollision\u201d Cliff:**In packing, a move is either valid (reward = 1) or it overlaps by a pixel (reward = -100). This sparse, binary feedback loop makes it nearly impossible for an agent to \u201clearn\u201d a gradient. It doesn\u2019t know*how*to fix the overlap, just that it failed.## The Solution: Simulated Annealing (on Steroids)\nThe \u201cSecret Sauce\u201d currently dominating the leaderboard is**Simulated Annealing (SA)**combined with**Lattice Generation**.\nInstead of training a model to*predict*the position, teams are writing physics engines that*shake*the box.\n* **High Temperature:**Randomly spin and throw trees into the box (Explorer Phase).\n* **Low Temperature:**Jiggle the trees by microscopic amounts to resolve collisions (Exploiter Phase).\nThe best solutions right now use a \u201cHybrid\u201d strategy:\n* **N &lt; 58:**Use Simulated Annealing to find unstructured, chaotic packings.\n* **N &gt; 58:**Switch to \u201cCrystalline Packing\u201d (regular geometric lattices) which is mathematically superior for large numbers.## The Twist: How LLMs are Actually Helping\nIf RL is dead, where is the AI?\nTop competitors aren\u2019t using LLMs to*solve*the puzzle; they are using LLMs to**write the solver**.\nPython is too slow for 10 billion annealing steps. The meta this year is to prompt Gemini 3 or Claude to:\n\u201cRewrite this Python overlap-check function in Rust/C++ with AVX2 vectorization.\u201d\nWe are seeing \u201cHybrid\u201d workflows where the**Human**defines the heuristics, the**LLM**writes the highly optimized C++ kernels, and**Simulated Annealing**does the heavy lifting.\n## The Starter Code: A Simple Annealer\nIf you want to jump in before the January deadline, don\u2019t start with PyTorch. Start here.\nHere is a conceptual snippet for a \u201cPerturbation\u201d mover \u2014the heart of any good annealing solution.\n```\nimport numpy as np\nimport math\ndef anneal(layout, max\\_temps=10000):\n# layout: Array of [x, y, rotation] for N trees\ncurrent\\_score = calculate\\_area(layout)\ntemperature = 1.0\ncooling\\_rate = 0.9995\nfor i in range(max\\_temps):\n# 1.

Check Constraints (The &quot;Wall&quot;)\nif check\\_overlap(layout):\n# Revert immediately if invalid\nlayout[idx] = original\\_pos\ncontinue\n# 3. Acceptance Criteria (Metropolis-Hastings)\nnew\\_score = calculate\\_area(layout)\ndelta = new\\_score - current\\_score\n# If better, accept.

Participants are tasked with determining the optimal way to pack Christmas tree toys into the smallest possible square box, allowing Santa Claus to mail them efficiently around the globe. The challenge is to find the dimensions of the smallest square box that can fit between 1 to 200 trees.\nThe competition is designed to encourage innovation and problem-solving skills, with a focus on packing efficiency. Participants are encouraged to submit their solutions, which will be evaluated based on the normalized area of the square bounding box for each puzzle configuration.\n### Description\nThe challenge is inspired by Santa&#x27;s need for the smallest box to fit all the tiny trees for his Christmas deliveries. Participants are required to find the best packing solution to help Santa Claus and win the competition&#x27;s prize.\n### Evaluation\nSubmissions are evaluated on the sum of the normalized area of the square bounding box for each puzzle. The formula for the score is:\n```\n`score = \u2211(sn^2/n)`\n```\nwhere`sn`is the side of the square box bounding the trees and`n`is the total number of trees in the configuration.\n### Submission File\nEach submission must include the tree position (`x`,`y`) and rotation (`deg`) for each`id`in the submission. The values must be converted to a string and prepended with an`s`before submission. Submissions with overlapping trees will result in an error. Location values must be constrained to -100 \u2264x, y \u2264100.\nThe file should have the following format:\n```\n`id,x,y,deg\n001\\_0,s0.0,s0.0,s20.411299\n002\\_0,s0.0,s0.0,s20.411299\n002\\_1,s-0.541068,s0.259317,s51.66348\netc.`\n```\n### Timeline\n* **November 17, 2025**: Start Date\n* **January 23, 2026**: Entry Deadline\n* **January 23, 2026**: Team Merger Deadline\n* **January 30, 2026**: Final Submission Deadline\nAll deadlines are at 11:59 PM UTC unless otherwise noted.\n### Prizes\n* **First Prize**: $12,000\n* **Second Prize**: $10,000\n* **Third Prize**: $10,000\n* **Fourth Prize**: $8,000\nAdditionally, a**Rudolph Prize**of $10,000 is awarded to the team holding 1st place on the leaderboard for the longest period of time between November 17, 2025, and January 30, 2026.\n### Citation\nWalter Reade and Ashley Oldacre.
