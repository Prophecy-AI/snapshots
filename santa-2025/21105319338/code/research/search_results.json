      "text": "Based on the competition description and the techniques shared by top participants, the most effective ways to push the Santa\u202f2025 score below\u202f68 are to treat the problem as an exact packing optimization, use aggressive back\u2011tracking with symmetry pruning, start from strong heuristic bounds, and avoid reinforcement\u2011learning approaches that have proven ineffective\u3010https://www.competehub.dev/en/competitions/kagglesanta-2025\u3011,\u3010https://developer.ansys.com/blog/advent-code-2025-day-12-aka-packing-problem\u3011,\u3010https://hmnshudhmn24.medium.com/kaggle-santa-2025-why-reinforcement-learning-is-failing-087f3f04fa97\u3011,\u3010https://calvinchang1.com/projects/kaggle-santa-packing\u3011.\n\n**Step\u2011by\u2011step technique**\n\n1. **Model the packing mathematically** \u2013 formulate a mixed\u2011integer (or constraint) program that minimizes the side length\u202f`s\u2099` of the square bounding box while enforcing non\u2011overlap and orientation constraints for each irregular tree shape\u3010https://calvinchang1.com/projects/kaggle-santa-packing\u3011.  \n\n2. **Implement a depth\u2011first backtracking search** \u2013 place trees sequentially, checking feasibility after each placement. Incorporate symmetry detection to discard equivalent configurations and prune branches as soon as they become infeasible\u3010https://developer.ansys.com/blog/advent-code-2025-day-12-aka-packing-problem\u3011.  \n\n3. **Generate strong initial bounds** \u2013 run a fast greedy or largest\u2011first heuristic to obtain an upper\u2011bound side length. Feed this bound into the backtracking solver so that any partial solution exceeding it is cut off early.  \n\n4. **Skip reinforcement\u2011learning methods** \u2013 recent analysis shows RL policies struggle with the discrete geometry and do not achieve competitive scores, so focus on exact/heuristic optimization instead\u3010https://hmnshudhmn24.medium.com/kaggle-santa-2025-why-reinforcement-learning-is-failing-087f3f04fa97\u3011.  \n\n5. **Score and iterate** \u2013 compute the competition score as `score = \u03a3 (s\u2099\u00b2 / n)`. Continuously refine the model and pruning rules until the total score drops below\u202f68, which indicates a sufficiently compact packing\u3010https://www.competehub.dev/en/competitions/kagglesanta-2025\u3011.

Participants are tasked with determining the optimal way to pack Christmas tree toys into the smallest possible square box, allowing Santa Claus to mail them efficiently around the globe. The challenge is to find the dimensions of the smallest square box that can fit between 1 to 200 trees.\nThe competition is designed to encourage innovation and problem-solving skills, with a focus on packing efficiency. Participants are encouraged to submit their solutions, which will be evaluated based on the normalized area of the square bounding box for each puzzle configuration.\n### Description\nThe challenge is inspired by Santa&#x27;s need for the smallest box to fit all the tiny trees for his Christmas deliveries. Participants are required to find the best packing solution to help Santa Claus and win the competition&#x27;s prize.\n### Evaluation\nSubmissions are evaluated on the sum of the normalized area of the square bounding box for each puzzle. The formula for the score is:\n```\n`score = \u2211(sn^2/n)`\n```\nwhere`sn`is the side of the square box bounding the trees and`n`is the total number of trees in the configuration.\n### Submission File\nEach submission must include the tree position (`x`,`y`) and rotation (`deg`) for each`id`in the submission. The values must be converted to a string and prepended with an`s`before submission. Submissions with overlapping trees will result in an error. Location values must be constrained to -100 \u2264x, y \u2264100.\nThe file should have the following format:\n```\n`id,x,y,deg\n001\\_0,s0.0,s0.0,s20.411299\n002\\_0,s0.0,s0.0,s20.411299\n002\\_1,s-0.541068,s0.259317,s51.66348\netc.`\n```\n### Timeline\n* **November 17, 2025**: Start Date\n* **January 23, 2026**: Entry Deadline\n* **January 23, 2026**: Team Merger Deadline\n* **January 30, 2026**: Final Submission Deadline\nAll deadlines are at 11:59 PM UTC unless otherwise noted.\n### Prizes\n* **First Prize**: $12,000\n* **Second Prize**: $10,000\n* **Third Prize**: $10,000\n* **Fourth Prize**: $8,000\nAdditionally, a**Rudolph Prize**of $10,000 is awarded to the team holding 1st place on the leaderboard for the longest period of time between November 17, 2025, and January 30, 2026.\n### Citation\nWalter Reade and Ashley Oldacre.

We expect a fun puzzle. We get a nightmare of Combinatorial Optimization.\nThis year\u2019s edition,**\u201cSanta 2025: The Christmas Tree Packing Challenge,\u201d**is no exception. The goal? Pack $N$ irregular \u201cTree Polygons\u201d into the smallest possible square bounding box for $N=1$ to $200$.\nIf you checked the leaderboard today (Dec 21), you noticed a trend:**Reinforcement Learning (RL) is getting crushed.**\nDespite the massive hype around \u201cReasoning Models\u201d and PPO agents this year, the top 100 teams aren\u2019t using neural networks. They are using 1980s physics simulations. Here is why the \u201cOld School\u201d is winning, and how the pros are using LLMs to cheat the system.\n## The Problem: Why RL Hates \u201cPacking\u201d\nOn paper, this looks like a game.*Place a tree, check for overlap, repeat.*Perfect for a DQN agent, right?\nWrong. The geometry kills the gradient.\n1. **Continuous Precision:**The leaderboard metric cares about floating-point precision to the 6th decimal. RL agents (which output discrete actions or probability distributions) struggle to make the \u201cmicro-adjustments\u201d needed to squeeze a tree into a 0.001mm gap.\n2. **The \u201cCollision\u201d Cliff:**In packing, a move is either valid (reward = 1) or it overlaps by a pixel (reward = -100). This sparse, binary feedback loop makes it nearly impossible for an agent to \u201clearn\u201d a gradient. It doesn\u2019t know*how*to fix the overlap, just that it failed.## The Solution: Simulated Annealing (on Steroids)\nThe \u201cSecret Sauce\u201d currently dominating the leaderboard is**Simulated Annealing (SA)**combined with**Lattice Generation**.\nInstead of training a model to*predict*the position, teams are writing physics engines that*shake*the box.\n* **High Temperature:**Randomly spin and throw trees into the box (Explorer Phase).\n* **Low Temperature:**Jiggle the trees by microscopic amounts to resolve collisions (Exploiter Phase).\nThe best solutions right now use a \u201cHybrid\u201d strategy:\n* **N &lt; 58:**Use Simulated Annealing to find unstructured, chaotic packings.\n* **N &gt; 58:**Switch to \u201cCrystalline Packing\u201d (regular geometric lattices) which is mathematically superior for large numbers.## The Twist: How LLMs are Actually Helping\nIf RL is dead, where is the AI?\nTop competitors aren\u2019t using LLMs to*solve*the puzzle; they are using LLMs to**write the solver**.\nPython is too slow for 10 billion annealing steps. The meta this year is to prompt Gemini 3 or Claude to:\n\u201cRewrite this Python overlap-check function in Rust/C++ with AVX2 vectorization.\u201d\nWe are seeing \u201cHybrid\u201d workflows where the**Human**defines the heuristics, the**LLM**writes the highly optimized C++ kernels, and**Simulated Annealing**does the heavy lifting.\n## The Starter Code: A Simple Annealer\nIf you want to jump in before the January deadline, don\u2019t start with PyTorch. Start here.\nHere is a conceptual snippet for a \u201cPerturbation\u201d mover \u2014the heart of any good annealing solution.\n```\nimport numpy as np\nimport math\ndef anneal(layout, max\\_temps=10000):\n# layout: Array of [x, y, rotation] for N trees\ncurrent\\_score = calculate\\_area(layout)\ntemperature = 1.0\ncooling\\_rate = 0.9995\nfor i in range(max\\_temps):\n# 1. Propose a Move (The &quot;Shake&quot;)\n# We only move ONE tree slightly to save compute\nidx = np.random.randint(0, len(layout))\noriginal\\_pos = layout[idx].copy()\n# Perturb: Move x/y by small amount, rotate slightly\nlayout[idx][0] += np.random.normal(0, temperature)\nlayout[idx][1] += np.random.normal(0, temperature)\nlayout[idx][2] += np.random.normal(0, temperature \\* 10) # Rotate\n# 2. Check Constraints (The &quot;Wall&quot;)\nif check\\_overlap(layout):\n# Revert immediately if invalid\nlayout[idx] = original\\_pos\ncontinue\n# 3. Acceptance Criteria (Metropolis-Hastings)\nnew\\_score = calculate\\_area(layout)\ndelta = new\\_score - current\\_score\n# If better, accept. If worse, accept with prob based on Temp.\nif delta &lt; 0 or math.exp(-delta / temperature) &gt; np.random.rand():\ncurrent\\_score = new\\_score\nelse:\nlayout[idx] = original\\_pos # Revert\n# Cool down\ntemperature \\*= cooling\\_rate\nreturn layout, current\\_score\n# Pro Tip: Ask an LLM to convert &#x27;&#x27;check\\_overlap&#x27;&#x27; to Cython for 100x speed.\n```\nThe competition ends**January 30, 2026**.

Each day a new puzzle is unlocked and programmers in all the world try to solve them, with various goals in mind: to learn a new language, to improve their skills, to have fun, to help Santa\u2026 This year there were 12 days of puzzles.\n## The Problem\nThe Day 12 2025 problem was on placing presents in a limited space under the Christmas tree. You get presented with 1000 scenarios and you have to figure out for each of them whether it is solvable, meaning that the presents fit into the designated area.\nFor each scenario, the area is rectangular, but its size varies. The presents come in a handful of shapes, but their number varies again. Here is an example of how the 6 pieces can be placed in the given area (here 12x5):\n![A screenshot of a game](https://developer.ansys.com/sites/default/files/inline-images/Picture1.png)\n(The visualization is done via Ansys SpaceClaim scripting by creating the present geometries.)\nNote that the presents can be flipped and rotated in the plane (by multiples of 90\u00b0).\nNow for the actual problems, the number of presents, but also the areas are a lot larger:\n![A screenshot of a computer game](https://developer.ansys.com/sites/default/files/inline-images/Picture2.png)\nBin packing is a hard problem (NP-hard), so in general, this means that often you need to run through all the possibilities to check whether there is any solution (bruteforcing). Of course, you can do so in more and less clever ways, for instance by taking symmetries into account and stopping early if a branch becomes infeasible. My solution implements a backtracking algorithm and stops at the first solution (i.e. it doesn\u2019t try to find a tighter packing).\nIt is able to solve also packing-wise more challenging problems like this:\n![A screenshot of a puzzle](https://developer.ansys.com/sites/default/files/inline-images/Picture3.png)\nHowever, the complexity grows exponentially with the size of the problem and solving it becomes very quickly intractable.\nThere is one caveat, this problem happens to be a \u201ctroll\u201d problem, tricking people into writing much more complicated code than needed (I\u2019m guilty as charged). The scenarios fall in two categories: a) the presents all fit into a 3x3 subregion and there are more than enough 3x3-subregions in the domain (i.e. trivially solvable); b) the total area of all presents is larger than the area of the domain (i.e. trivially non-solvable). There are no problems of the intermediate category (like the last example here) which would need a proper packaging algorithm. It was nonetheless a fun exercise.\n### The Code\nYou can check out Andreas' code here:[https://gist.github.com/andreas-hilti/81d419a90bd6067b16751f9b3cf0677c](https://gist.github.com/andreas-hilti/81d419a90bd6067b16751f9b3cf0677c). However, please bear in mind that this code was written for fun, as part of Advent of Code and does not conform to Ansys' usual standards of code quality. It is also subject to change as further developments are made.\n[![Logo](https://developer.ansys.com/themes/custom/ansys/frontend/src/images/about_us_block.svg \"Logo\")](https://developer.ansys.com/)\n## Connect with Ansys\n[](https://www.youtube.com/user/ansysinc)[](https://twitter.com/AnsysDev)[](https://www.linkedin.com/company/ansys-inc/)[](https://github.com/Ansys)",

I may add a gurobi version of thes emodels in the near future.\nMy posts series:\n* [A MILP Journey, part 1: proof of 2440 lower bound](https://www.kaggle.com/c/santa-2021/discussion/300507)\n* [A MILP Journey, part 2: 2440 solution](https://www.kaggle.com/c/santa-2021/discussion/300516)\n* [A MILP Journey, part 3: wildcards](https://www.kaggle.com/c/santa-2021/discussion/300522)\nThe text below is an edited version of these posts.\n# Introduction\n[](#introduction)\nI decided to see if one of the optimization technique I know the best, namely mixed integer linear model (MILP) could be used here. To my surprise it worked fine. Let me try to explain how I worked with successive MILP models towards a 2428 solution.\nOne way to solve problems with MILP is to work with relaxations of the problem, i.e. models that include only a part of the problem specification, in the hope that the relaxation is easier to solve. Once a relaxation is solved we can add a bit more of the problem to it and iterate.\nBefore describing my models let's introduce some concepts\n# Permutations, graph and cycles\n[](#permutations-graph-and-cycles)\nWe define a directed graph whose nodes are permutations of the string 1234567, and whose arcs are weighted with a cost. In the full problem, some permutations, the ones starting with 12, must appear in each of the 3 strings while the other permutations can appear only in one of them. We call the strings starting with 12 the mandatory strings.\nIn some variant I duplicate the nodes for mandatory strings 2 times or 3 times. In that case the cost of arcs from a mandatory string to a copy of itself is set to 7.\nGraph arcs cost is defined by the overlap between the two permutations.\nFor instance, the cost of the arc between 1234567 and 4567312 is 3, because if we merge the second string with the first with overlap overlap, then we get 1234567312 which is 3 chars longer than the first string.\nWe call c-arc an arc of cost c.\nThe next concept is that of 1-cycle. It is made of all the rotations of a given permutation. For instance the 1-cycle starting with 1234567 visits these permutations in order, via 7 1-arcs:\n1234567\n2345671\n3456712\n4567123\n5671234\n6712345\n7123456\n1234567\nIf we cut the cycle some arc, say the first one above, and merge the strings with overlap, then we get a string of length 13:\n2345671234567\nThat's a general property: the length of a string obtained by breaking a cycle and merging its permutations is 7 plus the sum of the cost of the arcs in the cycle minus the arc we broke.\nOur last concept is a 2-cycle. It is made of 6 broken 1-cycles. For instance the 2 cycle starting with 1234567 is made of these 1-cycles:\n2345671234567\n3456721345672\n4567231456723\n5672341567234\n6723451672345\n7234561723456\nIf we merge the strings with overlap then we get\n23456712345672134567231456723415672345167234561723456\n# Lower bound proof\n[](#lower-bound-proof)\nThe first relaxation I tried was very crude. The code is in the lower\\_bound\\_proof.ipynb notebook. I start with a graph without repeating mandatory permutations. The MILP model has two sets of variables :\n* visit(p) is an integer variable whose value is the number of time p appears in the problem solution. The lower bound of visit(p) is set to 3 for p mandatory, 1 otherwise.\n* next(p1, p2) is an integer variable whose value is the number of times p1 is immediately followed by p2 in the strings of the solution to the problem.\nThe graph does not contain all arcs. If there is an arc(p1, p2) such that there exist two other arcs (p1, p3) (p3, p2) and cost(p1, p3) + cost(p3, p2) = cost(p1, p2) then I remove the arc (p1, p2...",
