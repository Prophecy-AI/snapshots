Participants are tasked with determining the optimal way to pack Christmas tree toys into the smallest possible square box, allowing Santa Claus to mail them efficiently around the globe. The challenge is to find the dimensions of the smallest square box that can fit between 1 to 200 trees.\nThe competition is designed to encourage innovation and problem-solving skills, with a focus on packing efficiency. Participants are encouraged to submit their solutions, which will be evaluated based on the normalized area of the square bounding box for each puzzle configuration.\n### Description\nThe challenge is inspired by Santa&#x27;s need for the smallest box to fit all the tiny trees for his Christmas deliveries. Participants are required to find the best packing solution to help Santa Claus and win the competition&#x27;s prize.\n### Evaluation\nSubmissions are evaluated on the sum of the normalized area of the square bounding box for each puzzle. The formula for the score is:\n```\n`score = \u2211(sn^2/n)`\n```\nwhere`sn`is the side of the square box bounding the trees and`n`is the total number of trees in the configuration.\n### Submission File\nEach submission must include the tree position (`x`,`y`) and rotation (`deg`) for each`id`in the submission. The values must be converted to a string and prepended with an`s`before submission. Submissions with overlapping trees will result in an error. Location values must be constrained to -100 \u2264x, y \u2264100.\nThe file should have the following format:\n```\n`id,x,y,deg\n001\\_0,s0.0,s0.0,s20.411299\n002\\_0,s0.0,s0.0,s20.411299\n002\\_1,s-0.541068,s0.259317,s51.66348\netc.`\n```\n### Timeline\n* **November 17, 2025**: Start Date\n* **January 23, 2026**: Entry Deadline\n* **January 23, 2026**: Team Merger Deadline\n* **January 30, 2026**: Final Submission Deadline\nAll deadlines are at 11:59 PM UTC unless otherwise noted.\n### Prizes\n* **First Prize**: $12,000\n* **Second Prize**: $10,000\n* **Third Prize**: $10,000\n* **Fourth Prize**: $8,000\nAdditionally, a**Rudolph Prize**of $10,000 is awarded to the team holding 1st place on the leaderboard for the longest period of time between November 17, 2025, and January 30, 2026.\n### Citation\nWalter Reade and Ashley Oldacre.

It is a data problem. If Santa tried to run Christmas on gut instinct, he would over-order the wrong toys, under-prepare for trends, waste reindeer energy and probably forget an entire time zone. So let us give Santa a proper analytics roadmap, using tools and techniques that any data analyst or data scientist would recognise from their own work.\n### **Turning the North Pole into a dataset**\nA practical Santa would start with a few familiar tables. A &lsquo;Children&rsquo; table with IDs, locations, ages, previous gifts and a &lsquo;naughty&rsquo; or &lsquo;nice&rsquo; score. A &lsquo;Gifts&rsquo; table with categories, cost, lead time and popularity. A &lsquo;Deliveries&rsquo; table with dates, times, success or failure and maybe a column for special notes like broken chimney or aggressive dog.\nIn real life this might live in a cloud warehouse. Santa&rsquo;&rsquo;s elves in data could use SQL to clean and join it, and something like Python with pandas to explore it, check quality and build features. Suddenly the Christmas legend looks a lot like a normal analytics stack.\nGut-instinct might help the team to remember a few problem regions or surprise trends but the data gives Santa full visibility. He can see which countries are growing fastest, which gifts always run out, if any routes have failed deliveries and how early children tend to send wish lists.\n### **Santa&rsquo;&rsquo;s recommendation system**\nSanta&rsquo;&rsquo;s elves often have to work on gut-instinct to personalise the gifts Santa delivers, which is why some children will be adding to their Lynx collection, or unused socks collection this year. If only there was a way to accurately understand which presents are best for everyone&hellip&hellip;\nWith proper data, predicting gifts becomes a recommendation problem. Given what a child liked in previous years, what children like in similar households and what is trending in their region, which gift is most likely to make them happy this year.\nA data scientist at the North Pole might start with simple models that every data analyst knows. Logistic regression or decision trees to predict whether a child will like a specific gift category. Random Forest or gradient boosting will capture more complex patterns, still with reasonably interpretable feature importance. Over time, Santa could move to collaborative filtering or matrix factorisation, the same idea that streaming platforms use to suggest films.\nThe nice part is that all of this can happen in tools that analysts already use. Python with scikit learn, or R with caret or tidymodels, and feature tables built with SQL and pandas. Model results can be tracked in a simple experiment log or with MLflow. No one needs to talk about &ldquo;hyper personalisation at scale&rdquo;. Santa just needs to know which toy to put in the sack for each child with a measurable probability of delight.\nGut-instinct might say, children everywhere love whatever toy was on television last week. A trained model can show that certain age groups in certain regions are quietly shifting toward books or experiences, or that interest in a very expensive gadget is actually limited to a small, loud group who write many letters but do not represent the majority.\n### **Planning the route without sounding like a logistics textbook**\nOnce Santa has the right gifts, he still has to move himself and a heavy sleigh around the planet in a sensible order. This is that classic shortest route problem many data people first met as the seven bridges of K&ouml;nigsberg problem. In normal language; Santa wants to visit an enormous number of homes without zigzagging all over the map and wasting time. That is not something you solve exactly in a single Jupyter notebook, but the general approach is very familiar.\nSanta&rsquo;s data team can turn the world into a graph, with houses as nodes and possible paths as edges, and attach distances or estimated flight times as weights. From there they can play with algorithms that search for good routes, starting with toy examples locally and then scaling up. At a small scale they might use exact solvers just to build intuition.The code simply states that Santa must visit each house once, respect a maximum load, and reach every time zone during the night. The solver does the heavy lifting and produces a route that is dramatically better than an expert guessing on a whiteboard.\nIf Santa relied on gut-instinct alone, he might over-focus on regions he remembers as difficult and underestimate travel between remote areas. The algorithm does not care how he feels about a country or a city. It only cares about the objective he wrote down.\n### **Experimenting like a Christmas startup**\nEven with all the modelling, Santa will still be wrong sometimes. The difference between a gut-led operation and a data-informed one is what happens next. In the data informed by the North Pole, mistakes are not embarrassing stories, they are experiments.\nSanta&rsquo;s team can run A/B tests using the same tools they would use in product or marketing work. Perhaps half the regions get a new packing process for fragile toys, and the other half stay with the old method. Analysts then track breakage rates and delivery satisfaction and decide whether to roll it out everywhere. They can also test different gift rules for children who are on the border between &lsquo;naughty&rsquo; and &lsquo;nice&rsquo;, then measure how that influences behaviour patterns in the following year.\nIn practice, this relies on familiar pieces, such as feature flags or configuration tables to control who sees what, experiment IDs in the data, and clear dashboards showing leaders whether a new idea actually worked. The key shift is cultural. Santa no longer says, I just know this is the right way. He says, we tried it, this is what the data shows and this is the choice we are making.\nSeen that way, the North Pole starts to look a lot like any complex organisation. There is too much going on for one person&rsquo;s intuition to manage. Human judgement is still essential for setting goals and values, but data, models and experiments decide which tactics scale. The same skills analysts use every day on earth, from SQL and pandas through scikit learn and optimisation libraries, are exactly what you would need to save Christmas from running on vibes alone.\n### Related articles\n[![](https://ioaglobal.org/../../uploads/The-Optimal-Blend-Finding-the-Sweet-Spot-Between-Data-Led-Strategy-and-Expert-Intuition.jpg)###### The Optimal Blend: Finding the Sweet Spot Between Data-Led Strategy and E...",
