Participants are tasked with determining the optimal way to pack Christmas tree toys into the smallest possible square box, allowing Santa Claus to mail them efficiently around the globe. The challenge is to find the dimensions of the smallest square box that can fit between 1 to 200 trees.\nThe competition is designed to encourage innovation and problem-solving skills, with a focus on packing efficiency. Participants are encouraged to submit their solutions, which will be evaluated based on the normalized area of the square bounding box for each puzzle configuration.\n### Description\nThe challenge is inspired by Santa&#x27;s need for the smallest box to fit all the tiny trees for his Christmas deliveries. Participants are required to find the best packing solution to help Santa Claus and win the competition&#x27;s prize.\n### Evaluation\nSubmissions are evaluated on the sum of the normalized area of the square bounding box for each puzzle. The formula for the score is:\n```\n`score = \u2211(sn^2/n)`\n```\nwhere`sn`is the side of the square box bounding the trees and`n`is the total number of trees in the configuration.\n### Submission File\nEach submission must include the tree position (`x`,`y`) and rotation (`deg`) for each`id`in the submission. The values must be converted to a string and prepended with an`s`before submission. Submissions with overlapping trees will result in an error. Location values must be constrained to -100 \u2264x, y \u2264100.\nThe file should have the following format:\n```\n`id,x,y,deg\n001\\_0,s0.0,s0.0,s20.411299\n002\\_0,s0.0,s0.0,s20.411299\n002\\_1,s-0.541068,s0.259317,s51.66348\netc.`\n```\n### Timeline\n* **November 17, 2025**: Start Date\n* **January 23, 2026**: Entry Deadline\n* **January 23, 2026**: Team Merger Deadline\n* **January 30, 2026**: Final Submission Deadline\nAll deadlines are at 11:59 PM UTC unless otherwise noted.\n### Prizes\n* **First Prize**: $12,000\n* **Second Prize**: $10,000\n* **Third Prize**: $10,000\n* **Fourth Prize**: $8,000\nAdditionally, a**Rudolph Prize**of $10,000 is awarded to the team holding 1st place on the leaderboard for the longest period of time between November 17, 2025, and January 30, 2026.\n### Citation\nWalter Reade and Ashley Oldacre.

What size Christmas tree do you need? Should you go for the classic full shape, a narrow one, or something different? As a high-quality tree is meant to last, knowing the right Christmas tree dimensions ensures you\u2019re making the right investment in your family\u2019s holiday memory-making. We\u2019ve broken down the process into four easy steps to guide you in finding your perfect artificial Christmas tree.\n## Step 1: Choose Where to Put Your Christmas Tree\nBefore looking for your tree, identify where you want to set it up. Here are some factors to consider\nColumn\n![A cozy room decorated for Christmas, featuring a beautifully adorned Christmas tree, a leather armchair, a decorative wreath, and small golden Christmas trees, with snow visible through the windows.]()\n## * Visibility \u2013A Christmas tree serves as the focal point of your holiday home. Place it in a large room\u2019s center or a cozy corner to command attention.\n* Foot Traffic \u2013To avoid accidents, provide clearance between your tree and doorways or walkways. Allot extra space to accommodate gifts.\n* Furniture \u2013You may need to rearrange or remove some pieces to make room for your tree.\n* Power Source \u2013Place your tree near an electrical outlet for easy lighting.\n* Safety \u2013Protect your tree from heat sources such as radiators, fireplaces, and candles.\n3 Tiles\n## Christmas Tree Display Area Ideas\nHere are some popular spots to place your holiday tree.\n![A decorated Christmas tree with red and gold ornaments, surrounded by wrapped gifts, a fireplace, and a holiday wreath on the wall.]()\n## ### Foyer\nWelcome guests with a festive Christmas tree display in your entrance hall.\n![A beautifully decorated Christmas tree with ornaments and lights stands in a cozy room with wooden walls.

The room has a window with red and white curtains and a nightstand with holiday decorations.]()\n## ### Bedroom/Guest Rooms\nDelight family members and guests by infusing Christmas cheer into other living areas.\n## Step 2: Measure the Space\nNow that you\u2019ve chosen the location for your tree, it\u2019s time to size up your area. \u00a0Grab a ladder and measuring tape, and follow our simple guide:\nColumn\n![A cozy living room decorated for the holidays, featuring multiple Christmas trees with lights, a fireplace, and candlelit presents on the floor.]()\n## 1. Measure the distance between the ceiling and the floor and note it down.\n2. If you plan to use a[**tree topper**](https://www.balsamhill.com/c/christmas-tree-toppers-and-finials), subtract 12 inches from your ceiling height. If you don\u2019t need a topper, subtract 6 inches from your ceiling height. This measurement is the maximum height of your Christmas tree including its stand. All Balsam Hill standard Christmas tree sizes are calculated by measuring the tree stand to the topmost tip.\n3. Use your measuring tape to determine the available floor space for your tree. Adjust furniture placement if needed to maximize the area.\n4. Subtract 12 inches from this measurement and note it down. This is the maximum width of your tree.\n## Step 3: Find the Perfect Christmas Tree Size\nArtificial Christmas trees are offered in various heights and shapes. As you review your options, don\u2019t forget to match them to the measurements you listed.\nColumn\n![A decorated living room featuring a Christmas tree, a wreath on the window, blue sofas, and holiday decor.]()\n## When selecting the right height, allot 12 inches clearance between the top of your tree and the ceiling to accommodate a standard tree topper.

We're a member of the Russell Group: one of the 24 leading UK universities for research and teaching.\n[About the University](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/about/home)",

The final solution is evaluated by an ensemble score that combines all cases.\n**Notebook Link**:[Santa 2025 - Christmas Tree Packing Challenge V1](https://www.kaggle.com/code/adityapawar327/santa-2025-christmas-tree-packing-challenge-v1)\n**Public Score**: 85.92\n## Table of Contents\n[](#table-of-contents)\n* Library Imports and Environment Setup\n* Global Configuration and Precision Settings\n* ChristmasTree Class Definition\n* Utility Functions (Scoring/Collision)\n* Simulated Annealing Algorithm (N &lt; 20)\n* Grid Search Algorithm (N &gt;= 20)\n* Hybrid &amp; Ensemble Solvers\n* Main Computation Loop (N = 1 to 200)\n* Submission Formatting and Export\n## Methodology\n[](#methodology)\n* **Small N (&lt; 20):**Uses Simulated Annealing for efficient search in small configuration spaces.\n* **Large N (&gt;= 20):**Uses a tailored Grid Search for tractable solution space exploration.\n* **Hybrid/Ensemble:**Runs multiple seeds and chooses the best solution for each N.\n* **Collision Detection:**Employs Shapely geometry operations to prevent tree overlap.\n* **Performance:**Code leverages parallelization (`ProcessPoolExecutor`) and high-precision (Decimal) arithmetic.\n## Usage\n[](#usage)\n1. Install dependencies:\n* `shapely`,`numpy`,`pandas`,`matplotlib`,`tqdm`\n* Run the notebook or script sequentially to output results and save a`submission.csv`.\n* Check the score on important N cases (e.g., 1, 10, 25, 50, 100, 150, 200).\n## Output\n[](#output)\n* The notebook prints key logs during computation.\n* A`submission.csv`is generated with columns:`id`,`x`,`y`,`deg`(example row:`001\\_0, s-9.146226, s-0.12832, s-224.999647`).\n## License\n[](#license)\nThis project is released under the[Apache 2.0 License](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).\n## Author\n[](#author)\nAditya Pawar ([Kaggle Profile](https://www.kaggle.com/adityapawar327))\nFor questions or collaboration, feel free to reach out via Kaggle discussions or connect on[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adityapawar327).\n## About\nIn this re-defined optimization problem, help Santa fit Christmas tree toys into the smallest (2-dimension) parcel size possible so that ...",
