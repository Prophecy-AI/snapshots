      "text": "[Skip to main content](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/chebyshev-distance#main)\n\nData science and spatial analysis rely heavily on various distance metrics to solve complex problems. While Manhattan and Euclidean distances are widely recognized, another very interesting metric deserves attention: Chebyshev distance. This distance measure offers a distinct perspective on spatial relationships, particularly in grid-based environments and multidimensional data spaces.\n\nIn this guide, we'll explore the fundamentals of Chebyshev distance, examine its mathematical properties, and investigate its real-world applications. We'll also provide practical coding examples in Python and R, enabling you to implement Chebyshev distance calculations in your own projects. Also, if you are looking to deepen your understanding of how such metrics fit into broader data science workflows, our course on [Designing Machine Learning Workflows in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/designing-machine-learning-workflows-in-python) offers valuable insights into integrating various analytical techniques, including distance-based learning.\n\n![](https://media.datacamp.com/cms/google/ad_4nxeptpbucnjja4xri8yjsyfxx25a1mu_uqtlnpiis004ouqxnmg_7tyhcbfe-p-euutek60zw9s_n2u_wmrtqycboi1odu_f2b6pmkxpjzceozl2thex0mxsjdh7bwt-tnzjh6v1svswoltmcqkwdcptdgk0.png)\n\n_\"Chessboard distance.\" Image by Dall-E._\n\n## What is Chebyshev Distance?\n\nChebyshev distance, named after the Russian mathematician Pafnuty Chebyshev, is defined as the maximum difference between the coordinates of two points along any single axis. Mathematically, for two points P = (x1, y1, ..., z1) and Q = (x2, y2, ..., z2) in n-dimensional space, the Chebyshev distance is expressed as:\n\n![Chebyshev distance formula](https://media.datacamp.com/cms/google/ad_4nxdrdz1zzowglkt6un0sbko8skemiomkw3b7znf9zkgushhc2i6kvnzcdmgqmkckvyz7xicxlpk36aigx_kntwasvh2uot3dq7e4gvobq8kysxocicbyd5rmekz2ka8p8bfeqo_ymslyi_pe9mgwpwxh3cb1.png)\n\nThis definition sets Chebyshev distance apart from other common metrics like Manhattan distance (which sums the absolute differences) and Euclidean distance (which calculates the straight-line distance).\n\n## How Chebyshev Distance Works\n\nLet\u2019s look at how Chebyshev distance works in order to build our intuition.\n\n### Geometric interpretation\n\nChebyshev distance emphasizes the maximum shift in any coordinate direction, which is pivotal in scenarios where movement is not restricted to horizontal or vertical paths but includes any direct line.\n\nConsider two points in a 2-dimensional space: Point A at coordinates (1, 1) and Point B at coordinates (4, 5). To find the Chebyshev distance between these two points, we focus on the maximum difference along any one coordinate axis.\n\n- The difference along the x-axis: \\|4 - 1\\| = 3\n- The difference along the y-axis: \\|5 - 1\\| = 4\n\nHere, the Chebyshev distance is 4 because Chebyshev distance = max(3, 4) = 4.\n\nThe accompanying visual illustrates these points on a grid, highlighting the area that falls within a Chebyshev distance of 4 from Point A. The yellow shaded area shows all the positions that are reachable within this distance metric.\n\n![Chebyshev Distance Demonstrated in a 2D Coordinate System](https://media.datacamp.com/cms/google/ad_4nxc35x2-w4gs_jyn0c2bxaj88gnhdgxc5ho1t9bjkwied0jcorov49qirfkwusyqfufli9kzlxfye8m90zbpqujg4mjwnz2ern1v-digcuudt_7gsxv52lglhnkvire5m319t15qw-kbw1etdssha31ybug.png)\n\nChebyshev Distance Demonstrated in a 2D Coordinate System. Image by Author.\n\n### Grid interpretation\n\nChebyshev distance is also commonly called chessboard distance because it can be easily understood in the context of chess: The Chebyshev distance between two squares is equivalent to the number of king moves required to go from one square to the other. This interpretation can be visualized on our grid, where each number represents the Chebyshev distance from the central square (where the king is located) to every other square on the board.\n\n![Chebyshev Distance Visualized on a Chessboard Layout](https://media.datacamp.com/cms/google/ad_4nxfovzvh8c8fq2mroozld5cwfxiryvxs_loayrhjsqyrnvgpvpf44x5hgefgv5awbmi13fpoclepudfpyu5mciqhg_arb3cgmdkkyzm7z_2g69trurj2nhzecwv15wz7yhebpjnqstf7jcdffoy26ltqwedu.png)Chebyshev Distance Visualized on a Chessboard Layout. Image by Author.\n\nIn our visual model, the king is positioned on c5. The numbers on the chessboard represent the Chebyshev distance from c5 to all other squares. For example, the distance from c5 to e7 is 2 because the king can reach e7 in two moves: one diagonal move to d6, followed by another diagonal move to e7. Similarly, the distance to the nearest edge squares (like c8 or h5) is simply counted by the number of direct horizontal or vertical moves.\n\nThis grid-based approach to explaining Chebyshev distance highlights its practical application in games like chess and is also relevant in pathfinding algorithms used in robotics and artificial intelligence, where the goal is to find the most efficient path between points in a grid.\n\n## Applications of Chebyshev Distance\n\nThe properties of Chebyshev distance make it valuable in various fields, particularly where grid-like structures or simultaneous movement along different axes are involved. Let's explore some applications:\n\n### Robotics and warehouse logistics\n\nIn environments where robots or automated systems move along grid patterns, Chebyshev distance can optimize path planning. Imagine, for example, agricultural robots navigating crop fields or autonomous vehicles in structured environments.\n\nIn automated warehouses, robots often move along grid-like paths. Chebyshev distance helps optimize their movements, especially when they can move diagonally. This optimization can significantly improve efficiency in item retrieval and storage processes.\n\n### Image processing\n\nIn digital image analysis, Chebyshev distance is used in pixel-based operations. It helps define neighborhoods around a pixel for various transformations and filters. This is often used in tasks like edge detection or pattern recognition.\n\nThe ability to consider diagonal pixels as easily as horizontal or vertical ones makes Chebyshev distance particularly useful in these applications.\n\n### Geographic information systems (GIS)\n\nUrban planners and emergency services can use Chebyshev distance to calculate the minimum number of moves required between two points on a grid map. This is valuable for optimizing emergency route planning in cities with grid-like street layouts or planning efficient public transportation routes.\n\nIn these scenarios, Chebyshev distance can provide a quick estimate of travel time or distance in environments where diagonal movement is possible.\n\n### Machine learning and data science\n\nIn the field of machine learning and data science, Chebyshev distance finds applications in certain clustering algorithms or anomaly detection systems.\n\nIt's particularly useful in scenarios where the maximum difference along any dimension is more important than the overall difference. For example, in anomaly detection, a data point that significantly deviates in just one feature might be considered an anomaly, regardless of its values in other dimensions.\n\n### Game development\n\nBeyond chess, Chebyshev distance has broader applications in game development, especially for grid-based games. It can model movement costs for entities that can move diagonally as easily as horizontally or vertically. This is particularly useful in strategy games, roguelikes, or any game with grid-based movement.\n\nAlso, by incorporating Chebyshev distance, game developers can create more detailed and realistic movement mechanics, enhancing gameplay and strategic depth.\n\n## Mathematical Properties of Chebyshev Distance\n\nChebyshev distance satisfies all the properties of a metric space, which is crucial for its application in various fields. Let's verify these properties:\n\n1. Non-negativity: For any two points _x_ and _y_, _d(x, y) \u2265 0_\n\nThe Chebys...",

The goal of this optimization problem is to place a set of irregular\npolygons onto a material sheet without overlapping and in a way that minimizes wasted\nmaterial.\nIn this thesis, we delve into a fast 2D packing algorithm that automatically arranges\nparts of a user\u2019s design onto their available material sheets to provide live feedback on\nhow much material they have left. To do this, we make use of the concept of the no fit\npolygon to generate candidate placements, and we utilize custom heuristics and performance\noptimization to improve packing quality and runtime .\nOur technical evaluation shows that the implementation is fast enough to work at\ninteractive speeds and produce solutions of similar quality to other tools and algorithms that\nperform automated packing.\nThesis Supervisor: Stefanie Mueller\nTitle: Assistant Professor\n3\n4\nAcknowledgments\nFirst of all, I would like to extend my deepest gratitude to my advisor, Professor Stefanie\nMueller. She has been especially supportive during these trying times and has always been\navailable to give guidance and instruction. I would also like to give the hugest of thank yous\nto Ticha Sethapakdi and Daniel Anderson without whom this thesis could not have been\npossible. Ticha was the mastermind of Fabricaide and its user interface, and also somehow\nsimultaneously manages to be one of the coolest and one of the most awkward people I\nknow. Dan was always available to provide guidance and support in wrangling with C++\nand other difficult aspects of the implementation. Even outside the context of working on\nFabricaide, Ticha and Dan have been great friends and role models throughout the time I\ngot to know them. I could not have asked for a better group of mentors and colleagues than\nProfessor Mueller, Ticha and Dan.\nI am extremely grateful to my friends and family both here in the MIT community as\nwell as back home in the Philippines all the way at the other side of the world.

In this post we&#x27;ll have a look what goes into collision detection as well as a strategy to pack any arbitrary shape in 2D.\n#### By[Ahmad Moussa](https://www.gorillasun.de/author/ahmad/)\nPublished on July 22, 2022\nLast Updated on August 28, 2024\n21 min read\n![A Simple Solution for Shape Packing in 2D](https://www.gorillasun.de/content/images/size/w1200/2023/03/banner2.jpg)\nThis blog post is about the age-old creative coding problem of shape packing! Even though it might seem like a simple task at first, it is actually quite an involved undertaking. It also usually entails having a broader look at how collision detection algorithms work. In the following sections we'll work our way up to an algorithm with which you can essentially pack any sort of geometric shapes, and combinations thereof.\n![](https://www.gorillasun.de/content/images/2023/03/example1.jpg)\n![](https://www.gorillasun.de/content/images/2023/03/example2.jpg)\nBefore we begin, I want to point out that I had a first encounter with this algo back in February of 2022. I never completed that particular idea, but it led to an interesting packing scheme. You can see some of the artworks my code produced above.\n![](https://www.gorillasun.de/content/images/2023/03/maplands.jpg)\nI also recently learned that a few others have made their own version of this idea. In June I faced a packing problem where I had to draw all sorts of geometric shapes to the canvas. I was left scratching my head at first and it took me quite a while to find a solution. While researching different methods I came across[Amy Goodchild\u2019s](https://twitter.com/amygoodchild?ref=gorillasun.de)[writeup](https://www.amygoodchild.com/blog/maplands?ref=gorillasun.de)on a wonderful sketch of hers called \"Maplands\" where she used a similar strategy to what I ultimately did to implement my idea.\n![](https://www.gorillasun.de/content/images/2023/03/fruitpacking.jpg)\nLater on I also re-discovered[Tarwin Stroh-Spijer's](https://twitter.com/tarwin?ref=gorillasun.de)[fruit salad packing sketch](https://openprocessing.org/sketch/1533577?ref=gorillasun.de), which initially evolved from[Jeff's (aka ippsketch)](https://twitter.com/ippsketch?ref=gorillasun.de)[banana packing sketch](https://ippsketch.com/posts/non-circular-packing/?ref=gorillasun.de). I had a thorough look at Tarwin's beautifully written packing library, and a lot of the code in later sections of this post are based on Tarwin's method. Go check out the folks mentioned above, they're all awesome creative individuals!\n### Discussion:\n1. [Packing Algorithms in Generative Art](#packing-algorithms-in-generative-art)\n2.

[Closing Notes](#closing-notes)## Packing Algorithms in Generative Art\n![](https://www.gorillasun.de/content/images/2023/03/tripack.jpg)\nPacking problems come in various flavours, but generally their overarching concern is positioning items as densely as possible within a given area. Despite its deceptive simplicity, bin packing is actually an[NP-Hard problem](https://stackoverflow.com/a/19510170?ref=gorillasun.de), with it's associated decision problem (checking if the items to be packed fit in a certain area), is[NP-Complete](https://gorillasun.de/blog/rectangle-packing-an-incredibly-difficult-problem?ref=gorillasun.de). Understanding this is not necessary for what follows however. I just find it incredibly interesting though, I keep finding myself coming back to this problem thinking: \"Surely this can't be this difficult!\"\nPacking algorithms are useful for a range of real life scenarios, such as packing boxes in a warehouse, or positioning shapes on a sheet of laser cutting material such that the amount of wasted material is minimised. Packing is a heavily researched area of mathematics and fairly advanced algorithms have been developed to solve different variations of it. In generative art the primary goal of packing algorithms is often the creation of visually pleasing and interesting packing patterns. We also often don't start with shapes that have a pre-determined size (usually real life objects have a pre-determined size duh), but make them up on the go.\nHence gen-art packing algorithms vary a little in that regard. I'd like to show off a few artworks that have in one another or another been made with packing algorithms. Here's two stunning artworks from[Caleb Ogg](https://twitter.com/iso_hedron?ref=gorillasun.de):\n![](https://www.gorillasun.de/content/images/2023/03/Colorshift2.jpg)\n![](https://www.gorillasun.de/content/images/2023/03/Lens3.jpg)\nCaleb's pieces[Lens 3](https://superrare.com/0x6125e13fc97f6fc97ea14cf925211e4dc0e99f0f/lens-3-18?ref=gorillasun.de)and[Colorshift 2](https://superrare.com/0x6125e13fc97f6fc97ea14cf925211e4dc0e99f0f/colorshift-2-12?ref=gorillasun.de), part of his ongoing 'Coalesce' series, are some of the most interesting circle packing sketches I've seen in a while. Note that the images shown here (2000x2000px) don't do the originals justice which are absolutely gigantic (16000x16000px). Built on a system of circles and rings, Caleb makes use of an underlying noise field for a nifty creative effect. I especially like how Lens conveys the illusion of multiple overlapping lenses that appear to contort the coloration of the underlying circles, which is done by scaling and multiplying the underlying noise field. Excited to see where this series is heading, always a pleasure when Caleb's sketches bless my timeline.\nA little less recent[example](https://www.infinite.center/2015/08/08/circles-inside-circles/?ref=gorillasun.de)of a circle packing sketch is by none other than Jared Tarbell:\n![](https://www.gorillasun.de/content/images/2023/03/javadpack.jpg)\nAs well as this[beautiful homage](https://www.reddit.com/r/generative/comments/ibk6pf/circle_packing_\u00e0_la_tarbell/?ref=gorillasun.de)to Jared's sketch by prolific creative coder[Dmitri Cherniak](https://twitter.com/dmitricherniak?ref=gorillasun.de):\n![](https://www.gorillasun.de/content/images/2023/03/dimitripack-1.webp)\nIf you like these patterns you should also check out the[Appolonian Gasket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollonian_gasket?ref=gorillasun.de)(alternatively Appolonian circle packing). And for good measure we also need to mention[Yann LeGalle](https://twitter.com/Yann_LeGall?ref=gorillasun.de)who just utterly blows my mind on a regular basis:\nAnd one of the earliest ones that captivated me and initially motivated me to explore circle packing for myself was this sketch by Piter Pasma's:\n> [> > > > > > > > View this post on Instagram\n> > > > > > > > > > > > ](https://www.instagram.com/p/CLEl7WGH6j8/?utm_source=ig_embed&utm_campaign=loading)\n[> A post shared by Piter Pasma (@piterpasma)\n](https://www.instagram.com/p/CLEl7WGH6j8/?utm_source=ig_embed&utm_campaign=loading)\nI really love this one.

This paper reviews recent advances in the domain of 2D irregular packing problems based on a variety of research papers.

We hope that this review could provide guidance for researchers in the field of 2D irregular packing.\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nTwo-dimensional (2D) irregular packing problems are widespread in industries such as machinery manufacturing, aviation, shipbuilding, automobile manufacturing, clothing and furniture manufacturing. An efficient 2D irregular packing algorithm can effectively improve material utilization and reduce processing costs. The reduction in material consumption will also have a beneficial impact on the environment ( [Ke et al., 2020](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B76)). Therefore, research of the packing problem is of great significance for technology and social interest.\n\nThe 2D packing problem is a type of combinatorial optimization problems to locate parts with different shapes compactly in one or more master sheet material to minimize the occupied space or maximize the utilization of the material. The 2D packing problem is currently recognized as a NP problem, which is mainly solved by heuristic algorithms. In recent years, many scholars have conducted research on 2D irregular packing problems with a verity of solutions.\n\nThere exists a number of review articles on packing and cutting problems. We have summarized the main review literature in the field of 2D packing and cutting as shown in [Table 1](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#T1). Brown ( [Brown, 1971](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B17)) introduced an optimum packing and depletion problem with optimization of space and resource usage. Harvey ( [Salkin and De Kluyver, 1975](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B116)) surveyed the application of mathematical optimization models such as linear programming to the knapsack problem.

A link will be provided\nin a future version of this document.\narXiv:2308.08523v1 [cs.CG] 16 Aug 2023\n2 Improved Approximations for Translational Packing of Convex Polygons\n1 Introduction\nMany real-life situations require us to make decisions about optimally packing a collection\nof objects into a specific container. One particular category of these packing problems is\ntwo-dimensional packing, which is encountered in everyday scenarios like arranging items\non a shelf and in industrial applications such as cutting cookies from rolled-out dough\nor manufacturing sets of tiles from standard-sized panels made of wood, glass, or metal.\nAnother intriguing example involves cutting fabric pieces for clothing production. In this\ncase, the pieces often cannot be rotated freely, as they must adhere to a desired pattern\nin the final product, which is tailored of multiple elements. The widespread applicability\nof two-dimensional packing problems has led to a surge of interest in designing efficient\nalgorithms to address them. In this paper, we follow the line of research and study the\nproblem of packing convex polygons without rotations in various settings depending on the\ntype of containers used.\nPast research focusing on theoretical considerations of two-dimensional packings mainly\nconcentrates on the scenario when all objects are axis-parallel rectangles. In this paper, we\nwill discuss packing without rotations, in which only translations are permitted. There are\ntwo main classes of the problem depending on whether the size of the container is fixed and\nwe want to minimize the number of containers used or whether we want to minimize the\ncontainer\u2019s size with respect to some objective function.\nA seminal example of the first class is the Geometric Bin Packing problem in which\na number of unit size squared bins to pack is to be minimized. The problem is arguably\nthe most natural generalization of the regular (1D) Bin Packing to two dimensions, and\nits absolute approximability has been fully understood. Unless P = N P, the best possible\nefficient constant factor approximation is 2 [15], and such an algorithm is known [10].\nIn the second class, there are several variants to be considered. An example is the\nStrip Packing Problem which is concerned with packing objects into a strip of width\n1 and infinite height in such a way that the maximum of all the heights of the placed\nobjects is minimized. Like Geometric Bin Packing, Strip Packing generalizes (1D)\nBin Packing. The best known efficient constant factor approximation for Strip Packing\nhas approximation factor (5/3 + \u03f5) [9]. It is known that there can not exist a polynomial\ntime algorithm with an approximation ratio of (3/2 \u2212 \u03f5) for any \u03f5 > 0 unless P = N P, which\nfollows directly from the approximation hardness of (1D) Bin Packing. Both classes of\nproblems have been also considered in the asymptotic setting, see e.g. [11, 5, 12].\nIn younger time, there was also an increase of interest in cases where the objects in\nquestion are general convex polygons. Alt, de Berg and Knauer [2, 3] considered the problem\nof packing an instance consisting of a number of convex polygons of the form p \u2282 [0, 1]2into\na minimum area axis-parallel rectangular container. We refer to this problem as Polygon\nArea Minimization throughout this paper. In the special case where the instance consists\nof rectangles only, the problem is known to admit a PTAS [4]. They proved the existence of\nthe following efficient algorithm:\nA 23.78-approximation for Polygon Area Minimization.\nRecently, Aamand, Abrahamsen, Beretta and Kleist [1] showed that the algorithm of Alt,\nde Berg and Knauer can be leveraged to obtain also efficient approximation algorithms of\nfurther problems:\nA 7-approximation for Polygon Perimeter Minimization.\nA 51-approximation for Polygon Strip Packing.\nAn 11-approximation for Polygon Bin Packing for polygons with diameter at most 1\n10 .\nA. Kurpisz and S. Suter 3\n1.1 Our results\nThe results of Alt, de Berg and Knauer [2, 3] and Aamand et al. [1] are heavily based on\nso-called shelf packing algorithms. In shelf packing algorithms, the objects are first placed\non the shelves, possibly ordered by height, which are later stacked on one another to build\na final solution. Compared to axis-parallel rectangles, the main challenge in designing an\napproximation algorithm for polygon packing problems is that objects cannot be sorted by\nheight and orientation simultaneously. As a result, the algorithm and its analysis in [2, 3]\nhave such a large approximation guarantee. In this paper, we provide new insight into how\nshelf packing algorithms should be applied to polygon packing problems. We introduce a\nsequence of transformations of the objects that allow us first to sort them by height and later\nby orientation to build a solution of a much better approximation guarantee. More precisely,\nwe design polynomial-time algorithms with the following factors:\nA 9.45-approximation for Polygon Area Minimization.\nUsing this algorithm as a subroutine, we build upon the methods from Aamand et al. [1] to\nobtain the following efficient approximation algorithms:\nA (3.75 + \u03f5)-approximation for Polygon Perimeter Minimization.\nA 21.89-approximation for Polygon Strip Packing.\nA 5.09-approximation for Polygon Bin Packing for polygons which have their diameter\nbounded by 1\n10 .\nThe results are proved in Sections 4, 5, 6, and 7 respectively. Furthermore, in Section 8\nwe show the following results, which make progress towards solving an open question of a\nO(1)-approximation algorithm for Polygon Bin Packing for arbitrary polygons.\nThere is an efficient O(\n1\n\u03b4\n)-approximation algorithm for Polygon Bin Packing for\ninstances where each polygon has width or height at most 1 \u2212 \u03b4.\nThere is an efficient O(1)-approximation algorithm for Polygon Bin Packing for\ninstances with the property that all polygons share a spine (up to translation) with height\nat least 3\n4\n.\n2 Preliminaries\nWe start out considerations by recalling a classical and well-known problem in theoretical\ncomputer science, the Bin Packing problem: Given a list of numbers s1, . . . , sn \u2208 (0, 1] \u2229 Q,\nrepresenting the sizes of n objects, the goal is to find the minimum number of bins of size 1,\nso that we can pac...",
