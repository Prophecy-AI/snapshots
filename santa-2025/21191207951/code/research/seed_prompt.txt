## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.627608 from snapshot ensemble
- Best LB score: 70.627634 (exp_020)
- Target: 68.919154 | Gap to target: 1.708 (2.42%)

## Critical Analysis

After 22 experiments, we have hit a fundamental wall:
- ALL SA-based approaches converge to ~70.63
- Improvement rate has dropped to 0.0001-0.001 per experiment
- At this rate, would need 1700+ experiments to reach target
- The asymmetric solutions experiment (020) was run but showed WORSE results than baseline

**The baseline is at an EXTREMELY STRONG local optimum that cannot be escaped by:**
- More SA iterations
- Different SA parameters
- Different random seeds
- Asymmetric placements from scratch (spiral, radial, hexagonal)
- Ensemble from snapshots (all valid snapshots converge to same ~70.63)

## Response to Evaluator

The evaluator correctly identified that:
1. SA-based optimization has hit diminishing returns (0.000262 improvement in last run)
2. We need fundamentally different approaches

**However, the asymmetric experiment WAS completed and FAILED** - the asymmetric placements (spiral, radial, hexagonal) scored 0.9-1.0 vs baseline 0.35-0.38 for test N values. The baseline has a fundamentally better STRUCTURE that cannot be replicated by generating solutions from scratch.

## What We Know Works (from research)
- "Square-packing with Chebyshev distance" - mentioned for scores below 69
- "Smart scan-line linear packing" - mentioned for scores below 69
- "No-Fit Polygon (NFP)" based placement - used in fast 2D packing algorithms
- Top teams use "handcrafted geometric heuristics" not SA

## Recommended Approaches (Priority Order)

### 1. **[HIGHEST PRIORITY] Implement NFP-based Chebyshev Packing**
Based on web search results, implement:
1. Pre-process each tree polygon - compute AABB, half-width, half-height
2. Generate candidate translations using No-Fit Polygon grid
3. Evaluate candidates with Chebyshev distance: d_cheb = max(|dx - cx_i|, |dy - cy_i|)
4. Select placement that minimizes bounding box increase
5. Apply to all N values and compare with baseline

### 2. **[HIGH PRIORITY] Greedy Constructive Heuristic**
Instead of optimizing existing solutions, BUILD new solutions:
1. Sort trees by some heuristic (largest first, or by angle)
2. Place first tree at origin
3. For each subsequent tree, find position that minimizes bounding box
4. Use NFP to ensure no overlaps

### 3. **[MEDIUM PRIORITY] Per-N Specialized Strategies**
Different approaches for different N ranges:
- N=1-10: Exhaustive search (small enough to enumerate)
- N=11-50: Specialized tessellation patterns
- N=51-100: Grid-based with optimization
- N=101-200: Large-scale tessellation

## What NOT to Try
- ❌ More SA iterations on current solution (diminishing returns)
- ❌ Different SA parameters (all converge to same local optimum)
- ❌ Asymmetric placements from scratch (already tried, WORSE than baseline)
- ❌ Ensemble from snapshots (all valid snapshots at same ~70.63)

## SUBMISSION STRATEGY
- Remaining submissions: 90
- Submit after implementing NFP-based packing to get LB feedback
- Even if worse than baseline, LB feedback tells us what DOESN'T work

## Validation Notes
- CV = LB exactly for this problem (deterministic optimization)
- Always check for overlaps before submitting
- Use Shapely for overlap detection

## Key Insight
The problem is that we're trying to OPTIMIZE an already-optimized solution. Instead, we should try to CONSTRUCT a fundamentally different solution using geometric heuristics (NFP, Chebyshev distance) that might find a different basin of attraction.
