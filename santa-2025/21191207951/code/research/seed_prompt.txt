## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.627608 (exp_023_nfp_chebyshev - fell back to baseline)
- Best LB score: 70.6276 (exp_020)
- Target: 68.919154 | Gap to target: 1.71 points (2.48%)
- Submissions: 10/100 used, 90 remaining

## Response to Evaluator

The evaluator correctly identified that:
1. **Asymmetric solutions experiment (020) was NOT completed** - cells 5+ were never executed
2. **Diminishing returns from SA** - improvement dropped from 0.002559 to 0.000262 (10x reduction)
3. **Gap is still large** - 1.71 points requires fundamentally different approaches

I AGREE with the evaluator's assessment. The greedy Chebyshev packing I just tried (exp 023) was 2-3x WORSE than baseline, confirming that simple constructive heuristics cannot match the baseline's structure.

**Key insight from my analysis**: Small N values (1-10) have the WORST efficiency:
- N=1 is only 53% efficient (0.66 vs theoretical 0.35)
- N=2 is 78% efficient
- Large N (100+) are actually BETTER than theoretical minimum

This suggests we should focus optimization efforts on SMALL N values, not large N.

## CV-LB Relationship Analysis
- This is a deterministic optimization problem - CV = LB exactly
- All 10 submissions show perfect CV-LB alignment (differences are floating point precision)
- No distribution shift issues - the problem is finding better packings

## What Has Been Tried (22 experiments)
1. **Ensemble from multiple sources** - Found saspav_best.csv has 14 better N values (exp 010)
2. **bbox3 optimization** - No improvement (exp 004)
3. **SA with various parameters** - Minimal improvements (exp 013, 019, 021, 022)
4. **C++ SA with 2M iterations** - Found 3 tiny improvements totaling 0.0003 (exp 022)
5. **Greedy Chebyshev packing** - 2-3x WORSE than baseline (exp 023)
6. **Grid-based approaches** - All worse than baseline (exp 006, 007)
7. **Tessellation approaches** - No improvement (exp 010, 018)

## What Has NOT Been Tried
1. **ASYMMETRIC SOLUTIONS** - Experiment 020 was created but NEVER RUN (cells 5+ not executed)
2. **Focused optimization on SMALL N (1-10)** - These have worst efficiency
3. **Crystalline/lattice packing** - Different from simple grid
4. **Scan-line packing with drift correction** - Mentioned in research

## Recommended Approaches (Priority Order)

### 1. **[HIGHEST PRIORITY] Complete Asymmetric Solutions Experiment**
The notebook exists at `/home/code/experiments/020_asymmetric_solutions/asymmetric_packing.ipynb`.
Cells 5+ test asymmetric perturbation on baseline with:
- Spiral, radial, hexagonal placements with random angles
- Multiple restarts (10 per N)
- SA optimization from these starting points

**Action**: Execute cells 5-10 of the existing notebook OR create a new experiment that:
1. Takes the baseline solution
2. Applies asymmetric perturbations (random angles 0-360°, not just 0/90/180/270)
3. Uses SA to optimize from these new starting points
4. Tests on N=10, 20, 50, 100, 150, 200 first

### 2. **[HIGH PRIORITY] Focus on Small N Optimization**
Small N values have the worst efficiency and contribute disproportionately to the gap:
- N=1: 53% efficient (0.66 vs 0.35 theoretical)
- N=2: 78% efficient
- N=3: 80% efficient

For N=1, the optimal angle should be analytically solvable. Try:
- Exhaustive search over angles (0-360° in 0.1° increments)
- The current solution uses angle=45°, but is this truly optimal?

### 3. **[MEDIUM PRIORITY] Scan-line Packing with Drift Correction**
Research mentions "Smart scan-line (linear) packing" with drift/deskewing correction achieves scores below 69.
This is different from the greedy Chebyshev approach I tried.

**Implementation idea**:
1. Place trees along a sweep line
2. Adjust line height dynamically to fill gaps
3. Apply drift correction to minimize bounding box

## What NOT to Try
- ❌ More C++ SA iterations (diminishing returns - 0.0003 per 2M iterations)
- ❌ Simple greedy constructive heuristics (2-3x worse than baseline)
- ❌ Grid-based approaches (all worse than baseline)
- ❌ bbox3 optimization (no improvement found)

## Validation Notes
- CV = LB exactly (deterministic problem)
- Use Shapely for overlap detection
- Score = sum of (side^2 / N) for all N=1-200

## SUBMISSION STRATEGY
- Remaining submissions: 90
- **SUBMIT after this experiment** - we have abundant submissions
- Even if the approach doesn't improve, LB feedback confirms what doesn't work
