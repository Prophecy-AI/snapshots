## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.627608 from snapshot ensemble
- Best LB score: 70.627634 (exp_020)
- Target: 68.919154 | Gap to target: 1.708 (2.42%)

## Critical Analysis

After 22 experiments, we have hit a fundamental wall:
- ALL SA-based approaches converge to ~70.63
- Improvement rate has dropped to 0.0001-0.001 per experiment
- At this rate, would need 1700+ experiments to reach target
- The asymmetric solutions experiment (020) was run but showed WORSE results than baseline

**The baseline is at an EXTREMELY STRONG local optimum that cannot be escaped by:**
- More SA iterations
- Different SA parameters
- Different random seeds
- Asymmetric placements from scratch (spiral, radial, hexagonal)
- Ensemble from snapshots (all valid snapshots converge to same ~70.63)

## Response to Evaluator

The evaluator correctly identified that:
1. The asymmetric solutions experiment was created but the key insight is that it WAS run and FAILED - the asymmetric placements (spiral, radial, hexagonal) scored 0.9-1.0 vs baseline 0.35-0.38 for test N values
2. SA-based optimization has hit diminishing returns (0.000262 improvement in last run)
3. We need fundamentally different approaches

**However, I disagree that "completing" the asymmetric experiment will help** - it was completed and showed that generating solutions from scratch with asymmetric placements is WORSE than the optimized baseline. The baseline has a fundamentally better STRUCTURE.

## What We Know Works (from research)
- "Square-packing with Chebyshev distance" - mentioned for scores below 69
- "Smart scan-line linear packing" - mentioned for scores below 69
- "Crystallography-inspired lattice packing" - 17 plane-group symmetries
- Top teams use "handcrafted geometric heuristics" not SA

## What We Haven't Tried
1. **Chebyshev distance packing** - NOT implemented
2. **Scan-line packing** - Attempted in exp_012 but failed
3. **Crystalline lattice with plane-group symmetries** - NOT implemented
4. **Per-N specialized strategies** - NOT systematically explored

## Recommended Approaches (Priority Order)

### 1. **[HIGHEST PRIORITY] Implement Chebyshev Distance Packing**
The research mentions "square-packing with Chebyshev distance" achieves scores below 69.
- Chebyshev distance: d(p,q) = max(|x1-x2|, |y1-y2|)
- This corresponds to the smallest axis-aligned square containing both points
- Implement a packing algorithm that uses Chebyshev distance to place trees

### 2. **[HIGH PRIORITY] Implement Crystalline Lattice Packing**
Use the 17 plane-group symmetries (wallpaper groups):
- p1 (no symmetry), p2 (180° rotation), pm/pg (mirrors/glides)
- p4/p4m (square lattice with 4-fold rotation)
- p6/p6m (hexagonal lattice with 6-fold rotation)
- Different from simple grid - uses crystallographic principles

### 3. **[MEDIUM PRIORITY] Per-N Specialized Strategies**
Different approaches for different N ranges:
- N=1-10: Exhaustive search (small enough to enumerate)
- N=11-50: Specialized tessellation patterns
- N=51-100: Grid-based with optimization
- N=101-200: Large-scale tessellation

### 4. **[LOW PRIORITY] Hybrid Approach**
Combine multiple techniques:
- Use Chebyshev packing for initial placement
- Apply SA to refine
- Ensemble best results

## What NOT to Try
- ❌ More SA iterations on current solution (diminishing returns)
- ❌ Different SA parameters (all converge to same local optimum)
- ❌ Asymmetric placements from scratch (already tried, WORSE than baseline)
- ❌ Ensemble from snapshots (all valid snapshots at same ~70.63)

## SUBMISSION STRATEGY
- Remaining submissions: 90
- Submit after implementing Chebyshev packing to get LB feedback
- Even if worse than baseline, LB feedback tells us what DOESN'T work

## Validation Notes
- CV = LB exactly for this problem (deterministic optimization)
- Always check for overlaps before submitting
- Use Shapely for overlap detection
