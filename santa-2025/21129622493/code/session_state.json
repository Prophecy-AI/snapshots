      "query": "What are the best algorithms for irregular polygon packing optimization?",
      "finding": "Irregular\u2011polygon packing (also called irregular 2\u2011D nesting) seeks to place a set of non\u2011convex polygons into one or more bins or a strip while minimizing waste or the number of bins used. Because the exact problem is NP\u2011hard, most practical solvers rely on sophisticated heuristics or meta\u2011heuristics that combine a fast constructive phase with a powerful improvement phase\u202f([Frontiers](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmech.2022.966691/full)).\n\nThe most widely used constructive approaches are based on **No\u2011Fit\u2011Polygon (NFP)** calculations and simple placement rules. An NFP\u2011based nesting algorithm that introduces trace lines for lower time\u2011complexity and a *lowest\u2011gravity\u2011center* placement policy outperforms the classic bottom\u2011left rule and can handle arbitrary rotations and holes\u202f([ACM](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1141277.1141507)). A related 2\u2011level algorithm builds a collision\u2011free region (CFR) and then places pieces inside it, achieving high utilization on heterogeneo",
