      "text": "Simulated annealing (SA) is a meta\u2011heuristic that mimics the cooling of a molten metal to escape local minima and gradually converge to a low\u2011energy configuration. In the context of two\u2011dimensional irregular\u2011polygon packing, the \u201cenergy\u201d is usually defined as the wasted space or the amount of overlap between pieces, and the algorithm searches for a rotation\u2011and\u2011translation of each polygon that minimizes this waste while keeping all items inside a fixed container\u202f([scielo.br](https://www.scielo.br/j/jbsmse/a/NjF3nW9xTMnxmMThYJ8WQyv)). A common way to test for collisions is the no\u2011fit polygon (NFP) or Minkowski\u2011sum technique, which produces a collision\u2011free region for each item and avoids the need for ad\u2011hoc penalty parameters\u202f([abcm.org.br](https://abcm.org.br/symposium-series/SSM_Vol2/Section_XII_Emerging_Technologies_and_AI_Applications/SSM2_XII_02.pdf)).\n\nModern SA implementations enrich the basic scheme with adaptive neighbourhoods and feedback mechanisms that adjust the size of the perturbations based on recent acceptance history. Martins\u202fet\u202fal. introduced a \u201ccrystallization factor\u201d that expands or contracts the search step after each accepted or rejected move, respectively, and applied it to rotational irregular\u2011packing problems\u202f([semanticscholar.org](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/6509/3a9d2d6b9b38ac2c9a2da79c3905b76ef008.pdf)). An additional \u201cgravity\u2011center squeeze\u201d idea treats each polygon as if it were attracted toward the container\u2019s centroid, applying a virtual force that pulls pieces together and reduces gaps; this force\u2011based squeeze is combined with SA\u2019s stochastic moves to improve density without violating the NFP\u2011derived collision constraints\u202f([sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S147466701535549X)).\n\nTogether, these techniques enable high\u2011utilisation layouts for industries such as shipbuilding, textile, and sheet\u2011metal cutting, where irregular shapes must be nested efficiently. The review by Petrillo\u202fet\u202fal. highlights that SA\u2011based methods, especially those incorporating adaptive neighbourhoods and centre\u2011pulling forces, remain among the most effective heuristics for two\u2011dimensional irregular packing as of the early\u20112020s\u202f([frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmech.2022.966691/full)).",

This problem is approached with an heuristic based on simulated annealing. Traditional \" external penalization\" techniques are avoided through the application of the no-fit polygon, that determinates the collision-free region for each small item before its placement. The simulated annealing controls: the rotation applied and the placement of the small item. For each non-placed small item, a limited depth binary search is performed to find a scale factor that when applied to the small item, would allow it to be fitted in the large object. Three possibilities to define the sequence on which the small items are placed are studied: larger-first, random permutation and weight sorted. The proposed algorithm is suited for non-convex small items and large objects.\n**Keywords:**knapsack problem, cutting and packing, optimization\n**Introduction**\nThe knapsack problem arises in the industry whenever one must place multiple small items inside a large object such that there is no collision between the small items, while either minimizing the size of the large object or maximizing the volume occupied by the small items. High material utilization is of particular interest to mass production industries since small improvements of the layout can result in large savings of material and considerably reduce production cost.\nThe knapsack problem belongs to the more general class of combinatorial problems known as cutting and packing problems. According to Dyckhoff (1990), the cutting and packing problems are mainly characterized by the number of relevant dimensions, the regularity and irregularity of the shapes of the small items and large objects and the problem assignment. Considering assignment, it is possible to identify two situations: output maximization and input minimization. In the input minimization, the set of large objects is sufficient to accommodate all small items, and there is no selection regarding the small items. In the case of output maximization, the set of large objects is not sufficient to accommodate all the small items and a set of small items has to be assigned to a given set of large objects. The survey made by Wascher et al. (2005) improved the typology of cutting and packing problems proposed by Dyckhoff (1990). According to Wascher et al. (2005), the problem studied in this work can be defined as: \" ... the knapsack problem represents a problem category which is characterized by a strongly heteroge-neous assortment of small items which have to be allocated to a given set of large objects. Again, the availability of the large objects is limited such that not all small items can be accommodated. The value of the accommodated small items is to be maximized\" . In this survey, Wascher et al. (2005) identified 294 papers containing material relevant to cutting and packing. Only 5...",

This problem is approached with an heuristic based on Simulated Annealing (SA) with adaptive neighborhood. Traditional \u201cexternal penalization\u201d techniques are avoided through the application of the no\u2013fit polygon, that determinates the collision-free area for each polygon before its placement. The SA controls continuous and discrete parameters. The rotation applied and the translation of the polygon are continuous parameters, and the sequence of placement is represented as a set of discrete parameters. For each non\u2013placed item, a limited depth binary search is performed to find a scale factor that when applied to the item, would allow it to be fitted in the container.\n\n- [Previous article in issue](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1474667015355488)\n- [Next article in issue](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1474667015355506)\n\n## Keywords\n\nSimulated Annealing\n\nPlacement Problems\n\nOptimization\n\nProbabilistic Heuristics\n\n[View PDF](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S147466701535549X/pdf?md5=7bca88c33d2daef044751913b4156e2b&pid=1-s2.0-S147466701535549X-main.pdf)\n\nSpecial issue articlesRecommended articles\n\n## References\n\n01.

We hope that this review could provide guidance for researchers in the field of 2D irregular packing.\n## 1 Introduction\nTwo-dimensional (2D) irregular packing problems are widespread in industries such as machinery manufacturing, aviation, shipbuilding, automobile manufacturing, clothing and furniture manufacturing. An efficient 2D irregular packing algorithm can effectively improve material utilization and reduce processing costs. The reduction in material consumption will also have a beneficial impact on the environment ([Ke et al., 2020](#B76)). Therefore, research of the packing problem is of great significance for technology and social interest.\nThe 2D packing problem is a type of combinatorial optimization problems to locate parts with different shapes compactly in one or more master sheet material to minimize the occupied space or maximize the utilization of the material. The 2D packing problem is currently recognized as a NP problem, which is mainly solved by heuristic algorithms. In recent years, many scholars have conducted research on 2D irregular packing problems with a verity of solutions.\nThere exists a number of review articles on packing and cutting problems. We have summarized the main review literature in the field of 2D packing and cutting as shown in[Table 1](#T1). Brown ([Brown, 1971](#B17)) introduced an optimum packing and depletion problem with optimization of space and resource usage. Harvey ([Salkin and De Kluyver, 1975](#B116)) surveyed the application of mathematical optimization models such as linear programming to the knapsack problem. Bruce ([Golden, 1976](#B50)) surveyed various approaches to the cutting stock problem.

C\nDepartment of Mechatronics and Mechanical Systems Engineering, EPUSP\nthiago.martins@poli.usp.br\nTsuzuki, M. S. G.\nDepartment of Mechatronics and Mechanical Systems Engineering, EPUSP\nmtsuzuki@usp.br\nThis work deals with the problem of minimize the waste of space that occurs on a placement of a set of bi-dimensional\npolygons inside a bi-dimensional container. This problem is approached with an heuristic based on Simulated Annealing,\nwhich is inspired on the physico-chemical process that take place during the recrystalisation of a metal. Traditional \u201cex\u0002ternal penalisation\u201d techniques are avoided through the application of the Minkowski sum algorithm, that determinates\ncollision-free areas for the set of polygons. That gives to the proposed process a more universal character, as external\npenalisations are based on empiric parameters of great influence on the optimisation performance. The proposed process\nis suited for non-convex polygons and containers, and can be easily adapted for related problems, such as container size\nminimisation.\n1. Introduction to placement problems\nThe polygonal placement problems arises in the industry whenever one must place multiple objects inside a container\nso that there is no collision between the objects, while either minimizing the size of the container either maximizing the\nvolume occupied by the objects. For instance, on the shoe industry, a maximum number of shoe parts must be placed\nover a leather piece. Another instance of the problem occurs in the textile industry, where cloth parts must be placed over\nthe smallest possible sheet of tissue. Those problems are also closely related to robot motion planning, where a trajectory\nfor an object (the robot) that leads it from one point to another must be found while avoiding collisions with pre-placed\nobstacles. Those placement problems are also known by the names of nesting, containment, layout, packing and cutting\nstock (Downsland et al., 1995). Surveys of placement problems can be found at (Lodi et al., 2002; Downsland et al., 1992;\nDownsland et al., 1995). Computational approaches often focus on purely translational versions of the problem, and the\nmajor part of them approach problems whose polygons are constrained to rectangular shapes.\n2. This work\nAs seen on the section 1, due to their complexity, irregular placement problems are the least computationally ap\u0002proached, despite their great relevancy for the industry. This is the motivation for this work, which deals with the bidi\u0002mentional placement on its most unconstrained form, the translational and rotational placement of heterogeneous irregular\nforms (both nonvex and non convex) on irregular containers (also both convex and non convex).\n2.1 Problem statement\nThe problem can be defined as the problem of, given a container (a polygon, convex or non-convex) and a polygon\nset, to determinate a subset of polygons and the transformations (translations and rotations) that, when applied to their\nrespective polygons, place them without collisions inside the container while minimising the wasted space (see Figure 1).\nDefinition 1 There is a collision between two polygons when their intersection is a non-empty set.\nAs mentioned, it can be show that even restricted versions of this problem (for instance, limiting the polygon shape to\nrectangles only) are NP-Complete, which means it is believed they cannot be algorithmically solved for practical instances\n(Fowler et al. 1981). This motivates an heuristic approach, that while is not guaranteed to find the optimal solution, can,\nin a reasonable amount of time, find a good solution. Probabilistic optimisation heuristics follow this pattern: while a\nstipulated stop criteria is not satisfied, at each step the function to be optimised is evaluated at a set of points and a set of\nrules is applied to determinate the set of points to be evaluated at the next step. The process converges to a solution of the\nproblem.\nFor our problem, the space of valid solutions is the set of transformations (\u2206x, \u2206y, \u2206\u03b8) to be applied to the polygons\nrestricted to the condition of no-collisions between them. The space delimited by those restrictions is very complex (and\nmutable). Usually, when confronted to such complex spaces, probabilistic heuristics \u201crelax\u201d the original constrains of\nProcedings of COBEM 2005\nCopyright \u00b0c 2005 by ABCM\n18th International Congress of Mechanical Engineering\nNovember 6-11, 2005, Ouro Preto, MG\nPolygon set Container\nSolution\nFigure 1. A placement problem and its optimal solution.\nthe problem, allowing the search to go through points outside the space of valid solutions and applying penalisations to\ntheir cost. This technique is known as external penalisation. While at first this technique greatly simplifies the problem,\nit also introduces and additional problem: How to determinate the exact amount of penalisation to be applied to external\npoints? Another drawback of external penalisation is that it can lead the optimisation process to non-valid solutions. This\ncan be seen on the work of Heckman (1995), where problems very similar to those studied here are approached with\nsimulated annealing. On his work. Heckman points that his optimisation process can produce invalid solutions (solutions\nwith collisions between polygons), requiring a post-processing step of the obtained data.\nThe approach adopted here avoids the pitfalls of external penalisation by the continuous mapping (meaning it is\nupdated at each step of the process) of the complex space of valid solution into a simplified space. Although this additional\nmapping step increases the complexity of the process, it confers to the process a more universal character, as there is one\nless empiric parameter to be defined. Actually, the proposed process does not explores the whole space of possible\nsolutions, focusing instead on a reduced space, that contains at least one optimal solution. This reduces the search through\nirrelevant points and enhances the performance of the process.\n2.2 Simulated annealing\nSimulated Annealing (Kirkpatrick et al., 1983) is the probabilistic meta-heuristic adopted on this work. It was chose\ndue to its capacity of \u201cescape\u201d from local minima (which are very frequent on this problem). It is also worth of mention\nthat the process of recrystalisation, the inspiration for simulated annealing, is a natural instance of a placement problem.\n2.2.1 Description\nSimulated annealing comes from the Metropolis algorithm, a simulation of the recrystalisation of atoms on a metal\nduring its annealing (gradual and controlled cooling). During annealing, atoms migrate naturally to configurations that\nminimize the system total energy, even if during this migration the system must pass through high-energy configurations.\nThe observation of this behavior suggests the application of the simulation of such process to combinatorial optimisation\nproblems.\nSimulated annealing is a hill-climbing local exploration1 optimisation heuristic, which means it can skip local minima\nby allowing the exploration of the space in directions that lead to an increase on the cost function. It sequentially applies\nrandom modifications on the evaluation point of the cost function. If a modification yields a point of smaller cost,\nit is automatically kept. Otherwise, the modification also can be kept with a probability obtained form the Boltzman\ndistribution (1).\nP(\u2206E) = e\n\u2212 \u2206E\nkt (1)\nwhere P(\u2206E) is the probability of the optimisation process to keep a modification that incurred on an increase \u2206E of\nthe cost function, k is a parameter of the process (analogous to the Stefan-Boltzman constant) and t is the instantaneous\n\u201ctemperature\u201d of the process.

Tsuzuki\nAdditional information is available at the end of the chapter\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5772/50302\n1. Introduction\nSimulated annealing has been applied to a wide range of problems: combinatorial and\ncontinuous optimizations. This work approaches a new class of problems in which the\nobjective function is discrete but the parameters are continuous. This type of problem arises in\nrotational irregular packing problems. It is necessary to place multiple items inside a container\nsuch that there is no collision between the items, while minimizing the items occupied area.\nA feedback is proposed to control the next candidate probability distribution, in order to\nincrease the number of accepted solutions. The probability distribution is controlled by\nthe so called crystallization factor. The proposed algorithm modifies only one parameter\nat a time. If the new configuration is accepted then a positive feedback is executed to\nresult in larger modifications. Different types of positive feedbacks are studied herein. If\nthe new configuration is rejected, then a negative feedback is executed to result in smaller\nmodifications. For each non-placed item, a limited depth binary search is performed to find a\nscale factor that, when applied to the item, allows it to be fitted in the layout. The proposed\nalgorithm was used to solve two different rotational puzzles. A geometrical cooling schedule\nis used. Consequently, the proposed algorithm can be classified as simulated quenching.\nThis work is structured as follows. Section 2 presents some simulated annealing and\nsimulated quenching key concepts. In section 3 the objective function with discrete values and\ncontinuous parameters is explained. Section 4 explains the proposed adaptive neighborhood\nbased on the crystallization factor. Section 5 explains the computational experiments and\nsection 6 presents the results. Finally, section 7 rounds up the work with the conclusions.\n2. Background\nSimulated annealing is a probabilistic meta-heuristic with a capacity of escape from local\nminima. It came from the Metropolis algorithm and it was originally proposed in the area\nof combinatorial optimization [9], that is, when the objective function is defined in a discrete\n\u00a92012 Tsuzuki et al., licensee InTech.

The simulated annealing was modified in order to apply to the optimization of\nmultimodal functions defined on continuous domain [4]. The choices of the cooling schedule\nand of the next candidate distribution are the most important decisions in the definition of a\nsimulated annealing algorithm [13]. The next candidate distribution for continuous variables\nis discussed herein.\nIn the discrete domain, such as the traveling salesman and computer circuit design problems,\nthe parameters must have discrete values; the next point candidate xk+1 corresponds to a\npermutation in the list of cities to be visited, interchanges of circuit elements, or other discrete\noperation. In the continuous application of simulated annealing a new choice of the next point\ncandidate must be executed. Bohachevsky et al. [1] proposed that the next candidate xk+1 can\nbe obtained by first generating a random direction vector u, with |u| = 1, then multiplying it\nby a fixed step size \u0394r, and summing the resulting vector to the current candidate point xk.\nBrooks & Verdini [2] showed that the selection of \u0394r is a critical choice. They observed that an\nappropriate choice of this parameter is strictly dependent on the objective function F(x), and\nthe appropriate value can be determined by presampling the objective function.\nThe directions in [1] are randomly sampled from the uniform distribution and the step size is\nthe same in each direction. In this way, the feasible region is explored in an isotropic way and\nthe objective function is assumed to behave in the same way in each direction. But this is not\noften the case. The step size to define the next candidate point xk+1 should not be equal for all\nthe directions, but different directions should have different step sizes; i.e. the space should\nbe searched in an anisotropic way. Corana et al. [4] explored the concept of anisotropic search;\nthey proposed a self-tuning simulated annealing algorithm in which the step size is configured\nin order to maintain a number of accepted solutions. At each iteration k, a single variable of\nxk is modified in order to obtain a new candidate point xk+1, and iterations are subdivided\ninto cycles of n iterations during which each variable is modified. The new candidate point is\nobtained from xk in the following form xk+1 = xk + v \u00b7 \u0394ri \u00b7 ei. Where v is a uniform random\nnumber in [\u22121, 1], and \u0394ri is the step size along direction ei of the i-th axis. The anisotropy is\nobtained by choosing different values of \u0394ri for all the directions. The step size is kept fixed\nfor a certain number of cycles of variables, and the fraction of accepted moves in direction ei\nis calculated. If the fraction of accepted moves generated in the same direction is below 0.4,\nthen the step size \u0394ri along ei is decreased. It is assumed that the algorithm is using too large\nsteps along ei thus causing many moves to be rejected. If the fraction is between 0.4 and 0.6\nthe step size is left unchanged. If the fraction is above 0.6 then \u0394ri is increased. It is assumed\nthat the step size is too small thus causing many moves to be accepted.\nThis procedure may not be the best possible to process the different behavior of the objective\nfunction along different axes. Ingber [7] proposed that the random variable should follow a\nCauchy distribution with different sensitivities at different temperatures. The maximum step\nsize is kept constant during the algorithm and it allows escaping from local minima even at\nlow temperatures. The parameter space can have completely different sensitivities for each\ndimension, therefore the use of different temperatures for each dimension is suggested. This\nmethod is often referred to as very fast simulated re-annealing (VFSR) or adaptive simulated\nannealing (ASA). The sensitivity of each parameter is given by the partial derivative of the\nfunction with relation to the i-th dimension [3].\n4 Simulated Annealing \u2013 Advances, Applications and Hybridizations\nAdaptive Neighborhood Heuristics for Simulated Annealing over Continuous Variables 3\n3. Integer objective function with float parameters\nIrregular packing problems arise in the industry whenever one must place multiple items\ninside a container such that there is no collision between the items, while minimizing the\narea occupied by the items. It can be shown that even restricted versions of this problem (for\ninstance, limiting the polygon shape to rectangles only) are NP complete, which means that\nall algorithms currently known for optimal solutions require a number of computational steps\nthat grow exponentially with the problem size rather than according to a polynomial function\n[5]. Usually probabilistic heuristics relax the original constraints of the problem, allowing the\nsearch to go through points outside the space of valid solutions and applying penalization to\ntheir cost. This technique is known as external penalization. The most adopted penalization\nheuristic for external solutions of packing problems is to apply a penalization based on\nthe overlapping area of colliding items. While this heuristic leads to very computationally\nefficient iterations of the optimization process, the layout with objective function in minimum\nvalue may have overlapped items [6].\nFig. 1 shows an example in which the c...",

High material utilization is of particular interest to mass production industries since small improvements of the layout can result in large savings of material and considerably reduce production cost. In this work the Simulated Annealing is combined with deterministic heuristics (larger first (LF), bottom left (BL) and translations only (Tr)) and compared. The rotational generic approach has discrete (sequence of placement) and continuous (angle and position) parameters. It is very important to notice that the cost function (non occupied space) has only discrete values.\n\n- [Previous article in issue](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1474667016340174)\n- [Next article in issue](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1474667016340198)\n\n## Keywords\n\nComputer vision\n\nmatched filter\n\ninvariant mapping\n\n[View PDF](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1474667016340186/pdf?md5=8b357149307a0ecbdb40b0d6add2590e&pid=1-s2.0-S1474667016340186-main.pdf)\n\nSpecial issue articlesRecommended articles\n\n## References\n\n01.

The approach is based on an Iterated Local Search scheme, in which the key step is the perturbation move. Different perturbation moves, both combinatorial and continuous ones, are proposed and compared through extensive computational experiments on a set of test instances. The overall results are quite encouraging.\n\n## Introduction\n\nIn packing problems some items have to be placed into some containers in such a way that the overall unused space within the container (the so called _waste_) is minimized. The items and the containers have a fixed (usually two- or three-dimensional) shape, while their dimensions and positions can vary. More formally, let us consider _N_ items. For each item _i_ we introduce the parameter vectors xi,\u03b1i, the former being usually a vector of variables, while the latter might be a vector of fixed or variable values, depending on the applications (see below). These two vectors are, respectively, a position and a size vector, which allow to uniquely identify the portion of the space where the item lies, denoted by Di=Di(xi,\u03b1i),i=1,\u2026,N.For instance, if the items are circles, we have a two-dimensional position vector corresponding to the coordinates of the center of the circle, while we have a single size parameter, corresponding to the radius of the circle. Although the shapes of the items might be different from each other, in most cases the shape is the same for all of them. Possible shapes are convex ones such as circles, squares, rectangles, but also nonconvex ones are sometimes considered.\n\nNext, we consider a container C=C(x0,\u03b10),with some fixed shape (not necessarily equal to those of the items), and also depending on a position and a size vector. In some applications the vectors, identifying the portion of the space occupied by the container, are replaced by a description of such portion through proper inequalities and/or equalities.\n\nA packing problem can be formulated as an optimization problem. The _constraints_ of the problem are the following:\n\n- \u2022\nthe items may touch each other but cannot overlap, i.e.,Di0(xi,\u03b1i)\u2229Dj0(xj,\u03b1j)=\u2205\u2200i\u2260j,where _D_ _i_0, _D_ _j_0 denote the interior of _D_ _i_, _D_ _j_;\n\n- \u2022\nthe items must lie within the container, i.e.,Di(xi,\u03b1i)\u2286C(x0,\u03b10)\u2200i.\n\n\nThe _decision variables_ depend on the problem at hand. Usually, the position vectors **x** _i_ are variables, while the size vectors \u03b1i can either be variables or fixed values. The position vector **x** 0 for the container is usually fixed, while its size vector may either be variable or fixed. The _objective_ of the problem should state the fact that we aim at minimizing the waste. This can be accomplished in different ways depending on the nature of the position and size vectors:\n\n- \u2022\n_items_: _variable_ **x** _i_, _fixed_ \u03b1i; _container_: _fixed_ **x** 0, _variable_ \u03b10\u2014in this case we aim at minimizing the area (or volume) of the container, which is usually obtained as some function of the variable parameter \u03b10;\n\n- \u2022\n_items_: _variable_ **x** _i_, _variable_ \u03b1i; _container_: _fixed_ **x** 0, _fixed_ \u03b10\u2014in this case we aim at maximizing the sum of the areas (or volumes) of the items, where the area of each item _i_ is usually obtained as some function of the variable parameter \u03b1i;\n\n- \u2022\n_items_: _variable_ **x** _i_, _fixed_ \u03b1i; _container_: _fixed_ **x** 0, _fixed_ \u03b10\u2014in this case we aim at maximizing the number _N_ of items which can be placed within the container without violating the constraints.\n\n\nMany packing problems have been tackled in the literature. Most papers present heuristic approaches, although some exact approaches have also been proposed. A detailed survey about methods and applications of packing problems can be found in \\[1\\], while a problem typology is extensively presented in \\[2\\].\n\nProbably, the most widely studied cases are those involving circular items within containers having some regular form such as a circle or a square. In the field of circular items/square container we recall some heuristic (see, e.g., \\[3\\], \\[4\\], \\[5\\], \\[6\\], \\[7\\]) and exact approaches (see, e.g., \\[8\\], \\[9\\], \\[10\\], \\[11\\]). We also refer to survey \\[12\\] and a book \\[13\\]. Heuristic approaches for the case of circular items/circular container include those discussed in \\[14\\], \\[15\\], \\[16\\], \\[17\\], \\[18\\], \\[19\\], \\[20\\], \\[21\\], \\[22\\], \\[23\\], \\[24\\]. In \\[25\\] the problem of packing cylinders into a rectangular container is considered, while in \\[26\\] circular items are packed into triangles, rectangles and strips. In \\[27\\] the problem of placing circles with different sizes into a rectangular container with fixed width and minimum height is considered. An even more general problem is tackled in \\[28\\], aiming at cutting several different shapes (circles and convex polygons) from rectangular plates of raw material. Benchmark results for the problem of packing equal circles in a container whose shape is a square, a circle or an equilateral triangle are reported and continuously updated in E. Specht's web site.1 Test instances for the problem of packing unequal circles in a circle include those in \\[17\\] and the quite challenging instances from the Circle Packing Contest.2 The problem of packing irregular polygons has also been well studied (see \\[29\\] for an overview), considering either fixed size containers or infinite length strips (the so\u2013called Irregular Strip Packing Problem). The latter has been tackled, for instance, in \\[30\\] using a local search-based method, while in \\[31\\] linear programming relaxations are solved in a Simulated-Annealing framework.\n\nIn this paper we deal with the case of rectangular items/convex container.

The container has a fixed width, while its length can change so that all items are placed in it. The objective is to find a layout of the set of polygons that minimizes the length of the container. The proposed algorithm constructively creates layouts from an ordered list of items and a placement heuristic. The placement determines the collision free region (represents the set of translations to create a feasible layout) for the item to be placed. It is shown that the collision free region must be calculated using non-regularized Boolean operations, as contours of no-fit polygons should be ignored. The proposed algorithm to solve the placement problem has two levels, in the internal level the container has fixed dimensions, and the external level reduces or increases the variable dimension. The placement heuristic searches for degenerated vertices and edges as they represent local maximum compaction. Computational comparisons on benchmark problems show that the proposed algorithm generated highly competitive solutions. Moreover, our algorithm updated some best known results.\n...Read more\n## Key takeaways\n![sparkles](https://a.academia-assets.com/images/icons/sparkle.svg)\nAI\n1. The proposed two-level algorithm effectively minimizes container length for irregular polygon packing.\n2. Collision free regions (CFRs) are determined using non-regularized Boolean operations to avoid contour interference.\n3. Placement heuristic prioritizes degenerated edges and vertices for optimal item fitting and compaction.\n4. Benchmark tests with 13 datasets demonstrated competitive results, achieving 100% density in some cases.\n5.

This problem is approached with an heuristic based on simulated annealing. Traditional &quot;external penalization&quot; techniques are avoided through the application of the no-fit polygon, that determinates the collision-free region for each small item before its placement. The simulated annealing controls: the rotation applied and the placement of the small item. For each non-placed small item, a limited depth binary search is performed to find a scale factor that when applied to the small item, would allow it to be fitted in the large object. Three possibilities to define the sequence on which the small items are placed are studied: larger-first, random permutation and weight sorted. The proposed algorithm is suited for non-convex small items and large objects.\ndownloadDownload free PDF[View PDFchevron\\_right](https://www.academia.edu/58884840/Rotational_Placement_of_Irregular_Polygons_over_Containers_with_Fixed_Dimensions_using_Simulated_Annealing_and_No_Fit_Polygons)\n[An effective heuristic for the two-dimensional irregular bin packing problem](https://www.academia.edu/69875946/An_effective_heuristic_for_the_two_dimensional_irregular_bin_packing_problem)\n[Gabriela Ochoa](https://independent.academia.edu/GabrielaOchoa10)\nAnnals of Operations Research, 2013\nThis paper proposes an adaptation, to the two-dimensional irregular bin packing problem of the Djang and Finch heuristic (DJD), originally designed for the one-dimensional bin packing problem. In the two-dimensional case, not only is it the case that the piece&#39;s size is important but its shape also has a significant influence. Therefore, DJD as a selection heuristic has to be paired with a placement heuristic to completely construct a solution to the underlying packing problem. A successful adaptation of the DJD requires a routine to reduce computational costs, which is also proposed and successfully tested in this paper. Results, on a wide variety of instance types with convex polygons, are found to be significantly better than those produced by more conventional selection heuristics.\ndownloadDownload free PDF[View PDFchevron\\_right](https://www.academia.edu/69875946/An_effective_heuristic_for_the_two_dimensional_irregular_bin_packing_problem)\n[Irregular rotational placement of shapes over non-convex containers with fixed dimensions](https://www.academia.edu/104990568/Irregular_rotational_placement_of_shapes_over_non_convex_containers_with_fixed_dimensions)\n[Thiago de Castro Martins](https://independent.academia.edu/ThiagodeCastroMartins)\n8th IFAC International Workshop on Intelligent Manufacturing Systems, 2007, 2007\nThis work deals with the problem of minimize the waste of space that occurs on a placement of a set of bi-dimensional items inside a bi-dimensional container with fixed dimensions.
