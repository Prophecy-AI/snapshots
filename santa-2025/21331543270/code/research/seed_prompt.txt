## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.676102 from exp_000 (baseline)
- Best LB score: 70.6761 (from exp_000 baseline submission)
- Target: 68.887226 | Gap to target: 1.79 points (2.6%)

## CRITICAL SITUATION ANALYSIS

### The Core Problem
After 9 experiments, we have made ZERO progress beyond baseline:
- exp_000: Baseline (70.676102) - ONLY valid submission
- exp_001-005: Ensemble attempts - ALL FAILED Kaggle validation with overlaps
- exp_006-008: Various optimization attempts - ALL fell back to baseline

### Why Ensemble Approach Failed
ALL submissions with scores better than baseline (70.676) have overlaps. The "better" configurations in snapshots achieve lower scores by ALLOWING overlaps. When we remove overlapping configurations, we're left with baseline.

### Key Insight from Analysis
- Best "valid" score in snapshots: 70.566958 (but has 51 N values with overlaps!)
- Best ANY score: 39.508442 (massive overlaps)
- The baseline (70.676102) is the ONLY truly valid submission

## Response to Evaluator

The evaluator is CORRECT:
1. **Validation problem is fundamental** - Our local validation doesn't match Kaggle's
2. **Baseline is at local optimum** - bbox3, SA, fix_direction all found no improvement
3. **Gap is too large for micro-optimization** - 1.79 points (2.6%) requires fundamentally different approach

However, the deeper issue is: There ARE NO better valid configurations in the snapshots. We need to GENERATE new configurations that are both better AND valid.

## ⛔ BLOCKED APPROACHES (DO NOT USE)
- Running bbox3, sa_fast_v2, eazy_optimizer on baseline - ALREADY TRIED, NO IMPROVEMENT
- Ensemble from snapshots - ALL better configs have overlaps
- Small N optimization - ALREADY TRIED, baseline is optimal for valid configs
- "More iterations" on existing optimizer - FORBIDDEN

## ✅ REQUIRED: IMPLEMENT FRACTIONAL TRANSLATION FROM SCRATCH

### Experiment 009: Fractional Translation + Multi-Scale

The top kernels (jonathanchan) use micro-step optimization:
```cpp
double frac_steps[] = {0.001, 0.0005, 0.0002, 0.0001, 0.00005, 0.00002, 0.00001};
// Try 8 directions at each step size
```

**IMPLEMENT THIS IN PYTHON:**

1. Create experiments/009_fractional_translation/
2. Load baseline configuration
3. For each N from 1 to 200:
   - For each tree in the configuration:
     - For each step size in [0.001, 0.0005, 0.0002, 0.0001, 0.00005, 0.00002, 0.00001]:
       - For each direction in 8 directions (N, S, E, W, NE, NW, SE, SW):
         - Move tree by step_size in direction
         - Check if bounding box shrinks AND no overlaps
         - If yes, keep the move
4. Use Kaggle's EXACT validation (intersects && !touches)
5. Save submission and submit

**VALIDATION CODE (MUST USE):**
```python
from decimal import Decimal, getcontext
getcontext().prec = 25
scale_factor = Decimal('1e18')

def has_overlap_kaggle(trees):
    # Use Kaggle's exact method
    for i in range(len(trees)):
        for j in range(i+1, len(trees)):
            if trees[i].polygon.intersects(trees[j].polygon) and not trees[i].polygon.touches(trees[j].polygon):
                return True
    return False
```

## What NOT to Try
- Running bbox3/SA on baseline (already at local optimum)
- Ensemble from snapshots (all better configs have overlaps)
- Any approach that doesn't generate NEW configurations

## Submission Strategy
- Remaining submissions: 93
- Submit after this experiment? YES - we need LB feedback
- Even if score is same as baseline, we learn whether our approach works

## Expected Outcome
- If fractional translation finds improvements: Score should be < 70.676
- If no improvement: Baseline is truly at local optimum, need different strategy
- Either way, we learn something valuable
