# Santa 2025 - Christmas Tree Packing Challenge - Loop 6 Strategy

## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.615788 from 005_fixed_submission (NOT YET LOGGED!)
- Best LB score: 70.676102 from exp_000 (baseline) - ONLY submission that passed Kaggle!
- Target: 68.888293 | Gap to target: 1.79 points (2.6%)
- Submissions remaining: 96/100

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: 005_fixed_submission EXISTS BUT NOT LOGGED ⚠️

The executor created `/home/code/experiments/005_fixed_submission/` with:
- submission.csv (score: 70.615788)
- metrics.json (is_valid: true)
- Verified NO overlaps using relate() method

**FIRST ACTION: Log this experiment and submit it!**

## Response to Evaluator

The evaluator recommended:
1. ✅ Submit safe_ensemble - We tried exp_004, it FAILED with "Overlapping trees in group 060"
2. ✅ Implement fix_direction - Good idea, but won't close 1.79 point gap
3. ✅ Run bbox3 with multiple parameters - Already tried, NO improvement

**Key Insight**: The evaluator's recommendations are for MICRO-OPTIMIZATION. With a 1.79 point gap, we need FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT approaches.

## EXPERIMENT 005: Log and Submit Fixed Submission

### Goal
Log the existing 005_fixed_submission and submit it to verify it passes Kaggle validation.

### Steps
1. Log experiment 005_fixed_submission with:
   - name: "005_fixed_submission"
   - model_type: "optimization"
   - cv_score: 70.615788
   - submission_path: "/home/code/experiments/005_fixed_submission/submission.csv"
   - notes: "Fixed ensemble using relate() method for overlap detection. Replaced N=60 with baseline. Verified no overlaps."

2. Copy submission to /home/submission/submission.csv (already done)

3. Submit to Kaggle to verify it passes validation

### Expected Outcome
- If passes: New best LB score of ~70.615788 (0.06 points better than baseline)
- If fails: Need to investigate Kaggle's exact overlap detection method

## EXPERIMENT 006: Implement fix_direction Optimization

### Goal
Apply fix_direction (rotation optimization) to squeeze out 0.01-0.05 points.

### Implementation (from bbox3 runner kernel)
```python
from scipy.optimize import minimize_scalar
from scipy.spatial import ConvexHull
import numpy as np

def calculate_bbox_side_at_angle(angle_deg, points):
    angle_rad = np.radians(angle_deg)
    c, s = np.cos(angle_rad), np.sin(angle_rad)
    rot_matrix_T = np.array([[c, s], [-s, c]])
    rotated_points = points.dot(rot_matrix_T)
    min_xy = np.min(rotated_points, axis=0)
    max_xy = np.max(rotated_points, axis=0)
    return max(max_xy[0] - min_xy[0], max_xy[1] - min_xy[1])

def optimize_rotation(trees, angle_max=89.999, epsilon=1e-7):
    all_points = []
    for tree in trees:
        all_points.extend(list(tree.polygon.exterior.coords))
    points_np = np.array(all_points)
    hull_points = points_np[ConvexHull(points_np).vertices]
    
    initial_side = calculate_bbox_side_at_angle(0, hull_points)
    
    res = minimize_scalar(
        lambda a: calculate_bbox_side_at_angle(a, hull_points),
        bounds=(0.001, angle_max),
        method="bounded",
    )
    
    if initial_side - res.fun > epsilon:
        return res.x, res.fun
    return 0.0, initial_side

# Apply to each N value
for n in range(1, 201):
    trees = load_trees_for_n(submission_df, n)
    best_angle, best_side = optimize_rotation(trees)
    if best_angle > 0:
        # Apply rotation to all trees and update submission
        rotated_trees = apply_rotation(trees, best_angle)
        # Update submission_df with rotated trees
```

### Expected Outcome
- Score improvement of 0.01-0.05 points
- Valid submission that passes Kaggle

## STRATEGIC ANALYSIS: THE GAP PROBLEM

### Current Situation
- Gap to target: 1.79 points (2.6%)
- C++ optimizers (bbox3, SA) found NO improvement
- Both baseline and ensemble are at local optima

### Why Micro-Optimization Won't Work
- fix_direction: ~0.01-0.05 points
- Fractional translation: ~0.001-0.01 points
- Total possible: ~0.06 points
- Gap remaining: 1.73 points

### What We Need: Fundamentally Different Approaches

1. **Tessellation Patterns for Large N**
   - Chris Deotte's discussion suggests tessellations for N>58
   - Crystalline/lattice packing instead of chaotic SA

2. **Asymmetric Solutions**
   - Discussion "Why the winning solutions will be Asymmetric" (39 votes)
   - Symmetric solutions may not be optimal for all N

3. **Different Packing Strategies for Small N**
   - N=1-10 contribute 4.33 points (6.1% of total)
   - Small N has lowest packing efficiency
   - Potential for significant improvement

4. **Novel Algorithms**
   - No-Fit Polygon (NFP) precomputation
   - Branch-and-bound for small N
   - Genetic algorithms with custom operators

## What NOT to Try
- ❌ Running bbox3/SA with "more iterations" - already at local optima
- ❌ Ensemble submissions without relate() validation - will fail Kaggle
- ❌ Micro-optimization when gap is 1.79 points

## SUBMISSION STRATEGY
- Remaining submissions: 96/100 - ABUNDANT!
- Submit after EVERY valid experiment
- LB feedback is FREE information - USE IT!

## Priority Order
1. **IMMEDIATE**: Log 005_fixed_submission and submit to Kaggle
2. **HIGH**: Implement fix_direction optimization
3. **MEDIUM**: Research tessellation patterns for large N
4. **MEDIUM**: Research asymmetric solutions
5. **LOW**: Implement novel algorithms (NFP, branch-and-bound)
