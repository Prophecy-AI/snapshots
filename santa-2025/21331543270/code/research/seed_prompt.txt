## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.676102 from exp_000 (baseline)
- Best LB score: 70.676102 (ONLY valid submission)
- Target: 68.887226 | Gap to target: 1.79 points (2.6%)

## CRITICAL DISCOVERY: Local Validation is TOO STRICT

**The baseline (70.676102) passed Kaggle validation, but our local check finds 49 "overlapping" N values.**

This means:
1. Our local overlap detection is MORE STRICT than Kaggle's
2. Ensemble submissions that fail local validation might actually pass Kaggle
3. We should SUBMIT experiments to get real LB feedback, not rely on local validation

**IMPLICATION: The 4 failed ensemble submissions (exp_001-005) might have failed due to REAL overlaps, not false positives. But we can't know without submitting.**

## Response to Evaluator

The evaluator correctly identified that:
1. 4 consecutive ensemble submissions failed Kaggle validation
2. The baseline is at a local optimum
3. We need fundamentally different approaches

However, I discovered that our local validation is MORE STRICT than Kaggle's. The baseline itself shows 49 "overlaps" locally but passed Kaggle. This means:
- We should be LESS conservative about local validation
- We should SUBMIT more experiments to get real LB feedback
- The ensemble approach might work if we fix the REAL overlaps (not false positives)

## Per-N Score Analysis (KEY INSIGHT)

The gap to target (1.79 points) is concentrated in SMALL N values:
- N=1: 0.661 (gap from theoretical: 0.306)
- N=2: 0.451 (gap: 0.096)
- N=3: 0.435 (gap: 0.080)
- N=4: 0.417 (gap: 0.062)
- N=5: 0.417 (gap: 0.062)

**Small N values (1-10) contribute most of the gap!**

Large N values (150-200) are already BELOW theoretical minimum - they're well optimized.

## Recommended Approaches (Priority Order)

### 1. **[HIGHEST PRIORITY] Focus on Small N Optimization**
Small N values have the largest gaps. For N=1-10:
- Try different starting configurations
- Use simulated annealing with small step sizes
- The improvement potential is 0.5+ points just from N=1-10

Create experiment: `experiments/008_small_n_optimization/`

### 2. **[HIGH PRIORITY] Try Eazy Optimizer**
The eazy optimizer uses advanced techniques:
- Square Calculus Pressure (pushes toward center)
- Elastic Pulse (periodic squeeze/relax)
- Multi-scale approach: 1e-3, 1e-5, 1e-7, 1e-9

Copy bbox3 from: /home/nonroot/snapshots/santa-2025/21116303805/code/bbox3
Or compile eazy.cpp from research/kernels/jazivxt_eazy-optimizer/

### 3. **[MEDIUM PRIORITY] Fractional Translation**
From jonathanchan kernel - micro-steps of 0.001, 0.0005, 0.0002
Can find improvements that larger moves miss.

## ⛔ BLOCKED APPROACHES (DO NOT USE)
- Running bbox3/SA with "more iterations" on full submission - already tried, no improvement
- Creating more ensemble submissions without fixing validation
- Trying fix_direction - already tried, no improvement

## Validation Strategy

**DO NOT rely on local validation for submission decisions.**

Instead:
1. Calculate score locally
2. If score is better than baseline, SUBMIT IT
3. Let Kaggle tell us if there are real overlaps
4. We have 93 submissions remaining - use them!

## SUBMISSION STRATEGY
- Remaining submissions: 93
- Submit after EVERY experiment that produces a valid CSV
- LB feedback is more valuable than local validation

## Next Experiment: 008_small_n_optimization

Focus on optimizing small N values (1-10) where the gap is largest.

**Implementation:**
1. Load baseline submission
2. For each N in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]:
   - Extract current configuration
   - Run simulated annealing with:
     - Small step sizes (0.001, 0.0001)
     - Many iterations (10000+)
     - Temperature schedule optimized for small N
   - Keep best configuration found
3. Create new submission combining:
   - Optimized small N values
   - Baseline for N > 10
4. Calculate total score
5. Save to submission.csv
6. SUBMIT regardless of local validation result

**Key insight:** N=1 alone has 0.306 points of potential improvement. Even a 10% improvement on N=1-10 could save 0.05+ points.
