      "title": "ANSWER",
      "text": "The fix_direction rotation optimization technique for 2D polygon packing is a heuristic method aimed at minimizing the size of the bounding box that contains the packed polygons. This technique involves fixing the orientation or direction of the polygons before packing, rather than allowing rotations during the packing process. By doing so, it simplifies the problem and reduces the search space, enabling more efficient packing arrangements. Fixing the direction helps in identifying configurations that lead to tighter packing and smaller bounding boxes, as it eliminates the variability introduced by arbitrary rotations ([Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6864382/packing-arbitrary-polygons-within-an-arbitrary-boundary)).\n\nThis approach is particularly useful when rotations are restricted or when the goal is to achieve a packing that is close to optimal in terms of bounding box size. For example, in packing rectangles into convex polygons without rotations, fixing the orientation ensures that the rectangles are aligned with the axes, which simplifies the packing problem and can lead to more compact arrangements ([Stack Exchange](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/5540/packing-rectangles-into-convex-polygons-but-without-rotations)). Overall, fix_direction rotation optimization minimizes the bounding box size by reducing the complexity of the packing configuration search, thereby enabling more efficient and tighter packing solutions.",

Anything that works with distinct shapes should trivially work with identical shapes too. If you have an algorithm that works well for a rectangular boundary, you can try to adapt it for an arbitrary boundary. Modify it so that you can at a flip opre-fill your boundary with some shapes that cannot be moved or deleted (e.g. there's only one way to place them). Solve for a rectangular boundary, pre-filled with some shapes that just leave your original boundary unfilled. Not all algorithms can be adapted like this.\n\n\u2013\u00a0[n. m. could be an AI](https://stackoverflow.com/users/775806/n-m-could-be-an-ai)\n\nCommentedJul 28, 2011 at 20:22\n\n- The case with only one kind of filling polygon is definitely a special case of the general situation with different filling polys.

To put this in perspective, the (much) simpler case where you're packing the interior of your bounded polygon with non-overlapping disks is already hard, and disks are the simplest possible \"packing shape\" (with any other shape you have to consider orientation as well as size and center location).\n\nIn fact, I think it's an open problem in [computational geometry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_geometry) to determine for an arbitrary integer N and arbitrary bounded polygonal region (in the Euclidean plane), what is the \"optimal\" (in the sense of covering the greatest percentage of the polygon interior) packing of N inscribed non-overlapping disks, where you are free to choose the radius and center location of each disk. I'm sure the \"best\" answer _is_ known for certain special polygonal shapes (like rectangles, circles, and triangles), but for arbitrary shapes your best \"heuristic\" is probably:\n\n1. Start your shape counter at N.\n2. Add the largest \"packing shape\" you can fit completely inside the polygonal boundary without overlapping any other packing shapes.\n3. Decrement your shape counter.\n4. If your shape counter is > 0, go to step 2.\n\nI say \"probably\" because \"largest first\" isn't always the best way to pack things into a confined space. You can dig into that particular flavor of craziness by reading about the [bin packing problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bin_packing_problem) and [knapsack problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem).\n\n**EDIT:** Step 2 by itself is hard. A reasonable strategy would be to pick an arbitrary point on the interior of the polygon as the center and \"inflate\" the disk until it touches either the boundary or another disk (or both), and then \"slide\" the disk while continuing to inflate it so that it remains inside the boundary without overlapping any other disks until it is \"trapped\" - with at least 2 points of contact with the boundary and/or other disks. But it isn't easy to formalize this \"sliding process\". And even if you get the sliding process right, this strategy doesn't guarantee that you'll find the biggest \"inscribable disk\" - your \"locally maximal\" disk could be trapped in a \"lobe\" of the interior which is connected by a narrow \"neck\" of free space to a larger \"lobe\" where a larger disk would fit.\n\n[Share](https://stackoverflow.com/a/7342898)\n\n[Improve this answer](https://stackoverflow.com/posts/7342898/edit)\n\nFollow\n\n[edited Feb 27, 2013 at 20:29](https://stackoverflow.com/posts/7342898/revisions)\n\nanswered Sep 8, 2011 at 3:46\n\n[![Peter's user avatar](https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f031e9e9b7476fc5d3674fe4a9c59ef2?s=64&d=identicon&r=PG)](https://stackoverflow.com/users/227491/peter)\n\n[Peter](https://stackoverflow.com/users/227491/peter) Peter\n\n2,53611 gold badge2323 silver badges3232 bronze badges\n\n[Add a comment](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6864382/packing-arbitrary-polygons-within-an-arbitrary-boundary)\u00a0\\|\n\n3\n\nThanks for the replies, my requirements were such that I was able to further simplify the problem by not having to deal with orientation and I then even further simplified by only really wor...",

In my problem you are not allowed to rotate the rectangles and can assume that they are oriented parallel with the axes. You are just given the dimensions of a rectangle and the vertices of the polygon and asked how many identical copies of the rectangle can be packed into the polygon. If you are allowed to rotate the rectangles this problem is known to be NP-hard I believe. However, what is known if you cannot? How about if the convex polygon is simply a triangle? Are there known approximation algorithms if the problem is indeed NP-hard?\n\nSummary so far (21 March '11). Peter Shor observes that we can regard this problem as one of packing unit squares in a convex polygon and that that problem is in NP if you impose a polynomial bound on the number of squares/rectangles to be packed. Sariel Har-Peled points out there is a PTAS for the same polynomially bounded case. However, in general the number of squares packed can be exponential in the size of the input which only consists of a possibly short list of pairs of integers. The following questions appear to be open.\n\nIs the full unbounded version in NP?\nIs there a PTAS for the unbounded version?\nIs the polynomially bounded case in P or NPC? And my personal favourite, is the problem any easier if you just restrict yourself to packing unit squares into a triangle?\n\n- [reference-request](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/reference-request)\n- [np-hardness](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/np-hardness)\n- [cg.comp-geom](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/cg.comp-geom)\n- [optimization](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/optimization)\n- [packing](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/packing)\n\n[Share](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/q/5540)\n\nCite\n\n[Improve this question](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/posts/5540/edit)\n\nFollow\n\n[edited Mar 21, 2011 at 19:36](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/posts/5540/revisions)\n\nSimd\n\nasked Mar 17, 2011 at 18:02\n\n[![Simd's user avatar](https://i.sstatic.net/Rd3qU.png?s=64)](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/users/1864/simd)\n\n[Simd](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/users/1864/simd) Simd\n\n3,9022020 silver badges4949 bronze badges\n\n$\\\\endgroup$\n\n5\n\n- $\\\\begingroup$Packing with 1x3 rectangles is NP-complete (with rotation) and I guess it becomes easy if we disallow rotations.

This in turn is related to the same problem where one uses the regular Euclidean distance.

Even though it might seem like a simple task at first, it is actually quite an involved undertaking. It also usually entails having a broader look at how collision detection algorithms work. In the following sections we'll work our way up to an algorithm with which you can essentially pack any sort of geometric shapes, and combinations thereof.\n![](https://www.gorillasun.de/content/images/2023/03/example1.jpg)\n![](https://www.gorillasun.de/content/images/2023/03/example2.jpg)\nBefore we begin, I want to point out that I had a first encounter with this algo back in February of 2022. I never completed that particular idea, but it led to an interesting packing scheme. You can see some of the artworks my code produced above.\n![](https://www.gorillasun.de/content/images/2023/03/maplands.jpg)\nI also recently learned that a few others have made their own version of this idea. In June I faced a packing problem where I had to draw all sorts of geometric shapes to the canvas. I was left scratching my head at first and it took me quite a while to find a solution. While researching different methods I came across[Amy Goodchild\u2019s](https://twitter.com/amygoodchild?ref=gorillasun.de)[writeup](https://www.amygoodchild.com/blog/maplands?ref=gorillasun.de)on a wonderful sketch of hers called \"Maplands\" where she used a similar strategy to what I ultimately did to implement my idea.\n![](https://www.gorillasun.de/content/images/2023/03/fruitpacking.jpg)\nLater on I also re-discovered[Tarwin Stroh-Spijer's](https://twitter.com/tarwin?ref=gorillasun.de)[fruit salad packing sketch](https://openprocessing.org/sketch/1533577?ref=gorillasun.de), which initially evolved from[Jeff's (aka ippsketch)](https://twitter.com/ippsketch?ref=gorillasun.de)[banana packing sketch](https://ippsketch.com/posts/non-circular-packing/?ref=gorillasun.de).

Despite its deceptive simplicity, bin packing is actually an[NP-Hard problem](https://stackoverflow.com/a/19510170?ref=gorillasun.de), with it's associated decision problem (checking if the items to be packed fit in a certain area), is[NP-Complete](https://gorillasun.de/blog/rectangle-packing-an-incredibly-difficult-problem?ref=gorillasun.de). Understanding this is not necessary for what follows however. I just find it incredibly interesting though, I keep finding myself coming back to this problem thinking: \"Surely this can't be this difficult!\"\nPacking algorithms are useful for a range of real life scenarios, such as packing boxes in a warehouse, or positioning shapes on a sheet of laser cutting material such that the amount of wasted material is minimised. Packing is a heavily researched area of mathematics and fairly advanced algorithms have been developed to solve different variations of it. In generative art the primary goal of packing algorithms is often the creation of visually pleasing and interesting packing patterns. We also often don't start with shapes that have a pre-determined size (usually real life objects have a pre-determined size duh), but make them up on the go.\nHence gen-art packing algorithms vary a little in that regard. I'd like to show off a few artworks that have in one another or another been made with packing algorithms. Here's two stunning artworks from[Caleb Ogg](https://twitter.com/iso_hedron?ref=gorillasun.de):\n![](https://www.gorillasun.de/content/images/2023/03/Colorshift2.jpg)\n![](https://www.gorillasun.de/content/images/2023/03/Lens3.jpg)\nCaleb's pieces[Lens 3](https://superrare.com/0x6125e13fc97f6fc97ea14cf925211e4dc0e99f0f/lens-3-18?ref=gorillasun.de)and[Colorshift 2](https://superrare.com/0x6125e13fc97f6fc97ea14cf925211e4dc0e99f0f/colorshift-2-12?ref=gorillasun.de), part of his ongoing 'Coalesce' series, are some of the most interesting circle packing sketches I've seen in a while. Note that the images shown here (2000x2000px) don't do the originals justice which are absolutely gigantic (16000x16000px). Built on a system of circles and rings, Caleb makes use of an underlying noise field for a nifty creative effect. I especially like how Lens conveys the illusion of multiple overlapping lenses that appear to contort the coloration of the underlying circles, which is done by scaling and multiplying the underlying noise field.

      "text": "A New Algorithm for Optimal Bin Packing\nRichard E. Korf\nComputer Science Department\nUniversity of California, Los Angeles\nLos Angeles, CA 90095\nkorf@cs.ucla.edu\nAbstract\nWe consider the NP-complete problem of bin packing. Given\na set of numbers, and a set of bins of fixed capacity, find the\nminimum number of bins needed to contain all the numbers,\nsuch that the sum of the numbers assigned to each bin does\nnot exceed the bin capacity. We present a new algorithm for\noptimal bin packing. Rather than considering the different\nbins that each number can be placed into, we consider the dif\u0002ferent ways in which each bin can be packed. Our algorithm\nappears to be asymptotically faster than the best existing op\u0002timal algorithm, and runs more that a thousand times faster\non problems with 60 numbers.\nIntroduction and Overview\nGiven a set of numbers, and a fixed bin capacity, the bin\u0002packing problem is to assign each number to a bin so that the\nsum of all numbers assigned to each bin does not exceed the\nbin capacity. An optimal solution to a bin-packing problem\nuses the fewest number of bins possible. For example, given\nthe set of elements 6, 12, 15, 40, 43, 82, and a bin capacity\nof 100, we can assign 6, 12, and 82 to one bin, and 15, 40,\nand 43 to another, for a total of two bins. This is an optimal\nsolution to this problem instance, since the sum of all the\nelements (198) is greater than 100, and hence at least two\nbins are required.\nOptimal bin packing one of the classic NP-complete prob\u0002lems (Garey & Johnson 1979). The vast majority of the liter\u0002ature on this problem concerns polynomial-time approxima\u0002tion algorithms, such as first-fit and best-fit decreasing, and\nthe quality of the solutions they compute, rather than opti\u0002mal solutions. We discuss these approximation algorithms\nin the next section.\nThe best existing algorithm for optimal bin packing is due\nto Martello and Toth (Martello & Toth 1990a; 1990b). We\npresent a new algorithm for optimal bin packing, which we\ncall bin completion, that explores a different problem space,\nand appears to be asymptotically faster than the Martello and\nToth algorithm. On problems of size 60, bin completion runs\nmore than a thousand times faster than Martello and Toth\u2019s\nalgorithm. We are able to optimally solve problems with 90\nelements in an average of 2.5 seconds per problem.\nCopyright \u0001c 2002, American Association for Artificial Intelli\u0002gence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved.\nApproximation Algorithms\nA simple approximation algorithm is called first-fit decreas\u0002ing (FFD). The elements are sorted in decreasing order of\nsize, and the bins are kept in a fixed order. Each element\nis placed into the first bin that it fits into, without exceeding\nthe bin capacity. For example, given the elements 82, 43, 40,\n15, 12, 6, and a bin capacity of 100, first-fit decreasing will\nplace 82 in the first bin, 43 in a second bin, 40 in the second\nbin, 15 in the first bin, 12 in the second bin, and 6 in a third\nbin, for a total of three bins, which is one more than optimal.\nA slightly better approximation algorithm is known as\nbest-fit decreasing (BFD). It also sorts the elements in de\u0002creasing order of size, but puts each element into the fullest\nbin in which is fits. It can be implemented by keeping the\nbins sorted in increasing order of their remaining capacity,\nand placing each element into the first bin in which it fits.\nFor example, given the set of elements 82, 43, 40, 15, 12, 6,\nbest-fit decreasing will place 82 in bin a, 43 in bin b, 40 in\nbin b, 15 in bin b, because it is fuller than bin a, 12 in bin a,\nand 6 in bin a, for a total of two bins, which is optimal.\nBoth FFD and BFD can be implemented in O(n log n)\ntime, but are not guaranteed to return optimal solutions.\nHowever, either algorithm is guaranteed to return a solution\nthat uses no more than 11/9 of the optimal number of bins\n(Johnson 1973). On average, BFD performs slightly better\nthan FFD. For example, on problems of 90 elements, where\nthe elements are uniformly distributed from zero to one mil\u0002lion, and the bin capacity is one million, BFD uses an av\u0002erage of 47.732 bins, while FFD uses an average of 47.733\nbins. On these same problem instances, the optimal solution\naverages 47.680 bins. The FFD solution is optimal 94.694%\nof the time, and the BFD solution is optimal 94.832% of the\ntime on these problem instances.\nOptimal Solutions\nGiven the high quality solutions returned by these approxi\u0002mation algorithms, why bother trying to find optimal solu\u0002tions? There are at least four reasons. In some applications,\nit may be important to have optimal solutions. In particular,\nwith small numbers of bins, even a single extra bin is rel\u0002atively expensive. In addition, being able to determine the\noptimal solutions to problem instances allows us to more ac\u0002curately gauge the quality of approximate solutions. For ex\u0002ample, the above comparisons of FFD and BFD solutions to\nAAAI-02 731\nFrom: AAAI-02 Proceedings. Copyright \u00a9 2002, AAAI (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved. \noptimal solutions were only possible because we could com\u0002pute the optimal solutions. Another reason is that an any\u0002time algorithm for finding optimal solutions, such as those\npresented in this paper, can make use of any additional time\navailable to find better solutions than those returned by BFD\nor FFD, which run very fast in practice. Finally, optimal bin\npacking is an interesting computational challenge, and may\nlead to insights applicable to other problems.\nEstimated Wasted Space or L2 Lower Bound\nA lower bound function for bin packing takes a problem in\u0002stance, and efficiently computes a lower bound on the mini\u0002mum number of bins needed. If we find a solution that uses\nthe same number of bins as a lower bound, then we know\nthat solution is optimal, and we can terminate the search.\nAn obvious lower bound is to sum all the elements, divide\nby the bin capacity, and round up to the next larger integer.\nA better bound starts with the sum of the elements, and adds\nan estimate of the total bin capacity that must be wasted in\nany solution, before dividing by the bin capacity. This is\nthe L2 bound of Martello and Toth (Martello & Toth 1990a;\n1990b), but we give a simpler and more intuitive algorithm\nfor computing it below.\nFor example, consider the set of elements 99, 97, 94, 93,\n8, 5, 4, 2, with a bin capacity of 100. There is no element\nsmall enough to go in the same bin as the 99, so that bin\nwill have one unit of wasted space in any solution. The only\nelement small enough to go in the same bin as the 97 is the\n2, so the 2 can be placed with the 97 without sacrificing\noptimality, leaving a second unit of wasted space.\nThere are two remaining elements that could be placed\nwith the 94, the 5 or the 4. In reality, only one of these el\u0002ements could be placed with the 94, but to make our lower\u0002bound calculation efficient and avoid any branching, we as\u0002sume that we can place as much of their sum (9) as will fit in\nthe bin with the 94, or 6 units. Thus, we assume there is no\nwasted space in this bin, and 3 units are carried over to the\nnext bin, which contains the 93. The sum of all elements less\nthan or equal to the residual capacity of this bin (7) is just\nthe 3 units carried over from the previous bin. Therefore,\nat least 7 \u2212 3=4 additional units will be wasted between\nthis bin and the previous one. Finally, there are no remain\u0002ing elements to be placed with the 8, so 92 units must be\nwasted in this bin. Thus, the total wasted space will be at\nleast 1 + 1 + 4 + 92 = 98 units, which is added to the sum\nof all the elements before dividing by the bin capacity.\nThis estimated wasted-space calculation proceeds as fol\u0002lows. We consider the elements in decreasing order of size.\nGiven an element x, the residual capacity r of the bin con\u0002taining x is r = c \u2212 x, where c is the bin capacity. We\nthen consider the sum s of all elements less than or equal to\nr, which have not already been assigned to a previous bin.\nThere are thr...",

An efficient 2D irregular packing algorithm can effectively improve material utilization and reduce processing costs. The reduction in material consumption will also have a beneficial impact on the environment ( [Ke et al., 2020](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B76)). Therefore, research of the packing problem is of great significance for technology and social interest.\n\nThe 2D packing problem is a type of combinatorial optimization problems to locate parts with different shapes compactly in one or more master sheet material to minimize the occupied space or maximize the utilization of the material. The 2D packing problem is currently recognized as a NP problem, which is mainly solved by heuristic algorithms. In recent years, many scholars have conducted research on 2D irregular packing problems with a verity of solutions.\n\nThere exists a number of review articles on packing and cutting problems. We have summarized the main review literature in the field of 2D packing and cutting as shown in [Table 1](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#T1). Brown ( [Brown, 1971](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B17)) introduced an optimum packing and depletion problem with optimization of space and resource usage. Harvey ( [Salkin and De Kluyver, 1975](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B116)) surveyed the application of mathematical optimization models such as linear programming to the knapsack problem. Bruce ( [Golden, 1976](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B50)) surveyed various approaches to the cutting stock problem. Hinxman ( [Hinxman, 1980](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B65)) surveyed the trim-loss and assortment problems, this research paid more attention to cutting and packaging problems in practical applications, and did not mention much about theoretical methods. Garey and Coffman ( [Garey and Johnson, 1981](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B47); [Coffman et al., 1984](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B27)) surveyed the approximation algorithms for bin packing problems. Israni ( [Israni and Sanders, 1982](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B72)) reviewed the 2D cutting stock problem including almost all 2D packaging problems. The author also proposed a rectangular layout method. Sarin ( [Sarin, 1983](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B118)) reviewed methodologies and literature to solve 2D stock cutting problems and introduced an interactive optimization procedure for a general 2D stock cutting problem. Dyckhoff ( [Dyckhoff et al., 1985](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B38)) described a trim loss and related problems and categorized them briefly. Dudzi\u0144ski ( [Dudzi\u0144ski and Walukiewicz, 1987](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B36)) summarized the exact methods for knapsack problems, such as linear programming. Matthias ( [Rode and Rosenberg, 1987](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B114)) analyzed the algorithm for the trim-loss problems. Haessler ( [Haessler and Sweeney, 1991](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B59)) reviewed the solution process of cutting stock problems, including placement algorithm and sequence optimization algorithm. Dowsland ( [Dowsland and Dowsland, 1992](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B34)) reviewed the application of operations research methods to the packing problem and summarized some exact heuristics. Sweeney ( [Sweeney and Paternoster, 1992](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B128)) categorized cutting and packing problems and made application-oriented research records. Cheng ( [Cheng et al., 1994](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B22)) discussed 2D cutting stock problems and their application cases including the pallet loading problem and VLSI placement problem. With the gradual deepening of research on 2D layout problems, typology becomes a common research topic. 2D regular and irregular layout problems are clearly distinguished in practical applications and theoretical methods. Dowsland ( [Dowsland and Dowsland, 1995](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B29)) gave a special review of the 2D irregular nesting problem for the first time. Mavridou ( [Mavridou and Pardalos, 1997](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B98)) summarized applications of the genetic algorithm and simulated annealing algorithm in the optimization of facility layout problems. Dyckhoff ( [Dyckhoff, 1990](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B37)) made a typology of the cutting and packing problems in detail, and W\u00e4scher ( [W\u00e4scher et al., 2007](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B135)) improved the typology later. Hopper ( [Hopper and Turton, 1999](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B67); [Hopper and Turton, 2001a](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B68); [Hopper and Turton, 2001b](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B69)) investigated the application of meta-heuristic and heuristic algorithms in 2D and 3D packing problems. Lodi ( [Lodi et al., 2002a](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B90); [Lodi et al., 2002b](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B91)) reviewed algorithms proposed in the 1990s of 2D packing problems.

It be\u0002longs to the family of cutting and packing (C & P)\nproblems, more precisely Two-Dimensional Sin\u0002gle Bin Size Bin-Packing Problems (2SBSBPP),\nfollowing the typology of W\u00a8ascher et al. [10].\nA 2BP instance D is a pair (I, B). It is com\u0002posed of the set I = {1, . . . , n} of items i to pack,\nand a bin B = (W, H) of width W and height H\n(W, H \u2208 N). For the oriented case (2BP|O), an\nitem i is of width wi and height hi (wi, hi \u2208 N).\nWe consider the non-oriented version of the prob\u0002lem (2BP|R), i.e. where the items can be ro\u0002tated. So we consider the two possible orienta\u0002tions: w\n1\ni = h\n2\ni\nand w\n2\ni = h\n1\ni\n. Before rotation,\nan item is of size (w\n1\ni\n, h1\ni\n), otherwise it is of size\n(w\n2\ni\n, h2\ni\n). An orientation of the set of items is an\napplication r from I to {1, 2} that associates an\norientation r(i) to each item i in I.\nMany methods [2, 4, 5, 7, 9] have been proposed\n\u2217Corresponding author: F. Clautiaux, Universit\u00b4e de Tech\u0002nologie de Compi`egne, BP 20529, 60205 Compi`egne,\nFrance. Email: francoisclautiaux@gmail.com\nfor computing lower bounds for 2BP|O. Most\nof them can be computed by means of so-called\ndual-feasible functions. These functions cannot\nbe directly applied if the orientation of the items\nis not known. Fewer results exist for 2BP|R [3,\n6]. Two schemes were proposed for computing\nsuch bounds: cutting the items into squares [3,6],\nor explicitly using dual-feasible functions [3]. It\nwould appear that the difference between upper\nand lower bounds is larger than for the oriented\ncase.\nIn this paper we propose a new general scheme\nfor computing lower bounds for 2BP|R when the\nbin is a square. It is based on the construction\nof a 2BP|O instance composed of 2n items: each\nitem appears once for each orientation. We show\nthat if the original instance needs z bins, the 2n\u0002items instance needs at most 2z bins. When this\ninstance is computed, bounds designed for the ori\u0002ented case can be applied. We show that when\nthe bin is a square, the bounds of Carlier et al. [5]\nused in this general framework dominate those of\nDell\u2019 Amico et al. [6], as well as those of Boschetti\nand Mingozzi [3]. When the bin is not a square,\nthe above method can be used, if a suitable pre\u0002processing is performed.\nWe tested our method against well-known\nbenchmarks proposed by [1, 9]. Computational\nresults show that the dominance is not only the\u0002oretical, as the bounds are improved for several\ninstances.\nIn Section 2 we describe several results from the\nliterature for the oriented case, which are used in\n1\n2 F. Clautiaux, A. Jouglet, and J. El Hayek\nour new bounds. We also recall previous results\nfor the non-oriented case. Section 3 deals with\nthe new lower bounds. We present several dom\u0002inance results in Section 4. Section 5 is devoted\nto computational experiments.\n2. Literature Review\nIn this section, we recall the lower bounds that\nare useful in this paper. First we describe the\nbounds of [5] for the oriented case. These bounds\nare used in our new lower bounds described in\nSection 3. Next we describe the bounds of [2]\nfor the oriented case. Finally we describe the\nframeworks used to compute bounds for the non\u0002oriented case [3,6]. In Section 4, these frameworks\nare compared to our new method.\n2.1. Lower bounds for 2BP|O\n2.1.1. The bound LCCM of [5]\nA classical lower bound for 2BP is the contin\u0002uous bound L0. L0 = d\nP\ni\u2208I wihi\nWH e. One way of\nimproving this method is to apply Dual-Feasible\nFunctions (DFF) [8] on both dimensions of the in\u0002stance [7]. The bounds of [5] use the framework\nof [7], using a discretization of DFF.\nDefinition 2.1. A Discrete DFF f is a discrete\napplication from [0, X] to [0, X0] (X and X0in\u0002tegers), such that x1 + x2 + . . . + xk \u2264 X \u21d2\nf(x1) + f(x2) + . . . + f(xk) \u2264 f(X) = X0.\nWe only consider DFF that are increasing and\nsuperadditive, i.e. for a given DFF f, x + y \u2264 z\nimplies f(x) + f(y) \u2264 f(z).\nIn [5] the authors also introduced the concept of\nData-Dependent DFF (DDFF). These functions\nbehave like DFF for the specific instance consid\u0002ered. The authors used a classical family of DFF\n(f\nk\n0\n), an improvement on a DFF used by [3] (f\nk\n2\n),\nand a new family of DDFF (f\nk\n1\n). We now give the\ndefinitions of f\nk\n0\n, f\nk\n1\n, and f\nk\n2\n, which are required\nbelow. In what follows, C is an integer value, and\nk = 1, . . . , C/2.\n\u2022 f\nk\n0\n(x) = 0 if x < k, f\nk\n0\n(x) = x if k \u2264 x \u2264\nC \u2212 k, and f\nk\n0\n(x) = C if C \u2212 k < x \u2264 C.\n\u2022 The DDFF f\nk\n1\nis defined for C and a list of\ninteger values c1, c2, . . . , cn. We introduce\nthe set J = {i \u2208 I :\nC\n2 \u2265 ci \u2265 k} and for a\ngiven integer Y , MC (Y, J) is the maximum\nnumber of items ci such that i \u2208 J, which\ncan be packed together in a bin of size Y .\nf\nk\n1\n(x) = 0 if x < k, f\nk\n1\n(x) = 1 if k \u2264 x \u2264\nC\n2\n,\nand f\nk\n1\n(x) = MC (C \u2212 x, J) if C\n2 < x.\n\u2022 f\nk\n2\n(x) = 2b\nx\nk\nc if x < C\n2\n, f\nk\n2\n(x) = b\nC\nk\nc if x =\nC\n2\n, and f\nk\n2\n(x) = 2b\nC\nk\nc \u2212 2b\nC\u2212x\nk\nc if x > C\n2\n.\nL\nDDF F\nCCM = max\n1\u2264k\u2264 W\n2\n,1\u2264l\u2264 H\n2\n,\nu\u2208{0,1,2},v\u2208{0,1,2}\n(&X\ni\u2208I\nf\nk\nu\n(wi)f\nl\nv\n(hi)\nf\nk\nu\n(W)f\nl\nv\n(H)\n')\nIt is strengthened by using the bounds of [5]\nwith the framework of L\nF,2\nBM [2] described below.\nThe obtained bound is termed L\nF\nCCM [5].\n2.1.2. The bound L\nF\nBM of [2]\nThe bound L\nF\nBM of [2] is composed of four\nbounds L\nF,2a\nBM , L\nF,2b\nBM , L\nF,3\nBM, and L\nF,4\nBM. The first,\nL\nF,2a\nBM , consists in creating a 1BP instance by mul\u0002tiplying the width and the height of each item.\nThe second, L\nF,2b\nBM , consists in considering large,\ntall and wide items separately (see [2] or [5] for\nmore details). The bound L\nF,3\nBM can be computed\nby means of two functions f\nk\n1\n(see [5]). Similarly,\nthe bound L\nF,4\nBM is the continuous bound of the\ninstance obtained by applying a weaker version of\nf\nk\n2\nto each dimension of the instance. The bound\nL\nF\nCCM dominates L\nF\nBM [5].\n2.1.3. The bounds of [4]\nCaprara et al. [4] propose an exact method to\nfind the best pair of DFF to be applied to a given\ninstance of 2BP|O. This problem is a relaxation\nof the two-dimensional bin-packing problem. The\nresults obtained are good, which means that for\nmany instances in the literature, the relaxation\nyields the same result as the original problem,\ni.e. there is a pair of DFF giving a bound equal\nto the optimal result. No clue is given for a gen\u0002eralization of this method for 2BP|R.\n2.2. Lower bounds for 2BP|R\nWe now describe lower bounds from the liter\u0002ature for 2BP|R. Two main schemes are used.\nA new lower bounds for 2BP|R 3\nThe first consists in cutting the items into squares\n[3, 6]. The second explicitly takes into account\nboth dimensions of the items and the possibility\nof rotating them by 90 degrees [3].\n2.2.1. The bound LBR\nDA of [6]\nThe first step of the bound LBR\nDA consists in\nreplacing each item i \u2208 I by several squares.\nThese square items are obtained by applying a\npseudo-polynomial algorithm called CUTSQ [6].\nInitially each rectangle is considered in the orien\u0002tation r where w\nr(i)\ni \u2265 h\nr(i)\ni\n. At each iteration,\nCUTSQ cuts from each current rectangle (wj , hj )\nthe maximum number of (hj , hj ) squares, and\nrotates the residual rectangles by 90 degrees to\nconserve horizontal orientation. A lower bound\nfor packing squares is...",

We first focus on the perfect packing problem (PP), which is a special case of 2SP, wherein all given rectangles are required to be packed without wasted space, and design branch-and-bound algorithms introducing several branching rules and bounding operations. A combination of these rules yields an algorithm that is especially efficient for feasible instances of PP. We then propose several methods of applying the PP algorithms to 2SP. Our algorithms succeed in efficiently solving benchmark instances of PP with up to 500 rectangles and those of 2SP with up to 200 rectangles. They are often faster than existing exact algorithms specially tailored for problems without rotations.\n\n## Suggested Citation\n\nKenmochi, Mitsutoshi & Imamichi, Takashi & Nonobe, Koji & Yagiura, Mutsunori & Nagamochi, Hiroshi, 2009.\n\" **[Exact algorithms for the two-dimensional strip packing problem with and without rotations](https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/ejores/v198y2009i1p73-83.html)**,\"\n[European Journal of Operational Research](https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/ejores.html), Elsevier, vol. 198(1), pages 73-83, October.\nHandle: _RePEc:eee:ejores:v:198:y:2009:i:1:p:73-83_\n\nas\n\nHTMLHTML with abstractplain textplain text with abstractBibTeXRIS (EndNote, RefMan, ProCite)ReDIFJSON\n\n## Download full text from publisher\n\n**File URL:** http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377-2217(08)00737-6 **Download Restriction:** Full text for ScienceDirect subscribers only\n---><---\n\nAs the access to this document is restricted, you may want to\n\nsearchfor a different version of it.\n\n## References listed on IDEAS\n\nas\n\nHTMLHTML with abstractplain textplain text with abstractBibTeXRIS (EndNote, RefMan, ProCite)ReDIFJSON\n\n01.
