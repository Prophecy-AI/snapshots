      "title": "ANSWER",
      "text": "Tessellation patterns and asymmetric solutions enhance 2D polygon packing optimization by introducing structured arrangements and flexible configurations that improve packing efficiency. Tessellations, which involve covering a surface with shapes without overlaps or gaps, provide a systematic way to explore optimal packing arrangements, as seen in the study of tessellation rules and methods ([Result 6](https://www.elephango.com/index.cfm/pg/k12learning/lcid/13100/Tessellations:_Geometry_and_Art), [Result 7](https://en.tessellations-nicolas.com/method.php)). These patterns help identify arrangements that maximize space utilization.\n\nAsymmetric solutions, which relax the symmetry constraints typical of regular tessellations, allow for more adaptable configurations that can better accommodate irregular shapes and gaps. This flexibility can lead to higher packing densities, as demonstrated in the analysis of shapes that cannot tile perfectly, like circles, where non-regular arrangements can fill up to nearly 90.69% of the plane ([Result 3](https://www.quantamagazine.org/why-is-this-shape-so-terrible-to-pack-20240628)). Additionally, algorithms that leverage asymmetry and irregular tessellations can reduce wasted space and improve scores in polygon packing problems by enabling more efficient use of available space ([Result 4](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3303689/efficient-packing-algorithm-for-irregular-polygons), [Result 9](https://export.arxiv.org/pdf/2308.08523v1.pdf)). Overall, these approaches facilitate better optimization by allowing diverse, non-uniform arrangements that adapt to shape irregularities and packing constraints.",

By this they mean that if you want to subdivide a large area into tiles of equal size while minimizing the perimeter of each tile, you can\u2019t do any better than hexagons. In 1999,[Thomas Hales](https://www.mathematics.pitt.edu/people/thomas-hales)of the University of Pittsburgh[finally proved it](https://arxiv.org/abs/math/9906042). They\u2019re better than squares, triangles, or any other alternative.\nBut many shapes can\u2019t be tiled without leaving gaps. Circles, for example, obviously can\u2019t. With the best possible formation, a hexagonal-shaped circle packing, you\u2019ll fill nearly 90.69% of the plane.\n![](https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/TerriblePacking-Fig1-crMarkBelan-Desktop-v1-1.svg)![](https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/TerriblePacking-Fig1-crMarkBelan-Mobile-v1-1.svg)\nMark Belan for*Quanta Magazine*\nIn the 1920s, mathematicians began wondering: What\u2019s the worst shape to pack? In other words, what shape forces you to leave the largest gaps, even if you pack it in the best possible way? A[new paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04331)by Hales and his former graduate student[Koundinya Vajjha](https://kodyvajjha.github.io/), now an engineer at Intel, marks a major breakthrough in the search.\nDefining a worst shape requires a few rules. It\u2019s straightforward to come up with arbitrarily bad shapes that contain holes or inward dips, like these hollowed-out squares:\n![](https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/TerriblePacking-Fig2-crMarkBelan-Desktop-v1.jpg)![](https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/TerriblePacking-Fig2-crMarkBelan-Mobile-v1.jpg)\nThey aren\u2019t all that mathematically interesting, because by making the edges ever thinner, you can easily come up with a shape that forces an arbitrarily large fraction of space to be empty. But if you add in the requirement that the shape be convex \u2014meaning that if you choose any two points in the shape, the line segment connecting them will be contained within the shape \u2014then hollow shapes like this are forbidden, and things become more intriguing.\nMathematicians are interested in shapes that have one additional constraint: central symmetry. Without it, the worst known shape is the seven-sided regular heptagon (space filled: about 89.27%), though mathematicians are nowhere close to being able to prove it\u2019s the worst. Hales and Vajjha worked on the more constrained, and therefore simpler, question: What\u2019s the shape with the worst packing that is both convex and centrally symmetric?\nShare this article\n[\nFacebook\n](http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https://www.quantamagazine.org/why-is-this-shape-so-terrible-to-pack-20240628/)[\n](https://twitter.com/share?url=https://www.quantamagazine.org/why-is-this-shape-so-terrible-to-pack-20240628/&text=Why+Is+This+Shape+So+Terrible+to+Pack?&via=QuantaMagazine)[\nCopied!\nCopy link\n]()[\nEmail\n](https://www.quantamagazine.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#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)\n[\nPocket\n](https://getpocket.com/save?url=https://www.quantamagazine.org/why-is-this-shape-so-terrible-to-pack-20240628/&title=Why+Is+This+Shape+So+Terrible+to+Pack?)[\nReddit\n](https://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https://www.quantamagazine.org/why-is-this-shape-so-terrible-to-pack-20240628/)[\nYcombinator\n](https://news.ycombinator.com/submitlink?u=https://www.quantamagazine.org/why-is-this-shape-so-terrible-to-pack-20240628/&t=Why+Is+This+Shape+So+Terrible+to+Pack?)[\n](https://bsky.app/intent/compose?text=https://www.quantamagazine.org/why-i...",

Is it possible that the polygons you and your users want to tessellate can be characterized more narrowly? Such as sides being parallel, and maybe the polygons look like thickened strokes? Could you perhaps supply some more examples of what you're looking for?\n\n\u2013\u00a0[brainjam](https://stackoverflow.com/users/242848/brainjam)\n\nCommentedJul 23, 2010 at 3:04\n\n- Are there any constraints on the segments making up the polygons? For example, they always have sides oriented at multiples of X degrees, or the corners are aways angles multiple of Y degrees? I'm trying to figure out if we can have an _exact_ algorithm (fixed point operations), that doesn't run into this sort of problems: [flixxy.com/geometric-puzzle-solution-i.jpg](http://www.flixxy.com/geometric-puzzle-solution-i.jpg).\n\n\u2013\u00a0[Mau](https://stackoverflow.com/users/334220/mau)\n\nCommentedJul 23, 2010 at 10:06\n\n\n[Add a comment](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3303689/efficient-packing-algorithm-for-irregular-polygons)\u00a0\\|\n\n## 2 Answers 2\n\nSorted by:\n[Reset to default](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3303689/efficient-packing-algorithm-for-irregular-polygons?answertab=scoredesc#tab-top)\n\nHighest score (default)Trending (recent votes count more)Date modified (newest first)Date created (oldest first)\n\n8\n\nI don't know if this would give the optimal answer, but it would at least give an answer:\n\n1. Compute a Delaunay triangulation for the given polygon. There are standard algorithms to do this which will run very quickly for 100 vertices or fewer (see, for example, [this library here.](http://code.google.com/p/poly2tri/)) Using a Delaunay triangulation should ensure that you don't have too many long, thin triangles.\n2. Divide any non-right triangles into two right triangles by dropping an altitude from the largest angle to the opposite side.\n3. Search for triangles that you can combine into rectangles: any two congruent right triangles (not mirror images) which share a hypotenuse. I suspect there won't be too many of these in the general case unless your irregular polygon had a lot of right angles to begin with.\n\nI realize that's a lot of detail to fill in, but I think starting with a Delaunay triangulation is probably the way to go. Delaunay triangulations in the plane can be computed efficiently and they generally look quite \"natural\".\n\nEDITED TO ADD: since we're in ad-hoc heuristicville, in addition to the greedy algorithms being discussed in other answers you should also consider some kind of divide and conquer strategy. If the shape is non-convex like your example, divide it into convex shapes by repeatedly cutting from a reflex vertex to another vertex in a way that comes as close to bisecting the reflex angle as possible. Once you've divided the shape into convex pieces, I'd consider next dividing the convex pieces into pieces with nice \"bases\", pieces with at least one side having two acute or right angles at its ends. If any piece doesn't have such a \"base\" you should be able to divide it in two along a diameter of the piece, and get two new pieces which each have a \"base\" (I think). This should reduce the problem to dealing with convex polygons which are kinda-sorta trapezoidal, and from there a greedy algorithm should do well. I think this algorithm will subdivide the original shape in a fairly natural way until you get to the kinda-sorta trapezoidal pieces.\n\n[Share](https://stackoverflow.com/a/3313753)\n\n[Improve this answer](https://stackoverflow.com/posts/3313753/edit)\n\nFollow\n\n[edited Jul 23, 2010 at 12:50](https://stackoverflow.com/posts/3313753/revisions)\n\nanswered Jul 22, 2010 at 21:42\n\n[![Peter Milley's user avatar](https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/eb2a346fde4e2c5dc426aa702d181443?s=64&d=identicon&r=PG)](https://stackoverflow.com/users/298736/peter-milley)\n\n[Peter Milley](https://stackoverflow.com/users/298736/peter-milley) Peter Milley\n\n2,7781919 silver badges1818 bronze badges\n\n5\n\n- +1 for a solid breakdown answer. My first go-round that's actually what I did. Unfortunately, because it's not specifically designed to create rectangles, it's unusual (except in super special cases) to find any combination of those triangles that create a rectangle.

These tiles are carefully designed following three rules. If construction workers follow these rules when working on houses, schools, or other buildings in your community, they are creating tessellations!\nImagine you are working with a construction worker to check if the tessellations and tile patterns around you are following the rules.\nLet's get started by looking closely at these tile floors.\nBut before we try to understand tessellations, we need to remember how patterns work!\nA pattern is something repeated with a set of rules. You can find patterns with colors, shapes, numbers, and more! For example, this row of shapes has a pattern:\n![shape pattern](https://d2cvjmix0699s1.cloudfront.net/resources/elephango/_userimages/shape-pattern-13100.jpg \"shape pattern\")\nThis pattern has three rules.\n1. The first rule in this pattern is that the color of the shapes are green, then blue, then orange. The rule repeats over and over again to make the pattern.\n2. The second rule in this pattern is that the type of shape changes from a circle, to a star, and back to a circle. This rule also repeats over and over again to make a pattern.\n3. The last rule of the pattern is that the sizes of the shapes are small, small, big. These three rules make the pattern we see above.\nIf we follow these rules, we can guess what the next shape in the pattern will look like! The next shape will be a small green circle!\nWe see patterns all around us in our lives. For example, look around your house. I bet you can find a floor or a wall with tiles on it similar to this one.\n![mosaic tile](https://d2cvjmix0699s1.cloudfront.net/resources/elephango/_userimages/mosiac-tile__13100.jpg \"mosaic tile\")\nThe tiles cover an entire flat area and are made up of one or more shapes. This is an example of a tessellation.\nA tessellation is a type of pattern that covers an entire flat surface with repeating polygons without any gaps or overlapping.\nWhew! That seems complicated! But just like our shape pattern from above, we can break this pattern down into three simple rules to follow.\n3 Rules of a Tessellation|\nRule #1|The shapes must be*regular polygons*.|\nRule #2|The polygons can't overlap or have gaps in the pattern.|\nRule #3|Every vertex has to look the same.|\n**Tessellation Rule #1**: The shapes must be regular polygons.\nA polygon is any shape that is formed by straight lines. The names of polygons tell you how many sides the shape has.\n* Can you think of any polygons?\nA regular polygon is when all the sides are equal length. For example, a square is a regular polygon because all four sides are the same length.\nHere are examples of other regular polygons labeled by their number of sides:\n[![Image - Video](images/video_placeholder.png)](javascript:;)\nEach of these polygons is made up of sides that are the same length.\nThis tile floor is a tessellation made out of all regular hexagons!\n![mosaic tile hexagons](https://d2cvjmix0699s1.cloudfront.net/resources/elephango/_userimages/mosaic-tile-hexagons-13100.jpg \"mosaic tile hexagons\")\nIn order to make a tessellation, we must use regular polygons!\n**Tessellation Rule #2**: The polygons can't overlap or have gaps in the pattern.\nImagine laying tiles on a floor. The floor wouldn't look right or be smooth to walk on if the edges of the tiles overlapped. This is also true if there were gaps between tiles.\nFor example, you couldn't make a tessellation with just octagons. This 8-sided shape would overlap with each other.\n![octagons overlapping](https://d2cvjmix0699s1.cloudfront.net/resources/elephango/_userimages/overlapping-octagons-13100.jpg \"octagons overlapping\")\nHowever, you could make a tessellation with octagons and squares! No overlapping and no gaps!\n![tile floor](https://d2cvjmix0699s1.cloudfront.net/resources/elephango/_userimages/tile-floor-13100.jpg \"tile floor\")\nIn order to make a tessellation, we must use one or more regular polygons with no overlapping and no gaps.\n**Tessellation Rule #3**: Every vertex has to look the same.\nA vertex is where all the corners of each polygon meet.\nFor example, look at each corner of our tile floor. Find a corner, or a vertex, and look at all the polygons meeting at this spot.\n![6.6.6 tessellation](https://d2cvjmix0699s1.cloudfront.net/resources/elephango/_userimages/6-6-6-tessellation-13100.jpg \"6.6.6 tessellation\")\nNotice how every vertex you point to is surrounded by three hexagons (six sides). This is named a 6.6.6 tessellation.\nNow, look at our example of a tessellation made out of squares and octagons. Let's check to see if every vertex is the same.\n![4.8.8 tessellation](https://d2cvjmix0699s1.cloudfront.net/resources/elephango/_userimages/4-8-8-tessellation-13100.jpg \"4.8.8 tessellation\")\nEach vertex is surrounded by a square (four sides) and two octagons (eight sides). This is named a 4.8.8 tessellation.\nIn order to make a tessellation, we must follow these three rules for this type of pattern!\nMove to the*Got It?*section to practice using the rules of tessellations!\n[![Image - Button Next](images/bnt_next.png)](javascript:;)\n## Resources and Extras\n**Resources Referenced in the Lesson**\n* [Tessellation Creator](javascript:;)\n**Additional Resources**\n* [Tessellation](javascript:;)(Wolfram MathWorld)\n## Suggested Lessons\n[![Lesson - Multiplication: Single-digit by Multi-digit Educational Resources K12 Learning](https://d2cvjmix0699s1.cloudfront.net/resources/elephango/resourceFull/girls-map-13183.jpg \"Multiplication: Single-digit by Multi-digit Educational Resources K12 Learning\")\n![Badge - Multiplication: Single-digit by ...",

A link will be provided\nin a future version of this document.\narXiv:2308.08523v1 [cs.CG] 16 Aug 2023\n2 Improved Approximations for Translational Packing of Convex Polygons\n1 Introduction\nMany real-life situations require us to make decisions about optimally packing a collection\nof objects into a specific container. One particular category of these packing problems is\ntwo-dimensional packing, which is encountered in everyday scenarios like arranging items\non a shelf and in industrial applications such as cutting cookies from rolled-out dough\nor manufacturing sets of tiles from standard-sized panels made of wood, glass, or metal.\nAnother intriguing example involves cutting fabric pieces for clothing production. In this\ncase, the pieces often cannot be rotated freely, as they must adhere to a desired pattern\nin the final product, which is tailored of multiple elements. The widespread applicability\nof two-dimensional packing problems has led to a surge of interest in designing efficient\nalgorithms to address them. In this paper, we follow the line of research and study the\nproblem of packing convex polygons without rotations in various settings depending on the\ntype of containers used.\nPast research focusing on theoretical considerations of two-dimensional packings mainly\nconcentrates on the scenario when all objects are axis-parallel rectangles. In this paper, we\nwill discuss packing without rotations, in which only translations are permitted. There are\ntwo main classes of the problem depending on whether the size of the container is fixed and\nwe want to minimize the number of containers used or whether we want to minimize the\ncontainer\u2019s size with respect to some objective function.\nA seminal example of the first class is the Geometric Bin Packing problem in which\na number of unit size squared bins to pack is to be minimized. The problem is arguably\nthe most natural generalization of the regular (1D) Bin Packing to two dimensions, and\nits absolute approximability has been fully understood. Unless P = N P, the best possible\nefficient constant factor approximation is 2 [15], and such an algorithm is known [10].\nIn the second class, there are several variants to be considered. An example is the\nStrip Packing Problem which is concerned with packing objects into a strip of width\n1 and infinite height in such a way that the maximum of all the heights of the placed\nobjects is minimized. Like Geometric Bin Packing, Strip Packing generalizes (1D)\nBin Packing. The best known efficient constant factor approximation for Strip Packing\nhas approximation factor (5/3 + \u03f5) [9]. It is known that there can not exist a polynomial\ntime algorithm with an approximation ratio of (3/2 \u2212 \u03f5) for any \u03f5 > 0 unless P = N P, which\nfollows directly from the approximation hardness of (1D) Bin Packing. Both classes of\nproblems have been also considered in the asymptotic setting, see e.g. [11, 5, 12].\nIn younger time, there was also an increase of interest in cases where the objects in\nquestion are general convex polygons. Alt, de Berg and Knauer [2, 3] considered the problem\nof packing an instance consisting of a number of convex polygons of the form p \u2282 [0, 1]2into\na minimum area axis-parallel rectangular container. We refer to this problem as Polygon\nArea Minimization throughout this paper. In the special case where the instance consists\nof rectangles only, the problem is known to admit a PTAS [4]. They proved the existence of\nthe following efficient algorithm:\nA 23.78-approximation for Polygon Area Minimization.\nRecently, Aamand, Abrahamsen, Beretta and Kleist [1] showed that the algorithm of Alt,\nde Berg and Knauer can be leveraged to obtain also efficient approximation algorithms of\nfurther problems:\nA 7-approximation for Polygon Perimeter Minimization.\nA 51-approximation for Polygon Strip Packing.\nAn 11-approximation for Polygon Bin Packing for polygons with diameter at most 1\n10 .\nA. Kurpisz and S. Suter 3\n1.1 Our results\nThe results of Alt, de Berg and Knauer [2, 3] and Aamand et al. [1] are heavily based on\nso-called shelf packing algorithms. In shelf packing algorithms, the objects are first placed\non the shelves, possibly ordered by height, which are later stacked on one another to build\na final solution. Compared to axis-parallel rectangles, the main challenge in designing an\napproximation algorithm for polygon packing problems is that objects cannot be sorted by\nheight and orientation simultaneously. As a result, the algorithm and its analysis in [2, 3]\nhave such a large approximation guarantee. In this paper, we provide new insight into how\nshelf packing algorithms should be applied to polygon packing problems. We introduce a\nsequence of transformations of the objects that allow us first to sort them by height and later\nby orientation to build a solution of a much better approximation guarantee. More precisely,\nwe design polynomial-time algorithms with the following factors:\nA 9.45-approximation for Polygon Area Minimization.\nUsing this algorithm as a subroutine, we build upon the methods from Aamand et al. [1] to\nobtain the following efficient approximation algorithms:\nA (3.75 + \u03f5)-approximation for Polygon Perimeter Minimization.\nA 21.89-approximation for Polygon Strip Packing.\nA 5.09-approximation for Polygon Bin Packing for polygons which have their diameter\nbounded by 1\n10 .\nThe results are proved in Sections 4, 5, 6, and 7 respectively. Furthermore, in Section 8\nwe show the following results, which make progress towards solving an open question of a\nO(1)-approximation algorithm for Polygon Bin Packing for arbitrary polygons.\nThere is an efficient O(\n1\n\u03b4\n)-approximation algorithm for Polygon Bin Packing for\ninstances where each polygon has width or height at most 1 \u2212 \u03b4.\nThere is an efficient O(1)-approximation algorithm for Polygon Bin Packing for\ninstances with the property that all polygons share a spine (up to translation) with height\nat least 3\n4\n.\n2 Preliminaries\nWe start out considerations by recalling a classical and well-known problem in theoretical\ncomputer science, the Bin Packing problem: Given a list of numbers s1, . . . , sn \u2208 (0, 1] \u2229 Q,\nrepresenting the sizes of n objects, the goal is to find the minimum number of bins of size 1,\nso that we can pac...",

Many of these problems can be related to real-life[packaging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packaging), storage and transportation issues. Each packing problem has a dual[covering problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covering_problem), which asks how many of the same objects are required to completely cover every region of the container, where objects are allowed to overlap.\nIn a[bin packing problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bin_packing_problem), people are given:\n* A*container*, usually a two- or three-dimensional[convex region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_region), possibly of infinite size. Multiple containers may be given depending on the problem.\n* A set of*objects*, some or all of which must be packed into one or more containers. The set may contain different objects with their sizes specified, or a single object of a fixed dimension that can be used repeatedly.\nUsually the packing must be without overlaps between goods and other goods or the container walls. In some variants, the aim is to find the configuration that packs a single container with the maximal[packing density](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packing_density). More commonly, the aim is to pack all the objects into as few containers as possible.[&#91;1&#93;](#cite_note-1)In some variants the overlapping (of objects with each other and/or with the boundary of the container) is allowed but should be minimized.\n## Packing in infinite space\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Packing_problems&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1)]\nMany of these problems, when the container size is increased in all directions, become equivalent to the problem of packing objects as densely as pos...",

      "text": "Polygon Packing\n[\\~/](https://larswander.com/)[me](https://larswander.com/about/)[art](https://larswander.com/art/)[writing](https://larswander.com/writing/)\n# Polygon Packing\n2021-04-21\nYou might have heard of[tesselations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tessellation), and you&rsquo;ve\ndefinitely seen a few before. A tesselation of a flat surface simply involves\ncovering it in shapes, without having any overlap or leaving any gaps. For\nexample: the tiles on your kitchen floor are a tesselation (unless you&rsquo;re\nmissing some tiles). A[mosaic](#mosaic)is a tesselation. The infinite variety produced from\na few simple shapes in a[Penrose\nTiling](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/PenroseTiles.html)are tesselations.\nThere are many[beautiful examples of tesselations\nonline](https://www.widewalls.ch/magazine/tessellation-mathematics-method-art),\nand they have been used to[create art for\nmillenia](https://www.britannica.com/art/mosaic-art).\nI was curious what would happen if we changed the requirements for making\ntesselations a little, and instead used the following rules:\n* No overlapping shapes (the same as a tesselation).\n* Gaps can exist between shapes (different from a tesselation).\n* Shapes must be layed edge-to-edge (to enforce some structure).\nBy allowing for gaps between shapes, this becomes a variant of[Packing\nproblems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packing_problems). These problems try\nto fit shapes into[containers](#tetris), allowing for some space between shapes as it may\nnot be possible to create a perfect fit. I wasn&rsquo;t so interested in finding\n&ldquo;optimal packings&rdquo;, but instead just looking for the patterns that arise when\nwe apply these rules.\n## Packing procedure\nBefore looking at results, let me describe at a high-level how my polygon\npacking algorithm works. You can skip this part if you&rsquo;re not interested, but I\nthink it&rsquo;s important to have a high-level understanding to appreciate the\nresults.\nThe algorithm does the following:\n1. Place the`shape`we&rsquo;re packing at the center, e.g. (0, 0).\n2. As long as we don&rsquo;t have`count`(e.g. 100) shapes placed, repeatedly:\n1. Look at the closest edge to the center that doesn&rsquo;t have a shape next to\nit yet.\n2. Find an edge on our`shape`with the same length, and place our shape\nagainst it (reflecting it if need-be).\n3. If it doesn&rsquo;t collide with any other shapes in out packing, save it.\nYou can think of it as trying to place shapes as close to the center without\noverlapping, but only when sitting edge-to-edge with another shape that&rsquo;s\nalready been placed.\nTo demonstrate what&rsquo;s going, I&rsquo;ve drawn the first few iterations of this\nalgorithm against a triangle:\n![Packing procedure](https://larswander.com/img/art/polygon-packing/procedure.webp)The center is denoted with`0,0`. The edge we pick to line up our\nshape against is given a red tick mark. After just a few iterations the\nresult is quite predictable, and a little boring. It gets more interesting as\nwe start to pack more shapes (see below).### Pseudocode\nIf you&rsquo;re interested, here is some (unoptomized) python-esque pseudocode. This\npart is definitely skippable.\n```\n`# `shape` the shape we will pack, located at the origin\n# `count` is how many shapes we want to pack\ndef polygon\\_packing(shape, count):\nresult = [shape.copy()] # place a shape at the center\nopen\\_edges = queue(shape.edges()) # all edges, sorted by distance to (0, 0)\nwhile len(result) &lt;&lt; count: # keep going until we have `count` shapes\nedge = open\\_edges.pop() # look at the closest edge to (0, 0)\nif edge is None: # if no edges remain, we're done early\nprint(&quot;&quot;ran out of edges early...&quot;&quot;)\nreturn result\nfor new\\_shape in shape.options(edge): # all rotations/flips around `edge`\nif not new\\_shape.collides(result): # if there's not a collision\nresult.add(new\\_shape) # save the shape\nopen\\_edges.push(new\\_shape.edges()) # save the edges for later packing\nbreak\nreturn result`\n```\n> **> Sidenote\n**> : There are a surprising number of edge-cases when looking for> colliding shapes when allowing for (and encouraging) shapes to lie> edge-to-edge. I might do an explanation of these in a later post if anyoneexpresses interest in trying to implement this themselves.\n> This code is rather simple, and as long as you understand what it&rsquo;s doing, it\nshouldn&rsquo;t be a surprise (at least in small cases) how shapes are placed next to\none another. The &ldquo;magic&rdquo; happens when you scale this up to several thousand\nshapes.\n## Results\nThese results were all plotted with a pen plotter. I&rsquo;ll be walking through how\ndifferent shapes wind up packing together.\n### Triangles\nI started by packing differently shaped triangles, on the order of a few\nthousand at once. The result is immediately quite satisfying, and reminds me\nvisually of[grain\nboundaries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grain_boundary)found in crystalline\nstructures.\n![Packing of triangles](https://larswander.com/img/art/polygon-packing/triangle-zoom.webp)Here we have a zoomed in plot of a packing of triangles.\nSurprisingly, the triangles seem to orient themselves to point towards the\ncenter, and form large, contiguous regions where the packing pattern is\nrepeated.\n**Parameters**\n`shape: [0, 2], [2, 0], [0.9, 0.45]`\n`count: 3000`![Packing of triangles](https://larswander.com/img/art/polygon-packing/triangle-round.webp)Zoomed out, we see that the constant pressure to place shapes at\nthe center results in a rounded figure. The \"grain boundary\" effect at this\nlevel is even more pronounced.\n**Parameters**\n`shape: [0, 2], [2, 0], [0.9, 0.45]`\n`count: 3000`\nMoving shapes far away from the origin, in effect forcing them to pack close\nto a line rather than a single point creates even more clearly delineated grain[boundaries](#pen-gradient):\n![Packing of triangles](https://larswander.com/img/art/polygon-packing/triangle-flat.webp)The grain structures grow quite large here, and the contiguous\nfilled spaces create a nice composition in constrast to the gaps left where\nno shapes could be packed.\n**Parameters**\n`parameters lost due to technical error`### Watercolor\nFor fun, I&rsquo;ve also used the pen plotter to[create](#watercolor-gradient)a[watercolor](https://larswander.com/writing/watercolor-plots)of these triangle\npackings:\n![Watercolor packing of triangles](https://larswander.com/img/art/polygon-packing/triangle-watercolor.webp)For aesthetic reasons, I shrank every packed triangle before\nfilling it. The overall effect is quite playful I think. This is one of my\nfirst successful watercolor experiments with the pen plotter -- the\nchallenge here lay in getting the fill for each shape to look right.\n**Parameters**\n`shape: [0, 0], [1, 0], [0.5, 1]`\n`count: 350`\n`scale: 0.65`### Quads\nFoursided shapes (unsurprisingly) produce some very different results. One of\nmy favorite results has come from using slightly &ldquo;lopsided&rdquo; squares, meaning\none of the four shape is ever so slightly out of position. A packing of\nregular squares using my packing procedure would just result in a tesselation,\nafter all.\n![Packing of\nlopsided squares](https://larswander.com/img/art/polygon-packing/quad-lopsided-zoom.webp)Looking closely at this \"lopsided\" square packing we see much\nsmaller regions of alignment among the shapes.\n**Parameters**\n`shape: [0, 0], [1, 0], [1, 0.9], [0, 1]`\n`count: 20000`![Packing of\nlopsided squares](https://larswander.com/img/art/polygon-packing/quad-lopsided.webp)From a distance, we just see a very lovely texture, reminiscent\nEuropean rounded pavers, or[setts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sett_(paving)).\n**Parameters**\n`shape: [0, 0], [1, 0], [1, 0.9], [0, 1]`\n`count: 20000`\nTrapezoids on the other hand create a much more hectic and vibrant texture.\n![Packing of\ntrapezoids](https://larswander.com/img/art/polygon-packing/quad-trapezoid.webp)The gaps in the\npacking seem to radiate from the center in a somewhat regular but\nunpredicatable pattern...",

The packing problem to be solved corresponds to a two-dimensional packing of convex-shape polygons and is based on the locus operation used for the advancing front approach. Additionally, for the sake of simplicity, we decided to restrain the polygon rotation in the packing process. Three heuristics are presented to simplify the packing problem: density heuristic, gravity heuristic and the multi-layer packing. The decision made by those three heuristic are prioritizing on minimizing the area, inserting polygons on the minimum*Y*coordinate and pack polygons in multiple layers dividing the input in multiple lists, respectively. Finally, we illustrate the potential of the generated meshes by solving a diffusion problem, where the discretized domain consisted in polygons and spaces with different conductivities. Due to the arbitrary shape of polygons and spaces that are generated by the packing algorithm, the virtual element method was used to solve the diffusion problem numerically.\n**Keywords:**Polygonal meshes, Geometric packing, Virtual element method, Computational geometry\n## Introduction\nIn the last decade, the use of finite element methods (FEM) have been the common engineering practice to design and evaluate the performance of different systems. However, in many applications, the FEM has shown some limitations related to the complexity involved in the mesh generation, specially for problems in which the domain is defined by an arrangement of irregular sub-domains. In particular, these situations are found in problems related to the flux of fluid and heat in porous media, fracture mechanics of conglomerate rocks, stability of tailing dams, concrete modeling, amount others. Here, one of the issues is to deal with the random nature of the sub-domains, requiring the statistical study of the problem with multiple simulations. As consequence, the computational burden increases since it is required to draw the geometry and create the mesh several times.\nWith the advent of the virtual element method (VEM) [[15](#CR15)] very general polytopal meshes (polygons can even be non-convex) can now be used to simulate problems based on Galerkin methods in a manner similar to FEM. In porous media, microstructure, rock accumulation, among others, the bidimensional domain is composed naturally of arbitrary polytopal shapes, which in a simulation can be represented by virtual elements. In this regard, the mentioned issues could be solved using the packing perspective together with numerical methods that employ polytopal meshes (i.e., Virtual Element Method). In a general perspective, packing is an optimization problem on how to organize the content of a container as densely as possible. A particular example of packing is the geometric packing; this packing comprises fitting geometric figures as much as possible inside a container. For example, packing polygons inside a rectangle container, or packing tetrahedra inside a cube container. Then, these polygons/polyhedrons could be used to define the sub-domains at the same time that could be used as a mesh under VEMs schemes.\nDifferent packing strategies have been developed in the past employing different packing geometries. For example, adopting a circle and sphe...",
