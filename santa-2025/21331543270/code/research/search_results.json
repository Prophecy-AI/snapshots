      "text": "Top Kaggle competitors tackling 2D irregular polygon packing problems, such as Santa 2025, employ a variety of advanced techniques rooted in machine learning, heuristic algorithms, and optimization strategies. Recent research highlights the use of learning-based methods, particularly gradient field learning and diffusion models, which encode complex geometric relationships and spatial constraints to guide packing solutions ([arXiv:2406.07579](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1), [arXiv:2309.10329](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.10329)).

For instance, some teams utilize partitioning strategies to break down large problems into manageable subproblems, then apply sequential placement and overlap elimination techniques to optimize space utilization ([LIPIcs 2024](https://drops.dagstuhl.de/storage/00lipics/lipics-vol293-socg2024)).

The proposed attention-based diffusion model for 2D irregular packing, GFPack++, supports\ncontinuous rotation and accommodating arbitrary boundaries.\n\n## 1\\. Introduction\n\nIrregular shape packing is a classic challenge in operation research, with significant implications for various applications such as texture atlas generation and material utilization in manufacturing\u00a0(Wang et\u00a0al., [2021](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib34)). Its NP-hard nature requires practical and effective packing algorithms to optimize space utilization.\n\nTraditional numerical optimization methods are often slow and costly. Recently, learning-based methods have emerged as a promising alternative for irregular packing, mainly using reinforcement learning\u00a0(Xu et\u00a0al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib37); Yang et\u00a0al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib39)).\nAnother promising approach is the diffusion model, which learns geometric relationships from teacher packing examples and establishes a gradient field for all objects, guiding them to move simultaneously\u00a0(Hosseini et\u00a0al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib11); Xue et\u00a0al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib38)).\nIn particular, the work of (Xue et\u00a0al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib38)), namely GFPack, achieves a notable trade-off between computational cost and space utilization, demonstrating scalability in terms of polygon count and generalizability to rectangular container boundaries.\nHowever, it still faces unresolved issues, notably the lack of support for rotation, a relatively high occurrence of object collisions in results, and limited adaptability to arbitrary boundaries.\n\nThe main idea of the learning-based packing framework is to capture the geometric relationships between shapes, which are essential for the gradient computation.\nSuch relationships in latent space encompass multiple facets: the _spatial (position, orientation) relationship_ of the shapes, the _geometric features relationship_ among them, and the _container boundary conditions_ that constrain them.\nHowever, GFPack falls short in fully representing these relationships.\nIt solely focuses on the positional aspect, neglecting orientation, thus hindering rotational capabilities. Furthermore, it relies on PointNeXt\u00a0(Qian et\u00a0al., [2022](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib24)) for geometric feature extraction, ignoring critical details like polygon edges and resulting in a loss of topological and local features.\nThus, we argue that the full potential of gradient learning has not been thoroughly exploited in GFPack.\n\nIn this study, we introduce two primary strategies to tackle the challenge of learning packing policies.\nFirstly, we use a graph to represent each object and encode it with an _attention-based geometric encoder_, which can capture polygonal geometry information effectively.\nSecondly, we design an _attention-based relation encoding_ mechanism to encode intricate relationships both between polygons and among polygons and boundaries, eliminating the need to explicitly represent the relationships with a graph.\nThis attention-based diffusion model enhances the understanding of how objects interact with each other and the boundaries, resulting in superior performance in both training and inference.\nWe also investigate the utilization distribution between the teacher and inference data and design a weighting function to prioritize tighter teacher data during training, confirmed to be effective.\n\nThis paper makes the following contributions:\n\n1. -\n\n\nWe propose GFPack++, a novel packing framework that employs attention-based learning of gradient fields, supporting continuous rotation and enhancing generalization.\n\n2. -\n\n\nAdvancing beyond GFPack, we encapsulate geometric relationships in an attention-based encoder, incorporating mutual spatial (position, orientation) relationships of objects, their geometric features, and container boundary conditions, and a weighting function to facilitate effective learning policies.\n\n3. -\n\n\nGFPack++ achieves superior irregular packing results, demonstrating higher space utilization over several widely used baselines, one order of magnitude faster than the previous diffusion-based method, coupled with promising generalization for arbitrary boundaries.\n\n\n## 2\\. Related Work\n\n#### Traditional packing approaches\n\nTraditional methods usually involve placement optimization and sequence planning ( _c.f_.surveys\u00a0(Bennell and Oliveira, [2009](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib3); Leao et\u00a0al., [2020](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib18))). Most research focuses on placement optimization with heuristic rules (e.g., BL, BLF), NFP-based search\u00a0(Bennell and Song, [2008](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib4)), or mathematical models\u00a0(Hopper and Turton, [2001](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib10)). Novel approaches include SDF-based placement\u00a0(Pan et\u00a0al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib23)) and spectral domain correlation\u00a0(Cui et\u00a0al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib6)), but they only support limited rotations.

Being a joint, combinatorial decision-making problem involving all patch positions and orientations, this problem has well-known NP-hard complexity. Prior solutions either assume a heuristic packing order or modify the upstream mesh cut and UV mapping to simplify the problem, which either limits the packing ratio or incurs robustness or generality issues. Instead, we introduce a learning-assisted 2D irregular shape packing method that achieves a high packing quality with minimal requirements from the input. Our method iteratively selects and groups subsets of UV patches into near-rectangular super patches, essentially reducing the problem to bin-packing, based on which a joint optimization is employed to further improve the packing ratio. In order to efficiently deal with large problem instances with hundreds of patches, we train deep neural policies to predict nearly rectangular patch subsets and determine their relative poses, leading to linear time scaling with the number of patches. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on three datasets for UV packing, where our method achieves a higher packing ratio over several widely used baselines with competitive computational speed.\n\ngeometry processing, deep reinforcement learning, combinatorial optimization\n\n\u2020\u2020price: 15.00\u2020\u2020copyright: acmlicensed\u2020\u2020journal: TOG\u2020\u2020journalyear: 2023\u2020\u2020journalvolume: 42\u2020\u2020journalnumber: 6\u2020\u2020publicationmonth: 12\u2020\u2020price: 15.00\u2020\u2020doi: 10.1145/3618348\u2020\u2020ccs: Computing methodologies\u00a0Computer graphics\u2020\u2020ccs: Computing methodologies\u00a0Machine learning\n\n|     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![Refer to caption](https://arxiv.org/html/extracted/5118135/fig/fig1/part_model.jpg) | ![Refer to caption](https://arxiv.org/html/extracted/5118135/fig/fig1/part_xatlas_0.698.jpg) | ![Refer to caption](https://arxiv.org/html/extracted/5118135/fig/fig1/part_ours_0.774.jpg) | ![Refer to caption](https://arxiv.org/html/extracted/5118135/fig/fig1/chinsehouse_model.jpg) | ![Refer to caption](https://arxiv.org/html/extracted/5118135/fig/fig1/chinsehouse_xatlas_0.662.jpg) | ![Refer to caption](https://arxiv.org/html/extracted/5118135/fig/fig1/chinsehouse_ours_0.764.jpg) | ![Refer to caption](https://arxiv.org/html/extracted/5118135/fig/fig1/tigerhead_model.jpg) | ![Refer to caption](https://arxiv.org/html/extracted/5118135/fig/fig1/tigerhead_xatlas_0.610.jpg) | ![Refer to caption](https://arxiv.org/html/extracted/5118135/fig/fig1/tigerhead_ours_0.729.jpg) |\n|  | XAtlas pr: 69.8% | Ours pr: 77.4% |  | XAtlas pr: 66.2% | Ours pr: 76.4% |  | XAtlas pr: 61.0% | Ours pr: 72.9% |\n\nFigure 1.

Introduction\n\n2D irregular shape packing lies the theoretical foundation for a wide spectrum of applications across various industrial areas, e.g. material parts assembly\u00a0\\[Ke\net\u00a0al., [2020](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.10329#bib.bib22)\\], VLSI module placements\u00a0\\[Cheng\net\u00a0al., [2005](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.10329#bib.bib8)\\], and 2D shelf arrangements in automatic warehouses\u00a0\\[\u00d6n\u00fct et\u00a0al., [2008](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.10329#bib.bib28)\\]. The most prominent packing application in computer graphics is UV chart packing, where a set of 2D shapes corresponding to patches of 3D models are packed together into a single texture atlas for mapping various appearance details onto the 3D surface for downstream rendering. In the realm of digital games where many 3D models are rendered in the virtual world, improving the UV packing ratio could significantly save the graphical memory, improve the loading speed, and reduce rendering overhead. This problem was recognized decades ago, e.g., by\u00a0Soucy\net\u00a0al. \\[ [1996](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.10329#bib.bib39)\\] and\u00a0Sander\net\u00a0al. \\[ [2001](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.10329#bib.bib33)\\], which has recently revived as an active area of graphic research\u00a0\\[Limper\net\u00a0al., [2018](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.10329#bib.bib24); Liu\net\u00a0al., [2019](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.10329#bib.bib25); Zhang\net\u00a0al., [2020](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.10329#bib.bib47)\\].\n\nAn packing algorithm needs to search for both the position and orientation of each patch. Due to its combinatorial nature, finding optimal 2D shape packing has been well-understood as being NP-complete and APX-hard. Prior research efforts are focused on heuristic or genetic algorithms to determine the order of objects to be packed, and then search for the pose of each shape, e.g., using no-fit polygon (NFP) and the \u201cTetris\u201d algorithm. However, the sub-optimality gap of these heuristics can be substantial. On the other hand, when the problem size is small, globally optimal stochastic optimization algorithms have been proposed to search for the near-optimal packing orders. Although these techniques can scale to tens of 2D shapes, UV unwrapping approaches and commercial 3D modeling software can oftentimes generate hundreds of patches for one 3D model, which is far beyond the capabilities of the global search algorithms.\n\nWe propose a learning-assisted 2D packing pipeline for general irregular-shaped patches. The design of our approach is based on two observations: 1) Prior works generate sub-optimal solutions by assuming objects are packed sequentially. 2) Prior works try all possible poses and orientations for each to-be-packed object to find the best solution, leading to slow computation. To tackle these issues, we propose to hierarchically group patches into nearly rectangular super-patches, allowing a larger search space for patch combination and a smaller optimality gap. Instead of exhaustively trying all possible combinations, we train a high-level group selector network (HSN) to efficiently predict how likely a candidate patch subset can be grouped into a rectangular super-patch. Given an identified patch subset, we use the sequential ordering technique, similar to prior works. Specifically, we use a low-level sorter network (LSN) to determine the suitable order of packing within the subset. Next, a low-level pose network (LPN) infers the rough initial pose of each patch. The ultimate pose of these patches is determined by local numerical optimization. These two networks are trained using reinforcement learning to efficiently infer near optimal sequential packing policies.\n\nWe have evaluated our method on 3 datasets, containing highly irregular UV patches generated from both organic and man-made 3D models. We show the effectiveness of our approach by comparing against widely used algorithm baselines, including piecewise linear NFP, XAtlas\u00a0\\[Young, [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.10329#bib.bib46)\\], and\u00a0\\[Sander et\u00a0al., [2003](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.10329#bib.bib34)\\], where we achieve a 5%\u221210%percent5percent105\\\\%-10\\\\%5 % - 10 % packing ratio improvement across all the tested datasets.

It is also known as cutting or\nnesting problem, which involves arranging a collection of irregu\u0002larly shaped pieces onto one or multiple boards. The objective is to\nposition each piece entirely within the board(s) without overlaps,\nall while minimizing the waste material produced.\narXiv:2310.19814v1 [cs.LG] 18 Oct 2023\nTianyang Xue, Mingdong Wu, Lin Lu, Haoxuan Wang, Hao Dong, and Baoquan Chen\nOne of the key applications of irregular packing is manufacturing.\nIn these scenarios, packing problems take on different forms, such\nas packing parts to be cut from a larger piece of material in order\nto minimize waste and save costs in traditional manufacturing\nindustries like garment manufacturing, furniture making, metal\nsheet cutting, or arranging multiple models within the build volume\nfor simultaneous 3D printing to increase model production while\nminimizing material waste, and reducing print time.\nIn manufacturing applications, a fast, scalable, and generalizable\npacking algorithm is crucial for real-world deployment.\n\u2022 Efficient algorithms streamline decision-making, simplify\u0002ing deployment for end-users.\n\u2022 The size and aspect ratio of the container may vary depend\u0002ing on the raw material or machines used.\n\u2022 Packed objects may have similar shapes with slight devia\u0002tions due to customization and personalization preferences.\nThese objectives motivate us to propose a learning-based method\nto understand the relationships and similarities among the well\u0002packed examples from a dataset with limited size, instead of solving\nthe packing case individually without considering any priors.\nAs a classic NP-hard problem [Milenkovic 1999], the irregular\npacking problem is typically tackled using heuristic algorithms and\nglobal optimization strategies [Guo et al. 2022], which can be very\ntime-consuming. In recent years, machine learning approaches have\nemerged as potential solutions to address the challenging problem\nof packing optimization. The success of employing reinforcement\nlearning to address the bin packing problem [Verma et al. 2020; Zhao\net al. 2022] underscores its potential for aiding in the sequential\noptimization of packing. While researchers have strived to enhance\nthe initialization [Wo\u0142czyk 2018] or packing sequence [Fang et al.\n2023] for irregular packing, a trade-off between computational time\nand utilization rate persists.\nTo realize a fast, scalable, and generalizable packing algorithm,\nour key insight is to reframe the packing problem into modeling\nthe data distribution of sub-optimal packing examples. These ex\u0002amples can be generated by arbitrary packing algorithms, which\nwe refer to as the teacher algorithms. Specifically, such a learning\napproach should learn the correlations between the packing opti\u0002mality and the spatial relationships of polygons from the examples.\nBy modeling the local and global correlations together, the learned\nknowledge can generalize to unseen shapes, varying quantities,\nand diverse rectangular containers, which enables scalable and\ngeneralizable in-distribution packing.\nDuring testing, a solution can be generated via several neural\nnetwork inferences, without further online exploration or exhaus\u0002tive optimization, which enables a fast packing process. Thanks to\nthe inherent parallelism of deep learning, we can generate multiple\nsolution candidates in parallel and preserve the best one, which\nfurther improves the time efficiency of the packing process.\nInspired by [Wu et al. 2022], which proposes a score-based frame\u0002work that estimates a target gradient field (TarGF) to guide object\nrearrangement, we aim to develop a score-based approach for mod\u0002eling the teacher data. However, adapting this technique to the\nirregular packing problem is non-trivial due to the hard constraints\non the validity of packed objects, i.e., non-overlapping. As a result,\nsolving the irregular packing requires a coarse-to-fine refinement\nprocess guided by multiple levels of gradient fields, rather than a\nsingle gradient update (TarGF).\nTo achieve this goal, we introduce two key designs for the score\nnetwork: multi-scale feature extraction and coarse-to-fine relation\nextraction. The former incorporates a multi-scale feature extraction\nnetwork that encodes the geometric features of polygons at different\nscales. The latter employs a multi-layered coarse-to-fine graph\nconvolutional network (GCN) with varying neighbor ranges for\neffective message-passing. By combining these two key designs, our\napproach tailors the score network to effectively support the coarse\u0002to-fine refinement process, resulting in improved generalization\nand scalability for solving the 2D irregular packing problem.\nWe evaluate our method in two industrial packing domains,\nconsidering only translations. Empirical results demonstrate our\nmethod achieves spatial utilization rates that are either similar to or\nexceed those of teacher packing examples. Furthermore, our method\nscales with polygon count and generalizes to diverse container\nconstraints and polygon shapes within the training distribution.\nIn summary, our contributions are listed as follows:\n\u2022 We propose a score-based generative modeling approach to\ntackle th...",

We expect a fun puzzle. We get a nightmare of Combinatorial Optimization.\nThis year\u2019s edition,**\u201cSanta 2025: The Christmas Tree Packing Challenge,\u201d**is no exception. The goal? Pack $N$ irregular \u201cTree Polygons\u201d into the smallest possible square bounding box for $N=1$ to $200$.\nIf you checked the leaderboard today (Dec 21), you noticed a trend:**Reinforcement Learning (RL) is getting crushed.**\nDespite the massive hype around \u201cReasoning Models\u201d and PPO agents this year, the top 100 teams aren\u2019t using neural networks. They are using 1980s physics simulations. Here is why the \u201cOld School\u201d is winning, and how the pros are using LLMs to cheat the system.\n## The Problem: Why RL Hates \u201cPacking\u201d\nOn paper, this looks like a game.*Place a tree, check for overlap, repeat.*Perfect for a DQN agent, right?\nWrong. The geometry kills the gradient.\n1. **Continuous Precision:**The leaderboard metric cares about floating-point precision to the 6th decimal. RL agents (which output discrete actions or probability distributions) struggle to make the \u201cmicro-adjustments\u201d needed to squeeze a tree into a 0.001mm gap.\n2. **The \u201cCollision\u201d Cliff:**In packing, a move is either valid (reward = 1) or it overlaps by a pixel (reward = -100). This sparse, binary feedback loop makes it nearly impossible for an agent to \u201clearn\u201d a gradient. It doesn\u2019t know*how*to fix the overlap, just that it failed.## The Solution: Simulated Annealing (on Steroids)\nThe \u201cSecret Sauce\u201d currently dominating the leaderboard is**Simulated Annealing (SA)**combined with**Lattice Generation**.\nInstead of training a model to*predict*the position, teams are writing physics engines that*shake*the box.\n* **High Temperature:**Randomly spin and throw trees into the box (Explorer Phase).\n* **Low Temperature:**Jiggle the trees by microscopic amounts to resolve collisions (Exploiter Phase).\nThe best solutions right now use a \u201cHybrid\u201d strategy:\n* **N &lt; 58:**Use Simulated Annealing to find unstructured, chaotic packings.\n* **N &gt; 58:**Switch to \u201cCrystalline Packing\u201d (regular geometric lattices) which is mathematically superior for large numbers.## The Twist: How LLMs are Actually Helping\nIf RL is dead, where is the AI?\nTop competitors aren\u2019t using LLMs to*solve*the puzzle; they are using LLMs to**write the solver**.\nPython is too slow for 10 billion annealing steps. The meta this year is to prompt Gemini 3 or Claude to:\n\u201cRewrite this Python overlap-check function in Rust/C++ with AVX2 vectorization.\u201d\nWe are seeing \u201cHybrid\u201d workflows where the**Human**defines the heuristics, the**LLM**writes the highly optimized C++ kernels, and**Simulated Annealing**does the heavy lifting.\n## The Starter Code: A Simple Annealer\nIf you want to jump in before the January deadline, don\u2019t start with PyTorch. Start here.\nHere is a conceptual snippet for a \u201cPerturbation\u201d mover \u2014the heart of any good annealing solution.\n```\nimport numpy as np\nimport math\ndef anneal(layout, max\\_temps=10000):\n# layout: Array of [x, y, rotation] for N trees\ncurrent\\_score = calculate\\_area(layout)\ntemperature = 1.0\ncooling\\_rate = 0.9995\nfor i in range(max\\_temps):\n# 1. Propose a Move (The &quot;Shake&quot;)\n# We only move ONE tree slightly to save compute\nidx = np.random.randint(0, len(layout))\noriginal\\_pos = layout[idx].copy()\n# Perturb: Move x/y by small amount, rotate slightly\nlayout[idx][0] += np.random.normal(0, temperature)\nlayout[idx][1] += np.random.normal(0, temperature)\nlayout[idx][2] += np.random.normal(0, temperature \\* 10) # Rotate\n# 2. Check Constraints (The &quot;Wall&quot;)\nif check\\_overlap(layout):\n# Revert immediately if invalid\nlayout[idx] = original\\_pos\ncontinue\n# 3. Acceptance Criteria (Metropolis-Hastings)\nnew\\_score = calculate\\_area(layout)\ndelta = new\\_score - current\\_score\n# If better, accept. If worse, accept with prob based on Temp.\nif delta &lt; 0 or math.exp(-delta / temperature) &gt; np.random.rand():\ncurrent\\_score = new\\_score\nelse:\nlayout[idx] = original\\_pos # Revert\n# Cool down\ntemperature \\*= cooling\\_rate\nreturn layout, current\\_score\n# Pro Tip: Ask an LLM to convert &#x27;&#x27;check\\_overlap&#x27;&#x27; to Cython for 100x speed.\n```\nThe competition ends**January 30, 2026**. You have 40 days. Put down the Neural Network and pick up a physics textbook.\n*(****Discussion:****Are you using a Lattice approach or pure Annealing for N=200?

The sixth edition in\n2024 considers a 2-dimensional knapsack packing problem. The team Shadoks won first place\nwith the best solution (among the 14 participating teams) to 75 instances out of 180. In this\npaper, we describe the heuristics we used. We start by briefly describing the problem.\nAn input instance consists of a convex polygon called container and a multiset of items.\nEach item is a simple polygon with an associated integer value. The goal is to pack some of\nthe instance items inside the container using integer translations in order to maximize the\nsum of their values. In total, 180 instances have been given, ranging from 28 to 50,000 items.\nThe instances are of several different types according to the shape and values of the items.\nSome instances have mostly convex items, while other instances have many non-convex items\nsuch as polyominoes. In terms of item values, some items have only unit value, some have\nvalues proportional to the area, and other have random values, for example. Some solutions\nare presented in Figure 1 and more details about the challenge are available in the organizers\u2019\nsurvey paper [3].\nOur general strategy consists of finding a good initial solution (using integer programming\nor a greedy heuristic) and subsequently optimizing them with local search. Our strategy\nshares many common elements with the second place [5], but they did not use integer\nprogramming to obtain initial solutions and their optimization phase is more sophisticated\nthan ours. The third place [4] uses an hierarchical grid approach. The fourth place [1] used\na completely different integer programming model and a genetic algorithm.\nWe describe the algorithms in Section 2 and experimentally analyze their performance\nusing different parameters in Section 3. Our solvers were coded in Python and C++ and\nexecuted on several desktop laptop computers, as well as the LIMOS and LIS clusters.\n2 Algorithms\nWe used two different algorithms to compute initial solutions, a preprocessing phase that\ncan be executed beforehand, and a local search phase to improve the solutions.\n2.1 Integer Programming Approach\nA simple idea to solve the challenge problem is to produce a set V of random translations of\neach item inside the container and then reduce the problem to a kind of maximum weight\nindependent set problem in a graph G = (V, E). Each translated item is a vertex and there\nare two types of edges: (1) an edge between two translations that overlap and (2) translations\nof the same item i form a clique Ci. If all item have quantity one, then this is a traditional\nmaximum weight independent set problem. However, if items have non-unit quantities, then\neach clique Ciis associated with the quantity qi of item i and at most qi vertices of the\nclique are allowed in the solution.\nThis combinatorial problem can easily be modeled as integer programming with one\nbinary variable per vertex. A type-1 edge uv is modeled as u + v \u2264 1 and each clique Ci\nis modeled as P\nv\u2208Ci\nv \u2264 qi. The CPLEX solver [2] can optimally solve graphs with a few\nthousand vertices obtained from the challenge instances, which is not enough to obtain good\nsolutions using uniformly random placements.\nTo obtain better solutions, we start from a solutions S obtained with the aforementioned\nmethod and build a new graph G = (V, E) as follows. Let \u03c3 > 0 be a parameter and N be a\nset of the zero vector and random vectors where each random vector has x and y coordinates\nG. D. da Fonseca and Y. Gerard 84:3\nas Gaussian random variables of average 0 and standard deviation \u03c3. We create a translation\nin V for each item that is placed in S and for each translation vector in N if the translation\nis inside the container. We also create vertices in V using uniform random translations for\nall items. Edges and cliques are created as before, and the new combinatorial problem is\nsolved with CPLEX. We repeat this procedure multiple times using the previous solution S\nand reducing the value of \u03c3 at each step.\nThis method works well for instances with up to 200 items. To handle larger instances,\nwe partition the container using a square grid and partition the items equally among the\ncells. The partition is such that items are grouped by the slope of the longest edge, breaking\nties by the slope of the diameter. Each cell is then solved independently. The intuition to\ngroup items of similar slope together is that they can often be placed in a way that minimizes\nthe wasted space. Since the values of the items do not seem to be related to the slopes, this\napproach works well for the challenge instances.\n2.2 Greedy Heuristic\nThe greedy heuristic starts by creating an initial list L of n grid points inside the container\n(typically n = 1000). The list L is shuffled and we compute its centroid c rounded to integer\ncoordinates. The point c is inserted in the beginning of L. The input items are placed into a\nlist I ordered by decreasing utility, where the utility function is described next. Different\nutility functions may be used (more details in Section 3). The goal is that items of small\narea and high value have high utility while large items with small value have low utility.\nWe then build the packing by considering the items of the list I one by one in order. At\neach step, we have a current packing and a new item i to pack. We first try to pack i at\nthe first grid position g \u2208 L and at a number of random positions around g. If one of these\npositions is availa...",

We also want to thank Dominik Krupke for providing a\nhelpful official validator for solutions.\n1 Introduction\nThe recent CG:SHOP 2024 Challenge introduced a variant of irregular packing problems\nknown as the Maximum Polygon Packing (MPP) problem. The MPP problem involves a\nconvex polygonal container C and a polygon set P = {p1, p2, ..., pN }, where polygon piis\nassociated with a value vi. It seeks for a non-overlapping packing with the maximum total\nvalue. The challenge presents a total of 180 instances whose number of polygons ranges from\n28 to 50,000. The official document [4] gives a detailed description of the challenge.\nOur proposed algorithm employs a general process to solve these instances indiscriminately,\nand the overall framework is presented in Figure 1. We first partition a large-scale problem\ninto multiple small-scale subproblems (Section 2) and then solve each subproblem using\nupper-level polygon ordering (Section 3.1) and lower-level packing optimization techniques\n(Section 3.2). Section 4 presents our experimental results, followed by conclusions.\n1 Corresponding author: Zhouxing Su\n\u00a9 Canhui Luo, Zhouxing Su, and Zhipeng L\u00fc;\nlicensed under Creative Commons License CC-BY 4.0\n40th International Symposium on Computational Geometry (SoCG 2024).\nEditors: Wolfgang Mulzer and Jeff M.

It involves two components: partitioning the container C into\nmultiple regions and assigning polygons to each region.\n2.1 Container Partitioning\nThe container partitioning process consists of two steps, as shown in Figure 2. Initially, we\narrange two-dimensional square grids starting from the bottom-left corner of the bounding\nbox until the entire container is covered. The subregions formed by the intersection of the\ncontainer with all the grids constitute its partition C = C1 \u222a C2 \u222a ... \u222a Cm. Subsequently,\nwe merge the small subregions with adjacent grids, which are difficult to be used effectively.\nThe grid is dimensioned to keep the scale of each subproblem at approximately 300 polygons,\nmaking a trade-off between effectiveness and efficiency of lower-level packing optimization.\n2.2 Polygon Assignment\nWe adopt a simple approach of randomly assigning polygons to each subregion. Specifically, for\neach subregion Ci, we randomly select a polygon pj from P until\nP\nj\narea(pj )\narea(Ci) \u2265\nPN\ni=0\narea(pi)\narea(C)\n.\nThe advantage of random assignment lies in ensuring that the overall characteristics of each\nsubproblem align with the original problem.\nC.

We repeatedly select one remaining polygon with the\nhighest priority (ties are broken by value) and try to insert it into the current solution. If the\ninsertion with lower-level packing optimization fails, we skip the current polygon and turn to\nthe next one. For the majority of instances, the priority is defined as the value-to-area ratio\nof a polygon (we also call it unit value). Polygons with higher unit values are prioritized\nfor putting in the container, which is called the Unit Value First (UVF) strategy. For\nsmall-scale instances (N < 100), we employ the \u03b1\u03b2-random strategy. It randomly selects\n\u03b1% and \u03b2% of the polygons and reassigns their UVF-based priority to the highest and the\nlowest, respectively. These instances are run for multiple times to ensure comprehensive\noptimization, with \u03b1 and \u03b2 set to 10 in our implementation.\n3.2 Lower-Level Packing Optimization\nThe position of a polygon can be represented by the coordinates l = (x, y) of a reference point,\nsuch as the bottom-left corner of the boundary. Then, the translation of a polygon can be\nrepresented by a vector pointing from its original position to its new position. Given a feasible\npacking S and a polygon p to be placed, it is impossible to find a non-overlapping position\nfor p without moving other polygons in most cases. This section introduces the algorithm for\neliminating overlaps for an invalid packing, which involves solving an unconstrained nonlinear\nproblem and heuristic polygon movement.\nS o C G 2 0 2 4\n86:4 A General Heuristic Approach for Maximum Polygon Packing\n3.2.1 Overlap Minimization\nTo determine the appropriate translation for the polygons, we utilized the no-fit polygon\n(NFP) and inner-fit polygon (IFP), which are fundamental in algorithmic approaches to\ngeometric design and optimization challenges. For a fixed polygon pi and a movable polygon\npj , NFP(pi, pj ) describes their non-overlapping positions with boundaries in contact precisely,\nwhich can be utilized to determine the minimum translation for pj to avoid overlap. Similarly,\nIFP(pi, pj ) is employed to determine the minimum translation to place pj inside pi. Figure 3\nillustrates the polygon translations determined using NFP (left) and IFP (right). The readers\nmay refer to Burke et al. [2] for a more detailed description.\nFor a packing S, based on NFP and IFP, we define the overlap between polygons pi\nand pj as fij (S), representing the minimum translation to separate them, and f0i(S) as the\nminimum translation for moving pi to fit into the container. Subsequently, we employ the\nseparation algorithm proposed by Imamichi et al. [7] to minimize the overlap, which involves\nsolving an unconstrained nonlinear programming problem as follows:\nmin\nS\nF(S) = X\n0\u2264i<j\u2264N\nf\n2\nij (S) (1)\nThe model relaxes the non-overlapping constraint but introduces repulsion forces between\nany two overlapped polygons. We use the classic L-BFGS (limited memory BFGS) method\nto solve this problem. It makes the packing S converge to a local optimum but strongly\ndepends on the initial layout. ...",
