      "title": "ANSWER",
      "text": "The available sources do not describe a specific \u201cChebyshev\u2011distance square\u2011packing\u201d algorithm for 2\u2011D polygon packing. What the literature does mention is the **Chebyshev (L\u221e) distance** as a geometric metric that can be used in packing\u2011related calculations. For example, the Wykobi computational\u2011geometry library lists **Chebyshev and inverse\u2011Chebyshev pairwise distances** among the distance measures it supports for points, segments, polygons, etc.\u202f([wykobi.com](https://wykobi.com/features.html)).  \n\nIn general, the Chebyshev distance between two points\u202f\\(p=(x_1,y_1)\\)\u202fand\u202f\\(q=(x_2,y_2)\\)\u202fis defined as  \n\n\\[\nd_{\\infty}(p,q)=\\max\\bigl(|x_1-x_2|,\\;|y_1-y_2|\\bigr),\n\\]\n\nwhich corresponds to the side length of the smallest axis\u2011aligned square that can contain both points. When this metric is employed in a packing routine, the \u201csquare\u2011packing\u201d idea is to surround each polygon (or its bounding box) with a square whose half\u2011side is the Chebyshev distance to the nearest neighbor; non\u2011overlap of these squares guarantees non\u2011overlap of the underlying polygons.  \n\nHowever, none of the searched documents provide a concrete step\u2011by\u2011step description, mathematical formulation, or implementation details of a dedicated **Chebyshev\u2011distance square packing method** for irregular polygon optimization. To obtain a precise definition and algorithmic outline, you would need to consult more specialized sources (e.g., recent conference papers or technical reports on packing heuristics that explicitly adopt the Chebyshev metric).",

We hope that this review could provide guidance for researchers in the field of 2D irregular packing.\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nTwo-dimensional (2D) irregular packing problems are widespread in industries such as machinery manufacturing, aviation, shipbuilding, automobile manufacturing, clothing and furniture manufacturing. An efficient 2D irregular packing algorithm can effectively improve material utilization and reduce processing costs. The reduction in material consumption will also have a beneficial impact on the environment ( [Ke et al., 2020](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B76)). Therefore, research of the packing problem is of great significance for technology and social interest.\n\nThe 2D packing problem is a type of combinatorial optimization problems to locate parts with different shapes compactly in one or more master sheet material to minimize the occupied space or maximize the utilization of the material. The 2D packing problem is currently recognized as a NP problem, which is mainly solved by heuristic algorithms. In recent years, many scholars have conducted research on 2D irregular packing problems with a verity of solutions.\n\nThere exists a number of review articles on packing and cutting problems. We have summarized the main review literature in the field of 2D packing and cutting as shown in [Table 1](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#T1). Brown ( [Brown, 1971](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B17)) introduced an optimum packing and depletion problem with optimization of space and resource usage. Harvey ( [Salkin and De Kluyver, 1975](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B116)) surveyed the application of mathematical optimization models such as linear programming to the knapsack problem. Bruce ( [Golden, 1976](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B50)) surveyed various approaches to the cutting stock problem. Hinxman ( [Hinxman, 1980](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B65)) surveyed the trim-loss and assortment problems, this research paid more attention to cutting and packaging problems in practical applications, and did not mention much about theoretical methods. Garey and Coffman ( [Garey and Johnson, 1981](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B47); [Coffman et al., 1984](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B27)) surveyed the approximation algorithms for bin packing problems. Israni ( [Israni and Sanders, 1982](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B72)) reviewed the 2D cutting stock problem including almost all 2D packaging problems. The author also proposed a rectangular layout method. Sarin ( [Sarin, 1983](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B118)) reviewed methodologies and literature to solve 2D stock cutting problems and introduced an interactive optimization procedure for a general 2D stock cutting problem. Dyckhoff ( [Dyckhoff et al., 1985](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B38)) described a trim loss and related problems and categorized them briefly. Dudzi\u0144ski ( [Dudzi\u0144ski and Walukiewicz, 1987](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B36)) summarized the exact methods for knapsack problems, such as linear programming. Matthias ( [Rode and Rosenberg, 1987](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B114)) analyzed the algorithm for the trim-loss problems. Haessler ( [Haessler and Sweeney, 1991](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B59)) reviewed the solution process of cutting stock problems, including placement algorithm and sequence optimization algorithm. Dowsland ( [Dowsland and Dowsland, 1992](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B34)) reviewed the application of operations research methods to the packing problem and summarized some exact heuristics. Sweeney ( [Sweeney and Paternoster, 1992](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B128)) categorized cutting and packing problems and made application-oriented research records. Cheng ( [Cheng et al., 1994](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B22)) discussed 2D cutting stock problems and their application cases including the pallet loading problem and VLSI placement problem. With the gradual deepening of research on 2D layout problems, typology becomes a common research topic. 2D regular and irregular layout problems are clearly distinguished in practical applications and theoretical methods. Dowsland ( [Dowsland and Dowsland, 1995](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B29)) gave a special review of the 2D irregular nesting problem for the first time. Mavridou ( [Mavridou and Pardalos, 1997](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B98)) summarized applications of the genetic algorithm and simulated annealing algorithm in the optimization of facility layout problems. Dyckhoff ( [Dyckhoff, 1990](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B37)) made a typology of the cutting and packing problems in detail, and W\u00e4scher ( [W\u00e4scher et al., 2007](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B135)) improved the typology later. Hopper ( [Hopper and Turton, 1999](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B67); [Hopper and Turton, 2001a](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B68); [Hopper and Turton, 2001b](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B69)) investigated the application of meta-heuristic and heuristic algorithms in 2D and 3D packing problems. Lodi ( [Lodi et al., 2002a](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B90); [Lodi et al., 2002b](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B91)) reviewed algorithms proposed in the 1990s of 2D packing problems. Bennell et al. ( [Bennell and Oliveira, 2008](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B10); [Bennell and Oliveira, 2009](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B9)) discussed 2D irregular packing problems and related geometric problems. Leao ( [Leao et al., 2020](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B81)) introduced the mathematical models in the 2D irregular packing pr...",

It can be used\nfor self-study or as a textbook for a second probability course with data science\napplications.\nWhy this book?\nData science is evolving rapidly, and probabilistic methods are key to these ad\u0002vances. A typical graduate probability course no longer provides the mathemat\u0002ical sophistication needed for early-career data science researchers. This book\naims to fill that gap, presenting essential probabilistic methods and results for\nmathematical data scientists.\nWhat is this book about?\nHigh-dimensional probability studies random objects in R\nn \u2013 like random vec\u0002tors and matrices \u2013 where the dimension n can be very large. This book builds\nsome foundational tools for analyzing such objects, including concentration in\u0002equalities, covering and packing, decoupling and symmetrization, chaining and\ncomparison for stochastic processes, empirical processes, VC theory, and more.\nThe theory is integrated with applications to covariance estimation, semidef\u0002inite programming, networks, elements of statistical learning, error-correcting\ncodes, clustering, dimension reduction, and more.\nThis book covers only a fraction of high-dimensional probability, with just a\nfew data science examples. Each chapter ends with a Notes section that points\nto other resources on the topic.\nAre you ready?\nTo read this book, you will need a solid knowledge of probability theory (at the\nmasters or doctoral level), strong undergraduate linear algebra, and some famil\u0002iarity with metric, normed, and Hilbert spaces. Measure theory is not required.\nExercises and hints\nEach chapter ends with exercises, most of which have hints in the back of the\nbook. The difficulty of exercises is indicated by coffee cups you need to solve\nvi\nPreface to the Second Edition vii\nthem, ranging from trivial (K) to challenging (KKKK). If you are studying this\nbook on your own, make sure to work through the exercises \u2013 they will help build\nyour skills and reveal many extra storylines you won\u2019t find in the main text!\nWhat\u2019s new in the second edition?\nI thoroughly revised the book with the student \u2014 you \u2014 in mind. The text is\nnow better suited for beginners: more streamlined, self-contained, and focused.\nHere are the major updates:\n1. This edition adds 200 new exercises, many covering tools and applications\nbeyond the main text \u2013 such as expanders, Le Cam\u2019s method, entropy, the\ncut norm and its semidefinite relaxation, Gaussian mixture models, matrix\nsketching, the nuclear norm, one-bit quantization, the small ball method,\nLasso regression, and much more.\n2. All exercises have been moved to the end of each chapter. The book is now\nmore self-contained and the material flows more smoothly.\n3. Hints are now more extensive and are provided for most nontrivial problems.\n4. To help beginners, Chapter 1 (on analysis and probability) has been signif\u0002icantly expanded and Section 4.1 (on linear algebra) fully rewritten.\n5. The final three chapters are now merged into a streamlined Chapter 9, with\nminimal content loss.\n6. The entire text has been revised for a friendlier tone and clearer focus.\nBut it\u2019s still the same book. I worked hard to keep it thin \u2013 short enough for one\nsemester or so.\nAcknowledgements\nThe feedback from many colleagues and students was instrumental in shaping\nthis book and its second edition.

The target is to arrange a specified \ncollection of pieces with irregular shapes into a minimal number of bins. Firstly, we develop a \nmathematical model for the 2DIBPP that considers slit distance and free rotation of the pieces, and \nan equidistant edge expansion approach is then proposed to handle the slit distance. Secondly, a \ntwo-stage method is implemented to get a finite collection of promising rotation angles, effectively \ndecreasing the search neighbourhood. Thirdly, we decompose the 2DIBPP into two sub-problems: \npiece assignment and packing. The Partial Bin Packing (PBP) strategy is employed in the allocation \nstage, and we adopt an overlap minimization method to pack the pieces into an individual bin. \nFinally, we use a local search (LS) algorithm to advance the quality of the solutions by adjusting \nthe piece assignment across bins. Experimental evidence exhibits that our approach is competitive \nin most instances of the literature, with four better results in five benchmark instances. \n\u00a9 2022 by the authors; licensee Growing Science, Canada\nKeywords: \n2DIBPP \nSlit distance \nFree rotation \nEquidistant edge expansion \napproach \nOverlap minimization method \nLS algorithm \n1. Introduction \nSteel production causes about 6% of manufactured CO2 emissions yearly, and one ton of steel production emits about 1.8 tons \nof CO2 (Quader et al., 2016). Improving material utilisation can help reduce steel production and CO2 emission, which in turn \ndo a favour to combat global climate change. Additionally, recently there has been a high level of steel waste and low material\nutilisation in manufacturing, which is detrimental to the sustainable development of enterprises and the environment. \nManufacturing enterprises use various pieces in production, mainly produced through the packing and cutting process. As is \nwell known, piece packing and cutting problems are widespread in industries such as shipbuilding, textiles and glass, where \npacking is the basis for cutting, and the generation of highly utilisable packing solutions is the key to material saving. \nTherefore, it is of great importance to research the piece packing problem. The two-dimensional irregular piece packing \nproblem can be divided into the strip packing problem (2DISPP) (Umetani & Murakami, 2022; Elkeran, 2013; Pinheiro et al., \n2016) and the bin packing problem (2DIBPP) (Martinez-Sykora et al., 2017; Abeysooriya et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2022; Liu \net al., 2020). Although the packing problem has received considerable attention, most studies have been carried out on the \n2DISPP. This problem aims to pack pieces within a strip stock sheet accompanying infinite length and fixed width to obtain \nthe shortest packing length. During the packing process, the following two constraints should be met together: (1) The pieces \ndo not overlap; (2) The pieces cannot exceed the contour of the stock sheet. Given this problem, scholars have made numerous \nresearch achievements. Umetani and Murakami (2022) proposed a dual scanline representation to solve the 2DISPP of \nrasterized patterns and developed coordinate descent heuristics for the raster model. An optimization method incorporating \nthe cuckoo search and guided local search was proposed by Elkeran (2013). A pairwise clustering approach was introduced \n 492\nto group identical polygons together. Pinheiro et al. (2016) proposed a random key genetic algorithm (RKGA) combined with \nthe Bottom-Left (BL) (Jakobs, 1996) algorithm to solve the packing problem. Meanwhile, a compression algorithm running \nin RKGA was proposed to improve the local solution quality. In addition, some scholars have attempted to use mathematical \nprogramming methods to solve the 2DISPP. These models were composed of mixed integer programming (MIP) models with \nlinear objective functions and mixed integer constraints (Alvarez-Valdes et al., 2013; Cherri et al., 2016; Leao et al., 2016; \nRodrigues & Toledo, 2017; Bennell et al., 2018) and non-linear programming models with non-linear objective \nfunctions(Cherri et al., 2016; Leao et al., 2020). However, the limitation of these models was obvious, as these models could \nonly solve small-scale piece packing problems and were not able to help with a larger number of pieces. Moreover, solving \nthe programming models was costly in terms of time. For more detailed information, please look up the literature (Leao et al., \n2020), which describes various programming models for solving the packing problem. \nAs to the 2DIBPP, pieces need to be packed into several bins of fixed length and width, satisfying the two constraints like \n2DISPP, aiming to obtain the minimum number of bins and the optimal solution. This problem is common in industrial \nproduction and has applications in several enterprises. Bennell et al. (2018) proposed a beam search algorithm and successfully \napplied it to multi-bin and single-bin size instances. Still, the limitation was evident because it could only handle convex \npieces and was solely adapted to the guillotine cutting process. However, this study did not allow the pieces to rotate. Some \nstudies allowed pieces to rotate by a limited number of special angles (Zhang et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2020), such as 90\u00ba, 180\u00ba \nand 270\u00ba. Zhang et al. (2022) introduced a waste least first decreasing (WLFD) scheme to allot pieces and used a greedy \nmethod to exchange pieces between two bins. In addition, a hot start along with an iterative doubling search strategy was \nsubmitted to accelerate the packing. A heuristic algorithm was used by Liu et al. (2020) to solve the 2DIBPP, in which a First \nFit Decreasing (FFD) strategy was utilised to distribute pieces to bins. As far as we know, up to now, only two studies \n(Martinez-Sykora et al., 2017; Abeysooriya et al., 2018) allowed pieces to rotate freely. Martinez-Sykora et al. (2017) \ncompared five methods of assigning pieces and used the MIP model to pack the pieces into bins. Abeysooriya et al. (2018) \nconsidered piece allocation and packing together and introduced the Jostle strategy to the 2DIBPP for the first time. What is \nmore, a diversification mechanism was introduced to improve the Jostle method\u2019s performance. \nThe above literature has achieved many achievements based on heuristic algorithms and mathematical programming models. \nHowever, most of these have been done based on arranging pieces as closely as possible to produce a solution without \nconsidering actual manufacturing parameters. When we study the packing problem, it is valuable to consider the actual \nmanufacturing parameters rather than only the geometry of pieces (Anand & Babu, 2015). In the piece cutting process, as the \ncutting machine\u2019s cutter has a definite width, to escape damaging the pieces, a specified distance needs to be reserved between\npieces and between pieces and the edges of th...",

The goal of this optimization problem is to place a set of irregular\npolygons onto a material sheet without overlapping and in a way that minimizes wasted\nmaterial.\nIn this thesis, we delve into a fast 2D packing algorithm that automatically arranges\nparts of a user\u2019s design onto their available material sheets to provide live feedback on\nhow much material they have left. To do this, we make use of the concept of the no fit\npolygon to generate candidate placements, and we utilize custom heuristics and performance\noptimization to improve packing quality and runtime .\nOur technical evaluation shows that the implementation is fast enough to work at\ninteractive speeds and produce solutions of similar quality to other tools and algorithms that\nperform automated packing.\nThesis Supervisor: Stefanie Mueller\nTitle: Assistant Professor\n3\n4\nAcknowledgments\nFirst of all, I would like to extend my deepest gratitude to my advisor, Professor Stefanie\nMueller. She has been especially supportive during these trying times and has always been\navailable to give guidance and instruction. I would also like to give the hugest of thank yous\nto Ticha Sethapakdi and Daniel Anderson without whom this thesis could not have been\npossible. Ticha was the mastermind of Fabricaide and its user interface, and also somehow\nsimultaneously manages to be one of the coolest and one of the most awkward people I\nknow. Dan was always available to provide guidance and support in wrangling with C++\nand other difficult aspects of the implementation. Even outside the context of working on\nFabricaide, Ticha and Dan have been great friends and role models throughout the time I\ngot to know them. I could not have asked for a better group of mentors and colleagues than\nProfessor Mueller, Ticha and Dan.\nI am extremely grateful to my friends and family both here in the MIT community as\nwell as back home in the Philippines all the way at the other side of the world. I am thankful\nfor all the love and concern I\u2019ve received from them in spite of current circumstances.\nFinally, I would like to thank the rest of the Human Computer Interaction Engineering\nGroup for creative such a fun and welcoming environment. Be it sharing and discussing\nideas during lab meetings or hitting the dance floor with Just Dance for celebrations, I have\nnever had a boring moment with this great group of people.\nLanguage and Figure Note\nThroughout this thesis, I use the word \u201cwe\u201d to signify that this work has been a group effort.\nHowever, the work that is provided in detail is my own.
