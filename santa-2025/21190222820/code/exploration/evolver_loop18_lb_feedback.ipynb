    "## Strategic Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Has Been Exhausted\n",
    "1. **SA-based optimization** - All converge to same local optimum\n",
    "2. **Grid-based approaches** - Fundamentally worse than baseline\n",
    "3. **Ensemble of public solutions** - All at same optimum\n",
    "4. **Incremental improvements** - Too slow (0.00001 per run)\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Hasn't Been Fully Explored\n",
    "1. **Asymmetric solutions** - Discussion with 34 votes suggests this is key\n",
    "2. **Different initial configurations** - Not grid-based, not from public solutions\n",
    "3. **Crystalline packing** - 17 plane-group symmetries not explored\n",
    "4. **Large N focus** - 52% of score comes from N=100-200\n",
    "\n",
    "### Critical Insight\n",
    "The target (68.92) is 2.48% below our best (70.63). This is NOT achievable by:\n",
    "- Running more SA iterations\n",
    "- Trying different SA parameters\n",
    "- Ensembling existing solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "It IS achievable by finding a fundamentally different packing structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "1. **Research asymmetric solutions** - What makes them better?\n",
    "2. **Generate novel initial configurations** - Not from public sources\n",
    "3. **Focus on large N** - Where most score comes from\n",
    "4. **Try different symmetry groups** - Not just 0°, 90°, 180°, 270°"
