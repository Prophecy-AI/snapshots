  "seed_prompt": "# Christmas Tree Packing Optimization - Techniques Guide\n\n## Problem Overview\nThis is a 2D geometric packing optimization problem: pack Christmas tree shapes (15-vertex polygons) into the smallest square bounding box for configurations of n=1 to 200 trees. The score is the sum of normalized areas: \u03a3(s\u00b2/n) where s is the side length of the bounding square. **Lower is better.** Target score to beat: **68.954209**\n\n## Data Understanding\n**Reference notebooks for data characteristics:**\n- See `../research/kernels/inversion_santa-2025-getting-started/santa-2025-getting-started.ipynb` for tree geometry definition and basic greedy algorithm\n- See `exploration/eda.ipynb` for submission structure analysis\n- Tree shape: 3-tier triangular tree with trunk (15 vertices)\n- Dimensions: trunk_w=0.15, trunk_h=0.2, base_w=0.7, mid_w=0.4, top_w=0.25, tip_y=0.8\n- Each tree has position (x, y) and rotation angle (deg)\n- Coordinates must be in range [-100, 100]\n- Total rows in submission: 20,100 = sum(1 to 200)\n\n## Core Optimization Approaches\n\n### 1. Greedy Placement Algorithms\n- **Bottom-left strategy**: Place trees one by one, moving from far away toward center until collision\n- **Weighted angle generation**: Use `abs(sin(2*angle))` distribution to favor diagonal placements (45\u00b0, 135\u00b0, etc.) - this helps fill square corners better\n- **Multi-start**: Try 10+ random starting angles per tree, keep the best placement\n- **Step refinement**: Use coarse steps (0.5) to find collision, then fine steps (0.05) to back up\n- **Lowest-gravity-center policy**: Place piece at position with lowest gravity center (results in flatter boundaries)\n\n### 2. Rotation Tightening (fix_direction)\nAfter placing all trees, optimize the rotation of the entire configuration:\n- Extract all polygon vertices and compute ConvexHull\n- Use `scipy.optimize.minimize_scalar` to find optimal rotation angle (0-90\u00b0)\n- Objective: minimize max(width, height) of axis-aligned bounding box\n- Apply rotation to all tree positions and angles\n- This can significantly reduce bounding box size without changing relative positions\n\n### 3. External Optimizer (bbox3)\nTop solutions use a compiled binary optimizer with parameters:\n- `-n`: number of iterations (typical: 1000-2000)\n- `-r`: radius parameter (typical: 30-96)\n- Multi-phase approach:\n  - Phase A: Short runs (2 min) with many (n, r) combinations to find promising settings\n  - Phase B: Medium runs (10 min) on top candidates\n  - Phase C: Long runs (20 min) on best few\n- Always validate and revert if score regresses\n\n### 4. Local Search and Meta-heuristics\n- **Swap neighborhoods**: Exchange positions of two trees\n- **Translation neighborhoods**: Move single tree to new position\n- **Simulated annealing**: Control temperature for accepting worse solutions\n- **Tabu search**: Avoid revisiting recent configurations\n- **Jostle algorithm**: Iteratively compact placement by small perturbations\n- **Nonlinear programming**: Use NLP to minimize overlap during search\n\n### 5. No-Fit Polygon (NFP) - Advanced Technique\nThe NFP represents all positions a moving polygon can occupy relative to a fixed polygon without overlapping:\n- Pre-compute NFP for each pair of tree orientations\n- Replace costly pairwise overlap tests with simple point-in-polygon checks\n- Reduces computational complexity from O(nm+n+m) to O(k) for overlap detection\n- Methods: Minkowski sum, orbital/trace-line sliding\n- Handles degenerate cases: holes, interlocking concavities, jigsaw-type pieces\n\n## Collision Detection (Critical for Performance)\n\n### Shapely-based Detection\n```python\nfrom shapely.strtree import STRtree\nfrom shapely.geometry import Polygon\n\n# Build spatial index for efficient queries\ntree_index = STRtree(polygons)\n\n# Check for overlaps\nfor i, poly in enumerate(polygons):\n    indices = tree_index.query(poly)\n    for idx in indices:\n        if idx != i:\n            if poly.intersects(polygons[idx]) and not poly.touches(polygons[idx]):\n                # Overlap detected!\n```\n\n### High Precision Arithmetic\n- Use `Decimal` with precision 25-30 for coordinates\n- Scale factor of 1e15 to 1e18 for internal calculations\n- Round to 6 decimal places for submission\n\n## Overlap Repair Strategy\nWhen optimization creates overlapping configurations:\n1. Validate all n-configurations (1 to 200)\n2. For any configuration with overlaps, replace with known-good baseline\n3. Keep best submission and revert on regressions\n4. Use donor file approach: copy valid configurations from baseline\n\n## Submission Format\n- Values must be prefixed with 's' (e.g., \"s0.123456\")\n- Format: `id,x,y,deg` where id is `NNN_T` (N=tree count, T=tree index)\n- Coordinates constrained to [-100, 100]\n\n## Optimization Strategy\n\n### For Small n (1-20)\n- These contribute most to score (s\u00b2/n with small n)\n- Worth spending more time on optimal placement\n- Consider exhaustive search for very small n\n\n### For Large n (100-200)\n- Approximate circular packing becomes more efficient\n- Focus on overall compactness rather than individual optimization\n- Rotation tightening has larger impact\n\n### Incremental Building\n- Build n-tree configuration from (n-1)-tree configuration\n- Reuse previous placements and add one tree\n- This ensures consistency across configurations\n\n## Key Techniques from Top Kernels\n\n1. **Multi-phase optimization**: Start with quick exploration, then focus on promising regions\n2. **Rotation optimization**: Always apply fix_direction after placement\n3. **Validation loop**: Score \u2192 Validate \u2192 Repair \u2192 Repeat\n4. **Parameter tuning**: Different (n, r) parameters work better for different tree counts\n5. **Time budgeting**: Allocate more time to configurations that contribute most to score\n\n## Implementation Tips\n\n1. Use Shapely for polygon operations (affinity.rotate, affinity.translate)\n2. Implement efficient collision detection with STRtree spatial indexing\n3. Track best score and always keep backup of best submission\n4. Log progress to monitor optimization\n5. Consider parallel processing for independent configurations\n6. Use convex hull for fast bounding box calculations\n\n## Algorithm Families for 2D Irregular Packing (from literature)\n\n1. **Geometric heuristics**: Bottom-left, shelf-packing, jostle/collision-free region\n2. **Local search + hybrid meta-heuristics**: Outperform older methods, especially with arbitrary rotations\n3. **Genetic algorithms**: Shape-based crossover, adaptive cooling schedules\n4. **Approximation algorithms**: For convex polygons, polynomial-time with constant-factor guarantees\n5. **Two-level/collision-free region methods**: Hierarchical scheme for efficient placement\n\n## Expected Score Improvements\n- Baseline greedy: ~75-80\n- With rotation tightening: ~70-72\n- With bbox3 optimization: ~68-69\n- With extensive tuning: <68\n\n## Reference Kernels\n- `../research/kernels/inversion_santa-2025-getting-started/` - Basic greedy algorithm, tree geometry\n- `../research/kernels/yongsukprasertsuk_santa-2025-best-keeping-bbox3-runner/` - Multi-phase bbox3 optimization\n- `../research/kernels/saspav_santa-submission/` - Rotation tightening (fix_direction)\n- `../research/kernels/jazivxt_why-not/` - Overlap repair, crystallization analysis\n",
