## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.615745 from exp_004 (snapshot 21329067673)
- Best LB score: 70.647327 (exp_002 - previous baseline)
- Target: 68.888293 | Gap to target: 1.727 points (2.4%)

## Key Discovery This Loop
**ENSEMBLE APPROACH IS THE PATH FORWARD!**

Different snapshots have different optimal solutions for different N values:
- Snapshot 21329067673: 70.615745 (best valid, 1 tiny overlap at N=166)
- Snapshot 21145966992: 70.572798 (best overall BUT has many overlaps - invalid)
- Current baseline 21328309254: 70.647327

The jonathanchan kernel shows the winning approach: combine best solutions from MULTIPLE sources for each N value. This is how top competitors achieve scores in the 68-69 range.

## Response to Evaluator
The evaluator correctly identified that single-solution optimization has hit a wall. Three experiments (bbox3, sa_fast, fix_direction) all showed essentially zero improvement. The evaluator recommended the ENSEMBLE approach, which I have now validated:

1. **Confirmed**: Different snapshots have different optimal solutions for different N values
2. **Confirmed**: Snapshot 21329067673 is 0.032 points better than our baseline
3. **Challenge**: The best-scoring snapshot (21145966992 at 70.572798) has overlaps and is invalid
4. **Opportunity**: If we can ensemble valid solutions from multiple snapshots, we can improve further

## Recommended Approaches (Priority Order)

### 1. **[HIGHEST PRIORITY] Submit exp_004 to verify LB score**
Snapshot 21329067673 scores 70.615745 locally with only 1 tiny overlap (9.77e-34 area).
This should pass Kaggle validation and give us a 0.032 improvement.

### 2. **[HIGH PRIORITY] Implement per-N ensemble from valid snapshots**
```python
# For each N from 1 to 200:
#   1. Load N configuration from each VALID snapshot
#   2. Compute score for each
#   3. Keep the best one that has NO overlaps
#   4. Combine into final submission

# Valid snapshots to use (0 overlaps in sample):
valid_snapshots = [
    '21329067673',  # 70.615745
    '21328310479',  # 70.615745 (but 11 overlaps)
    '21329068588',  # 70.622435 (0 overlaps)
    '21198925328',  # 70.624381
    # ... and 80+ more with 0 sample overlaps
]
```

### 3. **[MEDIUM PRIORITY] Fix overlapping solutions**
The best-scoring snapshot (21145966992 at 70.572798) has overlaps. If we can:
- Identify which N values have overlaps
- Replace those N values with valid solutions from other snapshots
- We could potentially get close to 70.57 score

### 4. **[LOWER PRIORITY] Fractional translation refinement**
After ensembling, apply fractional translation (0.001, 0.0005, etc.) to squeeze out additional improvements. This is what the jonathanchan kernel does after ensembling.

## What NOT to Try
- ❌ bbox3, sa_fast_v2, or any pre-compiled binary (already proven ineffective)
- ❌ fix_direction rotation tightening (baseline already optimally rotated)
- ❌ Single-solution optimization (stuck at local optimum)

## Validation Notes
- CV = LB perfectly (confirmed by exp_002)
- Overlaps are the main risk - Kaggle uses stricter validation
- Use high-precision Decimal arithmetic with scale_factor = 1e15 for overlap checking

## SUBMISSION STRATEGY
- Remaining submissions: 92
- **SUBMIT exp_004 NOW** - we have abundant submissions and need LB feedback
- If exp_004 passes, implement per-N ensemble for further improvement

## Next Experiment Plan
1. Submit exp_004 (snapshot 21329067673) to verify 70.615745 on LB
2. If it passes, implement per-N ensemble:
   - Load all valid snapshots
   - For each N, pick the best valid solution
   - Validate no overlaps in final submission
   - Submit ensemble
3. If ensemble works, apply fractional translation refinement
