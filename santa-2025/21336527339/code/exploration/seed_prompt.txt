# Christmas Tree Packing Optimization - Techniques Guide

## Problem Overview
This is a 2D geometric packing optimization problem: pack Christmas tree shapes (15-vertex polygons) into the smallest square bounding box for configurations of n=1 to 200 trees. The score is the sum of normalized areas: Σ(s²/n) where s is the side length of the bounding square. **Lower is better.** Target score to beat: **68.888293**

## Data Understanding
**Reference notebooks for data characteristics:**
- See `../research/kernels/inversion_santa-2025-getting-started/santa-2025-getting-started.ipynb` for tree geometry definition and basic greedy algorithm
- Tree shape: 3-tier triangular tree with trunk (15 vertices)
- Dimensions: trunk_w=0.15, trunk_h=0.2, base_w=0.7, mid_w=0.4, top_w=0.25, tip_y=0.8
- Each tree has position (x, y) and rotation angle (deg)
- Coordinates must be in range [-100, 100]
- Total rows in submission: 20,100 = sum(1 to 200)

## Insights from Discussions (MANDATORY)
- Discussion "Why the winning solutions will be Asymmetric" (39 votes): Asymmetric solutions outperform symmetric ones based on 24 CPU experiments
- Discussion "Interactive Editor" (58 votes): Manual editing tool available for fine-tuning placements
- Discussion "Expected Leaderboard Progression" (20 votes): Staff guidance on expected score ranges
- Discussion "Where do these high-scoring CSVs originate from?" (13 votes): Top solutions come from extensive optimization runs

## What Discussions Say DOESN'T Work
- Simple greedy placement alone (scores ~75-80, far from target)
- Symmetric/lattice-based arrangements (asymmetric is better)
- Short optimization runs (need extensive multi-phase optimization)

## ⛔ BLOCKED AFTER BASELINE (exp_000)
After getting baseline score, the following are PERMANENTLY FORBIDDEN:
- Running bbox3, sa_fast_v2, eazy_optimizer, or ANY pre-compiled binary
- "More iterations" or "different parameters" on existing optimizers
- Ensembling outputs from the same optimizer

## ✅ REQUIRED: IMPLEMENT FROM SCRATCH
All experiments after baseline MUST implement a novel algorithm:
1. **No-Fit Polygon (NFP)** - precompute collision-free regions in Python
2. **Branch-and-bound** - exhaustive search for small N (1-20)
3. **Genetic algorithm** - evolve population with custom operators
4. **Constraint programming** - model as CSP
5. **Bottom-left heuristic** - construct placements deterministically
6. **Jostle algorithm** - iteratively compact placement by small perturbations

DO NOT USE PRE-COMPILED BINARIES. IMPLEMENT THE ALGORITHM.

## Core Optimization Approaches

### 1. Greedy Placement Algorithms
- **Bottom-left strategy**: Place trees one by one, moving from far away toward center until collision
- **Weighted angle generation**: Use `abs(sin(2*angle))` distribution to favor diagonal placements (45°, 135°, etc.) - this helps fill square corners better
- **Multi-start**: Try 10+ random starting angles per tree, keep the best placement
- **Step refinement**: Use coarse steps (0.5) to find collision, then fine steps (0.05) to back up
- **Lowest-gravity-center policy**: Place piece at position with lowest gravity center (results in flatter boundaries)

### 2. Rotation Tightening (fix_direction)
After placing all trees, optimize the rotation of the entire configuration:
- Extract all polygon vertices and compute ConvexHull
- Use `scipy.optimize.minimize_scalar` to find optimal rotation angle (0-90°)
- Objective: minimize max(width, height) of axis-aligned bounding box
- Apply rotation to all tree positions and angles
- This can significantly reduce bounding box size without changing relative positions

### 3. No-Fit Polygon (NFP) - ADVANCED TECHNIQUE (IMPLEMENT THIS!)
The NFP is a powerful tool for efficient collision detection in irregular shape packing:
- **Definition**: NFP represents all positions a moving polygon can occupy relative to a fixed polygon without overlapping
- **Benefit**: Reduces overlap detection from O(nm+n+m) to O(k) point-in-polygon test
- **Methods**: Minkowski sum, orbital/sliding algorithm, trace-line segments
- **Implementation**: Pre-compute NFP for each pair of tree orientations (discretize rotations)
- **Usage**: Replace costly pairwise overlap tests with simple point-in-polygon checks

**NFP Generation Algorithm (Sliding/Orbital Method):**
1. Place orbiting polygon B touching fixed polygon A
2. Slide B around A's boundary, tracing reference point
3. The traced path forms the NFP boundary
4. Handle degenerate cases: holes, interlocking concavities, jigsaw-type pieces

### 4. Local Search and Meta-heuristics
- **Swap neighborhoods**: Exchange positions of two trees
- **Translation neighborhoods**: Move single tree to new position
- **Simulated annealing**: Control temperature for accepting worse solutions
- **Tabu search**: Avoid revisiting recent configurations
- **Jostle algorithm**: Iteratively compact placement by small perturbations
- **Nonlinear programming**: Use NLP to minimize overlap during search

### 5. Genetic Algorithm Approach
- **Chromosome**: Sequence of tree placements (order + rotation angles)
- **Crossover**: Order-based crossover preserving relative positions
- **Mutation**: Random rotation changes, position perturbations
- **Fitness**: Bounding box side length (minimize)
- **Selection**: Tournament selection with elitism

## Collision Detection (Critical for Performance)

### Shapely-based Detection
```python
from shapely.strtree import STRtree
from shapely.geometry import Polygon

# Build spatial index for efficient queries
tree_index = STRtree(polygons)

# Check for overlaps
for i, poly in enumerate(polygons):
    indices = tree_index.query(poly)
    for idx in indices:
        if idx != i:
            if poly.intersects(polygons[idx]) and not poly.touches(polygons[idx]):
                # Overlap detected!
```

### High Precision Arithmetic
- Use `Decimal` with precision 25-30 for coordinates
- Scale factor of 1e15 to 1e18 for internal calculations
- Round to 6 decimal places for submission

## Overlap Repair Strategy
When optimization creates overlapping configurations:
1. Validate all n-configurations (1 to 200)
2. For any configuration with overlaps, replace with known-good baseline
3. Keep best submission and revert on regressions
4. Use donor file approach: copy valid configurations from baseline

## Submission Format
- Values must be prefixed with 's' (e.g., "s0.123456")
- Format: `id,x,y,deg` where id is `NNN_T` (N=tree count, T=tree index)
- Coordinates constrained to [-100, 100]

## Optimization Strategy by N-range

### For Small n (1-20) - HIGH PRIORITY
- These contribute most to score (s²/n with small n)
- Worth spending more time on optimal placement
- Consider exhaustive search or branch-and-bound
- Each configuration is independent - can be optimized in parallel

### For Medium n (21-100)
- Balance between exhaustive search and heuristics
- Genetic algorithm or simulated annealing work well
- Use NFP for efficient collision detection

### For Large n (100-200)
- Approximate circular packing becomes more efficient
- Focus on overall compactness rather than individual optimization
- Rotation tightening has larger impact

## Key Techniques from Top Kernels

1. **Multi-phase optimization**: Start with quick exploration, then focus on promising regions
2. **Rotation optimization**: Always apply fix_direction after placement
3. **Validation loop**: Score → Validate → Repair → Repeat
4. **Parameter tuning**: Different parameters work better for different tree counts
5. **Time budgeting**: Allocate more time to configurations that contribute most to score

## Algorithm Families for 2D Irregular Packing (from academic literature)

1. **Geometric heuristics**: Bottom-left, shelf-packing, jostle/collision-free region
2. **Local search + hybrid meta-heuristics**: Outperform older methods, especially with arbitrary rotations
3. **Genetic algorithms**: Shape-based crossover, adaptive cooling schedules
4. **Approximation algorithms**: For convex polygons, polynomial-time with constant-factor guarantees
5. **Two-level/collision-free region methods**: Hierarchical scheme for efficient placement
6. **Hybrid GA + Linear Programming**: Combines evolutionary search with exact optimization

## Expected Score Improvements
- Baseline greedy: ~75-80
- With rotation tightening: ~70-72
- With extensive optimization: ~68-69
- With novel algorithms (NFP, GA, etc.): <68

## CRITICAL: Start from Best Available Solution
Check `/home/nonroot/snapshots/santa-2025/` for pre-optimized solutions. Use the best one as baseline rather than starting from scratch.

Start with a simple baseline following this strategy. Reference the notebooks mentioned for data understanding.
