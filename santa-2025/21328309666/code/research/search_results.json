      "text": "In tackling 2D bin packing optimization problems, Kaggle winners often employ strategies to escape local optima by integrating advanced heuristics, metaheuristics, and hybrid approaches. One common method involves using local search heuristics, such as space defragmentation techniques, which aim to reduce fragmentation of free space within bins, thereby enabling the packing of additional items and improving overall solution quality ([Zhaoyi Zhang et al., 2011](https://ijcai.org/Proceedings/11/Papers/123.pdf)). These heuristics can be combined with metaheuristic algorithms like genetic algorithms or simulated annealing, which help explore the solution space more broadly and avoid stagnation in local optima ([Luis Miguel Costa, 2015](https://doi.org/10.24840/2183-6493_001.001_0005)).\n\nFurthermore, some approaches involve adaptive or hyper-heuristic frameworks that learn to combine multiple simple heuristics dynamically, selecting the most promising strategies based on the current state of the search process ([Hyper-Heuristics, 2010](https://www.academia.edu/72696415/Hyper_Heuristics_Learning_to_Combine_Simple_Heuristics_in_Bin_Packing_Problem)). These methods enable the algorithm to adapt to different problem instances and escape local optima by shifting between heuristics that focus on different aspects of the packing problem. Additionally, techniques like space defragmentation and solution space restructuring\u2014such as bin shuffling or pushing items along axes\u2014are employed to create more favorable configurations, thus facilitating the discovery of better solutions and avoiding entrapment in local minima ([Zhaoyi Zhang et al., 2011](https://ijcai.org/Proceedings/11/Papers/123.pdf)). Overall, the combination of local search, metaheuristics, and adaptive heuristics forms a robust toolkit for Kaggle winners to navigate complex solution landscapes in 2D bin packing problems.",

This study proposes a defragmenta\u0002tion technique to combine the fragmented space\ninto a continuous usable space, which potentially\nallows the packing of additional items. We illus\u0002trate the effectiveness of this technique on the two\u0002and three-dimensional Bin Packing Problems. In\nconjunction with a bin shuffling strategy for incre\u0002mental improvement, our resultant algorithm out\u0002performs all leading meta-heuristic approaches.\n1 Introduction\nPacking and cutting problems have wide practical applica\u0002tions and many variants have been extensively studied, espe\u0002cially the packing and cutting of rectangular two- and three\u0002dimensional items. They model many industrial applications,\nsuch as the packing of cargo for shipment and the cutting of\nsheets of metal, glass, paper or other materials. Although\nthe many variants of packing and cutting problems differ in\nobjectives and have their own unique challenges, the multi\u0002dimensional variants (i.e., greater than 1-D) share one com\u0002monality: denser packings tend to lead to higher quality solu\u0002tions. A common obstacle to obtaining a dense packing is the\nfragmentation of unutilized (free) space into multiple small\nparts that are too small to hold any items and are therefore\nunusable.\nIn this study, we address the space fragmentation issue by\ndesigning two space defragmentation operations. The opera\u0002tions are based on the concept of pushing loaded items along\nan axis in order to leave sufficient free space for an incoming\nitem. The distance that a loaded item can be pushed along an\naxis can be computed using a comparability graph representa\u0002tion of the packing pattern for each axis; we show how these\noperations can be performed in O(n2) time without explicitly\nconstructing the graphs.\nWe use the three-dimensional bin packing problem (3D\u0002BPP) as the target problem in order to illustrate the con\u0002cept of space defragmentation. Our experiments on standard\n\u2217Corresponding Author\nbenchmark problems show that by incorporating our space\ndefragmentation operations into the extreme point insertion\nconstructive heuristic for 3D-BPP, we can obtain solutions\nthat are comparable to those achieved by the leading existing\nmeta-heuristic approaches for the problem in a fraction of the\ntime. With the addition of a simple incremental improvement\nprocedure using bin shuffling, our algorithm outperforms all\nexisting techniques by a significant amount for both the two\u0002dimensional bin packing problem (2D-BPP) and 3D-BPP.\nThe 3D-BPP analyzed in this paper is defined as follows.\nWe are given n items that are 3D rectangular boxes, and an\nunlimited number of identical bins with dimensions L\u00d7W \u00d7\nH. The dimensions of the i-th item, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n, is denoted by\nli \u00d7 wi \u00d7 hi, and we assume that the boxes cannot be rotated.\nThe aim is to load all n items into bins such that:\n\u2022 Placement is orthogonal (i.e., axis-aligned)\n\u2022 Every item must be completely inside a bin\n\u2022 Any two items inside the same bin must be interior\u0002disjoint (i.e., non-overlapping)\n\u2022 The number of bins used is minimized.\nBin packing problems of dimensions other than three can\nbe defined similarly. We assume that bins are placed in the\nfirst octant of a Cartesian coordinate system with one corner\nat the origin. The length L of the bin is parallel to the X-axis,\nthe height H is parallel to the Y -axis, and the width W is\nparallel to the Z-axis.\n2 Space Defragmentation\nA primary objective for bin packing problems (and packing\nproblems in general) is to identify dense packing patterns so\nthat the utilization of space within each bin is high. When this\nis achieved, the number of bins required is naturally reduced.\nThe main obstacle against achieving a dense packing of items\nis the fragmentation of usable space as items are loaded into\nbins. For example, Figure 1(a) shows the situation inside a\nbin after two items are loaded. The usable space in the bin is\ndivided into two disconnected parts, and even though the to\u0002tal area of usable space in the bin is sufficient to load item 3,\nneither part is large enough to accommodate the item. How\u0002ever, by pushing item 1 upwards, we can make enough room\nto load item 3 (Figure 1(b)).\n699\nProceedings of the Twenty-Second International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence\n3\n1\n2\n(a) Usable space is fragmented, item 3\ncannot be packed\n1\n2\n3\n(b) Item 1 is pushed up\u0002wards to make room for\nitem 3\nFigure 1: Example of space defragmentation\nFigure 2: A packing pattern and its X-comparability graph\nThis is the basis for our space defragmentation operations.\nIn particular, when attempting to place an item i at some po\u0002sition p (i.e., the corner of item i that is closest to the origin\nis at point p) and there is not enough space to accommodate\nthe item due to the presence of existing items, we can attempt\nto push all items that overlap with i away from the origin in\norder to make room for the new item.\nThere are two tasks to perform when implementing this\nconcept. Firstly, we must determine if there is sufficient space\nto accommodate item i after pushing the items away from p;\nsecondly, the item i must be loaded at p. In this section, we\npresent an O(n2) algorithm that utilizes the space defragmen\u0002tation concept by efficiently determining the distance that an\nitem can be pushed along an axis, using the concept of a com\u0002parability graph for an axis.\nFor any item i in a bin, its projection onto the X-axis is an\ninterval that we denote by [xi, xi]. Therefore, the length of an\nitem i is li = xi \u2212 xi. We can construct the X-comparability\ngraph GX = (VX, EX) for the set of intervals corresponding\nto the items in a bin as follows:\n\u2022 Every item i corresponds to a vertex vi \u2208 VX;\n\u2022 Each vertex vi is assigned a weight equal to li;\n\u2022 There is a directed edge (vi, vj ) \u2208 EX from vertex vi to\nvj if and only if xi \u2264 xj , i.e., item i lies entirely to the\nleft of item j.\nGX is a directed acyclic graph; similar graphs can be con\u0002structed for the other axes in the same manner. Figure 2\nshows an example of a packing in a bin along with the corre\u0002sponding X-comparability graph. We define the length of a\npath as the sum of the weights of all vertices in the path.\nGiven a packing with X-comparability graph GX, we can\nright-justify all items along the X-axis such that [xr\ni , xr\ni ] is\nthe projection of item i on the X-axis after right-justification,\nwhere\nxr\ni =\n\u0002 min\n(vi,vj )\u2208EX\n{xr\nj} : \u2203(vi, vj ) \u2208 EX\nL : otherwise (1)\nNote that a feasible packing with X-comparability graph\nGX remains feasible after all items are right-justified along\nthe X-axis. Furthermore, the comparability graphs for the\nother axes for the resultant packing are unchanged.\nFor any given point x on the X-axis, we call the set of\nitems whose right endpoint lies to the right of x the right set\nat x, denoted by Rx = {i : xi > x}. The set of all other\nitems in the bin is called the left set at x, denoted by Lx =\n{i : xi \u2264 x}. We define an operator PUSH(GX, x), which\nright-justifies every item i \u2208 Rx along the X-axis.\nFor three-dimensional packing problems, we define a\ncomposite operator PUSH-OUT(b,(x, y, z)), which attempts\nto collate usable space in bin b around a reference point\n(x, y, z) by performing PUSH(GX, x); PUSH(GY , y); and\nPUSH(GZ, z). The three PUSH operations can be performed\nin any order, and the resultant packing will be the same.\nWe now describe how xr\ni can be computed in \u0398(n log n)\ntime for all items without explicitly constructing the X\u0002comparability graph ...",

We often found ourselves refocusing our efforts on different activities relating \nto Kaggle. Over time, we devoted ourselves not just to competitions but also to creating content \nand code based on the demands of the data science market and our own professional aspirations. \nAt this point in our journey, we felt that our combined experience and still-burning passion for \ncompetitions could really help other participants who have just started, or who would like to get \ninspired, to get hold of the essential expertise they need, so they can start their own journey in \ndata science competitions.\nWe then decided to work on this audiobook with a purpose:\n\u2022 To offer, in a single place, the best tips for being competitive and approaching most of \nthe problems you may find when participating on Kaggle and also other data science \ncompetitions.\n\u2022 To offer enough suggestions to allow anyone to reach at least the Expert level in any Kaggle \ndiscipline: Competitions, Datasets, Notebooks, or Discussions.\n\u2022 To provide tips on how to learn the most from Kaggle and leverage this experience for \nprofessional growth in data science.\n\u2022 To gather in a single source the largest number of perspectives on the experience of partic\u0002ipating in competitions, by interviewing Kaggle Masters and Grandmasters and listening \nto their stories.\nIn short, we have created an audiobook that demonstrates how to participate in competitions \nsuccessfully and make the most of all the opportunities that Kaggle offers. The audiobook is also \nintended as a practical reference that saves you time and effort, through its selection of many \ncompetition tips and tricks that are hard to learn about and find on the internet or on Kaggle \nforums. Nevertheless, the audiobook doesn\u2019t limit itself to providing practical help; it also aspires \nto help you figure out how to boost your career in data science by participating in competitions.\n2 Preface\nPlease be aware: this audiobook doesn\u2019t teach you data science from the basics. We don\u2019t explain \nin detail how linear regression or random forests or gradient boosting work, but how to use them \nin the best way and obtain the best results from them in a data problem. We expect solid foun\u0002dations and at least a basic proficiency in data science topics and Python usage from our readers. \nIf you are still a data science beginner, you need to supplement this audiobook with other books \non data science, machine learning, and deep learning, and train up on online courses, such as \nthose offered by Kaggle itself or by MOOCs such as edX or Coursera.\nIf you want to start learning data science in a practical way, if you want to challenge yourself \nwith tricky and intriguing data problems and simultaneously build a network of great fellow \ndata scientists as passionate about their work in data as you are, this is indeed the audiobook \nfor you.

They can also take much longer than non-evolutionary methods. We try to address these concerns by using an EA, in particular the learning classi\u00a3er system XCS, to learn a solution process rather than to solve individual problems. The process chooses one of various simple non-evolutionary heuristics to apply to each state of a problem, gradually transforming the problem from its initial state to a solved state. We test this on a large set of onedimensional bin packing problems. For some of the problems, none of the heuristics used can \u00a3nd an optimal answer; however, the evolved solution process can \u00a3nd an optimal solution in over 78% of cases.\n...Read more\n## Related papers\n[Evolutionary Hyper-Heuristics for Tackling Bi-Objective 2D Bin Packing Problems](https://www.academia.edu/32668634/Evolutionary_Hyper_Heuristics_for_Tackling_Bi_Objective_2D_Bin_Packing_Problems)\n[Juan Carlos Gomez](https://ugto.academia.edu/JuanCarlosGomez)\nIn this article, a multi-objective evolutionary framework to build selection hyper-heuristics for solving instances of the 2D bin packing problem is presented. The approach consists of a multi-objective evolutionary learning process, using specific tailored genetic operators, to produce sets of variable length rules representing hyper-heuristics. Each hyper-heuristic builds a solution to a given problem instance by sensing the state of the instance , and deciding which single heuristic to apply at each decision point. The hyper-heuristics consider the minimization of two conflicting objectives when building a solution: the number of bins used to accommodate the pieces and the total time required to do the job. The proposed framework integrates three well-studied multi-objective evolutionary algorithms to produce sets of Pareto-approximated hyper-heuristics: the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II, the Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm 2, and the Generalized Differential Evolution Algorithm 3. We conduct an extensive experimental analysis using a large set of 2D bin packing problem instances containing convex and non-convex irregular pieces, under many conditions, settings and using several performance metrics. The analysis assesses the ro-bustness and flexibility of the proposed approach, providing encouraging results when compared against a set of well-known baseline single heuristics.\ndownloadDownload free PDF[View PDFchevron\\_right](https://www.academia.edu/32668634/Evolutionary_Hyper_Heuristics_for_Tackling_Bi_Objective_2D_Bin_Packing_Problems)\n[A unified hyper-heuristic framework for solving bin packing problems](https://www.academia.edu/11655521/A_unified_hyper_heuristic_framework_for_solving_bin_packing_problems)\n[Hugo Terashima Marin](https://itesm.academia.edu/HugoTerashimaMarin)\nOne-and two-dimensional packing and cutting problems occur in many commercial contexts, and it is often important to be able to get good-quality solutions quickly. Fairly simple deterministic heuristics are often used for this purpose, but such heuristics typically find excellent solutions for some problems and only mediocre ones for others. Trying several different heuristics on a problem adds to the cost. This paper describes a hyper-heuristic methodology that can generate a fast, deterministic algorithm capable of producing results comparable to that of using the best problem-specific heuristic, and sometimes even better, but without the cost of trying all the heuristics. The generated algorithm handles both one-and two-dimensional problems, including two-dimensional problems that involve irregular concave polygons. The approach is validated using a large set of 1417 such problems, including a new benchmark set of 480 problems that include concave polygons.\ndownloadDownload free PDF[View PDFchevron\\_right](https://www.academia.edu/11655521/A_unified_hyper_heuristic_framework_for_solving_bin_packing_problems)\n[An Application of Heuristic and Evolutionary Algorithms for Solving Some Practical Two-dimensional Bin Packing Problems](https://www.academia.edu/52255794/An_Application_of_Heuristic_and_Evolutionary_Algorithms_for_Solving_Some_Practical_Two_dimensional_Bin_Packing_Problems)\n[Andile Ntanjana](https://dut.academia.edu/AndileNtanjana)\nEnvironment and Water Resource Management / 837: Health Informatics / 838: Modelling and Simulation / 839: Power and Energy Systems, 2016\nBin packing problems are a class of optimization problems that have numerous applications in the industrial world, ranging from efficient cutting of material to packing various items in a larger container.

The four corners\u2019 (FC) heuristic is specifically designed to increase the search efficiency of EAs. Experiments with the FC heuristic are conducted on 31 problems from the literature both with rotations permitted and without rotations permitted, using two different EA algorithms: a self-adaptive parallel recombinative simulated annealing (PRSA) algorithm, and a self-adaptive genetic algorithm (GA). Results on bin packing problems yield the smallest trim losses we have seen in the published literature; with the FC heuristic, zero trim loss was achieved on problems of up to 97 rectangles. A comparison of the self-adaptive GA to fixed-parameter GAs is presented and the benefits of self-adaption are highlighted.\n\n## Introduction\n\nTwo-dimensional (2D) packing problems occur in a wide range of industries. The goal is simply the optimal utilization of space or material available. In the garment and paper industries the problem is often to cut smaller pieces from a large roll of cloth or paper while reducing the scrap. In the wood, glass, and metal industries the task is not to cut from a roll, but to cut from a fixed size sheet or plate. In the semiconductor industry the task is VLSI floor planning with the goal being to optimize the use of space on the chip.\n\nThere are two major variants of the 2D packing problem: bin packing and strip packing. In the 2D bin packing variant, rectangles are to be packed in bins of given width and height, the goal being to minimize the number of bins used. In the 2D strip packing variant, rectangles must be packed in a fixed width, infinite height strip, the goal being to minimize the height. The bin packing variant is most suitable for the wood, glass, metal, and semiconductor industries, while the strip packing variant will generally apply to the paper and garment industries.\n\nAn important consideration is whether or not the rectangles can be rotated as they are placed. In the wood and garment industries one may care about the grain of the material and rotations may not be permitted. While in the paper, glass, and semiconductor industries there may be no particular restrictions. Allowing rotations adds flexibility and can result in a better packing, while at the same time apparently complicating the task.\n\nGiven the many permutations of 2D packing problems, most research focuses on a particular type of the packing problem: either bin packing or strip packing, with or without rotations. A recent survey of 2D packing problems is given by Lodi et al. (2002). A typology of cutting and packing problems is defined in W\u00e4scher et al. (2006).\n\nBeing NP-hard, the 2D packing problems are an attractive challenge for evolutionary algorithms (EA). For application to strip packing problems, Jakobs (1996) developed a genetic algorithm (GA) using the bottom-left (BL) packing method with support for rotation of rectangles. Hopper and Turton (2001) provide a comprehensive comparison of GA, simulated annealing (SA), na\u00efve evolution, and simple hill-climbing for the strip packing problem with rotations and for various BL methods. A recent paper by Lesh et al. (2004) gives a method to find strip packing solutions using an exact branch and bounds exhaustive search. They successfully find perfect packings (zero trim loss) for problem sizes up to 30 rectangles. In regards to bin packing problems, Babu and Babu (1999) use a GA and a BL packing heuristic. Recently, Leung et al. (2003) developed a mixed simulated annealing-genetic algorithm.\n\nIn this paper, we design the four corners\u2019 (FC) packing heuristic with the aim to increase the search efficiency of EAs when applied to bin packing problems. By the nature of the FC heuristic, the packings produced are non-guillotineable and bottom-left stability is not preserved. In this research we study only orthogonal packing problems, consisting of one bin with the goal to seek minimum trim loss. In the typology of cutting and packing problems as defined by W\u00e4scher et al. (2006), we deal with a two-dimensional, output maximization problem: we have one large rectangle of fixed dimensions, into which the value of the placed smaller rectangles (assumed proportional to area of the rectangle) must be maximized. The smaller rectangles are strongly heterogeneous and must be laid out orthogonally. Specifically, we study the two-dimensional single orthogonal knapsack problem.\n\nThe FC heuristic is tested with two different self-adapting EAs: a self-adapting parallel recombinative simulated annealing (PRSA) algorithm and a self-adapting GA. The results are presented both with and without support for rotations. The FC heuristic combined with the self-adapting PRSA algorithm is found to produce tighter packings than any of the methods we have seen published in the literature.\n\nThis paper is outlined as follows. In Section 2, an analysis on how EAs work on packing problems is performed and the EA-friendly four corners\u2019 packing heuristic is introduced. In Section 3, a detailed description of the EA components developed in this study is given. Section 4 describes details of the PRSA implementation. Section 5 describes the GA implementation. The remaining sections cover the experimental settings, results, and conclusions.\n\n## Section snippets\n\n## Designing the four corners\u2019 heuristic\n\nIn this section, we analyze how EAs commonly function on packing problems and propose a four corners\u2019 heuristic designed specifically for EAs. GAs are chosen as the representative EA for this discussion, however most of the principles apply in general to the many types of EAs. For example, SA can be implemented using the genome encoding and the mutation operators of a GA. An implementation of PRSA (see Section 4) could use both the mutation and crossover operators of a GA as is done in this\n\n## Common components of a self-adapting evolutionary algorithm\n\nThe PRSA and GA algorithms implemented in this paper share the genome structure, the crossover operators, mutation operators, and the fitness function.\n\n## Self-adaptive parallel recombinative simulate...",

The study considers six heuristics and their combination through an evolutionary hyper-heuristic framework. A wide set of problem instances is considered, including one-dimensional and two-dimensional regular and irregular problems. A number of problem features are considered, which are reduced to the subset of nine features that more strongly relate with heuristic performance. PCA is used to further reduce the dimensionality of the instance features and produce 2D maps. The performance of the heuristics and hyper-heuristics is then super-imposed into these maps to visually reveal relationships between problem features and heuristic behavior. Our analysis indicates that some instances are clearly harder to solve than others for all the studied heuristics and hyper-heuristics. The PCA maps give a valuable indication of the combination of features characterizing easy and hard to solve instances. We found indeed correlations between instance features and heuristic performance. The so-called DJD heuristics are able to best solve a large proportion of instances, but simpler and faster heuristics can outperform them in some cases. In particular when solving 1D instances with low number of pieces, and, more surprisingly, when solving some difficult 2D instances with small areas with low variability. This analysis can be generalized to other problem domains where a set of features characterize instances and several problem solving heuristics are available.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe problem of finding an arrangement of pieces to cut or pack inside larger objects is known as the cutting and packing problem. This NP-hard problem is not only of academic interest; numerous applications of its many variants can be found in practice. The one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) bin packing problems (BPP) are particular cases of the cutting and packing problem, which consists of finding an arrangement of items inside identical bins or objects such that the number of objects required to contain all pieces is minimum. For the 2D BPP, the case of rectangular pieces is the most widely studied. However, the irregular case is seen in a number of industries where parts with irregular shapes are cut from rectangular materials. For example, in the shipbuilding industry, plate parts with free-form shapes for use in the inner frameworks of ships are cut from rectangular steel plates. Also, in the apparel industry, parts of clothes and shoes are cut from fabric or leather (Okano, 2002). Other direct applications include the optimization of layouts within the wood, plastics, glass, textile, metalware and paper industries (Burke et al., 2006, Yu et al., 2009). In these industries, small improvements of the arrangement can result in a large saving of material (Hu-yao and Yuan-jun, 2006).\n\nWithin the field of machine learning, the term _meta-learning_ has been associated with the idea of, given a new dataset, automatically selecting the best learning algorithm for the problem at hand. Meta-learning ideas have traditionally been applied to learning algorithms to solve classification problems, where the goal is to relate performance of algorithms to characteristics or measures of classification datasets. In Smith-Miles (2008a) a framework is presented for the generalization of algorithm selection and meta-learning ideas to algorithms focused on other tasks such as sorting, forecasting, constraint satisfaction and optimization. Meta-learning ideas have been only little explored within optimization, although several approaches can be found in the related area of constraint satisfaction (Leyton-Brown et al., 2002). In Smith-Miles (2008b), meta-learning ideas are used for modeling the relationship between instance characteristics and algorithm performance for the quadratic assignment problem. The study considered a set of 28 problem instances and three metaheuristic algorithms. Both unsupervised and supervised neural network models were used to learn the relationships in the meta-dataset and automate the algorithm selection process. The unsupervised model, self-organization maps (Kohonen et al., 2001), was used to select the best algorithm by creating visual explorations of the performance of different algorithms under various conditions describing the complexity of the problem instances. Given the limited size of the data, this is a preliminary study, but it demonstrates the relevance of meta-learning ideas to the optimization domain. In a later study, Smith-Miles et al. (2009) found correlations between problem features and the effectiveness of scheduling heuristics using a large collection of instances in a production scheduling problem. Other authors have followed up this type of study in optimization (Kanda et al., 2011).\n\nThis paper proposes using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for visualizing _n_-dimensional feature data related to bin packing problems. The goal is to improve our understanding of the problem structure and its relationship with heuristic performance. PCA is a mathematical algorithm that reduces the dimensionality of the data while retaining most of the variation in the dataset. It accomplishes this reduction by converting a set of observations into a set of values of uncorrelated variables called principal components. This transformation is define...",

      "text": "Efficient Local Search Heuristics for Packing\nIrregular Shapes in Two-Dimensional\nHeterogeneous Bins\nRanga P. Abeysooriya1, Julia A. Bennell1, and Antonio Martinez-Sykora1\nBusiness School, University of Southampton, SO17 1BJ, Southampton, UK\nAbstract. In this paper we proposed a local search heuristic and a ge\u0002netic algorithm to solve the two-dimensional irregular multiple bin-size\nbin packing problem. The problem consists of placing a set of pieces rep\u0002resented as 2D polygons in rectangular bins with different dimensions\nsuch that the total area of bins used is minimized. Most packing algo\u0002rithms available in the literature for 2D irregular bin packing consider\nsingle size bins only. However, for many industries the material can be\nsupplied in a number of standard size sheets, for example, metal, foam,\nplastic and timber sheets. For this problem, the cut plans must decide\nthe set of standard size stock sheets as well as which pieces to cut from\neach bin and how to arrange them in order to minimise waste material.\nMoreover, the literature constrains the orientation of pieces to a single\nor finite set of angles. This is often an artificial constraint that makes\nthe solution space easier to navigate. In this paper we do not restrict\nthe orientation of the pieces. We show that the local search heuristic and\nthe genetic algorithm can address all of these decisions and obtain good\nsolutions, with the local search performing better. We also discuss the\naffect of different groups of stock sheet sizes.\nKeywords: Irregular shapes, Multiple bin size bin packing, Jostle Al\u0002gorithm\n1 Introduction\nThe two dimensional bin packing problem consists of placing a set of pieces,\nusually represented as rectangles or polygons, in one or several stock sheets\n(bins) in such a way the total waste generated is minimized. This problem arises\nin several industries where metal, foam, wood, plastic, paper or leather need to\nbe cut. Depending on the industrial application this problem has several variants\ndescribed by the properties of both the pieces to be placed and the bins. In this\npaper we address the problem where the pieces to be cut are irregular and may\nhave concavities. Pieces can be placed in any orientation within rectangular bins\nthat have a variety of different dimensions (heterogeneous bin sizes). We assume\nthat there are a limited number of bin types and there are enough bins of each\ntype to place all the demanded pieces in any set of bins. In this paper we denote\nthis problem as the two-dimensional irregular shape multiple bin size bin packing\nproblem (2D-IMBSBPP) and propose a local search heuristic, called jostle, and\na genetic algorithm to find efficient solutions.\nMost of the publications in the literature that consider heterogeneous bins\nare focused on packing rectangular pieces. Pisinger and Sigurad [19] consider a\nvariable bin cost when solving this problem. They propose a MILP model which\nis then solved by column generation. The model is intractable for large instances\nand difficult to solve even for small instances. Ortmann et al. [18] propose a\ntwo-phase approach. During the first phase they use first-fit decreasing with the\nlargest bins first. A second phase repacks bins into smaller bins. The two phase\nalgorithm is implemented with different bin sizes and aims to minimise the total\narea of the occupied bins. Wei et al. [21] propose a tabu search that uses a\nsequential packing heuristic, a local search, and a post-improvement procedure\nto reduce the total area of used bins in a feasible solution. Alvarez-Valdes et\nal. [2] implement meta-heuristic algorithms with variable bin costs which are\nnot proportional to the size of the bin. The objective is to minimize the cost of\nthe occupied bins, and the authors employ a greedy randomized adaptive search\nprocedure with path re-linking strategies to combine the best solutions obtained\nin the iterative process. In order to compare their results with Ortmann et al.\n[18]\u2019s, they modify the objective function to maximize the overall utilization of\nthe occupied bins.\nThe vast majority of research publications considering the packing of 2D\nirregular shapes address the 2D strip packing problem, also known as the nesting\nproblem. Instead of placing pieces into bins the aim is to place all the pieces into\na strip with fixed width and infinite length in such a way the total required length\nis minimized. However, recent publications of packing algorithms for irregular\npieces consider the bin packing problem with homogeneous bins, see [14], [20],\n[16] and [1]. However, in many situations bins are readily available to purchase\nas rectangular sheets in different standard sizes. In these industries companies\nusually handle several bin sizes in order to satisfy customer demand. The aim of\nthe companies is not only to reduce the waste generated in the cutting process,\nbut also charge a competitive price to the customers, which usually depends on\nthe area of material needed to meet the demand. There are several publications\nconsidering heterogeneous irregular bins, see [4] and [5], who solve an applied\nproblem which arises in the leather industry. In these publications the pieces\nare approximated by grid squares or pixels rather than polygons. While this\nsimplifies the geometry, solutions suffer from inaccuracy in shape representation.\nIt is important to highlight that in this paper we use the direct representa\u0002tions of the pieces as polygons and do not restrict the rotation of pieces to a\npredefined set of angles. Han et al. [13] and Martinez-Sykora et al. [15] considered\nfree rotation for the 2D irregular bin packing problem with guillotine cuts, solving\nan application derived from the glass industry. More recently, Martinez-Sykora\net al. [16] and Abeysooriya et al. [1] considered free rotation for the problem with\nhomogeneous bins and also report results with restricted and fixed rotations. For\ncomparison purposes, we also address the problem where a finite set of rotations\nare allowed.\nThe main contribution of this paper is to efficiently solve the 2D-IMBSBPP\nconsidering continuous rotation of pieces by using an adaptation of the jostle\nprocedure. Jostle was first proposed by Dowsland et al. [10] for the strip packing\nproblem and then used in [1] in bin packing problems with homogeneous bins.\nOne of the most important properties of the jostle procedure is that it explores\nefficient solutions with a relatively low computational effort, compared with other\navailable algorithms. The jostle procedure works over the sequence of pieces that\nrepresents the order pieces are inserted in the layout. The constructive heuristic\niterates between packing from one end of the strip and then the other end taking\nthe sequence from the last iteration. The results presented in this paper show\na considerable improvement when using a heterogeneous set of bin sizes, which\ndemonstrates the efficiency of the algorithms presented.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we describe the problem and\nwe discuss the measure of performance used to evaluate the quality of feasible\nsolutions. Section 3 explains the jostle algorithms and the genetic algorithm to\nsolve 2D-IMBSBPP. Computational tests are presented in Section 4. Finally, in\nSection 5 we present the conclusions of the paper.\n2 Problem Description\nLet N0 be the number of rectangular bin types (stock sheets) and let Lk and\nWk be, respectively, the length and the width of bin type k \u2208 {1, . . . , N0}.
