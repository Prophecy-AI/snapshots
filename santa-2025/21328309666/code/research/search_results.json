An efficient 2D irregular packing algorithm can effectively improve material utilization and reduce processing costs. The reduction in material consumption will also have a beneficial impact on the environment ( [Ke et al., 2020](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B76)). Therefore, research of the packing problem is of great significance for technology and social interest.\n\nThe 2D packing problem is a type of combinatorial optimization problems to locate parts with different shapes compactly in one or more master sheet material to minimize the occupied space or maximize the utilization of the material. The 2D packing problem is currently recognized as a NP problem, which is mainly solved by heuristic algorithms. In recent years, many scholars have conducted research on 2D irregular packing problems with a verity of solutions.\n\nThere exists a number of review articles on packing and cutting problems. We have summarized the main review literature in the field of 2D packing and cutting as shown in [Table 1](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#T1). Brown ( [Brown, 1971](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B17)) introduced an optimum packing and depletion problem with optimization of space and resource usage. Harvey ( [Salkin and De Kluyver, 1975](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B116)) surveyed the application of mathematical optimization models such as linear programming to the knapsack problem. Bruce ( [Golden, 1976](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B50)) surveyed various approaches to the cutting stock problem. Hinxman ( [Hinxman, 1980](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B65)) surveyed the trim-loss and assortment problems, this research paid more attention to cutting and packaging problems in practical applications, and did not mention much about theoretical methods. Garey and Coffman ( [Garey and Johnson, 1981](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B47); [Coffman et al., 1984](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B27)) surveyed the approximation algorithms for bin packing problems. Israni ( [Israni and Sanders, 1982](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B72)) reviewed the 2D cutting stock problem including almost all 2D packaging problems. The author also proposed a rectangular layout method. Sarin ( [Sarin, 1983](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B118)) reviewed methodologies and literature to solve 2D stock cutting problems and introduced an interactive optimization procedure for a general 2D stock cutting problem. Dyckhoff ( [Dyckhoff et al., 1985](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B38)) described a trim loss and related problems and categorized them briefly. Dudzi\u0144ski ( [Dudzi\u0144ski and Walukiewicz, 1987](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B36)) summarized the exact methods for knapsack problems, such as linear programming. Matthias ( [Rode and Rosenberg, 1987](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B114)) analyzed the algorithm for the trim-loss problems. Haessler ( [Haessler and Sweeney, 1991](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B59)) reviewed the solution process of cutting stock problems, including placement algorithm and sequence optimization algorithm. Dowsland ( [Dowsland and Dowsland, 1992](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B34)) reviewed the application of operations research methods to the packing problem and summarized some exact heuristics. Sweeney ( [Sweeney and Paternoster, 1992](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B128)) categorized cutting and packing problems and made application-oriented research records. Cheng ( [Cheng et al., 1994](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B22)) discussed 2D cutting stock problems and their application cases including the pallet loading problem and VLSI placement problem. With the gradual deepening of research on 2D layout problems, typology becomes a common research topic. 2D regular and irregular layout problems are clearly distinguished in practical applications and theoretical methods. Dowsland ( [Dowsland and Dowsland, 1995](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B29)) gave a special review of the 2D irregular nesting problem for the first time. Mavridou ( [Mavridou and Pardalos, 1997](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B98)) summarized applications of the genetic algorithm and simulated annealing algorithm in the optimization of facility layout problems. Dyckhoff ( [Dyckhoff, 1990](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B37)) made a typology of the cutting and packing problems in detail, and W\u00e4scher ( [W\u00e4scher et al., 2007](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B135)) improved the typology later. Hopper ( [Hopper and Turton, 1999](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B67); [Hopper and Turton, 2001a](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B68); [Hopper and Turton, 2001b](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B69)) investigated the application of meta-heuristic and heuristic algorithms in 2D and 3D packing problems. Lodi ( [Lodi et al., 2002a](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B90); [Lodi et al., 2002b](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B91)) reviewed algorithms proposed in the 1990s of 2D packing problems. Bennell et al. ( [Bennell and Oliveira, 2008](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B10); [Bennell and Oliveira, 2009](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B9)) discussed 2D irregular packing problems and related geometric problems.

However, existing approaches often struggle to achieve both high efficiency and compactness in the arrangement of irregularly shaped 2D components, leading to significant material waste and suboptimal layout solutions. To address this issue, this study introduces a novel methodology that integrates advanced image processing and computational intelligence to optimize the arrangement of irregularly shaped components on fixed boards. Employing normalized two-dimensional cross-correlation for enhanced template matching, our approach not only improves material utilization but also enhances packing efficiency by reducing gaps between components. The developed method involves several key steps, including the cropping of cross-correlation matrices and strategic pattern placement, which are critical for achieving a highly compact and computationally efficient arrangement. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances both material conservation and computational efficiency compared to traditional methods, ensuring a more optimized and automated packing process. Our findings provide a practical and scalable solution bridging the gap between theoretical research and industrial applications. This research contributes to advancing computational efficiency, reducing material waste, and optimizing spatial utilization in industrial cutting and packing scenarios.\n\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n\n### [Universal image segmentation for optical identification of 2D materials](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-85159-9?fromPaywallRec=false)\n\nArticleOpen access11 March 2021\n\n### [Accurate quantification of dislocation loops in complex functional alloys enabled by deep learning image analysis](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-74894-4?fromPaywallRec=false)\n\nArticleOpen access24 October 2024\n\n### [Multi-objective steel plate cutting optimization problem based on real number coding genetic algorithm](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-27100-2?fromPaywallRec=false)\n\nArticleOpen access28 December 2022\n\n## Introduction\n\nIn the multifaceted realms of manufacturing and design, practitioners face a spectrum of complex challenges. Central among these is the \u20182-D cutting and packing\u2019 problem, prevalent across industries like furniture craftsmanship, sheet metal fabrication, and footwear production. This issue involves the efficient arrangement of irregularly shaped components on fixed boards[1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-97202-0#ref-CR1), [2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-97202-0#ref-CR2), aiming to maximize space and resource utilization amidst the intricacies of diverse shapes and sizes[3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-97202-0#ref-CR3), [4](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-97202-0#ref-CR4).\n\nThe puzzle\u2019s complexity is further heightened by the need for optimal utilization within spatial and design constraints[5](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-97202-0#ref-CR5). Traditional manual methods, while viable in specific scenarios, often fall short under the pressures of high-volume, complex production, necessitating advanced solutions that integrate mathematical, computational, and spatial optimization[6](https://www.nature.com/www.nature.com#ref-CR6), [7](https://www.nature.com/www.nature.com#ref-CR7), [8](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-97202-0#ref-CR8). Figure\u00a0[1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-97202-0#Fig1) illustrates the application of pattern packing technology in various industrial engineering fields. This includes techniques such as laser cutting and milling machine cutting, which are essential for efficient material utilization and precise part placement.\n\n**Fig. 1**\n\nApplications of Irregularly Shaped Part Layout Algorithms in Various Industries: ( **a**) Waterjet Cutting Metal Plates; ( **b**) Laser Cutting 10\u00a0mm Stainless Steel; ( **c**) Laser Cutting Copper Plates; ( **d**) Milling Machine Cutting Aluminum Alloy Parts.\n\n[Full size image](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-97202-0/figures/1)\n\nAcademic and industrial research have made significant strides in addressing these challenges. Foundational to this field is the work of Iori et al.[9](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-97202-0#ref-CR9), who provided a comprehensive survey of key issues such as the Two-Dimensional Strip Packing Problem (2D-SPP) and the Two-Dimensional Bin Packing Problem (2D-BPP), laying the groundwork for understanding various methodologies.\n\nBuilding on this foundation, research has branched into addressing specific challenges. He et al.[10](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-97202-0#ref-CR10) devised an Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search algorithm for the 2D Circle Bin Packing Problem, and G\u00e1lvez et al.[11](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-97202-0#ref-CR11) developed a pseudo-polynomial-time approximation algorithm for strip packing. Alvarez-Valdes et al.[12](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-97202-0#ref-CR12) explored nesting of irregular shapes with a Branch & Bound Algorithm, while Rakotonirainy and van Vuuren[13](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-97202-0#ref-CR13) and Luo et al.[14](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-97202-0#ref-CR14) focused on metaheuristic algorithms for the 2D strip-packing and knapsack problems.\n\nAttention has also been directed towards packing irregular objects. Abeysooriya et al.[15](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-97202-0#ref-CR15) and Sato et al.[16](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-97202-0#ref-CR16) have proposed novel approaches for this purpose, complemented by the work of Cherri et al.[17](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-97202-0#ref-CR17) and Xu et al.[18](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-97202-0#ref-CR18), who introduced advanced heuristics and optimization algorithms for irregular strip packing and nesting. Additionally, Souza Queiroz and Andretta[19](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-97202-0#ref-CR19) have pioneered efficient solutions for the 2D Irregular Knapsack Problem.\n\nIn the domain of 2D placement and orientation, notable contributions include those by Andrade et al.[20](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-97202-0#ref-CR20), Zhang et al.[21](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-97202-0#ref-CR21), and Yang et al.[22](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-97202-0#ref-CR22), offering integrated strategies for maximizing space utilization in raw material processing. Oliveira et al.[23](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-97202-0#ref-CR23) have provided a comprehensive overview of solution approaches for rectangular cutting and packing problems. Wu et al.[24](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-97202-0#ref-CR24) presented an enhanced heuristic for 2D rectangle packing problems with central rectangles, showing that their IHACR algorithm surpasses the older HACR in efficiency and layout filling rate, particularly for complex layouts in semi-submersible production platforms.\n\nSpecialized challenges have been addressed by researchers such as Wu et al.[25](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-97202-0#ref-CR25) and Leao et al.[26](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-97202-0#ref-CR26), focusing on the Central Rectangle Rectangular Packing Area Maximization Proble...",

The goal of this optimization problem is to place a set of irregular\npolygons onto a material sheet without overlapping and in a way that minimizes wasted\nmaterial.\nIn this thesis, we delve into a fast 2D packing algorithm that automatically arranges\nparts of a user\u2019s design onto their available material sheets to provide live feedback on\nhow much material they have left. To do this, we make use of the concept of the no fit\npolygon to generate candidate placements, and we utilize custom heuristics and performance\noptimization to improve packing quality and runtime .\nOur technical evaluation shows that the implementation is fast enough to work at\ninteractive speeds and produce solutions of similar quality to other tools and algorithms that\nperform automated packing.\nThesis Supervisor: Stefanie Mueller\nTitle: Assistant Professor\n3\n4\nAcknowledgments\nFirst of all, I would like to extend my deepest gratitude to my advisor, Professor Stefanie\nMueller. She has been especially supportive during these trying times and has always been\navailable to give guidance and instruction. I would also like to give the hugest of thank yous\nto Ticha Sethapakdi and Daniel Anderson without whom this thesis could not have been\npossible. Ticha was the mastermind of Fabricaide and its user interface, and also somehow\nsimultaneously manages to be one of the coolest and one of the most awkward people I\nknow. Dan was always available to provide guidance and support in wrangling with C++\nand other difficult aspects of the implementation. Even outside the context of working on\nFabricaide, Ticha and Dan have been great friends and role models throughout the time I\ngot to know them. I could not have asked for a better group of mentors and colleagues than\nProfessor Mueller, Ticha and Dan.\nI am extremely grateful to my friends and family both here in the MIT community as\nwell as back home in the Philippines all the way at the other side of the world. I am thankful\nfor all the love and concern I\u2019ve received from them in spite of current circumstances.\nFinally, I would like to thank the rest of the Human Computer Interaction Engineering\nGroup for creative such a fun and welcoming environment. Be it sharing and discussing\nideas during lab meetings or hitting the dance floor with Just Dance for celebrations, I have\nnever had a boring moment with this great group of people.\nLanguage and Figure Note\nThroughout this thesis, I use the word \u201cwe\u201d to signify that this work has been a group effort.\nHowever, the work that is provided in detail is my own. Figures and images were jointly\ncreated by the project team.\n5\n6\nContents\n1 Introduction 13\n2 Related Work 15\n2.1 Preparing Designs for Laser Cutting . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 15\n2.2 Arranging Parts of a 2D Design . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 16\n3 Packing Algorithm 19\n3.1 Preliminaries . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 19\n3.1.1 No Fit Polygons . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 19\n3.1.2 Applying NFPs to the Packing Problem . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 20\n3.1.3 Bin Selection . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 21\n3.2 Overview . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 23\n3.3 Implementation . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 24\n3.3.1 Sheets with Holes . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 24\n3.3.2 Basic Part Placement Algorithm . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 24\n3.3.3 Order and Rotations of Parts . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 25\n3.3.4 Heuristics . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 29\n3.3.5 Placement across Multiple Sheets . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 30\n3.3.6 Partial Packing . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 32\n3.3.7 Complexity Analysis . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 33\n3.4 Implementation Optimizations . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 35\n3.4.1 Caching of NFPs . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 35\n3.4.2 Incremental Heuristic Calculation . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 36\n7\n3.4.3 Shape Dilation and Simplification . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 36\n3.5 Technical Evaluation of Part Placement Algorithm . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 37\n3.5.1 Benchmark Dataset . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 37\n3.5.2 Benchmark Setup . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 38\n3.5.3 Evaluation of Runtime . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 38\n3.5.4 Evaluation of Solution Quality . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 39\n3.5.5 Additional Evaluation for Standard Datasets . . . . . . . . . . . . . 40\n4 Fabricaide System Overview 43\n4.1 Core System Features . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 43\n4.1.1 Drawing Parts and Assigning Materials . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 43\n4.1.2 Live Packing Previews . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 44\n4.1.3 Material Warnings and Suggested Substitutes . . . . . . . . . . . . 46\n4.1.4 Material Utilization . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 47\n4.2 Implementation . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 47\n4.2.1 Splitting a Design into Constituent Materials . . . . . . . . . . . . 47\n4.2.2 Calculating Material Utilization . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 48\n4.3 Qualitative Evaluation of Fabricaide . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 49\n4.3.1 User Study Procedure . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 49\n4.3.2 User Study Findings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 49\n5 Conclusions 53\n8\nList of Figures\n3-1 A fixed-position polygon (black), a polygon to place (gray), and their NFP\n(red).

The classic packing solution is a hybrid algorithm based on heuristic positioning and meta-heuristic sequencing, which has the problems of complex solving rules and high time cost. In this study, the similarity measurement method based on the twin neural network model is used to evaluate the similarity of pieces in the source task and the target task. The reusability evaluation of packing tasks is designed to select appropriate source task knowledge. The transfer operator is used to transfer the piece sequence knowledge from the source task to complete the reuse of packing knowledge in the target task. The bottom-left algorithm is improved to complete the placement of 2D irregular pieces. The computational experiments show that the proposed algorithm for the bin packing problem using knowledge reuse and improved heuristic (KRIH) has good robustness. The KRIH algorithm can obtain 8 equal or better results on 16 instances in a relatively short time compared with some classical heuristic algorithms, which has good application potential.\n\n**Keywords:** Packing problem, Irregular piece, Knowledge reuse, Knowledge transfer, Heuristic algorithms\n\n**Subject terms:** Computational science, Applied mathematics, Mechanical engineering\n\n## Introduction\n\nPacking problems are commonly found in industries such as mechanical manufacturing, aviation, clothing, automotive manufacturing, shipbuilding, and furniture manufacturing. The manufacturing process of typical heavy industry products is shown in Fig.\u00a0[1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#Fig1). In actual production, efficient packing algorithms can improve the utilization of raw materials and reduce production costs within an acceptable time. In a sense, the reduction of raw material consumption can have a beneficial impact on the environment[1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#CR1). Packing problems, also known as bin packing problems or nesting problems, can be divided into three categories[2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#CR2): the one-dimensional (1D) packing problem (wire cutting stock problem)[3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#CR3), [4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#CR4), the two-dimensional (2D) packing problem (planar packing problem)[5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#CR5), [6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#CR6) and the three-dimensional (3D) packing problem[7](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#CR7).

Outline of our proof\n\nIn this paper we consider the _rectangle_ [packing problem](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/mathematics/packing-problem). The input is a rectangle _R_ with width _W_ and height _H_, and a list of _n_ rectangles r1,r2,\u2026,ri each with a given width wi and height hi. The question is whether the _n_ rectangles can be packed into _R_ so that no two rectangles [intersect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/mathematics/intersects) in their interiors. We do not allow rotations of the rectangles, i.e., all edges corresponding to the widths of the rectangles have to be parallel.\n\nOur main idea is to reduce the proof of [Theorem 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925772111000319#en0010) to a [finite number](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/mathematics/finite-number) of rectangle packing problems.

Similar to the _Tetris game_, the rectangles arrive from the top and, once placed, cannot be moved again. The rectangles are moved inside the bin to reach their place. For the case in which rotations are allowed, we design an algorithm whose performance ratio is constant. In contrast, if rotations are not allowed, we show that no algorithm of constant ratio exists. For this case we design an algorithm with performance ratio of _O_(log(1/\u03b5)), where \u03b5 is the minimum width of any rectangle. We also show that no algorithm can achieve a better ratio than\u03a9(log(1/\u03b5))for this case.\n\nRecommended articles\n\n- Y.

Most notably, online strip packing has been considered; for prominent examples, see Azar and Epstein \\[40\\], who employ shelf packing, and Epstein and van Stee \\[36\\]. Offline packing of rectangles into a unit square or rectangle has also been considered in different variants; for examples, see \\[41\\], as well as \\[42\\].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow abstract\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the presence of dynamic insertions and deletions into a partially reconfigurable FPGA, fragmentation is unavoidable. This poses the challenge of developing efficient approaches to dynamic defragmentation and reallocation. One key aspect is to develop efficient algorithms and data structures that exploit the two-dimensional geometry of a chip, instead of just one. We propose a new method for this task, based on the fractal structure of a quadtree, which allows dynamic segmentation of the chip area, along with dynamically adjusting the necessary communication infrastructure. We describe a number of algorithmic aspects, and present different solutions. We also provide a number of basic simulations that indicate that the theoretical worst-case bound may be pessimistic.\n\n- ### [Two-dimensional strip packing with unloading constraints](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166218X13003600)\n\n\n\n2014, Discrete Applied Mathematics\n\n\n\nShow abstract\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this paper we present approximation algorithms for the two-dimensional strip packing problem with unloading constraints. In this problem, we are given a strip S of width 1 and unbounded height, and n items of C different classes, each item ai with height h(ai), width w(ai) and class c(ai). As in the strip packing problem, we have to pack all items, minimizing the height used, but now we have the additional constraint that items of higher classes cannot block the way out of items of lower classes. For the case in which horizontal and vertical movements for removing the items are allowed, we design an algorithm whose asymptotic performance bound is 3. For the case in which only vertical movements are allowed, we design a bin packing based algorithm with an asymptotic approximation ratio of 5.745. Moreover, we also design approximation algorithms for restricted cases of both versions of the problem. These problems have practical applications in dealing with routing problems with loading/unloading constraints.\n\n- ### [Heuristics for the strip packing problem with unloading constraints](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305054812002353)\n\n\n\n2013, Computers and Operations Research\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitation Excerpt :\n\n\n\nSome other papers also achieved similar results \\[5,11,8\\]. In \\[3\\], Azar and Epstein proposed an online 4-competitive algorithm to a version of the strip packing problem, where while packing one item there must be a free way from the top of the bin until the position where the item is packed. In this model, a rectangle arrives from the top of S, and it should be moved continuously using only the free space until it reaches its place, as in the well known TETRIS game.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow abstract\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis article addresses the Strip Packing Problem with Unloading Constraints (SPU). In this problem, we are given a strip of fixed width and unbounded height, and _n_ items of _C_ different classes. As in the well-known two-dimensional Strip Packing problem, we have to pack all items minimizing the used height, but now we have the additional constraint that items of hig...",
