The classic *bottom\u2011left* placement rule, often combined with a preprocessing step that generates No\u2011Fit Polygons (NFPs), provides a fast constructive solution; recent refinements such as an *improved sliding algorithm* for NFP generation further reduce collisions and improve packing density ([MDPI](https://www.mdpi.com/2227-7390/10/16/2941)).
