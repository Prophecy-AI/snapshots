## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.676102 from exp_000 (001_baseline)
- Best LB score: N/A (not yet submitted)
- Target: 68.922808 | Gap to target: 1.753294 (2.54% improvement needed)

## Public Kernel Status (CRITICAL!)
- Have we implemented the best kernel yet? **PARTIALLY** - We have the pre-optimized CSVs but haven't run the optimizers
- Top kernels identified:
  1. BackPacking (74.75) - backward propagation approach
  2. Ensemble + SA + Fractional Translation - C++ optimizer with multi-threading
  3. bbox3 runner - simulated annealing with complex geometry
- Kernels we've implemented: Loaded best_ensemble.csv (score 70.676102)
- Kernels still to implement: C++ SA optimizer, backward propagation, bbox3 optimization

## Response to Evaluator
The evaluator correctly identified that:
1. **Submit baseline immediately** - AGREED. We have 100 submissions and need to verify our scoring matches LB.
2. **Run bbox3 optimizer** - AGREED. The binary is available and should be tried.
3. **Implement backward propagation** - AGREED. This is a constructive approach that can escape local optima.
4. **Focus on N=150-200** - PARTIALLY AGREE. Analysis shows score is evenly distributed (~24-27% per 50-N range), so improvements needed across all ranges.

## Key Insights from Kernel Analysis
1. **BackPacking kernel (74.75)**: Backward iteration from N=200 to N=1, propagating good configurations downward
2. **Ensemble + SA kernel**: Uses C++ optimizer with:
   - Simulated annealing (sa_v3)
   - Local search (ls_v3)
   - Fractional translation (very fine movements: 0.001 to 0.00001 steps)
   - Multi-threaded optimization with OpenMP
3. **bbox3**: Pre-compiled C++ optimizer using complex number geometry

## Recommended Approaches (Priority Order)

### 1. **[HIGHEST PRIORITY]** Submit baseline to verify LB score
- We have 100 submissions - use one to validate scoring
- This establishes the CV-LB relationship early
- Command: Submit exp_000 (001_baseline)

### 2. **[HIGH PRIORITY]** Run C++ SA optimizer from ensemble kernel
- The jonathanchan kernel has a complete C++ optimizer (sa_v1_parallel.cpp)
- Compile and run on current best submission
- Uses fractional translation for fine-grained improvements
- Expected: Can improve beyond pre-optimized baseline

### 3. **[HIGH PRIORITY]** Try bbox3 optimizer
- Binary available at /home/nonroot/snapshots/santa-2025/21116303805/code/preoptimized/bbox3
- Need to make executable and run with parameters
- Try: `./bbox3 -n 5000 -r 64` as suggested by evaluator

### 4. **[MEDIUM PRIORITY]** Implement backward propagation
- Start from N=200, work backward
- For each N, check if removing a boundary-touching tree from N+1 config gives better result
- This is a CONSTRUCTIVE approach that can find new solutions

### 5. **[MEDIUM PRIORITY]** Ensemble multiple optimization runs
- Run optimizers with different random seeds
- Combine best configurations per N from multiple runs
- This is how the best_ensemble.csv was created

## What NOT to Try
- Pure Python local search on pre-optimized CSVs (already at local optimum)
- fix_direction rotation (already applied, showed 0 improvement)
- Simple greedy placement (won't beat optimized solutions)

## Validation Notes
- Score = sum of (side_length^2 / N) for N=1 to 200
- Lower is better
- Must have 0 overlaps for valid submission
- Use Shapely STRtree for efficient overlap checking

## SUBMISSION STRATEGY
- Remaining submissions: 100
- Submit after this experiment? **YES** - We have abundant submissions and need LB feedback
- Submit baseline first, then submit any improved solution

## Next Experiment Plan
1. Submit baseline (exp_000) to get LB score
2. Create experiment 002: Run C++ SA optimizer on baseline
3. If improved, submit and continue optimizing
