      "text": "Beam search is a heuristic breadth\u2011first search that keeps only a fixed number\u202f\\(w\\)\u202fof the most promising partial solutions (the *beam*) at each depth of the search tree, discarding the rest.  It can be seen as a memory\u2011limited variant of best\u2011first search: nodes are expanded level\u2011by\u2011level, an evaluation (or scoring) function estimates the quality of each partial solution, and only the top\u202f\\(w\\)\u202fnodes are retained for the next expansion step\u202f([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beam_search)).  In combinatorial optimization the algorithm is used as an *incomplete* method that quickly produces high\u2011quality solutions when exhaustive search is infeasible; the key is designing a problem\u2011specific evaluation that guides which partial solutions survive.\n\nFor packing problems the search space is naturally expressed as a sequence of placement decisions.  Each node in the beam corresponds to a partially filled container together with an ordering of the items already placed.  When a new item is considered, the algorithm tries all feasible placements (e.g., different positions, rotations, or guillotine cuts), scores each resulting layout (using criteria such as wasted area, height of the strip, or a no\u2011fit polygon metric), and keeps the\u202f\\(w\\)\u202fbest partial packings for the next item.  This approach has been applied to two\u2011dimensional strip packing, where a parallel Beam Search\u2011based Packing Algorithm (BSPA) expands many candidate layouts and selects the most promising ones, achieving competitive solution quality on benchmark instances\u202f([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.08711)).  A similar implementation for irregular\u2011shape packing represents the problem as an ordered list of pieces decoded by a placement heuristic; the beam search explores different orderings, using a powerful no\u2011fit polygon generator and custom evaluation criteria to prune inferior packings, and has been shown to outperform many state\u2011of\u2011the\u2011art methods in far less time\u202f([eprints.soton.ac.uk](https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/154605)).\n\nRecent work also integrates machine learning into the beam\u2011search framework.  By learning a policy (e.g., with a neural network) that predicts which nodes are most likely to lead to good final packings, the algorithm can replace hand\u2011crafted evaluation functions and further improve performance on combinatorial packing tasks\u202f([repositum.tuwien.at](https://repositum.tuwien.at/handle/20.500.12708/142532);\u202f[link.springer.com](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-30035-6_9)).  In all cases, beam search provides a scalable way to explore the enormous combinatorial space of packing decisions while keeping computational effort bounded.",

Beam search is a modification of[best-first search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best-first_search)that reduces its memory requirements. Best-first search is a graph search which orders all partial solutions (states) according to some heuristic. But in beam search, only a predetermined number of best partial solutions are kept as candidates.[&#91;1&#93;](#cite_note-1)It is thus a[greedy algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greedy_algorithm).\n## Details\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Beam_search&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1)]\nBeam search uses[breadth-first search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search)to build its[search tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal). At each level of the tree, it generates all successors of the states at the current level, sorting them in increasing order of heuristic cost.[&#91;2&#93;](#cite_note-2)However, it only stores a predetermined number,&#x03B2;{\\\\displaystyle \\\\beta }![{\\displaystyle \\beta }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7ed48a5e36207156fb792fa79d29925d2f7901e8), of best states at each level (called the beam width). Only those states are expanded next. The greater the beam width, the fewer states are pruned. With an infinite beam width, no states are pruned and beam search is identical to[best-first search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best-first_search).[&#91;3&#93;](#cite_note-:0-3)Conversely, a beam width of 1 corresponds to a[hill-climbing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hill_climbing)algorithm.[&#91;3&#93;](#cite_note-:0-3)The beam width bounds the memory required to perform the search. Since a goal state could potentially be pruned, beam search sacrifices completeness (the guarantee that an algorithm will terminate with a solution, if one exists). Beam search is not optimal (that is, there is no guarantee that it will find the best solution).\n## Uses\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Beam_search&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2)]\nA beam search is most often used to maintain tractability in large systems with insufficient amount of memory to store the entire search tree.[&#91;4&#93;](#cite_note-furcy-4)For example, it has been used in many[machine translation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_translation)systems.[&#91;5&#93;](#cite_note-5)(The state of the art now primarily uses[neural machine translation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_machine_translation)based methods, especially[large language models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_models).) To select the best translation, each part is processed, and many different ways of translating the words appear. The top best translations according to their sentence structures are kept, and the rest are discarded. The translator then evaluates the translations according to a given criterion, choosing the translation which best keeps the goals.\n## History\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Beam_search&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3)]\nThe Harpy Speech Recognition System (introduced in a 1976 dissertation[&#91;6&#93;](#cite_note-6)) was the first use of what would become known as beam search.[&#91;7&#93;](#cite_note-7)While the procedure was originally referred to as the \"locus model of search\", the term \"beam search\" was already in use by 1977.[&#91;8&#93;](#cite_note-8)\n## Variants\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Beam_search&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4)]\nBeam search has been made[complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Completeness_(logic))by combining it with[depth-first search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search), resulting in*[beam stack search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beam_stack_search)*[&#91;9&#93;](#cite_note-9)and*depth-first beam search*,[&#91;4&#93;](#cite_note-furcy-4)and with limited discrepancy search,[&#91;4&#93;](#cite_note-furcy-4)resulting in*beam search using limited discrepancy backtracking*[&#91;4&#93;](#cite_note-furcy-4)(BULB). The resulting search algorithms are[anytime algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anytime_algorithm)that find good but likely sub-optimal solutions quickly, like beam search, then backtrack and continue to find improved solutions until convergence to an optimal solution.\nIn the context of a[local search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_search_(optimization)), we call*local beam search*a specific algorithm that begins selecting&#x03B2;{\\\\displaystyle \\\\beta }![{\\displaystyle \\beta }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7ed48a5e36207156fb792fa79d29925d2f7901e8)randomly generated states and then, for each level of the search tree, it always considers&#x03B2;{\\\\displaystyle \\\\beta }![{\\displaystyle \\beta }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7ed48a5e36207156fb792fa79d29925d2f7901e8)new states among all the possible successors of the current ones, until it reaches a goal.[&#91;10&#93;](#cite_note-10)[&#91;11&#93;](#cite_note-iitb-11)\nSince local beam search often ends up on local maxima, a common solution is to choose the next&#x03B2;{\\\\displaystyle \\\\beta }![{\\displaystyle \\beta }](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/7ed48a5e36207156fb792fa79d29925d2f7901e8)states in a random way, with a probability dependent from the heuristic evaluation of the states.

      "text": "A Beam Search Based Parallel Algorithm for the Two-Dimensional\nStrip Packing Problem\nYajie Wena,1, Defu Zhangb,\u2217,2\nXiamen University, Siming south street 443, Xiamen, 361000, Fujian, China\nA R T I C L E I N F O\nKeywords:\nTwo-dimensional strip-packing\nHeuristic\nBeam search algorithm\nA B S T R A C T\nThis paper introduces BSPA, a parallel algorithm that leverages beam search to address the two\u0002dimensional strip packing problem. The study begins with a comprehensive review of existing ap\u0002proaches and methodologies, followed by a detailed presentation of the BSPA algorithm. Experimental\nresults demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. To facilitate further research, both the\ncode and datasets are publicly available.\n1. Introduction\nGiven a set of \ud835\udc5b rectangular boxes and a container with a\nfixed width \ud835\udc4a and infinite length, the two-dimensional strip\npacking (2DSP) problem involves arranging all the boxes\nwithin the container such that the total length used by the\nboxes is minimized.\nThe two-dimensional strip packing problem is widely ap\u0002plied in industries such as metal processing, wood process\u0002ing, glass manufacturing, and furniture production, where it\nis necessary to cut various shapes and sizes of small parts\nfrom large sheets of raw material. The 2DSP problem helps\noptimize cutting plans, enhancing raw material utilization\nand minimizing waste. For example, different components\nsuch as table tops and chair legs must be cut from standard\u0002sized wood boards in furniture manufacturing. By applying\nan effective two-dimensional strip packing algorithm, the\noptimal cutting sequence and layout can be determined.\nThe 2DSP problem can be classified into four categories\nbased on whether box rotation is allowed and whether guil\u0002lotine cuts are required. Moreover, guillotine refers to a type\nof cut where the cutting action spans from one side to the\nother:\n\u2022 RF: Rotation is allowed, and no guillotine cut is re\u0002quired.\n\u2022 RG: Rotation is allowed, and a guillotine cut is required.\n\u2022 OF: Rotation is forbidden, and no guillotine cut is\nrequired.\n\u2022 OG: Rotation is forbidden, and a guillotine cut is re\u0002quired.\nThis paper explicitly addresses the RF and OF cases,\nwhich require a guillotine cut, and considers the constraints\non box rotation.\n\u2217\u2217Corresponding author\n23020201153806@stu.xmu.edu.cn (Y.

Related work\nThe two-dimensional strip packing problem (2DSP) has\ngarnered significant attention over several decades due to its\ntheoretical complexity (NP-hard) and practical importance\nin logistics, manufacturing, and resource optimization. Ex\u0002isting approaches to solving the 2DSP can be categorized\ninto three primary paradigms: exact algorithms, heuristic\nalgorithms, and emerging machine learning-based methods.\nThe subsequent section offers a comprehensive overview of\nkey advancements within each category.\n1.2. Exact algorithms\nEarly research on the two-dimensional strip packing\nproblem (2DSP) primarily focused on exact algorithms to\nguarantee optimal solutions, albeit at significant computa\u0002tional cost. Over time, these exact approaches were refined.\nHifi (1998) combined branch-and-bound with dynamic pro\u0002gramming, while Martello et al. (2003) and Kenmochi et al.\n(2009) developed specialized branch-and-bound algorithms\ntailored specifically for the 2DSP. C\u00f4t\u00e9 et al. (2014) intro\u0002duced column generation to obtain exact solutions. To ad\u0002dress guillotine constraints, Messaoud et al. (2008) proposed\npolynomial-time feasibility checks, and Fleszar (2016) fur\u0002ther advanced the concept of stage-unrestricted guillotine\ncutting.\nEfforts to reduce computational costs through paral\u0002lelization were also explored. B\u0105k et al. (2011) proposed\na parallel branch-and-bound algorithm, and Boschetti and\nMontaletti (2010) developed reduction procedures aimed\nat enhancing efficiency. Despite these advancements, exact\nmethods remain impractical for large-scale instances due to\ntheir exponential time complexity.\nWhile exact algorithms provide theoretical rigour, they\nprimarily apply to small-scale or highly constrained in\u0002stances, as their computational demands become prohibitively\nhigh for larger problem sizes.\n1.3. Heuristic algorithms\nHeuristic methods have become the predominant ap\u0002proach for solving the two-dimensional strip packing prob\u0002lem, offering a practical balance between computational\nefficiency and solution quality. Early contributions by Baker\nYajie Wen: Preprint submitted to Elsevier Page 1 of 9\narXiv:2503.08711v1 [math.OC] 10 Mar 2025\net al. (1980) introduced the Bottom-Up Left-Justified (BL)\nalgorithm, which laid the foundation for approximation\nbounds in packing problems. This seminal work was further\nrefined by Chazelle (1983), who optimized the bottom-left\nheuristic to enhance the efficiency of placement reporting.\nBuilding upon the BL algorithm, subsequent studies intro\u0002duced several noteworthy variants. Liu and Teng (1999)\nimproved packing density by leveraging permutation-based\npatterns, while Wei et al. (2011) incorporated greedy selec\u0002tion techniques combined with tabu search, demonstrating\nthe versatility of heuristics in this domain.\nA significant advancement in heuristic methods was\nmade by Burke et al. (2004), who proposed a best-fit heuris\u0002tic for strip packing. This approach was subsequently ex\u0002tended by A\u015f\u0131k and \u00d6zcan (2009) and \u00d6zcan et al. (2013),\nwho introduced bidirectional niche placement and com\u0002pound polygon evaluation, further improving the quality of\nthe solutions. The application of genetic algorithms (GAs)\nas a metaheuristic gained prominence, with Kr\u00f6ger (1995)\npioneering their use for rectangle packing problems. Yeung\nand Tang (2004) later hybridized GAs with a left-fit-bottom\nheuristic, and Bortfeldt (2006) refined this hybrid approach\nspecifically for strip packing, showcasing the potential of\nevolutionary algorithms in solving complex packing prob\u0002lems. Iterative heuristics, such as those proposed by Belov\net al. (2008) with the SVC and BLR methods and He\net al. (2013) with a deterministic heuristic (DHA), have also\ncontributed to the advancement of strip packing techniques.\nIn parallel, recursive and block-based strategies emerged\nas effective alternatives. Cui et al. (2008) developed the\nHRBB algorithm, applying recursive branch-and-bound\ntechniques to the strip packing problem. Building on this,\nCui et al. (2013) introduced the Sequential Grouping and\nValue Correction Procedure (SGVCP), which iteratively re\u0002fines packing layouts to optimize overall efficiency. Wei et al.\n(2016) proposed a three-stage intelligent search algorithm\nthat combines greedy, local, and randomized improvement\nmethods, achieving superior performance compared to ex\u0002isting metaheuristic approaches.\nThe exploration of greedy randomized adaptive search\n(GRASP) methods also gained traction. Alvarez-Vald\u00e9s et al.\n(2008) introduced a reactive GRASP algorithm, which was\nlater refined by Oviedo-Salas et al. (2022), further enhancing\nthe performance of these techniques. Hybrid approaches,\nsuch as the Hybrid Heuristic Algorithm (HHA) proposed by\nChen et al. (2019), which integrates greedy and local search\nmethods, and adaptive learning enhancements by Rako\u0002tonirainy and van Vuuren (2020), have further advanced\nthe effectiveness of metaheuristics in solving strip packing\nproblems.\nRecent innovations in the field include Zhang et al.\n(2024), who introduced the Block-Based Heuristic Search\nAlgorithm (BBHSA), optimizing block-level layouts and\nreducing fragmentation. Grandcolas and Pain-Barre (2022)\nproposed the PVS strategy, merging local search with exact\nverification techniques. Additionally, Wei et al. (2017, 2019)\ndeveloped the BestFitPack and FirstFitPack algorithms, fo\u0002cusing on bottom-left placement strategies and fitness eval\u0002uation to improve packing efficiency.\nTogether, these studies underscore the continuous de\u0002velopment of heuristic and metaheuristic approaches for\nthe two-dimensiona...",

Its key ingredient is a guidance heuristic that estimates the expected length (cost) to complete a partial solution. While this function is usually developed manually for a specific problem, we propose a more general Learning Beam Search (LBS) that uses a machine learning model for guidance. Learning is performed by utilizing principles of reinforcement learning: LBS generates training data on its own by performing nested BS calls on many representative randomly created problem instances. The general approach is tested on two specific problems, the longest common subsequence problem and the constrained variant thereof. Results on established sets of benchmark instances indicate that the BS with models trained via LBS is highly competitive. On many instances new so far best solutions could be obtained, making the approach a new state-of-the-art method for these problems and documenting the high potential of this general framework.\n\nen\n\nProject title:\n\nDoktoratskolleg \"Vienna Graduate School on Computational Optimization\": W1260-N35 (Fonds zur F\u00f6rderung der wissenschaftlichen Forschung (FWF))\n\n-\n\nResearch Areas:\n\nLogic and Computation: 100%\n\n-\n\nScience Branch:\n\n1020 - Informatik: 80%\n\n1010 - Mathematik: 20%\n\n-\n\nLicense:\n\n[In Copyright](http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC/1.0/)\n\nen\n\nAppears in Collections:\n\n[Conference Paper](https://repositum.tuwien.at/handle/20.500.12708/7)\n\n[![Thumbnail](https://repositum.tuwien.at/retrieve/231581/Huber-2022-Learning%20Beam%20Search%20Utilizing%20Machine%20Learning%20toGuide%20Beam%20Se...-am.pdf.jpg)](https://repositum.tuwien.at/bitstream/20.500.12708/142532/1/Huber-2022-Learning%20Beam%20Search%20Utilizing%20Machine%20Learning%20toGuide%20Beam%20Se...-am.pdf)\n\n[Fulltext\\\n(Accepted Version)](https://repositum.tuwien.at/bitstream/20.500.12708/142532/1/Huber-2022-Learning%20Beam%20Search%20Utilizing%20Machine%20Learning%20toGuide%20Beam%20Se...-am.pdf)\n\nAdobe PDF\n\n(322.43 kB)\n\n![Open Access](https://repositum.tuwien.at/image/open-access.png)[In Copyright 1.0](http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC/1.0/)\n\n* * *\n\n[Show full item record](https://repositum.tuwien.at/handle/20.500.12708/142532?mode=full)\n\n#### Page view(s)\n\n442\n\nchecked on Nov 23, 2023\n\n#### Download(s)\n\n87\n\nchecked on Nov 23, 2023\n\n![](https://repositum.tuwien.at/image/google_scholar_logo.png)\n\n#### Google ScholarTM\n\n[Check](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?as_q=&as_epq=Learning+Beam+Search%3A+Utilizing+Machine+Learning+to%C2%A0Guide+Beam+Search+for%C2%A0Solving+Combinatorial+Optimization+Problems&as_occt=title)",

Solutions, encoded as sequences, are typically generated from trained models via beam search, a search algorithm that generates sequences token-by-token while keeping a fixed number of promising partial solutions at each step. In this paper, we explore the problem of augmenting beam search generation with the enforcement of requirements---hard constraints that any generated solution must adhere to. We propose a hybrid approach, by encoding the requirements in the form of a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) and iteratively solving the CSP to cut any partial solution within the beam search that is incapable of satisfying the requirements. We study this problem in the context of vehicle routing problems (VRP) further augmented with capacity-related or temporal requirements. We experimentally show that cuts often allow us to satisfy the requirements with negligible impact on solution quality. Without the use of cuts, beam search is shown to be exponentially less likely to satisfy the requirements as the length of the solution increases and/or the requirements are strengthened.\n[![SoCS-2024 Proceedings Cover](https://ojs.aaai.org/public/journals/7/socs24.jpg)](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/SOCS/issue/view/607)\n## Downloads\n- [PDF](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/SOCS/article/view/31549/33709)\n## Published\n2024-06-01\n## Issue\n[Vol. 17 (2024): Seventeenth International Symposium on Combinatorial Search](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/SOCS/issue/view/607)\n## Section\nLong Papers\n[![More information about the publishing system, Platform and Workflow by OJS/PKP.](https://ojs.aaai.org/templates/images/ojs_brand.png)](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/SOCS/about/aboutThisPublishingSystem)",

It is an adaptation of the branch and bound method in which only some nodes are evaluated in the search tree. At any level, only the promising nodes are kept for further branching and remaining nodes are pruned off permanently. In this paper, we develop a beam search based scheduling algorithm for the job shop problem. Both the makespan and mean tardiness are used as the performance measures. The proposed algorithm is also compared with other well known search methods and dispatching rules for a wide variety of problems. The results indicate that the beam search technique is a very competitive and promising tool which deserves further research in the scheduling literature.\n\n## Introduction\n\nBeam search is a heuristic method for solving optimization problems. It is an adaptation of the branch and bound method in which only some nodes are evaluated. In this search method, at any level only the promising nodes are kept for further branching and the remaining nodes are pruned off permanently. Since a large part of the search tree is pruned off aggressively to obtain a solution, its running time is polynomial in the size of the problems.\n\nThis search technique was first used in artificial intelligence for the speech recognition problem (Lowerre, 1976). There have been a number of applications reported in the literature since then. Fox (1983)used beam search for solving complex scheduling problems by a system called ISIS. Later, Ow and Morton (1988)studied the effects of using different evaluation functions to guide the search and compare the performance of beam search with other heuristics for the single machine early/tardy problem and the flow shop problem. They also proposed a variation of this technique called the filtered beam search and found optimal settings of the search parameters.\n\nIn another study, Chang et al. (1989)used beam search as a part of their FMS scheduling algorithm called bottleneck-based beam search (BBBS). Results indicate that BBBS outperforms widely used dispatching rules for the makespan criterion. Another beam search application to FMSs is reported by De and Lee (1990)who showed that the solution quality of filtered beam search algorithm is better than depth-first type heuristics in terms of the average maximum lateness and average flowtime measures. The authors also showed that beam search was better than breadth first type heuristics in terms of number of nodes created during the search. In another study, Hatzikonstantis and Besant (1992)proposed a heuristic called _A_\\\\* for the job shop problem with the makespan criterion. _A_\\\\* algorithm is very similar to the beam search method. The only difference is that _A_\\\\* algorithm is a best-first search based heuristic and aims to find minimum-cost paths in search trees. Computational tests indicate that this heuristic search algorithm performs better than dispatching rules. Finally, Sabuncuoglu and Karabuk (1998)proposed a filtered beam search algorithm for more complex FMS environment in which AGVs are explicitly modeled in addition to the routing and sequence flexibilities. Their computational experiments show that the beam search performs better than the machine and AGV scheduling rules under all experimental conditions for the makespan, mean flow time and mean tardiness criteria. Their results also indicate that the beam search based scheduling algorithm exploits flexibilities inherent in FMS more effectively than other methods. An overview of the beam search and its applications to optimization problems can be found in Morton and Pentico (1993).\n\nEven though beam search has been used to solve a wide variety of optimization problems, its performance is not generally known for scheduling problems. Because, in the existing research work, beam search is primarily applied to the FMS scheduling problem with additional considerations on MHS finite buffer capacities and flexibilities and compared with only some dispatching rules. Hence, its relative performances with respect to the known optimum solution and other recently developed heuristics are not known. Besides, it has not been thoroughly studied as a problem solving strategy with certain evaluation functions and search parameters.\n\nThis paper attempts to achieve some of these objectives. First of all, we measure the performance of beam search (with respect to optimum solutions) and compare it with other well-known algorithms. In addition, we investigate the effectiveness of various rules as local and global functions of the beam search applications. The previous research indicates that the values of filter and beam width affect the performance of the beam search. Hence, we also examine the performance of beam search for various values of filter and beam width and find their proper values. Furthermore, we test two well-known schedule generation schemes (active and nondelay schedule generation schemes) in the context of the beam search applications to the job shop problems.\n\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2gives definitions of the job shop problem. Then a beam search based algorithm is developed for the problem. This is followed by a discussion on test problems and computational experience with the proposed algorithm. The paper ends with concluding remarks and suggestions for further research.\n\n## Section snippets\n\n## Problem definition\n\nThe job shop problem is to determine the start and completion time of operations of a set of jobs on a set of machines, subject to the constraint that each machine can handle at most one job at a time (capacity constraints) and each job has a specified processing order through the machines (precedence ...",

Recovering Beam Search is a recently introduced method for obtaining approximate solutions to combinatorial optimization problems. A traditional Beam Search algorithm is a type of truncated branch and bound algorithm approach. However, Recovering Beam Search allows the possibility of correcting wrong decisions by replacing partial solutions with others. We develop a Recovering Beam Search algorithm for our unrelated parallel machine scheduling problem that requires polynomial time. Computational results show that it is able to generate approximate solutions for instances with large size (up to 1000 jobs) using a few minutes of computation time.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThis paper considers the problem of scheduling independent jobs _J_ 1,\u2026, _J_ _n_ on parallel machines _M_ 1,\u2026, _M_ _m_ in order to minimize the maximum completion time, which is commonly known as the makespan. Each job _J_ _j_, for _j_ =1,\u2026, _n_, can be assigned to any one of the machines and requires a positive integer processing time _p_ _ij_ on machine _M_ _i_, for _i_ =1,\u2026, _m_. No machine can process two jobs at the same time and preemption is not allowed (once the processing of a job on a machine has started, it must be completed without interruption on that machine). All jobs are available for processing at time zero, and there are no precedence constraints among them.\n\nIn the case that _p_ _ij_= _p_ _j_ for each job _J_ _j_ and each machine _M_ _i_, the machines are said to be _identical_. If _p_ _ij_= _p_ _j_/ _s_ _i_, where _s_ _i_ is the speed of machine _M_ _i_, the machines are _uniform_. In the general case, the machines are _unrelated_. Following the standard three-field scheduling problems classification scheme \\[6\\], the above problems are denoted as _P_ \u2225 _C_ max, _Q_ \u2225 _C_ max and _R_ \u2225 _C_ max, respectively.\n\nThe unrelated parallel machines problem is known to be _NP-hard_ in the strong sense, since the special case with identical machines is known to be so \\[5\\]. Lenstra et al. \\[10\\] have shown that no polynomial time algorithm exists for the general _R_ \u2225 _C_ max problem with a better worst-case ratio than 3/2 unless _P_ = _NP_.\n\nMuch research effort has been invested on the design of approximations algorithms: the main contributions are provided by Horowitz and Sahni \\[8\\], Ibarra and Kim\\[9\\], De and Morton \\[2\\], Davis and Jaffe \\[1\\], Potts \\[14\\], Lenstra et al. \\[10\\] and Hariri and Potts \\[7\\]. Lower bounds for the problem are presented by Palekar et al. \\[13\\]. Van de Velde \\[16\\] develops a branch and bound method, and heuristic algorithms, based on a dual approach. Recently, Srivastava \\[15\\] has proposed a tabu search algorithm for the problem, while Martello et al. \\[11\\] introduce improved lower bounds obtained through cuts which eliminate infeasible disjunctions on the cost function value, and use these bounds to obtain exact and heuristic algorithms. They show that their methods outperform the most effective of the previous algorithms.\n\nThe aim of this paper is to present a new heuristic for the problem. The heuristic is an application of the recently introduced Recovering Beam Search (RBS) method for combinatorial optimization problems \\[3\\]. The RBS approach yields good results for the two-machine total completion time flow shop problem, for the uncapacitated _p_-median problem, and for the single-machine total completion time scheduling problem where jobs have individual release times \\[4\\]. An RBS algorithm is a beam search procedure \\[12\\] (in which each node is evaluated by means of a weighted sum of lower and upper bounds). Once the best _w_ nodes ( _w_ is the so-called _beam width_) are selected, a recovering step is applied in order to check whether each current partial solution is dominated by another partial solution at the same level of the search tree: if this is the case, the node is substituted by the improved partial solution.\n\nThe organization of this paper is as follows. In Section 2 the RBS approach is reviewed. Section 3 contains some lower and upper bounds that are used in our RBS algorithm. In Section 4, we propose an RBS algorithm for the unrelated parallel machine scheduling problem, _R_ \u2225 _C_ max. Computational results are presented in Section 5 and some concluding remarks are contained in Section 6.\n\n## Section snippets\n\n## The RBS method\n\nThe aim of this section is to review the main steps of the _Recovering Beam Search_ (RBS) approach \\[3\\] for combinatorial optimization problems.\n\nBeam Search is a well established heuristic derivative of branch and bound. It consists of a truncated branch and bound in which only the most promising _w_ nodes at each level of the search tree are selected as nodes to branch from, where _w_ is the so-called _beam width_. Obviously, the larger is the beam width the slower is the algorithm. The node evaluation\n\n## Lower and upper bounds\n\nIn this section, some well-known lower and upper bounds for the problem are reviewed. In Section 3.1, a mathematical formulation of the problem is given, and then a surrogate relaxation is described in order to obtain a lower bound for the problem. In Section 3.2, we review the upper bounding procedure _APPROX_, which is proposed by Martello et al. \\[11\\].\n\n## Proposed RBS procedure\n\nIn this section, the application of RBS to our unrelated parallel machine scheduling problem _R_ \u2225 _C_ max is presented. The following subsections contain descriptions of the main components of the algorithm: the branching scheme (Section 4.1), the filtering phase (Section 4.2), the node evaluation criteria (Section 4.3), and the recovering ste...",
