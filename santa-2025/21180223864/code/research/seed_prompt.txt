## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.630478 from exp_009/exp_010
- Best LB score: 70.6305 (PERFECT CALIBRATION - CV = LB exactly!)
- Target: 68.919154 | Gap to target: 1.711 points (2.42%)
- Submissions used: 6/100 (84 remaining)

## CV-LB Relationship Analysis
- Perfect calibration: CV = LB exactly (70.630478 = 70.6305)
- This is an optimization problem, not ML - no distribution shift
- The score is deterministic - what we compute locally IS the LB score

## Response to Evaluator
The evaluator correctly identified that:
1. All public sources are exhausted (best possible = 70.630478)
2. Random restart SA, exhaustive search, and genetic algorithms found NO improvements
3. The current solutions are at or very near optimal for local optimization

**I AGREE with the evaluator's assessment.** The key insight is that we need FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT approaches, not variations of SA or local search.

## Critical Insight from Web Research
Top teams achieving sub-69 scores use THREE different packers:
1. **Chebyshev-distance square-packing** - place trees on a regular grid using Chebyshev metric
2. **Smart Scanline linear packer** - sweep a line, insert each tree at first feasible position
3. **2-tree alternating lattice** - tile with pairs of trees alternating up/down orientations

They run ALL THREE for each N=1-200 and pick the smallest sn. This per-N selection is the core strategy.

## Score Analysis
- Small N (1-10): 4.33 points (6.1%) - highest per-N scores, most room for improvement
- Medium N (11-50): 14.71 points (20.8%)
- Large N (51-100): 17.62 points (24.9%)
- Very Large N (101-150): 17.14 points (24.3%)
- Huge N (151-200): 16.84 points (23.8%)

**Key insight**: N=1 alone contributes 0.661 points. If we could reduce N=1 score by 50%, we'd save 0.33 points!

## What We've Tried (ALL FAILED to improve beyond 70.630478)
1. ❌ Random restart SA for N=1-10 - NO improvements
2. ❌ Exhaustive search for N=1,2 - baseline already optimal
3. ❌ Genetic algorithm for N=10 - NO improvements
4. ❌ Tessellation SA - WORSE than baseline
5. ❌ Deletion cascade from large N - NO improvements
6. ❌ Ensemble from 25 public sources - hit ceiling at 70.630478
7. ❌ bbox3 optimizer - NO improvements
8. ❌ sa_v1_parallel optimizer - NO improvements

## Recommended Approaches (Priority Order)
1. **[HIGHEST PRIORITY] Smart Scanline linear packer**
   - Sweep a horizontal/vertical line across the space
   - Insert each tree at the first feasible position that doesn't increase bounding box
   - Linear-time heuristic that may find different local optima
   - This is a CONSTRUCTIVE heuristic (builds solution piece by piece) rather than iterative improvement

2. **[HIGH PRIORITY] 2-tree alternating lattice**
   - Tile the plane with pairs of trees alternating "up" and "down" orientations
   - Timothy Zhou reported this reaches score ~74 as baseline
   - May find better configurations for specific N values

3. **[HIGH PRIORITY] Chebyshev-distance square-packing**
   - Place trees on a regular grid using Chebyshev metric
   - Different from zaburo grid (which was worse)
   - May find better configurations for specific N values

4. **[MEDIUM PRIORITY] Per-N optimization with different parameters**
   - Run C++ optimizer with different parameters for different N ranges

## SUBMISSION STRATEGY
- Remaining submissions: 84
- **SUBMIT after EVERY experiment** - we have abundant submissions
- LB feedback is FREE information - use it!

## What NOT to Try
- More SA variations (exhausted)
- More ensemble from public sources (exhausted)
- Random restart approaches (exhausted)
- Genetic algorithms (exhausted)

## Validation Notes
- Use Shapely for overlap detection (matches Kaggle's checker)
- CV = LB exactly - no calibration issues
- Score formula: sum(sn^2 / n) for n=1 to 200
