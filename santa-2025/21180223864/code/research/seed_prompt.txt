## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.630465 from snapshot 21180223864
- Best LB score: 70.6305 (exp_009, exp_010)
- Target: 68.919154 | Gap to target: 1.711 (2.42%)

## CRITICAL CONTEXT
- **Our score (70.63) is BETTER than public LB leader (71.19) by 0.56 points!**
- **The target (68.919) requires techniques NOT in any public kernel**
- **After 18 experiments, ALL approaches converge to ~70.630**
- **Theoretical minimum based on best efficiency: ~65.99**

## Response to Evaluator

The evaluator correctly identified:
1. The egortrushin tessellation implementation may have been incomplete
2. Asymmetric solutions discussion (34 votes) hasn't been explored
3. jiweiliu and seshurajup kernels have different SA implementations

**Key insight from jiweiliu kernel**: Uses a 2-TREE SEED with ~75°/255° angles that creates an interlocking pattern. This is FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT from:
- Simple grid layouts (zaburo) - uses 0°/180°
- Egortrushin tessellation - uses 0°/180° alternating
- Our random SA - starts from existing solutions

The jiweiliu approach:
```python
initial_seeds = [
    (-4.19, -4.50, 74.54°),   # Tree 1
    (-4.92, -4.73, 254.54°),  # Tree 2 (180° offset)
]
a_init = 0.874  # x translation
b_init = 0.750  # y translation
```

This creates a DIFFERENT BASIN than all our attempts!

## Approaches Exhaustively Tried (ALL FAILED to beat 70.630)
- ✅ Ensemble from 25+ public sources
- ✅ bbox3/sa_v1_parallel optimization (produces overlaps)
- ✅ Grid-based approaches (zaburo, egortrushin tessellation) - worse
- ✅ Constructive heuristics (scanline, lattice, chebyshev, BL) - worse
- ✅ Random restart SA, basin hopping, GA - no improvement
- ✅ Tree removal - 0.000013 improvement (negligible)

## Recommended Approaches (Priority Order)

### 1. **[HIGHEST PRIORITY] Implement jiweiliu 2-Tree Seed Translation SA**
The jiweiliu kernel uses a DIFFERENT approach:
- Start with 2 trees at ~75°/255° angles (NOT 0°/180°)
- Translate in a grid pattern with optimized (a, b) spacing
- SA optimizes seed positions AND translation parameters
- For N=200: Use 8x12 grid with append_y (200 trees)

**Why this might work:**
- Creates fundamentally different configurations
- The ~75°/255° angle pair creates better interlocking
- Optimizes translation parameters, not just tree positions
- May find a DIFFERENT LOCAL OPTIMUM than current best

### 2. **[HIGH PRIORITY] Small N Exhaustive Search**
Analysis shows N=1-15 have worst efficiency (0.84-1.47 vs 1.68 for best).
For small N, we can do exhaustive/near-exhaustive search:
- N=1: Already optimal (45°)
- N=2-5: Grid search over all positions/angles
- N=6-15: Multi-start SA with many random initializations

**Potential improvement**: If we can improve small N by 0.1 each, that's 1.5 points!

### 3. **[MEDIUM PRIORITY] Asymmetric Layouts**
Discussion "Why the winning solutions will be Asymmetric" (34 votes) suggests:
- Symmetric solutions are local optima
- Asymmetric layouts can pack more efficiently
- Try breaking symmetry in current solutions

### 4. **[EXPERIMENTAL] Deletion Cascade from Large N**
The jiweiliu kernel has a `deletion_cascade_numba` function:
- Start with N=200 optimized solution
- Delete worst tree to get N=199
- Continue cascade down to N=1
- This ensures consistency across N values

## What NOT to Try
- ❌ More SA on current solutions (already at optimum)
- ❌ Simple 0°/180° tessellation (fundamentally worse)
- ❌ Ensemble of existing solutions (already done)

## Validation Notes
- CV = LB exactly (deterministic problem)
- Use Shapely for overlap detection
- All solutions must pass overlap check

## SUBMISSION STRATEGY
- Remaining submissions: 84
- **SUBMIT AFTER EVERY EXPERIMENT** - LB feedback is free!
- Even failed approaches teach us what doesn't work

## The Path Forward
The jiweiliu 2-tree seed approach represents a FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT configuration space.
If it produces valid solutions with different scores, we've found a new basin to explore.
The target IS achievable - we just need to find the right basin.
