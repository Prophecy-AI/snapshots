## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.630465 from exp_017 (cross_n_extraction)
- Best LB score: 70.6305 (from exp_009, exp_010)
- Target: 68.919154 | Gap to target: 1.711 points (2.42%)

## CRITICAL CONTEXT
- **Our score (70.630) is BETTER than public LB leader (terry_u16 at 71.19) by 0.56 points!**
- The target (68.919) is 2.27 points BELOW the public leader
- This means the target requires techniques NOT in any public kernel
- We have 84 submissions remaining - USE THEM for LB feedback!

## CV-LB Relationship Analysis
- This is a DETERMINISTIC optimization problem: CV = LB exactly
- No distribution shift - the gap is due to the baseline being at a local optimum
- All 6 submissions confirm CV = LB (70.6473 = 70.6473, 70.6305 = 70.6305)

## Response to Evaluator
The evaluator correctly identified that:
1. The baseline is at an EXTREMELY strong local optimum (confirmed by exhaustive extraction)
2. Incremental improvements (0.00001345) cannot close a 1.71 point gap
3. We need FUNDAMENTALLY different approaches

**I agree with the evaluator's assessment.** The exhaustive cross-N extraction and tree removal approaches both found the SAME tiny improvement, confirming the baseline is at a very strong local optimum. We must pivot to approaches that create configurations in DIFFERENT basins.

## What Has Been Tried (17 experiments)
✅ Ensemble from 25+ public sources (ceiling at 70.630478)
✅ bbox3 optimization (produces overlapping trees)
✅ sa_v1_parallel optimization (produces overlapping trees)
✅ Grid-based approaches (zaburo, tessellation) - fundamentally worse
✅ Constructive heuristics (scanline, lattice, chebyshev, BL) - all worse
✅ Random restart SA - no improvement
✅ Long-running SA (15 generations) - no improvement
✅ Basin hopping (scipy and custom) - no improvement
✅ Genetic algorithm with crossover - no improvement
✅ Tree removal technique - tiny improvement (0.000013)
✅ Rebuild from corners - SAME tiny improvement (0.000013)
✅ Exhaustive search for N=1,2 - baseline already optimal
✅ Constraint programming analysis - baseline at/near global optimum
✅ Cross-N extraction (exhaustive) - SAME tiny improvement
✅ Exhaustive tree removal - SAME tiny improvement

## What Has NOT Been Tried (Priority Order)

### 1. **[HIGHEST PRIORITY] EGORTRUSHIN TESSELLATION SA WITH TRANSLATIONS**
The egortrushin kernel shows a FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT approach:
- Uses a **2-tree unit cell** (two trees with specific relative positions)
- **Tessellates** this unit cell in a grid pattern
- Optimizes with **SA using translations** (not individual tree movements)

Grid configurations:
- N=72: [4,9] grid = 36 positions × 2 trees = 72 trees
- N=100: [5,10] grid = 50 positions × 2 trees = 100 trees
- N=110: [5,11] grid
- N=144: [6,12] grid
- N=156: [6,13] grid
- N=196: [7,14] grid
- N=200: [7,15] grid = 105 positions × 2 trees = 210 trees, delete 10 worst

**Why this might work:**
- Creates configurations in a DIFFERENT basin than individual tree optimization
- The unit cell approach constrains the search space in a beneficial way
- For N=200, optimizing 210 trees then deleting 10 worst is a DIFFERENT approach

**Implementation:**
```python
# Initial 2-tree unit cell
initial_trees = [
    ChristmasTree('0', '0', '0'),
    ChristmasTree('0.4', '0.5', '180')
]

# Tessellate with translations
for i in range(nx):
    for j in range(ny):
        for tree in initial_trees:
            new_tree = tree.clone()
            new_tree.translate(i * tx, j * ty)
            trees.append(new_tree)

# SA with translation optimization (not individual tree movements)
```

### 2. **[HIGH PRIORITY] ASYMMETRIC PACKING LAYOUTS**
Discussion "Why the winning solutions will be Asymmetric" (34 votes) suggests:
- Top teams use asymmetric layouts that beat symmetric approaches
- Replace bottom-left with 'minimum waste corner' or 'largest gap fit' placement
- Allow free/multi-angle rotation
- Integrate allocation and placement together

### 3. **[MEDIUM PRIORITY] VERY HIGH TEMPERATURE SA FROM RANDOM INITIAL**
All SA runs started from the baseline or grid-based solutions.
Try:
- Random initial configurations with VERY high temperature
- Goal: find a DIFFERENT basin, not optimize within the current one
- Use temperature high enough to completely scramble the solution

### 4. **[MEDIUM PRIORITY] HYBRID: TESSELLATION + TREE DELETION**
- Generate tessellation solutions for specific N values
- Then apply tree deletion to create solutions for N-1, N-2, etc.
- Combines structural benefits of tessellation with extraction

## Recommended Approaches for Next Experiment

**EXPERIMENT 018: EGORTRUSHIN TESSELLATION SA**

Implement the full egortrushin approach:
1. Create 2-tree unit cell with initial positions
2. Tessellate for target N values: 72, 100, 110, 144, 156, 196, 200
3. Run SA with translation optimization (optimize unit cell positions, not individual trees)
4. For N=200: create 210 trees, optimize, delete 10 worst
5. Compare with baseline for each N
6. If any N improves, apply tree deletion to create solutions for smaller N

**Key parameters from egortrushin:**
```python
config = {
    "params": {
        "Tmax": 1.0,
        "Tmin": 0.001,
        "nsteps": 10000,
        "nsteps_per_T": 100,
        "cooling": "exponential",
        "alpha": 0.99,
        "position_delta": 0.1,
        "angle_delta": 10,
        "delta1": 0.01,
        "log_freq": 1000
    }
}
```

## SUBMISSION STRATEGY
- Remaining submissions: 84
- **SUBMIT after this experiment** - we have abundant submissions
- Even if the tessellation approach is worse, LB feedback tells us what DOESN'T work
- The target IS achievable - keep searching for fundamentally different approaches

## What NOT to Try
- More extraction-based approaches (exhaustively tried, found same tiny improvement)
- More SA on the current baseline (it's at a strong local optimum)
- Grid-based approaches without tessellation SA (fundamentally worse)
- Incremental optimizations (can't close 1.71 point gap with 0.00001 improvements)

## Validation Notes
- CV = LB exactly (deterministic problem)
- Use Shapely for overlap detection (matches Kaggle validation)
- Verify no overlaps before submission

## Key Insight
The target of 68.919 IS achievable. Our current score (70.630) is already BETTER than the public LB leader (71.19). The target requires techniques that create configurations in DIFFERENT basins than the current optimum. The egortrushin tessellation SA approach is the most promising unexplored direction.
