## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.630478 from exp_009/exp_010
- Best LB score: 70.6305 (PERFECT CALIBRATION - CV = LB exactly!)
- Target: 68.919154 | Gap to target: 1.711 points (2.42%)
- Submissions used: 6/100 (84 remaining)

## CV-LB Relationship Analysis
- Perfect calibration: CV = LB exactly (70.630478 = 70.6305)
- This is an optimization problem, not ML - no distribution shift
- The score is deterministic - what we compute locally IS the LB score

## Response to Evaluator
The evaluator correctly identified that:
1. Constructive heuristics (scanline, lattice, chebyshev, BLD) all produce WORSE solutions
2. The baseline uses sophisticated CONTINUOUS angle optimization (angles like 23.6°, 66.4°)
3. Simple heuristics cannot match this level of optimization

**I AGREE with the evaluator's recommendations:**
1. Run sa_v1_parallel for MUCH longer (20+ generations instead of 3)
2. Try different starting configurations (perturb baseline)
3. Try bbox3 with proper repair

**KEY INSIGHT from code analysis:**
- sa_v1_parallel has `max_retries = 3` - it stops after 3 generations with no improvement
- We need to either modify the code or run multiple times with different seeds

## What We've Tried (ALL FAILED to improve beyond 70.630478)
1. ❌ Random restart SA for N=1-10 - NO improvements
2. ❌ Exhaustive search for N=1,2 - baseline already optimal
3. ❌ Genetic algorithm for N=10 - NO improvements
4. ❌ Tessellation SA - WORSE than baseline
5. ❌ Deletion cascade from large N - NO improvements
6. ❌ Ensemble from 25 public sources - hit ceiling at 70.630478
7. ❌ bbox3 optimizer - NO improvements (produces overlaps)
8. ❌ sa_v1_parallel optimizer - NO improvements after 4 generations
9. ❌ Constructive heuristics (scanline, lattice, chebyshev, BLD) - ALL WORSE
10. ❌ Solution compaction - NO improvements
11. ❌ Angle optimization - NO improvements

## Recommended Approaches (Priority Order)

### 1. **[HIGHEST PRIORITY] Long-running SA with modified parameters**
The sa_v1_parallel optimizer stops too early (3 generations). Try:
```bash
# Modify sa_v1_parallel.cpp:
# Change max_retries from 3 to 20
# Change max_retry_retries from 3 to 20
# Recompile and run:
./sa_v1_parallel -i saspav_best.csv -o output.csv -n 100000 -r 20
```
Let it run for 2+ hours. The optimizer may find improvements with more compute.

### 2. **[HIGH PRIORITY] Perturbed starting configurations**
All optimization starts from the same baseline. Try:
```python
# Perturb baseline randomly before optimization
for tree in trees:
    tree.x += random.uniform(-0.001, 0.001)
    tree.y += random.uniform(-0.001, 0.001)
    tree.angle += random.uniform(-1, 1)
# Then run sa_v1_parallel on perturbed solution
```
This may help escape local optima.

### 3. **[HIGH PRIORITY] bbox3 with proper repair**
bbox3 was abandoned due to overlap issues. Try:
1. Run bbox3 optimization
2. Validate each N with Shapely
3. Replace overlapping N values with baseline
4. Keep only improvements

### 4. **[MEDIUM PRIORITY] Multiple random seeds**
Run sa_v1_parallel multiple times with different random seeds:
```bash
for seed in 1 2 3 4 5; do
    ./sa_v1_parallel -i best.csv -o output_$seed.csv -n 50000 -r 10 -s $seed
done
# Ensemble the results
```

### 5. **[MEDIUM PRIORITY] Per-N focused optimization**
Instead of optimizing all N at once, focus on specific N values:
- Identify N values with highest per-N scores
- Run intensive optimization just for those N values
- May find improvements that global optimization misses

## SUBMISSION STRATEGY
- Remaining submissions: 84
- **SUBMIT after EVERY experiment** - we have abundant submissions
- LB feedback is FREE information - use it!
- Even if score doesn't improve, submit to verify our CV-LB calibration

## What NOT to Try
- More constructive heuristics (all worse than baseline)
- More ensemble from public sources (exhausted at 70.630478)
- Random restart approaches (exhausted)
- Genetic algorithms (exhausted)
- Simple grid-based approaches (zaburo was 25% worse)

## Validation Notes
- Use Shapely for overlap detection (matches Kaggle's checker)
- CV = LB exactly - no calibration issues
- Score formula: sum(sn^2 / n) for n=1 to 200

## Critical Insight
The gap is 1.711 points (2.42%). This is significant but NOT impossible.
- If we improve large N (51-200) by 3.32%, we close the gap
- The baseline uses continuous angle optimization - we need to match or exceed this
- The target IS achievable - we just need to find the right approach

## Compute Budget
- ~35 hours remaining
- Running sa_v1_parallel for 2-4 hours is feasible
- We have time for multiple long optimization runs
