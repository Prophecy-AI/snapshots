Lower values encourage higher diversity among parent selection.\n\n  - Must be $\\\\ge 1$\n\n**Parameters for the Unified Tabu Search**\n\n- `ITERATION_NUMBER`: Specifies the maximum number of iterations (or moves) that the Tabu Search Algorithm will execute.\n\n- `TABU_LIST_SIZE`: Sets the size of the tabu list.\n\n\n**Shared Genetic and Tabu Search Parameters**\n\n- `KAPPA`: Controls the degree to which the initial population of solutions favors items based on their area ranking. Lower values encourage higher diversity among solutions.\n  - Must be $\\\\ge 1$\n\n**General Options**\n\n- `GUILLOTINE`: Boolean flag indicating whether guillotine cuts are included.\n\n- `ROTATION`: Boolean flag indicating whether rotating an items is allowed.\n\n- `SELECTED_METAHEURISTIC`: Specifies the metaheuristic selected for optimization.\n\n\n## Versions of the 2D Bin Packing Problem\n\nThe 2D Bin Packing Problem can be categorized based on whether the items can be rotated and whether the items must adhere to the guillotine cut property. Each version addresses different constraints:\n\n- **Rotation (0 or R)**:\n\n  - When rotation is not allowed (0), items must be placed in their original orientation.\n  - When rotation is allowed (R), items can be rotated to better fit within the bin, which can lead to higher space utilization.\n- **Guillotine Cut Property (F or G)**:\n\n  - Guillotine free (F) allows for more flexibility in item placement as cuts don't need to be considered.\n  - Guillotine cut property (G) requires that items be placed in a manner that allows for them to be separated from the bin using a series of edge-to-edge cuts. This mimics real-world cutting processes and often adds complexity to the problem.\n\nBy considering these variations, we can tackle different scenarios of the 2D Bin Packing Problem:\n\n- **2DBP \\| 0 \\| F**: Simplest form where items are placed in their original orientation without the need for guillotine cuts.\n- **2DBP \\| 0 \\| G**: Items must be placed in their original orientation and follow the guillotine cut property.\n- **2DBP \\| R \\| F**: Items can be rotated, offering flexibility, without needing to follow the guillotine cut property.\n- **2DBP \\| R \\| G**: Most complex form where items can be rotated and must follow the guillotine cut property.\n\n## Implementation\n\n### Problem Context\n\nTraditional methods represent solutions as static configurations of bins with assigned items. However, it becomes computationally expensive when we to compute all the neighbors, which are the possible moves from one solution to another. Each move involves checking all possible spaces where each item can potentially fit into another bin while ensuring that these moves adhere to the guillotine rule.\n\n### Rethin...",

The objective of this problem was to pack a given set of small rectangles, which may be rotated by 90\u00b0, without overlaps into a minimum numbers of identical large rectangles. Our aim was to improve the performance of the MultiCrossover Genetic Algorithm (MXGA) proposed from the literature for solving the problem. **Approach:** Four major components of the MXGA consisted of selection, crossover, mutation and replacement are considered in this study. Initial computational investigations were conducted independently on the named components using some benchmark problem instances. The new MXGA was constructed by combining the rank selection, modified Partially Mapped Crossover (PMXm), mutation with two mutation operators and elitism replacement scheme with filtration. **Results:** Extensive computational experiments of the new proposed algorithm, MXGA, Standard GA (SGA), Unified Tabu Search (UTS) and Randomized Descent Method (RDM) were performed using benchmark data sets. **Conclusion:** The computational results indicated that the new proposed algorithm was able to outperform MXGA, SGA, UTS and RDM.\n\n**Journal of Mathematics and Statistics**\n\nVolume 6 No. 2, 2010, 157-162\n\n**DOI:** [https://doi.org/10.3844/jmssp.2010.157.162](https://doi.org/10.3844/jmssp.2010.157.162)\n\n**Submitted On:** 12 March 2010\n**Published On:** 30 June 2010\n\n**How to Cite:** Sarabian, M. & Lee, L.

The approach is applicable to not only convex shaped objects, but can also accommodate any type of concave and complex shaped objects including objects with holes. In this approach, a new concept of a two-dimensional genetic chromosome is introduced. The total layout space is divided into a finite number of cells for mapping it into this 2D genetic algorithm chromosome. The mutation and crossover operators have been modified and are applied in conjunction with connectivity analysis for the objects to reduce the creation of faulty generations. A new feature has been added to the Genetic Algorithm (GA) in the form of a new operator called compaction.

The position is subject to confinement of no overlapping of blocks. The problem is a complex NP-hard combinatorial optimization, thus a heuristic based on genetic algorithm is proposed to solve it. In this paper, we give a hybrid approach which combined genetic encoding and evolution scheme with the proposed placement approach. Such a combination resulted in better population evolution and faster solution convergence to optimal. The approach is subjected to a comprehensive test using benchmark instances. The computation results validate the solution and the effectiveness of the approach.\n\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n\n### [A Genetic Algorithm for the Three-Dimensional Open Dimension Packing Problem](https://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-030-85672-4_15?fromPaywallRec=false)\n\nChapter\u00a9 2021\n\n### [Nonlinear Integer Planning Three-Dimensional Crate Model Based on Hybrid Genetic Algorithm](https://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-981-96-2391-4_50?fromPaywallRec=false)\n\nChapter\u00a9 2025\n\n### [Packing Compaction Algorithm for Rectangular Cutting and Orthogonal Packing Problems](https://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-319-95630-5_201?fromPaywallRec=false)\n\nChapter\u00a9 2019\n\n### Explore related subjects\n\nDiscover the latest articles, books and news in related subjects, suggested using machine learning.\n\n- [Computational Geometry](https://link.springer.com/subjects/computational-geometry)\n- [Discrete Optimization](https://link.springer.com/subjects/discrete-optimization)\n- [Genetic hybridization](https://link.springer.com/subjects/genetic-hybridization)\n- [Genetic Techniques](https://link.springer.com/subjects/genetic-techniques)\n- [Genome assembly algorithms](https://link.springer.com/subjects/genome-assembly-algorithms)\n- [Organizing materials with DNA](https://link.springer.com/subjects/organizing-materials-with-dna)\n\n[Use our pre-submission checklist](https://beta.springernature.com/pre-submission?journalId=40092)\n\nAvoid common mistakes on your manuscript.\n\n## Introduction\n\nManufacturing and production industries very often come across the problem where a given stock material must be cut into a smaller set of shapes. In this paper, we consider a two-dimensional orthogonal rectangular strip packing problem (SPP) NP-hard in nature (Garey and Johnson [1979](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40092-014-0047-9#ref-CR18); Bortfeldt [2013](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40092-014-0047-9#ref-CR9)). This class of combinatorial optimization finds significant relevance in different domains of operation research. In industries like paper and pulp, wood and textile, the problem is to determine how the arbitrary rectangular block set would be cut from the available stock. The problem variant like arrangement of articles, reports and advertisement is considered in the newspaper field. In pharmaceutical packing industry, many strip packaging approach seems ideal for high-speed sealing of coated or uncoated tablets, capsules or lozenges of any shape or size in aluminum foils, polythene, cellophane, etc. It is an interesting real-world industrial problem where the objective is to provide the best arrangement with the aim of waste minimization. There are two broad categories of the solution approach, namely exact and inexact. The major bottleneck with the exact approaches are that as the problem size grow and become complex, the computation time also grows exponentially. Thus, the researchers focus more on the inexact approach in comparison to exact.\n\n### Industrial application\n\nIn today\u2019s world of industrialization, mass production and high material utilization are the crucial factors for growing industries that necessitate the need of finding correct cutting patterns which may result in a small improvement. In the long term, it leads to huge economical saving. These problems occur at wide scale in many industries such as wood, textile, rubber, glass, etc., where the complexity is determined by the shape of the item to be cut and the number of applicable constraints. Textile and shipping industries basically deal with irregular shaped items. Automation in a packing system saves much economic time and is preferred over the manual system. One case study discussing strip cuttings in wooden industries is discussed in Lefran\u00e7ois and Gascon ( [1995](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40092-014-0047-9#ref-CR29)) for a manufacturer of prefabricated doors and windows. These industries follow a daily production schedule where the desired length which may be wood, steel, plastic, etc., are cut to smaller length, either by automation or by manual labor. The policy followed is basically to meet the higher demand length first, followed by others in order of their decreasing length. The main concern for these industries is efficient utilization of available resources with minimum scrap production. The shorter length stock incapable of fulfilling any order demand is termed as scrap. The textile industry also tackles this problem, but under a different heading, namely Nesting and Marker making. It involves finding the best layout for the cutting of irregular shapes, where the shapes are allowed a rotation from 0\u00b0 to 180\u00b0. Regular and irregular shape packing are addressed in the shipbuilding industries where it is required to investigate how the irregular size items can be packed and transported in huge containers. In today\u2019s scenario of surplus demand, an automated system is required for efficient packing thereby reducing the transportation damage risk. The packing problem is not limited to industries, but can also be seen in other dimensions like in very-large-scale integration design, memory allocation during storage and in the field of optical fiber communication.\n\nThe World Packaging Organization ( [http://www.worldpackaging.org/i4a/doclibrary/index.cfm?category\\_id=4](http://www.worldpackaging.org/i4a/doclibrary/index.cfm?category_id=4)) report presented in 2008 with global packaging market statistics shows packaging growth is tied to the world economy. The fast growing economy of countries in Asia and Eastern Europe has created new opportunities for packaging suppliers. The world packaging market was valued at $427 billion in 2003, growing at an annual rate of 3.5\u00a0% since 1999. The global market for industrial and bulk (transport) packaging was valued at $105 billion in 2004, representing an increase of 5\u00a0% in 2003. At $30.8 billion, North America represents the single largest market with a 30\u00a0% share\u2014set to fall to 27\u00a0%, behind Asia by 2009. Overall, sales are forecast to grow at an average rate of 2\u00a0% over the period to reach $117 billion. Such growing industry calls for the use of intelligent automated system for quick and efficient packing approach, particularly for real-time applications where computation time is hard bound.\n\n### Our contribution\n\nIn this paper, we have proposed a metaheuristic al...",

These algorithms have been found to be very effective and robust in solving numerous problems from a wide range of application domains. In this paper we have performedan experimental studythat indicates the use of genetic algorithms for the two dimensional bin packing problem.

A construction heuristic is then often used as a decoder to produce a solution from each ordering. In such a situation further information is often available in the form of bounds on the partial solutions. This paper uses two two-dimensional packing problems to illustrate how this information can be incorporated into the genetic operators to improve the overall performance of the search. Our objective is to use the packing problems as a vehicle for investigating a series of modifications of the genetic algorithm approach based on information from bounds on partial solutions.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe last decade has seen considerable interest in the application of genetic algorithms (GAs) to many different classes of difficult optimisation problems. For example, see Pardalos and Resende, 2002 and Glover and Kochenberger, 2003. The field of cutting and packing is no exception. Such problems tend to be highly constrained in that pieces must be cut or packed within a confined space without overlap. If a packing or cutting pattern is defined by the positions of the pieces it contains, then it is easy to see that any layout produced by combining the features of two good feasible layouts is likely to contain overlapping pieces or large gaps. However, genetic algorithms are based on the premise that good partial solutions can be combined via the crossover operator to produce child solutions that are likely to be of high quality. Problems where this is not the case are defined as being highly epistatic, and it is well known that genetic algorithms struggle on epistatic domains (Falkenauer, 1998, p. 34). Examples of researchers recognising these problems are common in many domains. Erben (2000), uses a grouping genetic algorithm (Falkenauer, 1998) to solve a graph colouring problem and successfully applied it to _hard-to-colour_ graph examples as well as real-world timetabling problems. Mori and Tanaka (2002) also used a grouping genetic algorithm in designing conference programs and reports good results.\n\nIn an early paper Davis (1985) uses a rectangle packing problem to illustrate the difficulty in using a standard GA and suggests an alternative decoding in order to overcome it. This takes the form of an indirect representation, in which individuals are represented as permutations of the pieces. A placement heuristic is used to decode the representation by packing the pieces in the order given by the permutation and crossover involves copying one parent up to the crossover point and then completing the child by adding the missing values in the order they appear in the second parent. Aickelin and Dowsland (2004) used this approach for nurse scheduling and Ozcan and Alkan (2002) applied a similar method to university course timetabling. This approach remains popular for cutting and packing problems (Prosser, 1988, Dighe and Jakiela, 1995, Liu and Teng, 1999.\n\nAlthough these implementations work reasonably well, intuitively there are two drawbacks. First, only that part of the string before the crossover point is preserved in its entirety. Thus the information inherited from the second parent is less than that inherited from the first as, to maintain feasibility, the second parents genes are not kept together as the genes already inherited from the first parent must be deleted. Other crossover operators could be used (for example, partially matched crossover (PMX) (Goldberg, 1989). However, they too have problems. For example, after applying the PMX operator the offsprings could decode to solutions which differ widely from their parents. In (Falkenauer, 1998, p. 90), an example of a bin packing problem is given and he states _\u201cIn other words, the PMX transmits information which more often than not acquires a different meaning in the new chromosome\u201d_. Second, even when all the information is preserved (for example crossing over ABCDEF and BACEFD at position 3) only the first part of the string will preserve its meaning in terms of the physical arrangement of the pieces. The positions of _E_, _F_ and _D_ will depend on the layout of the pieces preceding them. Thus, even if the information from both parents is preserved in the genotype only the first part of the string will preserve its meaning in the phenotype. The result of these two observations is likely to be a large variation in the fitness values of the schema left undisturbed by crossover, thus affecting the efficiency of the GA. The motivation for the work in this paper is to exploit additional information inherent in the front section of the strings, in an attempt to overcome the deficiencies caused by lost information in the tails. This information is derived from a more traditional approach to discrete optimisation problems, that of tree search.\n\nThe application of tree search methods, often based on branch and bound, to cutting and packing problems have been widely reported in the literature. In many cases moderately sized problems have been solved efficiently by these means. Dowsland (1987) suggested a branch and bound approach for the pallet loading problem, in which the objective is to maximise the number of copies of a small rectangle that can be fitted without overlap into a larger rectangle. Beasley (1985a) successfully solved the problem of maximising the value of different sized pieces cut from a fixed area using a mixture of geometric bounds and Lagrangian relaxation, while Christofides and Whitlock (1977) solved the c...",

The four corners\u2019 (FC) heuristic is specifically designed to increase the search efficiency of EAs. Experiments with the FC heuristic are conducted on 31 problems from the literature both with rotations permitted and without rotations permitted, using two different EA algorithms: a self-adaptive parallel recombinative simulated annealing (PRSA) algorithm, and a self-adaptive genetic algorithm (GA). Results on bin packing problems yield the smallest trim losses we have seen in the published literature; with the FC heuristic, zero trim loss was achieved on problems of up to 97 rectangles. A comparison of the self-adaptive GA to fixed-parameter GAs is presented and the benefits of self-adaption are highlighted.\n\n## Introduction\n\nTwo-dimensional (2D) packing problems occur in a wide range of industries. The goal is simply the optimal utilization of space or material available. In the garment and paper industries the problem is often to cut smaller pieces from a large roll of cloth or paper while reducing the scrap. In the wood, glass, and metal industries the task is not to cut from a roll, but to cut from a fixed size sheet or plate. In the semiconductor industry the task is VLSI floor planning with the goal being to optimize the use of space on the chip.\n\nThere are two major variants of the 2D packing problem: bin packing and strip packing. In the 2D bin packing variant, rectangles are to be packed in bins of given width and height, the goal being to minimize the number of bins used. In the 2D strip packing variant, rectangles must be packed in a fixed width, infinite height strip, the goal being to minimize the height. The bin packing variant is most suitable for the wood, glass, metal, and semiconductor industries, while the strip packing variant will generally apply to the paper and garment industries.\n\nAn important consideration is whether or not the rectangles can be rotated as they are placed. In the wood and garment industries one may care about the grain of the material and rotations may not be permitted. While in the paper, glass, and semiconductor industries there may be no particular restrictions. Allowing rotations adds flexibility and can result in a better packing, while at the same time apparently complicating the task.\n\nGiven the many permutations of 2D packing problems, most research focuses on a particular type of the packing problem: either bin packing or strip packing, with or without rotations. A recent survey of 2D packing problems is given by Lodi et al. (2002). A typology of cutting and packing problems is defined in W\u00e4scher et al. (2006).\n\nBeing NP-hard, the 2D packing problems are an attractive challenge for evolutionary algorithms (EA). For application to strip packing problems, Jakobs (1996) developed a genetic algorithm (GA) using the bottom-left (BL) packing method with support for rotation of rectangles. Hopper and Turton (2001) provide a comprehensive comparison of GA, simulated annealing (SA), na\u00efve evolution, and simple hill-climbing for the strip packing problem with rotations and for various BL methods. A recent paper by Lesh et al. (2004) gives a method to find strip packing solutions using an exact branch and bounds exhaustive search. They successfully find perfect packings (zero trim loss) for problem sizes up to 30 rectangles. In regards to bin packing problems, Babu and Babu (1999) use a GA and a BL packing heuristic. Recently, Leung et al. (2003) developed a mixed simulated annealing-genetic algorithm.\n\nIn this paper, we design the four corners\u2019 (FC) packing heuristic with the aim to increase the search efficiency of EAs when applied to bin packing problems. By the nature of the FC heuristic, the packings produced are non-guillotineable and bottom-left stability is not preserved. In this research we study only orthogonal packing problems, consisting of one bin with the goal to seek minimum trim loss. In the typology of cutting and packing problems as defined by W\u00e4scher et al. (2006), we deal with a two-dimensional, output maximization problem: we have one large rectangle of fixed dimensions, into which the value of the placed smaller rectangles (assumed proportional to area of the rectangle) must be maximized. The smaller rectangles are strongly heterogeneous and must be laid out orthogonally. Specifically, we study the two-dimensional single orthogonal knapsack problem.\n\nThe FC heuristic is tested with two different self-adapting EAs: a self-adapting parallel recombinative simulated annealing (PRSA) algorithm and a self-adapting GA. The results are presented both with and without support for rotations. The FC heuristic combined with the self-adapting PRSA algorithm is found to produce tighter packings than any of the methods we have seen published in the literature.\n\nThis paper is outlined as follows. In Section 2, an analysis on how EAs work on packing problems is performed and the EA-friendly four corners\u2019 packing heuristic is introduced. In Section 3, a detailed description of the EA components developed in this study is given. Section 4 describes details of the PRSA implementation. Section 5 describes the GA implementation. The remaining sections cover the experimental settings, results, and conclusions.\n\n## Section snippets\n\n## Designing the four corners\u2019 heuristic\n\nIn this section, we analyze how EAs commonly function on packing problems and propose a four corners\u2019 heuristic designed specifically for EAs. GAs are chosen as the representative EA for this discussion, however most of the principles apply in general to the many types of EAs. For example, SA can be implemented using the genome encoding and the mutation operators of a GA. An implementation of PRSA (see Section 4) could use both the mutation and crossover operators of a GA as is done in this\n\n## Common components of a self-adapting evolutionary algorithm\n\nThe PRSA and GA algorithms implemented in this paper share the genome structure, the crossover operators, mutation operators, and the fitness function.\n\n## Self-adaptive parallel recombinative simulate...",
