You saw an interesting challenge or the big prize money but feel a bit lost about how to tackle the competition ?\nThis blog provides a broad overview of Kaggle competitions, guides you through the winning methodologies, and offers tips and tricks to help you tackle a Kaggle competition more effectively.\n## All you need to know about Kaggle competitions\n![](https://dataroots.ghost.io/content/images/2023/06/Untitled-1.png)Kaggle competition overview page\n\ud83d\udca1Kaggle is a platform where data enthusiasts come together to explore and analyse datasets and participate in machine learning competitions. The platform is a fun and collaborative space that encourages learning, problem-solving, and innovation.\nWhile Kaggle has grown substantially over the last few years to a more all-round data science hub, the competitions were and remain Kaggle\u2019s raison d\u2019\u00eatre and come in all shapes and forms but can be divided into three main (albeit slightly arbitrary) categories: getting-started , community competitions, and cash prize competitions.\nFirstly there are the**getting-started competitions**, such as the[Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic?ref=dataroots.ghost.io)or[Digit Recognizer](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer?ref=dataroots.ghost.io)ones. These are meant more as a sandbox with a well-defined goal to allow newcomers to become familiar with ML concepts, libraries and the Kaggle ecosystem in a fun way. Together with the**community competitions**, where someone just had an idea for an interesting competition, these generally list \u201ckudos\u201d, \u201cswag\u201d or \u201cknowledge\u201d as their prizes with the reasoning that the journey and knowledge gained on the way are more important than the destination.\nWhat actually tends to attract people to Kaggle are the**competitions with cash prizes**. These \u00a0attach prize money to top leaderboard spots and are usually set up by companies or research institutes that actually want a problem solved and would like the broader audience to take a shot at this. With prizes ranging from a few 100\u2019s to multiple 100 000\u2019s of dollars, these attract some of the best in their respective fields, which makes competing challenging but very rewarding.\nEvery single one of those competitions is defined by a**dataset**and an**evaluation score**. Here the labels from the dataset define the problem to be solved and the evaluation score is the single objective measure that indicates how well a solution solves this problem (and that will be used to rank the solutions for the leaderboard).\nWhile the********************train set********************is publicly available, the data used to evaluate solutions is not and is usually divided into two parts. First there is the**public leaderboard test set**which is used to calculate leaderboard scores while the competition is still going on. This can be used by teams to check how well their solution performs on unseen data and verify their validation strategy. Secondly there is the**private leaderboard test set.**This is used to calculate the private leaderboard scores, which decides ones actual final place, and these are only disclosed after the competition ended.\nThis not only prevents fine-tuning on the test data but also keeps things exiting since leaderboards can completely change last minute if people did (either intentionally or not) do this anyway. The resulting shuffle usually makes for some interesting drama where long-reigning champions fall from grace and unnoticed underdogs, who kept best practices in mind, suddenly rise to the top.\n### Notebooks\nTo compete one can either work on private resources (such as a local machine or cloud-hosted vm or compute instance) or use a Kaggle notebook.\nPrivate resources do have some advantages since one has full freedom about the environment, packages, etc. Especially if you want to use packages such as MLFlow or Tensorboard, which do not work in the Kaggle notebooks. Next to this, not having a limit to running times, memory and disk space can be quite convenient.\nThe Kaggle notebooks are Jupyter notebooks running on a maintained and standardised environment, hosted by Kaggle and they come with unlimited, free CPU time (with session limits of 12h) and 30h of GPU time (per user) each week for most of your parallel computing needs. This ensures that everybody who wants to compete can compete and is not limited by their hardware, which makes the competitions as democratic as possible. Additionally, you can easily import Kaggle datasets in a few seconds, which is especially convenient for the larger ones which can easily exceed 100s of GBs. Finally they are also the way to submit a solution to the competition. The submission notebook will have to read in a (private )test set and generate predictions on this set that will be used to calculate the leaderboard score. So even if you work on your own resources for training and fine-tuning, you will have to convert your code to a Kaggle notebook eventually.\n## How to take the W in a Kaggle competition ?\nIt is a matter of approach taken and how many of your ideas you could try out to finish high on the leaderboard !\nWe participated in the[Vesuvius Challenge - Ink Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/c/vesuvius-challenge-ink-detection?ref=dataroots.ghost.io)competition. While we did not win any prizes, some of the top Kaggle competitors shared their solutions after the competition ended. The methodology used by the winners seems to be more or less the same across the board. Interested to know them ? Let\u2019s break them down in few simple steps !\n### 1. Have a good understanding of the competition and how to tackle the problem\nAs the people who are organising these competitions often already spend a lot of time finding a good solution themselves, a ton of material might be already available. We would recommend you to:\n* Read the competition overview and linked resources thoroughly\n* Get familiar with the data. Look at samples, plot statistics, all the usual EDA\n* Check existing literature on approaches that were tried/succeeded in solving this or similar problems### 2. Get inspired by other participants\u2019 work to get started\nTo earn Kaggle medals or because they are genuinely nice, some competitors share their knowledge through making notebooks and datasets public or sharing findings and insights in discussions to get \u201cupvotes\u201d. We recommend reading the ones that got a lot of upvotes. This step is really a must as there are so much things to try out to improve your result it is impossible to cover everything with your team.\n![](https://dataroots.ghost.io/content/images/2023/06/Untitled--1--1.png)Go in the \"Code\" section of the competition page. You can select notebooks with the most votes and check the number of upvotes on the right side of the notebook\nBased on your readings, choose a clear and simple notebook with a decent LB score as**baseline**. Try to come up with a strategy on how to improve this baseline based on your thoughts and what you read from the shared work.\n### 3. Improve your model in an efficient way\nIn this phase, you will experiment a lot in the hopes of improving your LB. The goal here is to maximise the number of experiments you will try in a limited amount of time !\n##### Create datasets for intermediate results / preprocessed data\nSaved preprocessed datasets and trained models will make your results comparis...",

In this guide, you will learn how to set up your own competition, step-by-step.\nBefore diving in, it's helpful to understand how a Kaggle competition works.\n### How Kaggle competitions work\n#### Overview\nEvery competition has two things, a) a clearly defined problem that participants need to solve using a machine learning model and b) a dataset that\u2019s used both for training and evaluating the effectiveness of these models.\nFor example, in the[Store Sales \u2013Time Series Forecasting](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/store-sales-time-series-forecasting)competition, participants must accurately predict how many of each grocery item will sell using a dataset of past product and sales information from a grocery retailer.\nOnce the competition starts participants can submit their predictions, Kaggle will score them for accuracy, and the team will be placed on a ranked leaderboard. The team at the top of the leaderboard at the deadline wins!\n#### Datasets, Submissions &amp; Leaderboards\nEvery competition\u2019s dataset is split into two smaller datasets.\nOne of these smaller datasets will be given to participants to train their models, typically named`train.csv`.\nThe other dataset will be mostly hidden from participants and used by Kaggle for testing and scoring, named`test.csv`and`solution.csv`(`test.csv`is the same as`solution.csv`except that`test.csv`contains the feature values and`solution.csv`contains the ground truth variable(s) \u2013participants will never, ever see`solution.csv`).\nWhen a participant feels ready to make a submission to the competition, they will use`test.csv`to generate a prediction and upload a CSV file. Kaggle will automatically score the submission for accuracy using the hidden`solution.csv`file.\nMost competitions have a maximum number of submissions that a participant can make each day and a final deadline at which point the leaderboard will be frozen.\nIt\u2019s conceivable that a participant could use the mechanics of a Kaggle competition to overfit a solution - which would be great for winning a competition, but not valuable for a real-world application.\nTo help prevent this, Kaggle has two leaderboards \u2013the public and private leaderboard. The competition host splits the`solution.csv`dataset into two parts, using one part for the public leaderboard and another part for the private leaderboard. Participants generally will now know which samples are public vs private. The private leaderboard is kept a secret until after the competition deadline and is used as the official leaderboard for determining the final ranking.\n### Create your competition\ufe0f\nTo create a new competition, click on the \u201cCreate new competition\u201d button at the top of the Kaggle Community landing page.\nThen, enter a descriptive title, subtitle and URL for your competition. Be as descriptive and to the point as possible. In our example above, the title \u201cStore Sales - Time Series Forecasting\u201d quickly outlines the type of data, the industry of the dataset, and the type of problem to be solved.\nIf you want to create a competition with more privacy, you can limit your competition's visibility and restrict who can join on this page.\nVisibility: Competitions with their visibility set to public are viewable on Kaggle and appear in Kaggle search results. Competitions with visibility set to private are hidden and only accessible via invitation URLs from the host.\nWho Can Join: Competitions access can be set to three levels: anyone, only people with a link and restricted email list. If you select anyone, all Kagglers can join your competition. Selecting only people with a link, will restrict access to those users you provide a special URL. Finally, restricted email list is the most private competition. Only Kagglers with accounts that match the emails or email domains you specify will be able to join. Note: if you select restricted email list, notebooks will be turned off. This provides a way to ensure that any private data that you have in a competition is not accidentally leaked through shared notebooks. You can choose to re-enable notebooks if you choose.\nReview and accept our terms of service, then click \u201cCreate Competition\u201d.\nYour competition listing is now in draft mode. You can take your time to prepare the details before making the competition public.\n#### Offering Prizes\nCommunity competition hosts have the option to offer prizes with a total value of up to $10,000 USD.\nTo set up prizes:\n* Enable Prize Awards: When creating a competition, select \"Competition will award prizes.\" Enter the total amount of prize money to be awarded.\n* Document Prize Rules: You'll need to specify the number of prizes and the amount for each prize on the Competition Rules and Overview pages. Clearly define the criteria for winning in this section. These sections must be completed to launch the competition.Adjusting prize amounts:\n* Prize amounts can be adjusted or turned off entirely only before launch. After you launch a competition, prize settings are locked. We advise you to double-check your prizes before scheduling, as you won't be able to change them after launch.\n* If you are offering a valuable prize that is not cash (eg. gift cards, or valuable objects), please list the monetary value of the prizes in US dollars. The value should not exceed the prize limit of $10,000 USD.Prize fulfillment:\n* Prizes for Community Competitions must be manually awarded and announced.\nLeaderboards for Community Competitions will not display an \"In the money\" designation for winning participants. We advise reaching out to winners directly on Kaggle and announcing winners using the Discussions feature.\n* When you enable prizes for a competition, you are solely responsible for providing and distributing all prizes, fulfilling all promises and commitments, and for complying with all applicable tax rules related to competition winners. Kaggle does not participate in prize distribution or rule enforcement for...",
