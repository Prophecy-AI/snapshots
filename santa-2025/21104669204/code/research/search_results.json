      "text": "Circle\u2011in\u2011square packing is a highly non\u2011convex quadratically\u2011constrained problem that quickly becomes intractable for more than a handful of circles.  The most reliable exact approach is to embed strong convex relaxations (polyhedral or semi\u2011definite) inside a branch\u2011and\u2011cut global solver; these relaxations tighten the non\u2011overlap constraints and give provable bounds, but they are only practical for small\u2011size instances (typically\u202f\u2264\u202f10\u202fcircles)\u202f([optimization\u2011online](https://optimization-online.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/5911.pdf)).  For larger instances researchers turn to sophisticated heuristics.  A widely used meta\u2011heuristic is **formulation\u2011space search**, which alternates between Cartesian and polar formulations and solves each sub\u2011problem with a nonlinear solver (e.g., SNOPT), often improving the best known radii for a variety of containers\u202f([brunel.ac.uk](https://people.brunel.ac.uk/~mastjjb/jeb/circle.html)).  Another effective strategy is the **partitioned action\u2011space / basin\u2011hopping** method, which first approximates circles by squares to locate large empty \u201caction spaces\u201d, then partitions both the space and the circles into size\u2011based groups and performs a local search; this algorithm has set new records on benchmark instances and runs faster than earlier global\u2011search approaches\u202f([arxiv.org/abs/1701.00541](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.00541)).\n\nWhen provable guarantees are required, **divide\u2011and\u2011conquer approximation schemes** dominate.  The \u201cSplit Packing\u201d algorithm recursively splits the set of circles into two groups and packs each into a sub\u2011square, achieving the optimal worst\u2011case density of \u2248\u202f53.90\u202f% of the square\u2019s area; the construction is explicit and runs in polynomial time\u202f([arxiv.org/abs/1705.00924](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.00924)).  More generally, an **asymptotic PTAS** (and a resource\u2011augmentation APTAS) exists for packing circles (and regular polygons) into unit\u2011square bins, guaranteeing solutions arbitrarily close to optimal by separating large and small items and using augmented bin height\u202f([arxiv.org/abs/1412.4709](https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.4709)).  These schemes extend to polygon packing because the same item\u2011separation and bin\u2011augmentation ideas apply to any convex regular shape, and the underlying mixed\u2011integer programming models can be convexified analogously to the circle case.\n\nIn practice, the \u201cbest\u201d strategy depends on problem size and required guarantees:  \n* **Small\u2011scale exact work** \u2013 branch\u2011and\u2011cut with polyhedral/SDP relaxations.  \n* **Medium\u2011scale high\u2011quality solutions** \u2013 formulation\u2011space search or partitioned action\u2011space/basin\u2011hopping heuristics.  \n* **Large\u2011scale or provably near\u2011optimal needs** \u2013 Split Packing or PTAS/APTAS\u2011based algorithms, which also handle regular polygon items with minor modifications.  Combining a fast heuristic to generate a good initial layout and then tightening it with a global\u2011optimization bound often yields the most robust results.",

      "text": "Packing circles in a square: a theoretical comparison of various\nconvexification techniques\nAida Khajavirad \u2217\nJuly 12, 2018\nAbstract\nWe consider the problem of packing congruent circles with the maximum radius in a unit square.\nAs a mathematical program, this problem is a notoriously difficult nonconvex quadratically constrained\noptimization problem which possesses a large number of local optima. The nonconvexity stems from a\ncollection of pairwise non-overlapping constraints, a structure that appears in many important applica\u0002tions such as metal cutting, communication networks, and distance geometry. We study several existing\nand new convexification techniques for the circle packing problem, including polyhedral and semi-definite\nrelaxations and assess their strength theoretically. As we demonstrate both theoretically and numerically,\nwhen embedded in a branch-and-cut based global solver, the current state-of-the-art bounding techniques\nare only effective for small-size circle packing problems.\nKey words: Circle packing problem, Non-overlapping constraints, Polyhedral relaxations, Semi-definite\nrelaxations, Boolean quadric polytope.\n1 Introduction\nThe problem of finding the maximum radius r of n identical non-overlapping circles that fit in a unit square\nis a classic problem in discrete geometry. It is well-known that this problem can be equivalently stated as:\nLocate n points in a unit square, such that the minimum distance between any two points is maximal.\nDenote by (xi, yi), i \u2208 {1, . . . , n} the coordinate of the ith point to be located in the unit square. It then\nfollows that the above problem can be stated as the following optimization problem:\n(CP) maximize \u03b3\nsubject to (xj \u2212 xi)\n2 + (yj \u2212 yi)2 \u2265 \u03b3, 1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 n, (1)\nx \u2208 [0, 1]n, y \u2208 [0, 1]n,\nwhere \u03b3 denotes the minimum squared pair-wise distance of the points in the unit square and n \u2265 2. The\ncorresponding radius r for n circles that can be packed into the unit square is then given by r =\n\u221a\u03b3\n2(1+\u221a\u03b3)\n.\nThroughout this paper, we refer to Problem (CP) as the Circle packing problem. In spite of its simple\nformulation, the Circle packing problem is a difficult nonconvex optimization problem with a large number\nof locally optimal solutions. This nonconvexity is due to the presence of non-overlapping constraints defined\nby (1). In fact, non-overlapping constraints appear in a variety of applications including circular cutting,\ncommunication networks, facility layout problems, and distance geometry applications (see [2] for a detailed\nreview of industrial applications).\nThe Circle packing problem and its variants have been studied extensively by the optimization community;\nseveral customized stochastic and deterministic algorithms have been proposed to find high quality solutions\nfor this problem (see [12] for a review of the existing optimization techniques). Yet, we are unable to\nsolve Problem (CP) to global optimality for n > 10 with any of the state-of-the-art general-purpose global\n\u2217Department of Chemical Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University. E-mail: aida@cmu.edu.\n1\nsolvers [9, 6, 15] within a few hours of CPU-time. This surprisingly poor performance is mainly due to the\ngeneration of weak upper bounds on the optimal value of \u03b3, which in turn is caused by our inability to\neffectively convexify a collection of non-overlapping constraints. Indeed, current global solvers exhibit very\nslow convergence rates for optimization problems containing non-overlapping constraints.\nIn this paper, we perform a systematic study of the existing techniques to convexify a nonconvex set\ndefined by a collection of non-overlapping constraints. To this end, we consider the Circle packing prob\u0002lem as our prototypical example in that its simple formulation makes it amenable to a theoretical study,\nyet it demonstrates the limitations of existing convexification schemes. We consider various widely-used\npolyhedral and semi-definite relaxations of the Circle packing problem; interestingly, we are able to solve\nthese relaxations analytically and conduct a theoretical assessment of their relative strength. Moreover, we\ninvestigate the effect of symmetry-breaking constraints based on tightened variable bounds and/or order\nconstraints on the quality of these relaxations. As we detail in the following sections, the best polyhedral\nand semi-definite relaxations are obtained via a certain combination of the two types of symmetry-breaking\nconstraints. We should emphasize that the purpose of this paper is not to identify the most efficient cus\u0002tomized optimization algorithm for the Circle packing problem but to examine the applicability of the most\nwidely-used convexfication schemes for non-overlapping constraints.\nIn Section 2, we consider relaxations of Problem (CP) obtained by replacing each non-overlapping con\u0002straint with its convex hull over the corresponding domain. We refer to such relaxations as single-row\npolyhedral relaxations of the Circle packing problem. We demonstrate that the upper bounds given by such\nrelaxations are quite weak, confirming their ineffectiveness when embedded in global solvers. In Section 3,\nwe propose tighter polyhedral relaxations of Problem (CP) by convexifying multiple non-overlapping con\u0002straints simultaneously. Namely, we consider a reformulation of the Circle packing problem whose relaxation\nis closely related to the Boolean quadric polytope [7], a well-studied polytope in combinatorial optimization.\nBy building upon existing results on the facial structure of the Boolean quadric polytope, we present multi\u0002row polyhedral relaxations of the Circle packing problem whose quality is significantly better than single-row\ncounterparts. In Section 4, we examine the strength of semi-definite programming (SDP) relaxations for the\nCircle packing problem. We show that the upper bounds achieved by these relaxations are identical or\nworse than the bounds obtained by the proposed multi-row polyhedral relaxations. Finally, in Section 5, we\nincorporate our best multi-row polyhedral relaxations in the global solver BARON [9] and demonstrate their\nimpact on the convergence rate of the branch-and-cut tree for Circle packing problems with 3 \u2264 n \u2264 20.\n2 Single-row polyhedral relaxations\nThe basic approach. Perhaps the most intuitive approach to obtain a convex relaxation for the Circle\npacking problem is to replace the nonconvex set defined by a single non-overlapping constraint by its convex\nhull. Denote by conv(C) the convex hull of a nonconvex set C and denote concX f the concave envelope of the\nfunction f over the convex set X. It is simple to show that the concave envelope of a convex quadratic function\nof the form f(u) = (u1 \u2212 u2)\n2 over the box H = [0, 1]2\nis given by concHf(u) = min{u1 + u2, 2 \u2212 u1 \u2212 u2}.\nSince non-overlapping constraints are separable in x and y variables, we have\nconv\b(xi, xj , yi, yj, \u03b3) : (xj \u2212 xi)\n2 + (yj \u2212 yi)2 \u2265 \u03b3, x \u2208 [0, 1]2\n, y \u2208 [0, 1]2\n\t\n=\n\b\n(xi, xj , yi, yj, \u03b3) : concHf(x) + concHf(y) \u2265 \u03b3, x \u2208 [0, 1]2, y \u2208 [0, 1]2\n\t\nIt then follows that the following linear program (LP) provides an upper bound on the optimal value of\nProblem (CP):\n(TW) maximize \u03b3\nsubject to\nxi + xj + yi + yj \u2265 \u03b3\n\u2212xi \u2212 xj + yi + yj + 2 \u2265 \u03b3\nxi + xj \u2212 yi \u2212 yj + 2 \u2265 \u03b3\n\u2212xi \u2212 xj \u2212 yi \u2212 yj + 4 \u2265 \u03b3\n\uf8fc\n\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8fd\n\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8fe\n, 1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 n\n0 \u2264 x \u2264 1, 0 \u2264 y \u2264 1.\n2\nClaim 1. The optimal value of Problem (TW) is \u03b3\n\u2217 = 2 for all n \u2265 2.\nProof. Denote by (\u02dcx, y\u02dc) a point at which \u03b3\n\u2217\nis attained. By symmetry, \u03b3\n\u2217\nis also attained at the following\npoints: (1 \u2212 x, \u02dc y\u02dc), (\u02dcx, 1 \u2212 y\u02dc), and (1 \u2212 x, \u02dc 1 \u2212 y\u02dc). Hence, by convexity of the feasible region, \u03b3\n\u2217\nis also attained\nat the point obtained by taking the average over the above four points; i.e., xi = yi =\n1\n2\nfor i = 1, . . . , n. It\nthen follows that \u03b3\n\u2217 = 2 for all n \u2265 2.\nRemark 1. Define Xij = xixj and Yij = yiyj , for all 1 \u2264 i \u2264 j \u2264 n. Then the feasible region of\nProblem (CP) can be equivalently written as P = {(x, y, X, Y, \u03b3) : Xii \u2212 2Xij + Xjj + Yii \u2212 2Yij + Yjj \u2265\n\u03b3, \u22001 \u2264 i <...",

Based on our previous work on an Action Space based Global Optimization (ASGO) that approximates each circle item as a square item to efficiently find the large unoccupied spaces, we propose an optimization algorithm based on the Partitioned Action Space and Partitioned Circle Items (PAS-PCI). The PAS is to partition the narrow action space on the long side to find two equal action spaces to fully utilize the unoccupied spaces. The PCI is to partition the circle items into four groups based on size for the basin hopping strategy. Experiments on two sets of benchmark instances show the effectiveness of the proposed method. In comparison with our previous algorithm ASGO on the 68 tested instances that ASGO published, PAS-PCI not only gains smaller containers in 64 instances and matches the other 4 but also runs faster in most instances. In comparison with the best record of the Packomania website on a total of 98 instances, PAS-PCI finds smaller containers on 82 and matches the other 16. Note that we updated 19 records for (47-48, 51-54, 57, 61-72) that had been kept unchanged since 2013.\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| Subjects: | Computational Geometry (cs.CG); Data Structures

Packing problems like this have been shown to be $\\\\mathsf{NP}$-hard. In this paper, we present new sufficient conditions for packing circles into square and triangular containers, using only the sum of the circles' areas: For square containers, it is possible to pack any set of circles with a combined area of up to approximately 53.90% of the square's area. And when the container is a right or obtuse triangle, any set of circles whose combined area does not exceed the triangle's incircle can be packed.\n>\n> These area conditions are tight, in the sense that for any larger areas, there are sets of circles which cannot be packed. Similar results have long been known for squares, but to the best of our knowledge, we give the first results of this type for circular objects.\n>\n> Our proofs are constructive: We describe a versatile, divide-and-conquer-based algorithm for packing circles into various container shapes with optimal worst-case density. It employs an elegant subdivision scheme that recursively splits the circles into two groups and then packs these into subcontainers. We call this algorithm \"Split Packing\". It can be used as a constant-factor approximation algorithm when looking for the smallest container in which a given set of circles can be packed, due to its polynomial runtime.\n>\n> A browser-based, interactive visualization of the Split Packing approach and other related material can be found at [this https URL](https://morr.cc/split-packing/)\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| Comments: | 36 pages, 34 figures |\n| Subjects: | Computational Geometry (cs.CG) |\n| Cite as: | [arXiv:1705.00924](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.00924) \\[cs.CG\\] |\n|  | (or [arXiv:1705.00924v2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.00924v2) \\[cs.CG\\] for this version) |\n|  | [https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1705.00924](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1705.00924)<br>Focus to learn more<br>arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite |\n\n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Sebastian Morr \\[ [view email](https://arxiv.org/show-email/ef295654/1705.00924)\\]\n\n**[\\[v1\\]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.00924v1)**\nTue, 2 May 2017 11:48:45 UTC (228 KB)\n\n**\\[v2\\]**\nWed, 27 Jun 2018 10:27:36 UTC (232 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled Split Packing: Algorithms for Packing Circles with Optimal Worst-Case Density, by S\\\\'andor P.

To obtain rational solutions, we use augmented bins of height $1+\\\\gamma$, for some arbitrarily small number $\\\\gamma > 0$. Our algorithm is polynomial on $\\\\log 1/\\\\gamma$, and thus $\\\\gamma$ is part of the problem input. For the special case that $\\\\gamma$ is constant, we give a (one dimensional) resource augmentation scheme, that is, we obtain a packing into bins of unit width and height $1+\\\\gamma$ using no more than the number of bins in an optimal packing. Additionally, we obtain an APTAS for the circle strip packing problem, whose goal is to pack a set of circles into a strip of unit width and minimum height. These are the first approximation and resource augmentation schemes for these problems.\n>\n> Our algorithm is based on novel ideas of iteratively separating small and large items, and may be extended to a wide range of packing problems that satisfy certain conditions. These extensions comprise problems with different kinds of items, such as regular polygons, or with bins of different shapes, such as circles and spheres. As an example, we obtain APTAS's for the problems of packing d-dimensional spheres into hypercubes under the $L\\_p$-norm.\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| Subjects: | Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS) |\n| Cite as: | [arXiv:1412.4709](https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.4709) \\[cs.DS\\] |\n|  | (or [arXiv:1412.4709v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.4709v1) \\[cs.DS\\] for this version) |\n|  | [https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1412.4709](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1412.4709)<br>Focus to learn more<br>arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite |\n\n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Lehilton Pedrosa \\[ [view email](https://arxiv.org/show-email/398a3241/1412.4709)\\]\n\n**\\[v1\\]**\nMon, 15 Dec 2014 18:27:32 UTC (34 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled Polynomial-Time Approximation Schemes for Circle and Other Packing Problems, by Fl\\\\'avio K.

In this paper, we present several circle packing problems, review their industrial applications, and some exact and heuristic strategies for their solution. We also present illustrative numerical results using \u2018generic\u2019 global optimization software packages. Our work highlights the relevance of global optimization in solving circle packing problems, and points towards the necessary advancements in both theory and numerical practice.\n\n## Introduction\n\nIn a general setting, a circle packing is an optimized arrangement of _N_ arbitrary sized circles inside a container (e.g., a rectangle or a circle) such that no two circles overlap. The quality of the packing is typically measured by: (1) the size of the container, (2) the weighted average pairwise distance between the centers of the circles, or (3) a linear combination of criteria (1) and (2).\n\nCircle packings (mostly of uniform size circles) have received a considerable amount of attention in the \u2018pure\u2019 mathematics literature. At the same time, these problems so far have received only limited attention in the operations research literature, in spite of a broad range of existing and potential applications.\n\nPackings also pose interesting modeling and numerical challenges. In its full generality, a circle packing is a difficult optimization problem that cannot be tackled effectively by purely analytical approaches. The \u2018simplest\u2019 cases of packing uniform sized circles inside a square or inside a circle are provably solved to theoretical optimality only for a few instances (up to tens of circles), in spite of the significant effort spent on variants of the problem in recent decades.\n\nIt is impossible to offer a detailed overview on the existing solution strategies and numerical results, within the framework of a single paper. Instead, we will present several circle packing problems, highlight their industrial applications, and then review some exact and heuristic strategies for their solution. We also provide illustrative numerical results using several readily available global optimization software packages, namely LINGO (Lindo Systems, 2004), NMinimize (Wolfram Research, 2005), and MathOptimizer Professional (Pint\u00e9r and Kampas, 2006). The latter is an implementation of the Lipschitz Global Optimizer (LGO) global/local solver suite (Pint\u00e9r and LGO, 2005) for the Mathematica platform (Wolfram Research, 2005). The theoretical foundations that lead to the global solvers embedded in LGO are discussed in detail by Pint\u00e9r (1996).\n\nIn the following models, the center of circle _i_ is denoted by (xi,yi) and the radius of circle _i_ is denoted by ri,i=1,\u2026,N. If uniform sized circles are considered, then simply ri=r,i=1,\u2026,N. The pairwise distance between the centers of circles _i_ and _j_ ( _i_\u00a0<\u00a0_j_), measured using the _l_ 2 norm (Euclidean distance), is denoted by dij=(xi-xj)2+(yi-yj)2,i,j=1,\u2026,N. Additional notation will be introduced as needed.\n\n## Section snippets\n\n## Generic circle packing problems\n\nFirst, several circle packing problems are considered with no explicit industrial application: we refer to these problems as _generic_. These problems are classified as uniform sized and arbitrary sized circle problems.\n\n## Circle packing applications in industry\n\nIn this section, we present a collection of industrial circle packing problems. In recent years, several interesting application areas have been investigated in the literature, including circular cutting problems, communication networks, facility location and dashboard layout. Let us note here that Dyckhoff, 1990, Haessler and Sweeney, 1991, Dowsland and Dowsland, 1992 also discuss geometric packing and cutting stock applications. However, these authors deal mainly with the packing of\n\n## Classification and summary\n\nSo far, we have introduced and classified the circle packing problems that have appeared in the literature as generic and industrial problems. In the case of the generic problems, we have also classified them based on the size of the circles: uniform and arbitrary. Two additional classifications are possible. One of the possible classifications is based on the interpretation of the objective function and the other is based on the solution strategy used to solve the respective circle packing\n\n## Illustrative numerical results\n\nIn this section, numerical results are presented for various circle packing problem instances that have appeared in the literature. Unfortunately, most of the data that is based on industrial applications is not publicly available. Since results for packing uniform sized circles are abundant in the literature, we concentrate on instances related to the packing of arbitrary sized circles; that is, ACP1, ACP2, and ICP3/ICP4.\n\nWe acknowledge that there is clearly a trade-off between solution\n\n## Summary and conclusions\n\nCircle packing problems have received a considerable amount of attention in the mathematics literature, but only modest attention in the operational research literature. This is surprising, considering the numerous areas of existing and potential applications: several of these have been reviewed in this paper. In general, the reviewed industrial applications cannot be tackled effectively by purely analytical approaches. Our review of industrial circle packing problems reveals that a significant\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThe authors thank Dr. David W.

This begs the question: how do I know a solution is optimal? The answer is not always obvious.\n\nAn automated nesting search is part of the answer, which can explore a number of options quickly, automatically and report the results. Finding the maximum number of parts in a full sheet or finding the smallest sized sheet required for a given number of parts.\nIt should be noted that circles have subtle nuances in packing efficiencies. It can be an advantage to have a working knowledge of these expected packing efficiencies of typical cases. (See efficiency graph)\n\nOddly in some cases the optimal packing for circles is irregular packing which is counter-intuitive. Transferring these irregular types of packing placements into other software is difficult. Hence, generally a trade-off is made by selecting the most optimal of the more regular circle packing patterns.\n\n[Rectangular, Hexagonal and Worst case packing](https://i.sstatic.net/VIKz0.jpg)\n\nThere is no set formula for calculating the maximum number of discs from a rectangular sheet. The efficiency of disc packing depends on the arrangement of discs in the material.\nThe Rectangular disc packing array (with zero spacing) is 78.5% (does not suffer from the low efficiency of edge effects)\nThe Hexagonal disc packing array (with zero spacing) is 90.6%\nWorst case disc packing is (2 discs inside a square) 53.8%\n\n[Circle packing software](https://i.sstatic.net/qyPDP.jpg)\n\nThe above disc packing software calculates and compares eight different packing methods and highlights the most efficient solutions.\nEach variation uses a different nesting pattern.\nNote that no single method will give the optimum yield for nesting every size disc into every sized sheet. The optimum method varies depending on the disc sizes and sheet dimensions.\nNote that transferring these optimal arrangements of the x,y positions of eac...",
