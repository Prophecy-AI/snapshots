This NP-hard problem requires efficient algorithms to optimize space utilization.\nConventional numerical methods suffer from slow convergence and high computational cost. Existing learning-based methods, such as the score-based diffusion model, also have limitations, such as no rotation support, frequent collisions, and poor adaptability to arbitrary boundaries, and slow inferring.\nThe difficulty of learning from teacher packing is to capture the complex geometric relationships among packing examples, which include the spatial (position, orientation) relationships of objects, their geometric features, and container boundary conditions.

The proposed attention-based diffusion model for 2D irregular packing, GFPack++, supports\ncontinuous rotation and accommodating arbitrary boundaries.\n\n## 1\\. Introduction\n\nIrregular shape packing is a classic challenge in operation research, with significant implications for various applications such as texture atlas generation and material utilization in manufacturing\u00a0(Wang et\u00a0al., [2021](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib34)). Its NP-hard nature requires practical and effective packing algorithms to optimize space utilization.\n\nTraditional numerical optimization methods are often slow and costly. Recently, learning-based methods have emerged as a promising alternative for irregular packing, mainly using reinforcement learning\u00a0(Xu et\u00a0al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib37); Yang et\u00a0al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib39)).\nAnother promising approach is the diffusion model, which learns geometric relationships from teacher packing examples and establishes a gradient field for all objects, guiding them to move simultaneously\u00a0(Hosseini et\u00a0al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib11); Xue et\u00a0al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib38)).\nIn particular, the work of (Xue et\u00a0al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib38)), namely GFPack, achieves a notable trade-off between computational cost and space utilization, demonstrating scalability in terms of polygon count and generalizability to rectangular container boundaries.\nHowever, it still faces unresolved issues, notably the lack of support for rotation, a relatively high occurrence of object collisions in results, and limited adaptability to arbitrary boundaries.\n\nThe main idea of the learning-based packing framework is to capture the geometric relationships between shapes, which are essential for the gradient computation.\nSuch relationships in latent space encompass multiple facets: the _spatial (position, orientation) relationship_ of the shapes, the _geometric features relationship_ among them, and the _container boundary conditions_ that constrain them.\nHowever, GFPack falls short in fully representing these relationships.\nIt solely focuses on the positional aspect, neglecting orientation, thus hindering rotational capabilities. Furthermore, it relies on PointNeXt\u00a0(Qian et\u00a0al., [2022](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib24)) for geometric feature extraction, ignoring critical details like polygon edges and resulting in a loss of topological and local features.\nThus, we argue that the full potential of gradient learning has not been thoroughly exploited in GFPack.\n\nIn this study, we introduce two primary strategies to tackle the challenge of learning packing policies.\nFirstly, we use a graph to represent each object and encode it with an _attention-based geometric encoder_, which can capture polygonal geometry information effectively.\nSecondly, we design an _attention-based relation encoding_ mechanism to encode intricate relationships both between polygons and among polygons and boundaries, eliminating the need to explicitly represent the relationships with a graph.\nThis attention-based diffusion model enhances the understanding of how objects interact with each other and the boundaries, resulting in superior performance in both training and inference.\nWe also investigate the utilization distribution between the teacher and inference data and design a weighting function to prioritize tighter teacher data during training, confirmed to be effective.\n\nThis paper makes the following contributions:\n\n1. -\n\n\nWe propose GFPack++, a novel packing framework that employs attention-based learning of gradient fields, supporting continuous rotation and enhancing generalization.\n\n2. -\n\n\nAdvancing beyond GFPack, we encapsulate geometric relationships in an attention-based encoder, incorporating mutual spatial (position, orientation) relationships of objects, their geometric features, and container boundary conditions, and a weighting function to facilitate effective learning policies.\n\n3. -\n\n\nGFPack++ achieves superior irregular packing results, demonstrating higher space utilization over several widely used baselines, one order of magnitude faster than the previous diffusion-based method, coupled with promising generalization for arbitrary boundaries.\n\n\n## 2\\. Related Work\n\n#### Traditional packing approaches\n\nTraditional methods usually involve placement optimization and sequence planning ( _c.f_.surveys\u00a0(Bennell and Oliveira, [2009](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib3); Leao et\u00a0al., [2020](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib18))). Most research focuses on placement optimization with heuristic rules (e.g., BL, BLF), NFP-based search\u00a0(Bennell and Song, [2008](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib4)), or mathematical models\u00a0(Hopper and Turton, [2001](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib10)). Novel approaches include SDF-based placement\u00a0(Pan et\u00a0al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib23)) and spectral domain correlation\u00a0(Cui et\u00a0al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib6)), but they only support limited rotations. Sequence planning combines heuristics\u00a0(Lopez et\u00a0al., [2013](htt...",

The optimization of shape rotation angles for better packing outcomes was further refined by Guo et al. (2018) based on the application of Principal Component Analysis (PCA), demonstrating improved packing density. Liu et al. (2023) developed a hybrid approach combining genetic algorithm and linear programming to optimize two-dimensional irregular packing, significantly enhancing material utilization and efficiency. Cai et al. (2023) tackled the 2-D irregular bin packing issue by developing heuristics that accommodate specific degrees of rotation for packing irregular shapes efficiently. Their novel approach optimized the packing strategy by accounting for the material's texture constraints, delivering effective solutions to maximize utilization across various industries.</p><p>The extension of the orbital sliding method to handle arcs in irregular packing was discussed by Burke et al. (2010), improving the accuracy of no-fit polygon calculations and thus the efficiency of packing solutions. Terashima-Mar\u00edn et al. (2010) introduced a GA-based model for generating hyper-heuristics, showcasing the potential of hyper-heuristics in outperforming individual heuristics for both regular and irregular shapes. The adaptation of the Djang and Finch heuristic for two-dimensional irregular bin packing problems by L\u00f3pez-Camacho et al. (2013) and the introduction of a beam search approach by Bennell and Song (2010) further contributed to the advancement of efficient packing solutions.</p><p>Transitioning towards self-learning models, Zhang et al. (2021) introduced a model utilizing deep reinforcement learning and self-attention mechanisms, marking a significant advancement in the application of machine learning to bin packing problems.

(2023) proposed a hybrid reinforcement learning algorithm tailored for 2D irregular packing problems. This algorithm represents a pioneering attempt to combine machine learning strategies with traditional packing methodologies, highlighting the expanding scope of machine learning applications in optimizing raw material utilization.</p><p>Leao et al.

The improved algorithm can cope with complex cases and is given an implementation in detail. The proposed concept of a touching group can simplify the judging process when recognizing the potential translation vector for an orbital polygon. In addition, the generation of the no-fit polygon only involves three main steps based on the proposed concept. The proposed algorithm has a mechanism that searches other start positions to generate a complete no-fit polygon for handling complex cases. To improve the efficiency, many acceleration strategies have been proposed, such as point exclusion strategy and point inclusion test. The robust and efficient performance of the algorithm is tested by well-known benchmark instances and degenerate and complex cases, such as holes, interlocking concavities and jigsaw-type pieces. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can produce complete no-fit polygons for complex cases, and acceleration strategies can reduce the creation time of no-fit polygon on benchmark instances by more than sixteen percent on average.\nKeywords:\n[no-fit polygon](https://www.mdpi.com/search?q=no-fit+polygon);[irregular packing problem](https://www.mdpi.com/search?q=irregular+packing+problem);[sliding algorithm](https://www.mdpi.com/search?q=sliding+algorithm);[cutting](https://www.mdpi.com/search?q=cutting);[configuration space obstacle](https://www.mdpi.com/search?q=configuration+space+obstacle)\nMSC:\n90; 68; 51\n## 1. Introduction\nIn the field of cutting and packing problems, there is a kind of problem known as the two-dimensional (2D) irregular packing problem or the nesting problem. It is commonly encountered in many industries and applications, such as metal sheet cutting [1,2], leather [3], clothing [4], paper [5] and spatial arrangement [6]. Through excellent algorithms to optimize the packing, even a one percent increase in the material utilization rate will save lots of resource costs for enterprises and generate huge economic benefits for the whole society. Despite the many practical applications and benefits, the problem has received relatively little attention in the literature when compared to the regular packing problem [7,8,9]. One of the main reasons is that researchers have to deal with the geometry problem, which is the first obstacle they encounter. This means that satisfying the constraint of having all irregular pieces without overlapping is much harder than regular pieces.\nDirect trigonometry involving line intersection and point inclusion testing is the classic method to identify the positional relationship between two polygons. However, the optimization algorithms will become inefficient when it adopts this method, which results in the slightly poor performance of the algorithms. The alternative used in irregular packing problems is the no-fit polygon (NFP), which is also used in the field of engineering and robot motion planning and the aircraft parking stand allocation problem [10]. The no-fit polygon facilitates the research of irregular packing problems [11,12,13,14]. It is an increasingly popular option since it is more efficient than direct trigonometry, particularly when using an iterative search. Determining whether polygons overlap, touch, or are separated only needs to conduct a simple test to identify whether the reference point is inside the NFP. Essentially, the no-fit polygon describes the region in which two polygons intersect. The computational efficiency gained by utilizing this method is very attractive. Hence, it is important to develop an algorithm for creating NFP for the research of irregular packing problems. The algorithm can enrich the application in 2D geometrical computer software.\nHowever, there are few published works on algorithms for generating NFP. Note the fact that developing a robust geometry library is still needed, and this task is very time-consuming and difficult. Furthermore, it is difficult to develop a robust NFP generator because of the complexity of irregular piece shapes. Thus, we propose an improved sliding algorithm for the generation of NFP and give an implementation in detail of our algorithm. Such an algorithm can become good preparation for applying more strategies to solve the irregular packing problem. For instance, in the work published by Costa et al. [15], if the NFP algorithm is efficient, it can directly calculate the new merged piece instead of approximating by one already computed because of this time-consuming operation. In other words, the more efficient the algorithm is, the better.\nThe proposed algorithm only involves two simple geometric stages. The first is generating the external NFP between two polygons, which includes three main steps: finding the touching group, determining the translation vector from all touching groups and computing the translation distance. The second stage is searching on the unvisited edges to determine whether there is a feasible starting point that can be found. If the starting point is available, then return to the first stage to generate the NFP.\nThe contributions of this study are:\n* To address the problem of the efficient and robust creation of the no-fit polygon;\n* To propose an improved sliding algorithm and provide a detailed implementation;\n* To present the concept of touching group, resulting in the number of cases to consider being reduced by half when determining the feasible translation vector;\n* To develop many acceleration strategies to improve the algorithm\u2019s efficiency, such as the point exclusion strategy, the right side test, and the point inclusion test;\n* To assess the performance of the proposed alg...",

An efficient 2D irregular packing algorithm can effectively improve material utilization and reduce processing costs. The reduction in material consumption will also have a beneficial impact on the environment ( [Ke et al., 2020](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B76)). Therefore, research of the packing problem is of great significance for technology and social interest.\n\nThe 2D packing problem is a type of combinatorial optimization problems to locate parts with different shapes compactly in one or more master sheet material to minimize the occupied space or maximize the utilization of the material. The 2D packing problem is currently recognized as a NP problem, which is mainly solved by heuristic algorithms. In recent years, many scholars have conducted research on 2D irregular packing problems with a verity of solutions.\n\nThere exists a number of review articles on packing and cutting problems. We have summarized the main review literature in the field of 2D packing and cutting as shown in [Table 1](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#T1). Brown ( [Brown, 1971](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B17)) introduced an optimum packing and depletion problem with optimization of space and resource usage. Harvey ( [Salkin and De Kluyver, 1975](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B116)) surveyed the application of mathematical optimization models such as linear programming to the knapsack problem. Bruce ( [Golden, 1976](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B50)) surveyed various approaches to the cutting stock problem. Hinxman ( [Hinxman, 1980](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B65)) surveyed the trim-loss and assortment problems, this research paid more attention to cutting and packaging problems in practical applications, and did not mention much about theoretical methods. Garey and Coffman ( [Garey and Johnson, 1981](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B47); [Coffman et al., 1984](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B27)) surveyed the approximation algorithms for bin packing problems. Israni ( [Israni and Sanders, 1982](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B72)) reviewed the 2D cutting stock problem including almost all 2D packaging problems. The author also proposed a rectangular layout method. Sarin ( [Sarin, 1983](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B118)) reviewed methodologies and literature to solve 2D stock cutting problems and introduced an interactive optimization procedure for a general 2D stock cutting problem. Dyckhoff ( [Dyckhoff et al., 1985](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B38)) described a trim loss and related problems and categorized them briefly. Dudzi\u0144ski ( [Dudzi\u0144ski and Walukiewicz, 1987](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B36)) summarized the exact methods for knapsack problems, such as linear programming. Matthias ( [Rode and Rosenberg, 1987](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B114)) analyzed the algorithm for the trim-loss problems. Haessler ( [Haessler and Sweeney, 1991](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B59)) reviewed the solution process of cutting stock problems, including placement algorithm and sequence optimization algorithm. Dowsland ( [Dowsland and Dowsland, 1992](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B34)) reviewed the application of operations research methods to the packing problem and summarized some exact heuristics. Sweeney ( [Sweeney and Paternoster, 1992](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B128)) categorized cutting and packing problems and made application-oriented research records. Cheng ( [Cheng et al., 1994](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B22)) discussed 2D cutting stock problems and their application cases including the pallet loading problem and VLSI placement problem. With the gradual deepening of research on 2D layout problems, typology becomes a common research topic. 2D regular and irregular layout problems are clearly distinguished in practical applications and theoretical methods. Dowsland ( [Dowsland and Dowsland, 1995](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B29)) gave a special review of the 2D irregular nesting problem for the first time. Mavridou ( [Mavridou and Pardalos, 1997](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B98)) summarized applications of the genetic algorithm and simulated annealing algorithm in the optimization of facility layout problems. Dyckhoff ( [Dyckhoff, 1990](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B37)) made a typology of the cutting and packing problems in detail, and W\u00e4scher ( [W\u00e4scher et al., 2007](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B135)) improved the typology later. Hopper ( [Hopper and Turton, 1999](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B67); [Hopper and Turton, 2001a](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B68); [Hopper and Turton, 2001b](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B69)) investigated the application of meta-heuristic and heuristic algorithms in 2D and 3D packing problems. Lodi ( [Lodi et al., 2002a](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B90); [Lodi et al., 2002b](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B91)) reviewed algorithms proposed in the 1990s of 2D packing problems. Bennell et al. ( [Bennell and Oliveira, 2008](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B10); [Bennell and Oliveira, 2009](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B9)) discussed 2D irregular packing problems and related geometric problems.

However, existing approaches often struggle to achieve both high efficiency and compactness in the arrangement of irregularly shaped 2D components, leading to significant material waste and suboptimal layout solutions. To address this issue, this study introduces a novel methodology that integrates advanced image processing and computational intelligence to optimize the arrangement of irregularly shaped components on fixed boards. Employing normalized two-dimensional cross-correlation for enhanced template matching, our approach not only improves material utilization but also enhances packing efficiency by reducing gaps between components. The developed method involves several key steps, including the cropping of cross-correlation matrices and strategic pattern placement, which are critical for achieving a highly compact and computationally efficient arrangement. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances both material conservation and computational efficiency compared to traditional methods, ensuring a more optimized and automated packing process. Our findings provide a practical and scalable solution bridging the gap between theoretical research and industrial applications. This research contributes to advancing computational efficiency, reducing material waste, and optimizing spatial utilization in industrial cutting and packing scenarios.\n\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n\n### [Universal image segmentation for optical identification of 2D materials](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-85159-9?fromPaywallRec=false)\n\nArticleOpen access11 March 2021\n\n### [Accurate quantification of dislocation loops in complex functional alloys enabled by deep learning image analysis](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-74894-4?fromPaywallRec=false)\n\nArticleOpen access24 October 2024\n\n### [Multi-objective steel plate cutting optimization problem based on real number coding genetic algorithm](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-27100-2?fromPaywallRec=false)\n\nArticleOpen access28 December 2022\n\n## Introduction\n\nIn the multifaceted realms of manufacturing and design, practitioners face a spectrum of complex challenges. Central among these is the \u20182-D cutting and packing\u2019 problem, prevalent across industries like furniture craftsmanship, sheet metal fabrication, and footwear production. This issue involves the efficient arrangement of irregularly shaped components on fixed boards[1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-97202-0#ref-CR1), [2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-97202-0#ref-CR2), aiming to maximize space and resource utilization amidst the intricacies of diverse shapes and sizes[3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-97202-0#ref-CR3), [4](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-97202-0#ref-CR4).\n\nThe puzzle\u2019s complexity is further heightened by the need for optimal utilization within spatial and design constraints[5](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-97202-0#ref-CR5). Traditional manual methods, while viable in specific scenarios, often fall short under the pressures of high-volume, complex production, necessitating advanced solutions that integrate mathematical, computational, and spatial optimization[6](https://www.nature.com/www.nature.com#ref-CR6), [7](https://www.nature.com/www.nature.com#ref-CR7), [8](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-97202-0#ref-CR8). Figure\u00a0[1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-97202-0#Fig1) illustrates the application of pattern packing technology in various industrial engineering fields. This includes techniques such as laser cutting and milling machine cutting, which are essential for efficient material utilization and precise part placement.\n\n**Fig. 1**\n\nApplications of Irregularly Shaped Part Layout Algorithms in Various Industries: ( **a**) Waterjet Cutting Metal Plates; ( **b**) Laser Cutting 10\u00a0mm Stainless Steel; ( **c**) Laser Cutting Copper Plates; ( **d**) Milling Machine Cutting Aluminum Alloy Parts.\n\n[Full size image](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-97202-0/figures/1)\n\nAcademic and industrial research have made significant strides in addressing these challenges. Foundational to this field is the work of Iori et al.[9](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-97202-0#ref-CR9), who provided a comprehensive survey of key issues such as the Two-Dimensional Strip Packing Problem (2D-SPP) and the Two-Dimensional Bin Packing Problem (2D-BPP), laying the groundwork for understanding various methodologies.\n\nBuilding on this foundation, research has branched into addressing specific challenges. He et al.[10](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-97202-0#ref-CR10) devised an Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search algorithm for the 2D Circle Bin Packing Problem, and G\u00e1lvez et al.[11](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-97202-0#ref-CR11) developed a pseudo-polynomial-time approximation algorithm for strip packing. Alvarez-Valdes et al.[12](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-97202-0#ref-CR12) explored nesting of irregular shapes with a Branch & Bound Algorithm, while Rakotonirainy and van Vuuren[13](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-97202-0#ref-CR13) and Luo et al.[14](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-97202-0#ref-CR14) focused on metaheuristic algorithms for the 2D strip-packing and knapsack problems.\n\nAttention has also been directed towards packing irregular objects. Abeysooriya et al.[15](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-97202-0#ref-CR15) and Sato et al.[16](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-97202-0#ref-CR16) have proposed novel approaches for this purpose, complemented by the work of Cherri et al.[17](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-97202-0#ref-CR17) and Xu et al.[18](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-97202-0#ref-CR18), who introduced advanced heuristics and optimization algorithms for irregular strip packing and nesting. Additionally, Souza Queiroz and Andretta[19](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-97202-0#ref-CR19) have pioneered efficient solutions for the 2D Irregular Knapsack Problem.\n\nIn the domain of 2D placement and orientation, notable contributions include those by Andrade et al.[20](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-97202-0#ref-CR20), Zhang et al.[21](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-97202-0#ref-CR21), and Yang et al.[22](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-97202-0#ref-CR22), offering integrated strategies for maximizing space utilization in raw material processing. Oliveira et al.[23](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-97202-0#ref-CR23) have provided a comprehensive overview of solution approaches for rectangular cutting and packing problems. Wu et al.[24](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-97202-0#ref-CR24) presented an enhanced heuristic for 2D rectangle packing problems with central rectangles, showing that their IHACR algorithm surpasses the older HACR in efficiency and layout filling rate, particularly for complex layouts in semi-submersible production platforms.\n\nSpecialized challenges have been addressed by researchers such as Wu et al.[25](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-97202-0#ref-CR25) and Leao et al.[26](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-97202-0#ref-CR26), focusing on the Central Rectangle Rectangular Packing Area Maximization Proble...",

I am given a single polygon as a boundary (convex or concave may also contain holes) and a single \"fill\" polygon (may also be convex or concave, does not contain holes) and I need to fill the boundary polygon with a specified number of fill polygons. (I'm working in 2D).\n\nMany of the polygon packing heuristics I've found assume that the boundary and/or filling polygons will be rectangular and also that the filling polygons will be of different sizes. In my case, the filling polygons may be non-rectangular, but all will be exactly the same.\n\nMaybe this is a particular type of packing problem? If somebody has a definition for this type of polygon packing I'll gladly google away, but so far I've not found anything which is similar enough to be of great use.\n\nThanks.\n\n- [algorithm](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/algorithm)\n- [polygon](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/polygon)\n- [heuristics](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/heuristics)\n- [packing](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/packing)\n\n[Share](https://stackoverflow.com/q/6864382)\n\n[Improve this question](https://stackoverflow.com/posts/6864382/edit)\n\nFollow\n\nasked Jul 28, 2011 at 19:12\n\n[![Craig's user avatar](https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/015502b5e2de5fa52ffa72f5b2bbbd75?s=64&d=identicon&r=PG)](https://stackoverflow.com/users/863506/craig)\n\n[Craig](https://stackoverflow.com/users/863506/craig) Craig\n\n56411 gold badge55 silver badges2020 bronze badges\n\n4\n\n- No, this doesn't look like some well-known special case of the packing problem. Anything that works with distinct shapes should trivially work with identical shapes too. If you have an algorithm that works well for a rectangular boundary, you can try to adapt it for an arbitrary boundary. Modify it so that you can at a flip opre-fill your boundary with some shapes that cannot be moved or deleted (e.g. there's only one way to place them). Solve for a rectangular boundary, pre-filled with some shapes that just leave your original boundary unfilled. Not all algorithms can be adapted like this.\n\n\u2013\u00a0[n. m. could be an AI](https://stackoverflow.com/users/775806/n-m-could-be-an-ai)\n\nCommentedJul 28, 2011 at 20:22\n\n- The case with only one kind of filling polygon is definitely a special case of the general situation with different filling polys. I believe most heuristics for solving this kind of cutting/packing problem uses the no-fit polygon, so googling \"no-fit irregular packing\"' or something like that could be a good start.\n\n\u2013\u00a0[Anders Forsgren](https://stackoverflow.com/users/678410/anders-forsgren)\n\nCommentedJul 28, 2011 at 23:05\n\n- I think you should as this in the theoretical cs version of SO.\n\n\u2013\u00a0[Ira Baxter](https://stackoverflow.com/users/120163/ira-baxter)\n\nCommentedAug 31, 2011 at 5:25\n\n- for the algorithm: this is commonly called \"nesting\", which means to pack irregular, potentially non-convex, 2D/3D shapes into some piece of \"stock\" that is then cut. things need not be nested literally, but they could be.\n\n\u2013\u00a0[Christoph Rackwitz](https://stackoverflow.com/users/2602877/christoph-rackwitz)\n\nCommentedJun 26, 2023 at 19:18\n\n\n[Add a comment](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6864382/packing-arbitrary-polygons-within-an-arbitrary-boundary)\u00a0\\|\n\n## 4 Answers 4\n\nSorted by:\n[Reset to default](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6864382/packing-arbitrary-polygons-within-an-arbitrary-boundary?answertab=scoredesc#tab-top)\n\nHighest score (default)Trending (recent votes count more)Date modified (newest first)Date created (oldest first)\n\n4\n\nThe question you ask is very hard. To put this in perspective, the (much) simpler case where you're packing the interior of your bounded polygon with non-overlapping disks is already hard, and disks are the simplest possible \"packing shape\" (with any other shape you have to consider orientation as well as size and center location).\n\nIn fact, I think it's an open problem in [computational geometry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_geometry) to determine for an arbitrary integer N and arbitrary bounded polygonal region (in the Euclidean plane), what is the \"optimal\" (in the sense of covering the greatest percentage of the polygon interior) packing of N inscribed non-overlapping disks, where you are free to choose the radius and center location of each disk. I'm sure the \"best\" answer _is_ known for certain special polygonal shapes (like rectangles, circles, and triangles), but for arbitrary shapes your best \"heuristic\" is probably:\n\n1. Start your shape counter at N.\n2. Add the largest \"packing shape\" you can fit completely inside the polygonal boundary without overlapping any other packing shapes.\n3. Decrement your shape counter.\n4. If your shape counter is > 0, go to step 2.\n\nI say \"probably\" because \"largest first\" isn't always the best way to pack things into a confined space. You can dig into that particular flavor of craziness by reading about the [bin packing problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bin_packing_problem) and [knapsack problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem).\n\n**EDIT:** Step 2 by itself is hard. A reasonable strategy would be to pick an arbitrary point on the interior of the polygon as the center and \"inflate\" the disk until it touches either the boundary or another disk (or both), and then \"slide\" the disk while continuing to inflate it so that it remains inside the boundary without overlapping any other disks until it is \"trapped\" - with at least 2 points of contact with the boundary and/or other disks. But it isn't easy to formalize this \"sliding process\". And even if you get the sliding process right, this strategy doesn't guarantee that you'll find the biggest \"inscribable disk\" - your \"locally maximal\" disk could be trapped in a \"lobe\" of the interior which is connected by a narrow \"neck\" of free space to a larger \"lobe\" where a larger disk would fit.\n\n[Share](https://stackoverflow.com/a/7342898)\n\n[Improve this answer](https://stackoverflow.com/posts/7342898/edit)\n\nFollow\n\n[edited Feb 27, 2013 at 20:29](https://stackoverflow.com/posts/7342898/revisions)\n\nanswered Sep 8, 2011 at 3:46\n\n[![Peter's user avatar](https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f031e9e9b7476fc5d3674fe4a9c59ef2?s=64&d=identicon&r=PG)](https://stackoverflow.com/users/227491/peter)\n\n[Peter](https://stackoverflow.com/users/227491/peter) Peter\n\n2,53611 gold badge2323 silver badges3232 bronze badges\n\n[Add a comment](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6864382/packing-arbitrary-polygons-within-an-arbitrary-boundary)\u00a0\\|\n\n3\n\nThanks for the replies, my requirements were such that I was able to further simplify the problem by not having to deal with orientation and I then even further simplified by only really wor...",
