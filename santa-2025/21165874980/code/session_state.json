      "finding": "Two\u2011dimensional polygon packing \u2013 the problem of arranging irregular shapes (such as Christmas trees) inside a fixed\u2011size sheet or strip with minimal waste \u2013 is a classic NP\u2011complete nesting problem.  The literature distinguishes **exact** approaches that guarantee optimality from **heuristic/approximation** methods that trade optimality for speed on large, real\u2011world instances.  Exact formulations treat the placement of each polygon as a set of relative pairwise relationships (e.g., \u201cpolygon\u202fA is to the left of polygon\u202fB\u201d) and solve the resulting meta\u2011CSP or integer\u2011programming model with branch\u2011and\u2011bound, symmetry\u2011breaking, and geometric pruning techniques\u202f([cse.unl.edu](https://cse.unl.edu/~choueiry/Documents/Moffitt-ICAPS06.pdf)).  For problems with many large items, a two\u2011level search that first selects a promising subset of rectangles and then refines their exact positions has also proved effective\u202f([sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S036083",
