      "text": "Two\u2011dimensional polygon packing \u2013 the problem of arranging irregular shapes (such as Christmas trees) inside a fixed\u2011size sheet or strip with minimal waste \u2013 is a classic NP\u2011complete nesting problem.  The literature distinguishes **exact** approaches that guarantee optimality from **heuristic/approximation** methods that trade optimality for speed on large, real\u2011world instances.  Exact formulations treat the placement of each polygon as a set of relative pairwise relationships (e.g., \u201cpolygon\u202fA is to the left of polygon\u202fB\u201d) and solve the resulting meta\u2011CSP or integer\u2011programming model with branch\u2011and\u2011bound, symmetry\u2011breaking, and geometric pruning techniques\u202f([cse.unl.edu](https://cse.unl.edu/~choueiry/Documents/Moffitt-ICAPS06.pdf)).  For problems with many large items, a two\u2011level search that first selects a promising subset of rectangles and then refines their exact positions has also proved effective\u202f([sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0360835207000678)).\n\nBecause optimal methods quickly become infeasible for irregular polygons, most practitioners rely on **heuristic and meta\u2011heuristic** schemes.  The **Bottom\u2011Left\u2011Decreasing (BLD)** family \u2013 placing items in decreasing order of a size metric (height, width, area, or perimeter) and always as far left and down as possible \u2013 remains a strong baseline, and its stochastic variant BLD* (which samples random orderings guided by Kendall\u2011tau distance) consistently outperforms many recent meta\u2011heuristics after only a minute of computation\u202f([harvard.edu](https://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~michaelm/postscripts/jea2005.pdf)).  **No\u2011Fit\u2011Polygon (NFP)** constructions give the exact feasible region for two polygons and are the foundation of many nesting algorithms, though implementing a clear NFP generator can be non\u2011trivial (see the Stack\u2011Overflow discussion on NFP algorithms)\u202f([stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2527129/polygon-packing-2d)).  More sophisticated local\u2011search frameworks first **group polygons** using convex\u2011hull and bounding\u2011box similarity to form near\u2011rectangular clusters, then apply a bottom\u2011left initialization followed by an **Extended Local Search (ELS)** that iteratively adjusts the strip length and re\u2011positions groups\u202f([scholar.its.ac.id](https://scholar.its.ac.id/en/publications/extended-local-search-and-polygon-grouping-for-2d-irregular-strip)).  A compact **binary\u2011tree representation** of the sheet\u2019s free space enables fast insertion and removal of rectangles during such local moves\u202f([sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0260877404004753)).\n\nFor large\u2011scale or time\u2011critical applications, **approximation algorithms** for translational packing of convex polygons provide provable guarantees while remaining practical.  Recent work achieves improved constant\u2011factor approximations for polygon bin\u2011packing, strip\u2011packing, and area/minimum\u2011perimeter variants by sorting polygons by height/orientation and applying enhanced shelf\u2011packing strategies\u202f([arxiv.org](https://export.arxiv.org/pdf/2308.08523v1.pdf)).

In our algorithm, the rectangles are placed into the container one by one and each rectangle should be packed at a position by a corner-occupying action so that it touches two items without overlapping other already packed rectangles. At the first level of our algorithm, a simple algorithm called*A*0selects and packs one rectangle according to the highest degree first rule at every iteration of packing. At the second level,*A*0is itself used to evaluate the benefit of a CCOA more globally. Computational results show that the resulted[packing algorithm](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/packing-algorithm)called*A*1produces high-density solutions within short running times.\n## Introduction\nThe two-dimensional (2D) rectangular packing problem is an optimization problem of allocating a set of rectangular items to larger containers with the objective of minimizing the waste. The 2D rectangular packing problem has been widely studied in recent decades, as it has numerous applications in the cutting and packing industry, e.g. wood, glass and cloth industries, newspapers paging, VLSI floor planning and so on, with different applications incorporating different constraints and objectives (Chan and Markov, 2004, Hifi and Ouafi, 1998, Lee and Sewell, 1999, Lesh et al., 2004, Lodi et al., 2002). The 2D rectangular packing problem belongs to a subset of classical cutting and packing problems and has been shown to be an NP hard problem (Hochbaum &amp; Maass, 1985). Therefore, various approximation or heuristic algorithms have been proposed for approaching the problem.\nIn rectangle packing, one of the earliest approaches is the so-called bottom-left (BL) heuristic (Baker, Coffman, &amp; Rivest, 1980). In BL, the rectangles to be placed are, starting from the top-right corner of the container, first slide vertically downward as far as possible, followed by sliding horizontally as far as possible to the left, so as to reduce the number of possible packing patterns. One improved variant of BL is the bottom-left-fill (BLF) heuristic, in which the rectangles are placed directly into the lowest positions available and then left justified. Both BL and BLF are later used in meta-heuristic based algorithms. Hybrid algorithms combining genetic algorithm (GA) and deterministic methods were proposed by Jakobs, 1996, Liu and Teng, 1999, Dagli and Poshyanonda, 1997. An empirical investigation of the result of different combinations of simulated annealing (SA) and GA with various heuristics such as BL or BLF was given by Hopper and Turton (2001).\nInspired by enhancing some working experience of professional masons in their everyday work, a Less Flexibility First (LFF) packing principle was proposed in Tam et al., 1998, Wu et al., 2002 for solving the rectangular packing problem. Recently, by introducing a tightness measure to represent the degree of fitting between rectangles and placement locations, an enhanced version of LFF, called LFFT, was proposed in Wu, Chan, and SAGA (2005). More recently, a fast heuristic recursive (HR) algorithm based on divide-and-conquer and greedy strategies was proposed in Zhang, Kang, and Deng (2006), and an effective GA, called SPGAL, was proposed in Bortfeldt (2006) for the four subtypes of the 2D strip packing problem.\nBased on the previous studies (Huang et al., 2005, Tam et al., 1998, Wu et al., 2002), we will propose a quite different class of efficient heuristic for the 2D rectangular packing problem in this paper. Different from the stochastic search methods where the researches are mainly focused on finding the efficient data structures for presenting packing results so that the search space and the processing time of the underling search engine can be minimized, our algorithm is a deterministic algorithm and no data structure is needed. Similar to LFF, our algorithm packs the rectangles into the container one by one and each rectangle should be packed at a position occupying an empty corner in the container. The computational results of our proposed algorithm is very encouraging in terms of both packing density and running time.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 gives the problem definition. Section 3 describes the details of the algorithm. Section 4 presents our experimental results for two sets of test instances. We draw our conclusions in Section 5.\n## Section snippets\n## Problem definition\nWe consider the following rectangular packing problem: given a rectangular empty container with fixed width and infinite height and a set of rectangles with various sizes, the rectangle packing problem is to pack each rectangle into the container such that no two rectangles overlap and the used height of the container is minimized. From this optimization problem, an associated decision problem can be formally stated as follows:\nGiven a rectangular board with given width*W*and given height*H*, and\n## Corner-occupying action and degree\n**Definition**Configuration\nA configuration*C*is a pattern (layout) where*m*(0\u2a7d*m*&lt;*n*) rectangles have been already packed inside the container without overlap, and*n*\u2212*m*rectangles remain to be packed into the container.\nA configuration is said to be successful if*m*=*n*, i.e., all the rectangles have been placed inside the container without overlapping.

Although tree-representations of this problem have been presented in the open literature extensively, the binary tree representation is shown in this work to be capable of capturing any configuration of such rectangular shapes in two-dimensional space, such as rotations through right angles and translations, and to be advantageous and more general over other approaches when local search [optimization procedures](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/optimisation-procedure) are to be utilized. The construction is such that these boxes must be bound together in pairs having a common edge, and can be extended to contain constrains regarding vertical or horizontal space between the actual objects as well as special types of cuts, e.g. guillotine cuts used in the glass cutting industry. Finally, a simple continuous sheet application is shown as a demonstration of the capabilities of the algorithm in connection with a local search method, specifically threshold accepting.\n\n## Section snippets\n\n## Introduction and literature survey\n\nThis paper presents a methodology suitable for local search methods when these are applied to two-dimensional space partitioning problems. Such problems include the trim loss minimization problem, which finds many applications, as for example in the cutting of two-dimensional shapes from wood, marble, glass, fabric, etc. In these applications the loss of material due to the placement and cutting constraints is the issue of concern and its minimization is the goal of related optimization\n\n## Local search methods: an overview\n\nAlthough the above sited literature is not an exhaustive attempt to account for the enormous bulk of work appearing on the theme topic of this paper, nonetheless it is considered as a representative cross section of advances and ideas in the field as it currently stands.

Lesh et al.\n1. INTRODUCTION\nPacking problems involve constructing an arrangement of items that minimizes\nthe total space required by the arrangement. In this paper, we specifically con\u0002sider the two-dimensional (2D) rectangular strip packing problem. The input\nis a list of n rectangles with their dimensions and a target width W. The goal is\nto pack the rectangles without overlap into a single rectangle of width W and\nminimum height H. We further restrict ourselves to the orthogonal variation,\nwhere rectangles must be placed parallel to the horizontal and vertical axes.\nWe consider two variations: fixed orientation, in which the rectangles cannot be\nrotated, and variable orientation, in which they can be rotated by 90\u25e6. Further,\nfor all our test cases, all dimensions are integers. Like most packing problems,\n2D rectangular strip packing (even with these restrictions) is NP-hard.\nA common method for packing rectangles is to take an ordered list of rect\u0002angles and greedily place them one by one. Perhaps the best studied and most\neffective such heuristic for the fixed-orientation variation is the Bottom-Left\n(BL) heuristic, where rectangles are sequentially placed first as close to the\nbottom and then as far to the left as they can fit. For some problems, BL can\u0002not find the optimal packing under any ordering of the rectangles [Baker et al.\n1980; Brown 1980], nor does it perform well in practice when applied to random\norderings. However, a very successful approach is to apply BL to the rectan\u0002gles ordered by decreasing height, width, perimeter, and area and return the\nbest of the four packings that result [Hopper 2000]. We refer to this scheme as\nBottom-Left-Decreasing (BLD).\nA natural alternative approach would be to find good orderings of the rectan\u0002gles for BL or other similar heuristics using standard search techniques, such\nas simulated annealing, genetic algorithms, or tabu search. Despite significant\nefforts in this area, the search space has not generally proved amenable to such\nsearch techniques; for more details see the thesis of Hopper [2000]. Recently,\ngenetic algorithms and tabu search, using a different search space, have proved\nmore successful [Iori et al. 2003].\nIn this paper, we present a variation of the BLD heuristic called BLD\u2217\nthat considers successive random perturbations of the original four decreasing\norderings. We also present an apparently novel generalization of BL and, conse\u0002quently, of BLD and BLD\u2217, for the variable orientation case. Our experiments on\nboth benchmark and randomly generated problems show that BLD\u2217 substan\u0002tially outperforms BLD, as well as BL applied to randomly chosen orderings.\nFor example, for the benchmarks taken from Hopper [2000] in the case of fixed\norientation, BLD\u2217 reduces the packing height from an average of 9.4% over\noptimal by BLD to about 4.9% over optimal after just one minute. These are\nthe best published results for these benchmarks that we are aware of. We note\nthat improvements of even 1% can be very valuable for industrial applications\nof this problem, such as glass and steel cutting.\nThis work was done as part of Human-Guided Search (HuGS) project, an\nongoing effort to develop interactive optimization systems [Klau et al. 2002a].\nDetermining how people can effectively interact with powerful stochastic search\nalgorithms is important because it leverages people\u2019s abilities in areas in which\nACM Journal of Experimental Algorithmics, Vol. 10, Article No. 1.2, 2005.\nNew Approaches to 2D Rectangular Strip Packing \u2022 3\nthey currently outperform computers, such as visual perception and strategic\nassessment. Furthermore, involving people in the process of optimization can\nhelp them understand and trust the produced solutions, as well as modify them\non the fly, if the need arises. Human-guided search makes particular sense in\nthe context of cutting and packing problems, where humans can often find\nbetter solutions than the best current algorithms. Our interactive optimization\nsystem is designed to allow people to effectively use the computer\u2019s speed and\npreprogrammed algorithms to more quickly find good solutions than they could\nfind alone, especially for larger problems.\nFor the 2D packing problem, we explored people\u2019s ability to guide our BLD\u2217\nheuristic. We found that people can reason about this problem to make use of the\ncomputer\u2019s power extremely well. People can identify particularly well-packed\nsubregions of a given packing and then focus a search algorithm on improving\nthe other parts. People can also devise multistep repairs to a packing problem to\nreduce unused space, often producing packings that could not be found by the BL\nheuristic for any ordering of rectangles. Our experiments on large benchmarks\nshow that interactive use of BLD\u2217 can produce solutions 1% closer to optimal\nin about 20 min than BLD\u2217 produces on its own in 2 hours. Thus, 2D packing\nseems to be a problem for which people and computers can currently produce\nbetter results together tha...",

One particular category of these packing problems is\ntwo-dimensional packing, which is encountered in everyday scenarios like arranging items\non a shelf and in industrial applications such as cutting cookies from rolled-out dough\nor manufacturing sets of tiles from standard-sized panels made of wood, glass, or metal.\nAnother intriguing example involves cutting fabric pieces for clothing production. In this\ncase, the pieces often cannot be rotated freely, as they must adhere to a desired pattern\nin the final product, which is tailored of multiple elements. The widespread applicability\nof two-dimensional packing problems has led to a surge of interest in designing efficient\nalgorithms to address them. In this paper, we follow the line of research and study the\nproblem of packing convex polygons without rotations in various settings depending on the\ntype of containers used.\nPast research focusing on theoretical considerations of two-dimensional packings mainly\nconcentrates on the scenario when all objects are axis-parallel rectangles. In this paper, we\nwill discuss packing without rotations, in which only translations are permitted. There are\ntwo main classes of the problem depending on whether the size of the container is fixed and\nwe want to minimize the number of containers used or whether we want to minimize the\ncontainer\u2019s size with respect to some objective function.\nA seminal example of the first class is the Geometric Bin Packing problem in which\na number of unit size squared bins to pack is to be minimized. The problem is arguably\nthe most natural generalization of the regular (1D) Bin Packing to two dimensions, and\nits absolute approximability has been fully understood. Unless P = N P, the best possible\nefficient constant factor approximation is 2 [15], and such an algorithm is known [10].\nIn the second class, there are several variants to be considered. An example is the\nStrip Packing Problem which is concerned with packing objects into a strip of width\n1 and infinite height in such a way that the maximum of all the heights of the placed\nobjects is minimized. Like Geometric Bin Packing, Strip Packing generalizes (1D)\nBin Packing. The best known efficient constant factor approximation for Strip Packing\nhas approximation factor (5/3 + \u03f5) [9]. It is known that there can not exist a polynomial\ntime algorithm with an approximation ratio of (3/2 \u2212 \u03f5) for any \u03f5 > 0 unless P = N P, which\nfollows directly from the approximation hardness of (1D) Bin Packing. Both classes of\nproblems have been also considered in the asymptotic setting, see e.g. [11, 5, 12].\nIn younger time, there was also an increase of interest in cases where the objects in\nquestion are general convex polygons. Alt, de Berg and Knauer [2, 3] considered the problem\nof packing an instance consisting of a number of convex polygons of the form p \u2282 [0, 1]2into\na minimum area axis-parallel rectangular container. We refer to this problem as Polygon\nArea Minimization throughout this paper. In the special case where the instance consists\nof rectangles only, the problem is known to admit a PTAS [4]. They proved the existence of\nthe following efficient algorithm:\nA 23.78-approximation for Polygon Area Minimization.\nRecently, Aamand, Abrahamsen, Beretta and Kleist [1] showed that the algorithm of Alt,\nde Berg and Knauer can be leveraged to obtain also efficient approximation algorithms of\nfurther problems:\nA 7-approximation for Polygon Perimeter Minimization.\nA 51-approximation for Polygon Strip Packing.\nAn 11-approximation for Polygon Bin Packing for polygons with diameter at most 1\n10 .\nA. Kurpisz and S. Suter 3\n1.1 Our results\nThe results of Alt, de Berg and Knauer [2, 3] and Aamand et al. [1] are heavily based on\nso-called shelf packing algorithms. In shelf packing algorithms, the objects are first placed\non the shelves, possibly ordered by height, which are later stacked on one another to build\na final solution. Compared to axis-parallel rectangles, the main challenge in designing an\napproximation algorithm for polygon packing problems is that objects cannot be sorted by\nheight and orientation simultaneously. As a result, the algorithm and its analysis in [2, 3]\nhave such a large approximation guarantee. In this paper, we provide new insight into how\nshelf packing algorithms should be applied to polygon packing problems. We introduce a\nsequence of transformations of the objects that allow us first to sort them by height and later\nby orientation to build a solution of a much better approximation guarantee. More precisely,\nwe design polynomial-time algorithms with the following factors:\nA 9.45-approximation for Polygon Area Minimization.\nUsing this algorithm as a subroutine, we build upon the methods from Aamand et al. [1] to\nobtain the following efficient approximation algorithms:\nA (3.75 + \u03f5)-approximation for Polygon Perimeter Minimization.\nA 21.89-approximation for Polygon Strip Packing.\nA 5.09-approximation for Polygon Bin Packing for polygons which have their diameter\nbounded by 1\n10 .\nThe results are proved in Sections 4, 5, 6, and 7 respectively. Furthermore, in Section 8\nwe show the following results, which make progress towards solving an open question of a\nO(1)-approximation algorithm for Polygon Bin Packing for arbitrary polygons.\nThere is an efficient O(\n1\n\u03b4\n)-approximation algorithm for Polygon Bin Packing for\ninstances where each polygon has width or height at most 1 \u2212 \u03b4.\nThere is an efficient O(1)-approximation algorithm for Polygon Bin Packing for\ninstances with the property that all polygons share a spine (up to translation) with height\nat least 3\n4\n.\n2 Preliminaries\nWe start out considerations by recalling a classical and well-known problem in theoretical\ncomputer science, the Bin Packing problem: Given a list of numbers s1, . . . , sn \u2208 (0, 1] \u2229 Q,\nrepresenting the sizes of n objects, the goal is to find the minimum number of bins of size 1,\nso that we can pac...",

      "text": "Optimal Rectangle Packing: A Meta-CSP Approach\nMichael D. Moffitt and Martha E. Pollack\nDepartment of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science\nUniversity of Michigan\nAnn Arbor, MI 48109, USA\n{mmoffitt, pollackm}@eecs.umich.edu\nAbstract\nWe present a new approach to optimal rectangle packing, an\nNP-complete problem that can be used to model many sim\u0002ple scheduling tasks. Recent attempts at incorporating artifi\u0002cial intelligence search techniques to the problem of rectangle\npacking have focused on a CSP formulation, in which partial\nassignments are defined to be the fixed placement of a sub\u0002set of rectangles. Our technique takes a significant departure\nfrom this search space, as we instead view partial assignments\nas subsets of relative pairwise relationships between rectan\u0002gles. This approach recalls the meta-CSP commonly con\u0002structed in constraint-based temporal reasoning, and is thus a\ncandidate for several pruning techniques that have been de\u0002veloped in that field. We apply these to the domain of rect\u0002angle packing, and develop a suite of new techniques that ex\u0002ploit both the symmetry and geometry present in this partic\u0002ular domain. We then provide experimental results demon\u0002strating that our approach performs competitively compared\nto the previous state-of-the-art on a series of benchmarks,\nmatching or surpassing it in speed on nearly all instances.\nFinally, we conjecture that our technique is particularly ap\u0002propriate for problems containing large rectangles, which are\ndifficult for the fixed-placement formulation to handle effi\u0002ciently.\nIntroduction\nThe problem of rectangle packing is one that has drawn at\u0002tention from several diverse fields of computer science. For\ninstance, in the context of scheduling, it can be used to rep\u0002resent scenarios where jobs require a fixed amount of time\nand resources, which compose the two dimensions of a sin\u0002gle rectangle. The task of packing many such rectangles into\nan enclosing space, so as to minimize the width, height, or\narea of this space, allows for the minimization of makespan,\nresources needed, or total wasted resource. In VLSI design,\nrectangles represent actual physical modules that need to be\nplaced in a spatial arrangement such that no two modules\noverlap.\nOne of the more recent approaches (Korf 2003) has cast\noptimal rectangle packing as a constraint satisfaction prob\u0002lem (CSP). In this formulation, a variable is created for each\nrectangle, whose legal values are the positions that rectan\u0002gle could occupy without exceeding the boundaries of the\nenclosing space.

By obtaining\nlower bounds on the amount of wasted space at each node in\nthe search, an efficient algorithm is constructed, which was\nlater refined (Korf 2004) into the fastest known algorithm\nfor optimal rectangle packing.\nIn this paper, we present a new approach to rectangle\npacking. Specifically, we cast the problem of optimally\npacking a set of rectangles with fixed orientations as a meta\u0002CSP. In this formulation, we create a meta-variable for each\npair of rectangles, whose values are the four pairwise re\u0002lationships (i.e., above, below, left of, right of) that pre\u0002vent that pair from overlapping. As such, commitment to\nthe exact placement of any rectangle is not established un\u0002til a consistent solution has been generated. In this regard,\nour approach resembles graph-based methods for optimal\nrectangle packing (Onodera, Taniguchi, & Tamaru 1991),\nwhich have previously been unable to cope with more than a\nsmall handful of rectangles. The key difference in our meta\u0002CSP formulation is the introduction of modern artificial\u0002intelligence search techniques that greatly increase the effi\u0002ciency of exploring this alternative space. Some of these are\ndrawn from literature on constraint-based temporal reason\u0002ing (Dechter, Meiri, & Pearl 1991; Stergiou & Koubarakis\n1998; Tsamardinos & Pollack 2003), while others are en\u0002tirely new techniques that exploit the symmetry and geom\u0002etry present in this particular domain. We combine these\nmethods to create the BLUEBLOCKER solver, and provide ex\u0002perimental results demonstrating that our approach performs\ncompetitively compared to the previous state-of-the-art on a\nseries of benchmarks. Finally, we conjecture that our tech\u0002nique is particularly appropriate for problems containing\nlarge rectangles, which are difficult for the fixed-placement\nformulation to handle efficiently.\nBackground\nRectangle Packing\nConsider the following problem: we are given a set of N\njobs, where each job j requires a specific number of workers\n(or machines) mj and a specific amount of uninterrupted\nprocessing time pj . Assuming that all workers are paid the\nsame salary and work the same hours, one may wish to find\na schedule that minimizes the total cost of labor (which is\nproportional to the product of number of workers and the\ntotal hours worked).\n93\nThis problem can be approximated as a rectangle pack\u0002ing problem.1 Specifically, each job can be represented by a\nrectangle, with width wj being equal to the time required pj ,\nand height hj being equal to the required number of work\u0002ers mj . Minimizing the total labor cost is then equivalent to\nfinding an enclosing rectangle of dimensions W \u00d7 H whose\ntotal area is minimal. We refer to this as the Minimal Bound\u0002ing Box Problem. The decision variant of this, where the di\u0002mensions of the enclosing space are specified, we refer to as\nthe Containment Problem.\nPrevious work on rectangle packing has primarily focused\non generating approximate or suboptimal solutions, using\ntechniques such as genetic algorithms and simulated anneal\u0002ing. To facilitate these approaches, a number of data struc\u0002tures have been developed to represent a layout of rectangles\nincluding sequence pairs (Murata et al. 1995), BSG struc\u0002tures (Nakatake et al. 1996), and O-Trees (Guo, Cheng, &\nYoshimura 1999). We omit the details of such structures, as\nthey are largely unrelated to our formulation.\nThe first line of research to consider optimal two\u0002dimensional compactions of rectangles (Onodera,\nTaniguchi, & Tamaru 1991) applied a branch-and-bound\napproach, using a graph algorithm to maintain consistency\nat each step of the backtracking search. Extensions of\nthis method have been largely avoided, as it was shown to\nhandle no more than six rectangles tractably. More recently,\nan algorithm using the O-Tree representation was able\nto surpass this record by efficiently handling up to nine\nrectangles (Chan & Markov 2004).\nRectangle Packing as a CSP\nOne of the more distinctive approaches to rectangle packing\n(Korf 2003) applied artificial intelligence search techniques\nwith great success. In this work, rectangle packing is mod\u0002eled as a binary constraint satisfaction problem. There is a\nvariable for each rectangle, whose legal values are the po\u0002sitions it could occupy without exceeding the boundaries of\nthe enclosing space. In addition, there is a binary constraint\nbetween each pair of rectangles that they cannot overlap.\nTo solve this CSP, a backtracking algorithm is used. At\neach node in the search, a rectangle is given a fixed posi\u0002tion within the enclosing space. This is accomplished by\n\u201cdrawing\u201d the rectangle (or an outline of the rectangle) onto\na bitmap representing the entire area. For example, one such\npartial assignment is depicted in Figure 1. Here, two rect\u0002angles (in fact, squares) have been given assignments. The\nupper-left corner of the 6\u00d76 square has been placed at (0, 0),\nand the upper-left corner of the 5\u00d75 square has been placed\nat (6, 0). Suppose we have four more squares remaining,\nwith dimensions 4\u00d74, 3\u00d73, 2\u00d72, and 1\u00d71; by visual in\u0002spection...",

In*two-dimensional bin packing problems*these units are finite rectangles, and the objective is to pack all the items into the minimum number of units, while in*two-dimensional strip packing problems*there is a single standardized unit of given width, and the objective is to pack all the items within the minimum height. We discuss mathematical models, and survey lower bounds, classical approximation algorithms, recent heuristic and metaheuristic methods and exact enumerative approaches. The relevant special cases where the items have to be packed into rows forming levels are also discussed in detail.\n## Introduction\nIn several industrial applications one is required to allocate a set of rectangular items to larger rectangular standardized stock units by minimizing the waste. In wood or glass industries, rectangular components have to be cut from large sheets of material. In warehousing contexts, goods have to be placed on shelves. In newspapers paging, articles and advertisements have to be arranged in pages. In these applications, the standardized stock units are rectangles, and a common objective function is to pack all the requested items into the minimum number of units: the resulting optimization problems are known in the literature as two-dimensional bin packing problems. In other contexts, such as paper or cloth industries, we have instead a single standardized unit (a roll of material), and the objective is to obtain the items by using the minimum roll length: the problems are then referred to as two-dimensional strip packing problems. As we will see in the following, the two problems have a strict relation in almost all algorithmic approaches to their solution.\nMost of the contributions in the literature are devoted to the case where the items to be packed have a fixed orientation with respect to the stock unit(s), i.e., one is not allowed to rotate them. This case, which is the object of the present article, reflects a number of practical contexts, such as the cutting of corrugated or decorated material (wood, glass, cloth industries), or the newspapers paging. For variants allowing rotations (usually by 90\u00b0) and/or constraints on the items placement (such as the \u201cguillotine cuts\u201d), the reader is referred to Lodi et al. [41], [42], where a three-field classification of the area is also introduced. General surveys on cutting and packing problems can be found in Dyckhoff and Finke [17], Dowsland and Dowsland [16] and Dyckhoff et al. [18]. Results on the probabilistic analysis of packing algorithms can be found in Coffman and Shor [12] and Coffman and Lueker [11].\nLet us introduce the problems in a more formal way. We are given a set of*n*rectangular*items**j*\u2208*J*={1,\u2026,*n*}, each defined by a*width*,*w**j*, and a*height*,*h**j*:\n* (i)\nin the*Two-Dimensional Bin Packing Problem*(2BP), we are further given an unlimited number of identical rectangular*bins*of width*W*and height*H*, and the objective is to allocate all the items to the minimum number of bins;\n* (ii)\nin the*Two-Dimensional Strip Packing Problem*(2SP), we are further given a bin of width*W*and infinite height (hereafter called*strip*), and the objective is to allocate all the items to the strip by minimizing the height to which the strip is used.\nIn both cases, the items have to be packed with their*w*-edges parallel to the*W*-edge of the bins (or strip). We will assume, with no loss of generality, that all input data are positive integers, and that*w**j*\u2a7d*W*and*h**j*\u2a7d*H*(*j*=1,\u2026,*n*).\nBoth problems are strongly NP-hard, as is easily seen by transformation from the strongly NP-hard (one-dimensional)*Bin Packing Problem*(1BP), in which*n*items, each having an associated size*h**j*, have to be partitioned into the minimum number of subsets so that the sum of the sizes in each subset does not exceed a given capacity*H*.\nA third relevant case of rectangle packing is the following. Each item*j*has an associated profit*p**j*&gt;0, and the problem is to select a subset of items, to be packed in a single finite bin, which maximizes the total selected profit. This problem is usually denoted as (*Two-Dimensional*)*Cutting Stock*, although it had been introduced by Gilmore and Gomory [29] as (*Two-Dimensional*)*Cutting Knapsack*.\nIn this survey we concentrate on two-dimensional problems in which all items have to be packed, i.e., on 2SP and 2BP. The reader is referred to Dyckhoff et al. [18, Section 5] for an annotated bibliography on two-dimensional cutting stock problems. For both 2SP and 2BP, we also consider the special case where the items have to be packed into rows forming levels.\nIn Section 2 we discuss mathematical models for the various problems introduced above. In Section 3 we survey classical approximation algorithms as well as more recent heuristic and metaheuristic methods. In Section 4 we introduce lower bounding techniques, while in Section 5 we describe exact enumerative approaches.\n## Section snippets\n## Modeling two-dimensional problems\nThe first attempt to model two-dimensional packing problems was made by Gilmore and Gomory [29], through an extension of their approach to 1BP (see [27], [28]). They proposed a column generation approach (see [53] for a recent survey) based on the enumeration of all subsets of items (*patterns*) that can be packed into a single bin. Let*A**j*be a binary column vector of*n*elements*a**ij*(*i*=1,\u2026,*n*) taking the value 1 if item*i*belongs to the*j*th pattern, and the value 0 otherwise. The set of all\n## Approximation algorithms\nIn this section we concentrate on*off-line*algorithms, i.e., algorithms which have full knowledge of the input.
