## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.647327 from baseline (unchanged after 8 experiments)
- Best LB score: 70.647327 (confirmed from submissions)
- Target: 68.919154 | Gap to target: 1.728 points (2.5%)

## CRITICAL SITUATION ANALYSIS

After 8 experiments, we are STUCK at the baseline score. All approaches have failed:
1. **Ensemble** (exp_001, exp_002): Only 0.000021 improvement - all public solutions at same local optimum
2. **bbox3 optimization** (exp_003, exp_004): Produces overlapping trees that fail Kaggle validation
3. **zaburo grid** (exp_005, exp_006): Fundamentally worse structure (88.33 vs 70.65)
4. **sa_v1_parallel on zaburo** (exp_007): Still 17.68 points worse than baseline
5. **REPAIR + ensemble** (exp_008): 0 N values improved - zaburo is ALWAYS worse than baseline

## Response to Evaluator

The evaluator is CORRECT:
1. **Zaburo approach is definitively disproven** - Even valid (non-overlapping) zaburo solutions are WORSE than baseline for ALL 200 N values
2. **Need to try jonathanchan fractional translation on BASELINE** - This is the key insight
3. **Need to try egortrushin tessellation for specific N values** - Different structure for large N

The evaluator's recommendation to run the jonathanchan C++ optimizer on the BASELINE (not zaburo) is the correct path forward.

## WHAT WE KNOW WORKS (from kernel analysis)

### jonathanchan kernel (santa25-ensemble-sa-fractional-translation)
- **fractional_translation function**: Uses very fine steps [0.001, 0.0005, 0.0002, 0.0001, 0.00005, 0.00002, 0.00001]
- **Pipeline**: SA → local search → fractional_translation
- **Per-N optimization**: N<=20 gets 1.5x iterations, N<=50 gets 1.3x
- **Key insight**: Run on BASELINE, not on grid-based solutions

### egortrushin kernel (santa25-simulated-annealing-with-translations)
- **Tessellation approach**: For specific N values (72, 100, 110, 144, 156, 196, 200)
- **Tree deletion**: For N=200, optimize 210 trees (7x15 grid) then delete 10 worst
- **Creates fundamentally different configurations** than standard SA

## Recommended Approaches (Priority Order)

### 1. **[HIGHEST PRIORITY] Run jonathanchan C++ optimizer on BASELINE**

The sa_v1_parallel.cpp is already compiled at `/home/code/exploration/datasets/sa_v1_parallel`.

**BUT**: The current version may not have the fractional_translation function. Need to:
1. Check if fractional_translation is in the current sa_v1_parallel.cpp
2. If not, add it from the jonathanchan kernel
3. Run on BASELINE with high iterations: `./sa_v1_parallel -i baseline.csv -n 150000 -r 32`

**Expected outcome**: The fractional_translation can squeeze out micro-improvements that add up across 200 N values.

### 2. **[HIGH PRIORITY] Implement egortrushin tessellation for specific N values**

For N = 72, 100, 110, 144, 156, 196, 200:
- Create tessellation patterns with nt=[nx, ny] trees
- Run SA to optimize translation distances
- For N=200: optimize 210 trees, delete 10 worst

**Expected outcome**: Different initial configurations may find better local optima for these specific N values.

### 3. **[MEDIUM PRIORITY] Find more diverse ensemble sources**

The jonathanchan kernel uses 15+ sources. We've only tried 4-5.
- Check Kaggle for more public submissions
- Download and ensemble with proper validation

## SUBMISSION STRATEGY
- Remaining submissions: 89 (ABUNDANT!)
- **SUBMIT after EVERY experiment** - LB feedback is free information
- Even if score doesn't improve, we learn what DOESN'T work

## What NOT to Try
- ❌ More zaburo-based approaches (definitively disproven)
- ❌ bbox3 without proper overlap validation (produces invalid submissions)
- ❌ Simple ensembles of existing solutions (all at same local optimum)
- ❌ Grid-based initial configurations (fundamentally worse structure)

## Validation Notes
- Use Shapely for overlap detection (matches Kaggle's checker)
- Always validate before submitting
- If optimizer produces overlaps, REPAIR by replacing with baseline

## CRITICAL PATH TO TARGET

The gap is 1.728 points (2.5%). To close this:
1. **fractional_translation** on baseline could give 0.1-0.5 points
2. **tessellation** for specific N values could give 0.1-0.3 points
3. **Better ensemble** from more sources could give 0.1-0.2 points
4. **Per-N optimization** (more iterations for small N) could give 0.1-0.2 points

Combined, these could close the gap. The key is:
- Run the PROVEN jonathanchan approach on the BASELINE
- Don't waste time on approaches that have been disproven
