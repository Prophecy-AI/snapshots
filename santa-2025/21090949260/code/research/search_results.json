One particular category of these packing problems is\ntwo-dimensional packing, which is encountered in everyday scenarios like arranging items\non a shelf and in industrial applications such as cutting cookies from rolled-out dough\nor manufacturing sets of tiles from standard-sized panels made of wood, glass, or metal.\nAnother intriguing example involves cutting fabric pieces for clothing production. In this\ncase, the pieces often cannot be rotated freely, as they must adhere to a desired pattern\nin the final product, which is tailored of multiple elements. The widespread applicability\nof two-dimensional packing problems has led to a surge of interest in designing efficient\nalgorithms to address them. In this paper, we follow the line of research and study the\nproblem of packing convex polygons without rotations in various settings depending on the\ntype of containers used.\nPast research focusing on theoretical considerations of two-dimensional packings mainly\nconcentrates on the scenario when all objects are axis-parallel rectangles. In this paper, we\nwill discuss packing without rotations, in which only translations are permitted. There are\ntwo main classes of the problem depending on whether the size of the container is fixed and\nwe want to minimize the number of containers used or whether we want to minimize the\ncontainer\u2019s size with respect to some objective function.\nA seminal example of the first class is the Geometric Bin Packing problem in which\na number of unit size squared bins to pack is to be minimized. The problem is arguably\nthe most natural generalization of the regular (1D) Bin Packing to two dimensions, and\nits absolute approximability has been fully understood. Unless P = N P, the best possible\nefficient constant factor approximation is 2 [15], and such an algorithm is known [10].\nIn the second class, there are several variants to be considered. An example is the\nStrip Packing Problem which is concerned with packing objects into a strip of width\n1 and infinite height in such a way that the maximum of all the heights of the placed\nobjects is minimized. Like Geometric Bin Packing, Strip Packing generalizes (1D)\nBin Packing. The best known efficient constant factor approximation for Strip Packing\nhas approximation factor (5/3 + \u03f5) [9]. It is known that there can not exist a polynomial\ntime algorithm with an approximation ratio of (3/2 \u2212 \u03f5) for any \u03f5 > 0 unless P = N P, which\nfollows directly from the approximation hardness of (1D) Bin Packing. Both classes of\nproblems have been also considered in the asymptotic setting, see e.g. [11, 5, 12].\nIn younger time, there was also an increase of interest in cases where the objects in\nquestion are general convex polygons. Alt, de Berg and Knauer [2, 3] considered the problem\nof packing an instance consisting of a number of convex polygons of the form p \u2282 [0, 1]2into\na minimum area axis-parallel rectangular container. We refer to this problem as Polygon\nArea Minimization throughout this paper. In the special case where the instance consists\nof rectangles only, the problem is known to admit a PTAS [4]. They proved the existence of\nthe following efficient algorithm:\nA 23.78-approximation for Polygon Area Minimization.\nRecently, Aamand, Abrahamsen, Beretta and Kleist [1] showed that the algorithm of Alt,\nde Berg and Knauer can be leveraged to obtain also efficient approximation algorithms of\nfurther problems:\nA 7-approximation for Polygon Perimeter Minimization.\nA 51-approximation for Polygon Strip Packing.\nAn 11-approximation for Polygon Bin Packing for polygons with diameter at most 1\n10 .\nA. Kurpisz and S. Suter 3\n1.1 Our results\nThe results of Alt, de Berg and Knauer [2, 3] and Aamand et al. [1] are heavily based on\nso-called shelf packing algorithms. In shelf packing algorithms, the objects are first placed\non the shelves, possibly ordered by height, which are later stacked on one another to build\na final solution. Compared to axis-parallel rectangles, the main challenge in designing an\napproximation algorithm for polygon packing problems is that objects cannot be sorted by\nheight and orientation simultaneously. As a result, the algorithm and its analysis in [2, 3]\nhave such a large approximation guarantee. In this paper, we provide new insight into how\nshelf packing algorithms should be applied to polygon packing problems. We introduce a\nsequence of transformations of the objects that allow us first to sort them by height and later\nby orientation to build a solution of a much better approximation guarantee. More precisely,\nwe design polynomial-time algorithms with the following factors:\nA 9.45-approximation for Polygon Area Minimization.\nUsing this algorithm as a subroutine, we build upon the methods from Aamand et al. [1] to\nobtain the following efficient approximation algorithms:\nA (3.75 + \u03f5)-approximation for Polygon Perimeter Minimization.\nA 21.89-approximation for Polygon Strip Packing.\nA 5.09-approximation for Polygon Bin Packing for polygons which have their diameter\nbounded by 1\n10 .\nThe results are proved in Sections 4, 5, 6, and 7 respectively. Furthermore, in Section 8\nwe show the following results, which make progress towards solving an open question of a\nO(1)-approximation algorithm for Polygon Bin Packing for arbitrary polygons.\nThere is an efficient O(\n1\n\u03b4\n)-approximation algorithm for Polygon Bin Packing for\ninstances where each polygon has width or height at most 1 \u2212 \u03b4.\nThere is an efficient O(1)-approximation algorithm for Polygon Bin Packing for\ninstances with the property that all polygons share a spine (up to translation) with height\nat least 3\n4\n.\n2 Preliminaries\nWe start out considerations by recalling a classical and well-known problem in theoretical\ncomputer science, the Bin Packing problem: Given a list of numbers s1, . . . , sn \u2208 (0, 1] \u2229 Q,\nrepresenting the sizes of n objects, the goal is to find the minimum number of bins of size 1,\nso that we can pac...",

It adopts two neighborhoods, swapping two given polygons in a placement and placing one polygon into a new position. The local search algorithm is used to minimize the overlap on the basis of the neighborhoods mentioned above and the unconstrained[nonlinear programming](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/nonlinear-programming)model is adopted to further minimize the overlap during the search process. Moreover, the[tabu](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/tabu)search algorithm is used to avoid[local minima](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/local-minimum), and a compact algorithm is presented to improve the result. The results of standard test instances indicate that when compared with other existing algorithms, the presented algorithm does not only show some signs of competitive power but also updates several best known results.\n## Introduction\nThe irregular strip packing problem, also known as the nesting problem, has a wide area of applications. Given a set of irregular shapes and a rectangular strip with a fixed width and an arbitrary length, the target of the two-dimensional irregular strip packing problem is to place all shapes within the strip such that the length of the strip is minimized and the irregular shapes do not overlap. A classic example application is clothing industry. Several pieces of clothes will be cut from a roll of fabric and the objective is to minimize the waste of fabric. The fabric has a fixed width and its length can be generally assumed infinite; so the problem is to minimize the length required for producing the specified number of irregular shapes.\nThe irregular strip packing problem is a NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem [1]. Numerous papers on nesting problem have been published since the first paper by Art [2]. Meta-heuristics are often used to solve this problem. Hopper and Turton [3] reviewed these methods, and a summary of geometric methods was published by Bennell and Oliveira [4]. As research progressed, further breakthroughs in algorithms for this problem have achieved in recent years. When compared with the previous years, these solutions have markedly improved the effect and speed of nesting results. The typical methods include Burke et al. [5], Gomes and Oliveira [6], Egeblad et al. [7], Imamichi et al. [8], etc.\nAlbano and Sapuppo [9] proposed an algorithm that places each shape at the bottom-left position, and the sequence of places is obtained by tree search. Jakobs [10] proposed a two-stage solution which first generates the rectangular enclosure of each irregular shape, and then finds the placement for these enclosures through a genetic algorithm. Secondly, a shrinking algorithm moves the shapes to another one as close as possible using the idea of the bottom-left heuristic. Gomes and Oliveira [11] based on bottom-left heuristic and find a good placement by exchanging two shapes in the layout. Dowsland et al. [12] developed a compact algorithm to improve the bottom-left heuristic algorithm. The algorithm first gets the initial placement by the bottom-left heuristic, and then uses a shaking process to compact the placement. Burke et al. [5] presented a new bottom-left heuristic algorithm based on discretization, and combination with hill climbing or tabu search to get a high quality solution. This algorithm can also pack the shapes with circular arcs and holes. Egeblad et al. [7] proposed an efficient fast local search method whose neighborhood is any horizontal or vertical translation of a given shape. They also formulated a polynomial time algorithm to find a translation with minimum overlap area between the given polygon and the other polygons in the current placement. Gomes and Oliveira [6] presented a separation algorithm to locally optimize the placement based on linear programming models, and used simulated annealing to guide the search. A new separation algorithm based on unconstrained nonlinear programming is proposed by Imamichi et al. [8]. They also designed an algorithm that swaps two polygons in a placement, and then the algorithms are combined as a component into an iterated local search algorithm for the overlap minimization problem. This method yielded several best known results on the standard test instances. Our algorithm is based on a separation algorithm presented by Imamichi et al. [8], and local search is adopted to guide the search. Moreover, a tabu search algorithm is used to avoid local minima and a compacted algorithm is used to improve the packing results.\n## Section snippets\n## Formulation\nIn this section, some fundamental elements of geometry are first defined, before formulation of the irregular strip packing problem algorithm is given.\n**Definition 1 (point)**\nA point*p*in two-dimensional space is represented by a pair:p=(px,py)\u2208R2.\n**Definition 2 (line segment)**\nA line segment*s*is a point set defined by two endpoints*p**a*and*p**b*:s={p\u2208R2,t\u2208[0,1]|p=pa+t(pb\u2212pa)}.\n**Definition 3 (polygon)**\nA polygon is a plane figure bounded by a closed path composes of a finite sequence of line segments denoted by*S*.

Previously, the no-fit polygon (NFP) has not been widely applied because of the perception that it is difficult to implement and because of the lack of generic approaches that can cope with all problem cases without specific case-by-case handling. This paper introduces a robust orbital method for the creation of no-fit polygons which does not suffer from the typical problem cases found in the other approaches from the literature. Furthermore, the algorithm only involves two simple geometric stages so it is easily understood and implemented. We demonstrate how the approach handles known degenerate cases such as holes, interlocking concavities and jigsaw type pieces and we give generation times for 32 irregular packing benchmark problems from the literature, including real world datasets, to allow further comparison with existing and future approaches.\n## Introduction\nThe irregular two-dimensional variant of the cutting and packing problem impacts upon several important manufacturing industries such as textiles, plastics, metal cutting and others. These problems usually consist of a number of irregular pieces that are to be placed onto one or more sheets of material in the most efficient layout possible, so that all pieces are assigned and do not overlap. Additionally, there are usually rotational constraints enforced on the pieces due to the physical properties of the problem such as grain on the material, patterns on textiles and the cutting technology being employed. Sometimes rotational constraints may be used for non-physical reasons such as to restrict pieces to a finite set of rotations thus simplifying layout construction procedures and allowing for faster solutions to be obtained. The two-dimensional stock cutting problem has been shown to be NP hard and is therefore intrinsically difficult to solve (Garey and Johnson, 1979). There have been many different strategies for producing solutions to the irregular stock cutting problem. These include linear programming approaches, heuristic placement methods, metaheuristic guided search techniques and other novel approaches such as the iterative jostling of pieces (Dowsland et al., 1998). Survey papers can be found in (Dowsland and Dowsland, 1992, Sweeney and Paternoster, 1992, Dyckhoff, 1990). However, the feature that connects all of the approaches is that they are all required to cope with the geometry of the problem. This can be especially complicated when highly irregular shapes are used which may include holes or concavities. The implementation of robust and efficient geometry routines can be laborious and can often take considerably longer than the packing strategies themselves. In particular, the geometry must handle all of the interactions between shapes such as detecting whether two shapes are overlapping and calculating the translation distance required in a given direction so that the overlap is resolved. As we show in the following section, although these tests can be implemented using trigonometric techniques, the no-fit polygon represents a considerably more efficient solution.\nWhilst the generation of the no-fit polygon is academically challenging, it is a \u2018tool\u2019 and not a \u2018solution\u2019 and this is perhaps one of the reasons why there are many publications in the literature which state that the no-fit polygon is used but which provide relatively little or no details on its implementation. In this paper we concentrate specifically on the no-fit polygon and provide an overview of the previous techniques that have been used for its creation. Furthermore, we describe and provide full implementation details for a new robust orbital approach that can cope with the traditional problem cases that many other approaches cannot handle. Hopefully this will help in the further dissemination of the benefits of using the no-fit polygon (as opposed to traditional trigonometry based approaches) within both the industrial and the academic communities.\n## Section snippets\n## The no-fit polygon \u2013an overview\nIn this section we describe the functionality of the no-fit polygon and we compare it to the more traditional trigonometric based overlap and intersection tests. We also give brief overviews of the many techniques that have been used to generate no-fit polygons within the previous literature.\n## The new no-fit polygon construction algorithm\nWe now describe our new approach for robust no-fit polygon generation through the use of orbital methods utilising standard trigonometrical techniques. For the intersection calculations within our presented implementation, it is important to use a robust geometry library. It is also beneficial to implement routines that are as fast and as close to optimal as possible in order to promote fast no-fit polygon generation and packing algorithms. We have implemented such a library. Although this can\n## Problem cases\nIn this section we discuss each of the problem cases that cause difficulties with other methods and show why our approach is able to handle them without specific case-by-case implementations. In each figure of this section we identify the stationary and orbiting polygons in dark and light grey shading respectively and we show the reference point of the orbiting polygon by a black dot. This is used to trace the loops of the no-fit polygon (which we number). We present the data for these problem\n## Generation times on the benchmark problems\nIn order to demonstrate the speed and capabilities of our new no-fit polygon procedure, we report the generation times for 32 benchmark pr...",

      "text": "[University of Southampton Institutional Repository](https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/)\n\n# Efficient local search heuristics for packing irregular shapes in two-dimensional heterogeneous bins\n\nEfficient local search heuristics for packing irregular shapes in two-dimensional heterogeneous bins\n\nEfficient local search heuristics for packing irregular shapes in two-dimensional heterogeneous bins\n\nIn this paper we proposed a local search heuristic and a genetic algorithm to solve the two-dimensional irregular multiple bin-size bin packing problem. The problem consists of placing a set of pieces represented as 2D polygons in rectangular bins with different dimensions such that the total area of bins used is minimized. Most packing algorithms available in the literature for 2D irregular bin packing considersingle size bins only. However, for many industries the material can be supplied in a number of standard size sheets, for example, metal, foam, plastic and timber sheets. For this problem, the cut plans must decide the set of standard size stock sheets as well as which pieces to cut from each bin and how to arrange them in order to minimise waste material. Moreover, the literature constrains the orientation of pieces to a single or finite set of angles. This is often an artificial constraint that makes the solution space easier to navigate.

The problem consists of placing a set of pieces represented as 2D polygons in rectangular bins with different dimensions such that the total area of bins used is minimized. Most packing algorithms available in the literature for 2D irregular bin packing considersingle size bins only. However, for many industries the material can be supplied in a number of standard size sheets, for example, metal, foam, plastic and timber sheets. For this problem, the cut plans must decide the set of standard size stock sheets as well as which pieces to cut from each bin and how to arrange them in order to minimise waste material. Moreover, the literature constrains the orientation of pieces to a single or finite set of angles. This is often an artificial constraint that makes the solution space easier to navigate. In this paper we do not restrict the orientation of the pieces. We show that the local search heuristic and the genetic algorithm can address all of these decisions and obtain goodsolutions, with the local search performing better. We also discuss the effect of different groups of stock sheet sizes.\n\nText\n\n**ICCL17\\_paper\\_43**\n**\\- Accepted Manuscript**\n\n[Download](https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/415314/1/ICCL17_paper_43.pdf) (729kB)\n\n## More information\n\ne-pub ahead of print date: October 2017\n\nPublished date: October 2017\n\nKeywords:\nIrregular shapes, Multiple bin size bin packing, Jostle Algorithm\n\n## Identifiers\n\nLocal EPrints ID: 415314\n\nURI: http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/id/eprint/415314\n\nDOI: [doi:10.1007/978-3-319-68496](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-68496)\n\nPURE UUID: e654d0b7-af4b-43c1-86e1-635828997331\n\nORCID for Antonio Martinez Sykora: [orcid.org/0000-0002-2435-3113](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2435-3113)\n\n## Catalogue record\n\nDate deposited: 07 Nov 2017 17:30\n\nLast modified: 16 Mar 2024 05:53\n\n## Export record\n\nASCII CitationAtomBibTeXData Cite XMLDublin CoreDublin CoreEP3 XMLEndNoteHTML CitationHTML CitationHTML ListJSONMETSMODSMPEG-21 DIDLOpenURL ContextObjectOpenURL ContextObject in SpanRDF+N-TriplesRDF+N3RDF+XMLRIOXX2 XMLReferReference ManagerSimple Metadata\n\n## Altmetrics\n\n## Share this record\n\n[Share this on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/415314/) [Share this on Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Efficient%20local%20search%20heuristics%20for%20packing%20irregular%20shapes%20in%20two%2Ddimensional%20heterogeneous%20bins+https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/415314/) [Share this on Weibo](http://service.weibo.com/share/share.php?url=Efficient%20local%20search%20heuristics%20for%20packing%20irregular%20shapes%20in%20two%2Ddimensional%20heterogeneous%20bins+https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/415314/)\n\n## Contributors\n\nAuthor:Ranga, Prasad Abeysooriya\n\nAuthor:Julia Bennell\n\nAuthor: [Antonio Martinez Sykora](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/business-school/about/staff/am1u10.page)\n\nEditor:Tolga Bektas\n\nEditor:Stefano Coniglio\n\nEditor:Antonio Martinez-Sykora\n\nEditor:Stefan Boss\n\n## Download statistics\n\nDownloads from ePrints over the past year.

Research on 2D irregular packing problems is essential for improving material utilization and industrial automation. Much research has been conducted on this problem with significant research results and certain algorithms. The work has made important contributions to solving practical problems. This paper reviews recent advances in the domain of 2D irregular packing problems based on a variety of research papers. We first introduce the basic concept and research background of 2D irregular packing problems and then summarize algorithms and strategies that have been proposed for the problems in recent years.

We hope that this review could provide guidance for researchers in the field of 2D irregular packing.\n## 1 Introduction\nTwo-dimensional (2D) irregular packing problems are widespread in industries such as machinery manufacturing, aviation, shipbuilding, automobile manufacturing, clothing and furniture manufacturing. An efficient 2D irregular packing algorithm can effectively improve material utilization and reduce processing costs. The reduction in material consumption will also have a beneficial impact on the environment ([Ke et al., 2020](#B76)). Therefore, research of the packing problem is of great significance for technology and social interest.\nThe 2D packing problem is a type of combinatorial optimization problems to locate parts with different shapes compactly in one or more master sheet material to minimize the occupied space or maximize the utilization of the material. The 2D packing problem is currently recognized as a NP problem, which is mainly solved by heuristic algorithms. In recent years, many scholars have conducted research on 2D irregular packing problems with a verity of solutions.\nThere exists a number of review articles on packing and cutting problems. We have summarized the main review literature in the field of 2D packing and cutting as shown in[Table 1](#T1). Brown ([Brown, 1971](#B17)) introduced an optimum packing and depletion problem with optimization of space and resource usage. Harvey ([Salkin and De Kluyver, 1975](#B116)) surveyed the application of mathematical optimization models such as linear programming to the knapsack problem. Bruce ([Golden, 1976](#B50)) surveyed various approaches to the cutting stock problem. Hinxman ([Hinxman, 1980](#B65)) surveyed the trim-loss and assortment problems, this research paid more attention to cutting and packaging problems in practical applications, and did not mention much about theoretical methods. Garey and Coffman ([Garey and Johnson, 1981](#B47);[Coffman et al., 1984](#B27)) surveyed the approximation algorithms for bin packing problems. Israni ([Israni and Sanders, 1982](#B72)) reviewed the 2D cutting stock problem including almost all 2D packaging problems. The author also proposed a rectangular layout method. Sarin ([Sarin, 1983](#B118)) reviewed methodologies and literature to solve 2D stock cutting problems and introduced an interactive optimization procedure for a general 2D stock cutting problem. Dyckhoff ([Dyckhoff et al., 1985](#B38)) described a trim loss and related problems and categorized them briefly. Dudzi&#x00144;ski ([Dudzi&#x00144;ski and Walukiewicz, 1987](#B36)) summarized the exact methods for knapsack problems, such as linear programming. Matthias ([Rode and Rosenberg, 1987](#B114)) analyzed the algorithm for the trim-loss problems. Haessler ([Haessler and Sweeney, 1991](#B59)) reviewed the solution process of cutting stock problems, including placement algorithm and sequence optimization algorithm. Dowsland ([Dowsland and Dowsland, 1992](#B34)) reviewed the application of operations research methods to the packing problem and summarized some exact heuristics. Sweeney ([Sweeney and Paternoster, 1992](#B128)) categorized cutting and packing problems and made application-oriented research records. Cheng ([Cheng et al., 1994](#B22)) discussed 2D cutting stock problems and their application cases including the pallet loading problem and VLSI placement problem. With the gradual deepening of research on 2D layout problems, typology becomes a common research topic. 2D regular and irregular layout problems are clearly distinguished in practical applications and theoretical methods. Dowsland ([Dowsland and Dowsland, 1995](#B29)) gave a special review of the 2D irregular nesting problem for the first time. Mavridou ([Mavridou and Pardalos, 1997](#B98)) summarized applications of the genetic algorithm and simulated annealing algorithm in the optimization of facility layout problems. Dyckhoff ([Dyckhoff, 1990](#B37)) made a typology of the cutting and packing problems in detail, and W&#x000e4;scher ([W&#x000e4;scher et al., 2007](#B135)) improved the typology later. Hopper ([Hopper and Turton, 1999](#B67);[Hopper and Turton, 2001a](#B68);[Hopper and Turton, 2001b](#B69)) investigated the application of meta-heuristic and heuristic algorithms in 2D and 3D packing problems. Lodi ([Lodi et al., 2002a](#B90);[Lodi et al., 2002b](#B91)) reviewed algorithms proposed in the 1990s of 2D packing problems. Bennell et al. ([Bennell and Oliveira, 2008](#B10);[Bennell and Oliveira, 2009](#B9)) discussed 2D irregular packing problems and related geometric problems. Leao ([Leao et al., 2020](#B81)) introduced the mathematical models in the 2D irregular packing problem.\nTABLE 1\n[![www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/966691/fmech-08-966691-HTML/image_m/fmech-08-966691-t001.jpg)](https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/966691/fmech-08-966691-HTML/image_m/fmech-08-966691-t001.jpg)\n**TABLE 1**. Review literature in the field of cutting and packing problems.\nThe scope of these reviews is broad, mainly for all 2D packing problems including rectangular packing and other regular packing problems. These review papers are out of date with missed innovative algorithms of 2D irregular packing. Since 2010, only Leao ([Leao et al., 2020](#B81)) reviewed 2D irregular packing problems. But he only introduced the mathematical models, instead of reviewing 2D irregular packing problems comprehensively. In recent years, there is not ...",

In the two-dimensional case, not only is it the case that the piece\u2019s size is important but its shape also has a significant influence. Therefore, DJD as a selection heuristic has to be paired with a placement heuristic to completely construct a solution to the underlying packing problem. A successful adaptation of the DJD requires a routine to reduce computational costs, which is also proposed and successfully tested in this paper. Results, on a wide variety of instance types with convex polygons, are found to be significantly better than those produced by more conventional selection heuristics.\n\nThis is a preview of

It explores the procedure of applying the bottom-left strategy to a given order the bottom-left algorithm. The chapter explains the irregular strip packing problem and introduces some practical algorithms for irregular packing problems. It focuses on the problem of packing irregular shapes represented in bitmap format and analyses the rectilinear block packing problem and also introduces various schemes used to represent solutions to the rectilinear block packing problem and algorithms based on such coding schemes. The chapter considers two-dimensional irregular packing problems, which have been actively studied in the last decade. It provides some basic techniques including bottom-left strategy, clustering strategy, and no-fit polygons. The chapter shows that various algorithms proposed for the irregular strip packing and bin packing problems and their variants. T. Imamichi et al. proposed an iterated local search based on nonlinear programming for the irregular strip packing problem.\n\n[Taylor & Francis Group Logo![Taylor & Francis Group Logo](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/assets/images/tfgroup-logo-white.svg)](https://www.taylorfrancis.com)\n\n- PoliciesPolicies\n\n- [Privacy Policy](https://informa.com/privacy-policy/)\n- [Terms & Conditions](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/terms-and-conditions/)\n- [Cookie Policy](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/cookie-policy/)\n\n- JournalsJournals\n\n- [Taylor & Francis Online](https://www.tandfonline.com)\n\n- CorporateCorporate\n\n- [Taylor & Francis Group](https://taylorandfrancis.com/)\n\n- Help & ContactHelp & Contact\n\n- [Students/Researchers](https://help.taylorfrancis.com/students_researchers)\n- [Librarians/Institutions](https://help.taylorfrancis.com/librarians_institutions)\n\n- Connect with us\n\n\nRegistered in England & Wales No. 3099067\n\n5 Howick Place \\| London \\| SW1P 1WG\u00a9 2024 Informa UK Limited\n\nBack to Top",
