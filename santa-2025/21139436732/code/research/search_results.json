      "text": "Minimizing the area of the bounding box that contains a set of irregular polygons is usually tackled by a combination of exact geometric preprocessing and powerful optimisation engines.  A common first step is to compute the **no\u2011fit polygon (NFP)** for each pair of pieces, which captures all relative positions that avoid overlap; the NFP can be obtained robustly with Minkowski\u2011sum techniques and careful handling of internal edges, holes and lock\u2011key configurations\u202f([Computers\u202f&\u202fOperations\u202fResearch](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0305054806000669),\u202f[PDF\u202f2005](https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/36850/1/CORMSIS-05-05.pdf)).  Once the NFPs are known, the nesting problem can be expressed as a **mixed\u2011integer linear program (MILP)** that enforces non\u2011overlap through linearised NFP constraints and often uses vertical\u2011slice or polygonal\u2011enclosure formulations to tighten the bounding\u2011box dimensions\u202f([Springer\u202f2022](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10479-015-1971-9)).  For truly exact solutions, researchers have introduced a **relax\u2011and\u2011bound** approach that inscribes a few circles in each irregular shape; the non\u2011overlap constraints are replaced by circle\u2011non\u2011overlap constraints, yielding quadratic\u2011programming sub\u2011problems that provide provable lower bounds, while local search supplies feasible upper bounds\u202f([Springer\u202f2013](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10898-013-0129-z)).  Branch\u2011and\u2011bound frameworks that explore the combinatorial placement space and prune by these bounds are also widely used for small\u2011to\u2011medium instances\u202f([ScienceDirect\u202f2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0925527313001692)).\n\nWhen exact methods become computationally prohibitive, **heuristic and meta\u2011heuristic** strategies dominate practice.  Constructive shelf\u2011or\u2011strip packing procedures that sort polygons by height or area and then place them greedily (often with guillotine\u2011cut restrictions) give fast, high\u2011quality solutions and can be embedded in mixed\u2011integer models for further refinement\u202f([Omega\u202f2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0305048314001285)).  Genetic algorithms, tabu\u2011search, and other local\u2011search schemes have been applied to the irregular nesting problem, typically using the NFP to test feasibility and to guide moves\u202f([International\u202fJournal\u202fof\u202fProduction\u202fEconomics\u202f2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0925527313001692)).  A more recent discrete\u2011placement technique builds a **raster\u2011penetration map** on a rectangular grid; a full\u2011search over the pre\u2011processed map quickly identifies viable positions and often improves packing density compared with state\u2011of\u2011the\u2011art methods\u202f([Academia\u202f2023](https://www.academia.edu/104990577/Raster_penetration_map_applied_to_the_irregular_packing_problem)).  \n\nFinally, for special cases where rotations are prohibited, **approximation algorithms** with provable guarantees have been developed for convex polygons and can be extended to irregular shapes by decomposing them into convex components.

In practice, the most effective workflow combines an accurate NFP/Minkowski\u2011sum preprocessing step, a tight MILP or quadratic\u2011programming formulation for bounding\u2011box minimisation, and a heuristic (genetic, tabu, or raster\u2011based) to explore large solution spaces when exact optimisation is infeasible.",

One particular category of these packing problems is\ntwo-dimensional packing, which is encountered in everyday scenarios like arranging items\non a shelf and in industrial applications such as cutting cookies from rolled-out dough\nor manufacturing sets of tiles from standard-sized panels made of wood, glass, or metal.\nAnother intriguing example involves cutting fabric pieces for clothing production. In this\ncase, the pieces often cannot be rotated freely, as they must adhere to a desired pattern\nin the final product, which is tailored of multiple elements. The widespread applicability\nof two-dimensional packing problems has led to a surge of interest in designing efficient\nalgorithms to address them. In this paper, we follow the line of research and study the\nproblem of packing convex polygons without rotations in various settings depending on the\ntype of containers used.\nPast research focusing on theoretical considerations of two-dimensional packings mainly\nconcentrates on the scenario when all objects are axis-parallel rectangles. In this paper, we\nwill discuss packing without rotations, in which only translations are permitted. There are\ntwo main classes of the problem depending on whether the size of the container is fixed and\nwe want to minimize the number of containers used or whether we want to minimize the\ncontainer\u2019s size with respect to some objective function.\nA seminal example of the first class is the Geometric Bin Packing problem in which\na number of unit size squared bins to pack is to be minimized. The problem is arguably\nthe most natural generalization of the regular (1D) Bin Packing to two dimensions, and\nits absolute approximability has been fully understood. Unless P = N P, the best possible\nefficient constant factor approximation is 2 [15], and such an algorithm is known [10].\nIn the second class, there are several variants to be considered. An example is the\nStrip Packing Problem which is concerned with packing objects into a strip of width\n1 and infinite height in such a way that the maximum of all the heights of the placed\nobjects is minimized. Like Geometric Bin Packing, Strip Packing generalizes (1D)\nBin Packing. The best known efficient constant factor approximation for Strip Packing\nhas approximation factor (5/3 + \u03f5) [9]. It is known that there can not exist a polynomial\ntime algorithm with an approximation ratio of (3/2 \u2212 \u03f5) for any \u03f5 > 0 unless P = N P, which\nfollows directly from the approximation hardness of (1D) Bin Packing. Both classes of\nproblems have been also considered in the asymptotic setting, see e.g. [11, 5, 12].\nIn younger time, there was also an increase of interest in cases where the objects in\nquestion are general convex polygons. Alt, de Berg and Knauer [2, 3] considered the problem\nof packing an instance consisting of a number of convex polygons of the form p \u2282 [0, 1]2into\na minimum area axis-parallel rectangular container. We refer to this problem as Polygon\nArea Minimization throughout this paper. In the special case where the instance consists\nof rectangles only, the problem is known to admit a PTAS [4]. They proved the existence of\nthe following efficient algorithm:\nA 23.78-approximation for Polygon Area Minimization.\nRecently, Aamand, Abrahamsen, Beretta and Kleist [1] showed that the algorithm of Alt,\nde Berg and Knauer can be leveraged to obtain also efficient approximation algorithms of\nfurther problems:\nA 7-approximation for Polygon Perimeter Minimization.\nA 51-approximation for Polygon Strip Packing.\nAn 11-approximation for Polygon Bin Packing for polygons with diameter at most 1\n10 .\nA. Kurpisz and S. Suter 3\n1.1 Our results\nThe results of Alt, de Berg and Knauer [2, 3] and Aamand et al. [1] are heavily based on\nso-called shelf packing algorithms. In shelf packing algorithms, the objects are first placed\non the shelves, possibly ordered by height, which are later stacked on one another to build\na final solution. Compared to axis-parallel rectangles, the main challenge in designing an\napproximation algorithm for polygon packing problems is that objects cannot be sorted by\nheight and orientation simultaneously. As a result, the algorithm and its analysis in [2, 3]\nhave such a large approximation guarantee. In this paper, we provide new insight into how\nshelf packing algorithms should be applied to polygon packing problems. We introduce a\nsequence of transformations of the objects that allow us first to sort them by height and later\nby orientation to build a solution of a much better approximation guarantee. More precisely,\nwe design polynomial-time algorithms with the following factors:\nA 9.45-approximation for Polygon Area Minimization.\nUsing this algorithm as a subroutine, we build upon the methods from Aamand et al. [1] to\nobtain the following efficient approximation algorithms:\nA (3.75 + \u03f5)-approximation for Polygon Perimeter Minimization.\nA 21.89-approximation for Polygon Strip Packing.\nA 5.09-approximation for Polygon Bin Packing for polygons which have their diameter\nbounded by 1\n10 .\nThe results are proved in Sections 4, 5, 6, and 7 respectively. Furthermore, in Section 8\nwe show the following results, which make progress towards solving an open question of a\nO(1)-approximation algorithm for Polygon Bin Packing for arbitrary polygons.\nThere is an efficient O(\n1\n\u03b4\n)-approximation algorithm for Polygon Bin Packing for\ninstances where each polygon has width or height at most 1 \u2212 \u03b4.\nThere is an efficient O(1)-approximation algorithm for Polygon Bin Packing for\ninstances with the property that all polygons share a spine (up to translation) with height\nat least 3\n4\n.\n2 Preliminaries\nWe start out considerations by recalling a classical and well-known problem in theoretical\ncomputer science, the Bin Packing problem: Given a list of numbers s1, . . . , sn \u2208 (0, 1] \u2229 Q,\nrepresenting the sizes of n objects, the goal is to find the minimum number of bins of size 1,\nso that we can pac...",

At its core is an innovative mixed integer programme model that places irregular pieces and defines guillotine cuts. The two-dimensional irregular shape bin [packing problem](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/packing-problem) with guillotine constraints arises in the glass cutting industry, for example, the cutting of glass for conservatories. Almost all cutting and packing problems that include guillotine cuts deal with rectangles only, where all cuts are orthogonal to the edges of the stock sheet and a maximum of two [angles of rotation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/angles-of-rotation) are permitted. The literature tackling packing problems with irregular shapes largely focuses on strip packing i.e. minimizing the length of a single fixed width stock sheet, and does not consider guillotine cuts. Hence, this problem combines the challenges of tackling the complexity of packing irregular pieces with free rotation, guaranteeing guillotine cuts that are not always orthogonal to the edges of the stock sheet, and allocating pieces to bins. To our knowledge only one other recent paper tackles this problem. We present a hybrid algorithm that is a constructive heuristic that determines the relative position of pieces in the bin and guillotine constraints via a mixed integer programme model. We investigate two approaches for allocating guillotine cuts at the same time as determining the placement of the piece, and a two phase approach that delays the allocation of cuts to provide flexibility in space usage. Finally we describe an improvement procedure that is applied to each bin before it is closed. This approach improves on the results of the only other publication on this problem, and gives competitive results for the classic rectangle bin packing problem with guillotine constraints.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe paper focuses on the two-dimensional bin packing problem (BBP) with irregular convex pieces and guillotine cuts. Guillotine cuts arise due to the cutting process of certain materials, where cuts are restricted to extend from one edge of the stock-sheet to another. This is commonly found in the glass cutting industry and research has almost exclusively focused on the cutting of rectangles where the cuts are orthogonal to the edges of the stock sheet. The problem tackled here is a generalized version of the rectangle single size stock sheet bin packing problem with guillotine constraints, where the pieces to be cut are irregular convex polygons and the guillotine cuts are not constrained to be orthogonal to the edges of the bin. We present a number of constructive heuristics that exploit a mixed integer programming (MIP) model for placing the pieces in the bin while satisfying all the geometric constraints and the guillotine cuts and provide comprehensive results for benchmark instances for this problem and the rectangular bin packing problem with guillotine cuts. The results are compared with the best in the literature and new lower bound is presented.\n\nThe motivation for tackling this problems arises in the cutting of glass sheets, for example, the glass panes for conservatories. Glass is cut by scoring and snapping the material. Each cut divides the sheet in two and is called a guillotine cut. As a result, only convex pieces can be cut directly. Since the properties of the material are homogeneous, pieces can be cut at any angle of rotation, and in some cases reflected. Typically, cutting plans involve multiple stock sheets. An example solution to this problem is given in Fig. 1. Note that the pieces must be removed by the guillotine cuts (in bold) in a specific order so that each cut begins and ends at the edge of the complete or divided stock sheet.\n\nThe requirement for guillotine cuts arise in many industries such as glass, wood boards or fibre glass for printed circuit boards. Each industrial setting implies a particular class of cutting and packing problem. For example, Malaguti et al. \\[15\\] consider a cutting stock problem with multiple stocksheets found in the wood industry, while Cui \\[8\\] tackles the cutting of metal of coils where a stock sheet is considered to have unrestricted length.\n\nThe literature tackling packing problems with irregular shapes largely focuses on strip packing i.e. minimizing the length of a single fixed width stock sheet, see \\[3\\], and does not consider guillotine cuts. Further, almost all cutting and packing problems that include guillotine cuts deal with rectangles only, where all cuts are orthogonal to the edges of the stock sheet and a maximum of two angles of rotation of the pieces are permitted. Hence, this problem combines the challenges of tackling the complexity of packing irregular pieces with free rotation, guaranteeing guillotine cuts that may or may not be orthogonal to the edges of the stock sheet, and allocating pieces to bins or stock sheets. To our knowledge, Han et al. \\[13\\] is the only other paper that tackles this problem. They propose two different construction heuristics. The first heuristic, they call a one-stage algorithm, constructs multiple parallel clusters of pieces by iteratively joining two blocks, where a block is either a piece or the convex hull of a cluster of pieces. Blocks are combined by matching pairs of edges and selecting the best match according to a dynamic solution evaluation function. Since each accepted match, starting with two individual pieces, is transformed into its convex block by taking the convex hull, the guillotine cut structure is always satisfied. The approach uses threshold parameters to control the number of blocks generated and as a result the computational time. The second constructive heuristic, a two-stage algorithm, combines pairs of p...",

Although the concept was first described in 1966, it was not until the early 90s that the general trend of research moved away from direct trigonometry to favour the nofit polygon. Since then, the ability to calculate the nofit polygon has practically become a pre-requisite for researching irregular packing problems. However, realization of this concept in the form of a robust algorithm is a highly challenging task with few instructive approaches published. In this paper, a procedure using the [mathematical concept](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/mathematical-concept) of Minkowski sums for the calculation of the nofit polygon is presented. The described procedure is more robust than other approaches using Minkowski sum knowledge and includes details of the removal of internal edges to find holes, slits and lock and key positions. The procedure is tested on benchmark data sets and gives examples of complicated cases.\n\n### Scope and purpose\n\nCutting and packing problems involving irregular shapes feature in a wide variety of manufacturing processes. Automated solution techniques that can generate packing arrangements more efficiently than current technology that employs user intervention, must be able to handle the complex geometry that arises from these problems. The nofit polygon has been demonstrated to be an effective tool in providing efficient handling of the geometric characteristics of these problems. The paper presents a new algorithmic procedure for deriving this tool.\n\n## Introduction\n\nCutting and packing problems involving irregular shapes are common in a variety of manufacturing processes. They occur whenever a piece of irregular shape is to be cut from a sheet of stock material. Examples include dye-cutting in the engineering sector, parts nesting for shipbuilding, marker layout in the garment industry, and leather cutting for shoes, furniture and other goods. The paper specifically addresses the geometric calculations required for tackling these problems. Here we consider that shapes are irregular if they are; polygonal, i.e no arcs; simple, i.e. non-self-intersecting; and non-rectangular. Even when all the components are rectangular the problem of finding layouts that minimize waste is known to be NP-hard. Where irregular components are involved an extra dimension of complexity is generated by the geometry.\n\nThe precise requirements of a good layout will differ from industry to industry and this has led to a variety of algorithmic approaches. In spite of their differences, all the methods have a common requirement in which they need to be able to identify whether a layout is feasible or not, i.e. do any of the pieces overlap. Early research handled this problem in a number of ways. Adamowicz and Albano \\[1\\] chose to nest pieces into simpler shapes where the geometry can be more easily calculated. If the shapes are used directly then the intersection of pieces can be handled by direct trigonometric approaches such as the D function \\[2\\], \\[3\\]. Alternatively the stock sheet and the pieces can be approximated as grid squares, often referred to as the raster method. Hence, if a piece occupies, fully or partially, a grid square it is coded as occupied \\[4\\], \\[5\\].\n\nAlthough all these approaches have merit, it is widely recognized that the nofit polygon (NFP) is more efficient, provided you have a robust and efficient NFP generator, and has become the principle approach for handling the geometry in nesting problems. Unfortunately, some researchers believe that despite the value of this tool, its introduction may have stifled research into this variant of packing problems. W\u00e4scher et al. \\[6\\] report that there have been only 21 publications in irregular problems in the last 10 years. Researchers attribute this to the fact that the realization of the NFP as a robust algorithm is, in itself, a highly challenging task. Those considering embarking on research into irregular shaped packing may be discouraged by the significant investment of time required in first developing an NFP generator. Hence, it is essential that robust and easily realizable algorithms are available in order to facilitate new interest into this important problem.\n\nThe primary purpose of this paper is to introduce a new procedure for calculating the NFP. The method is developed from the theory of Minkowski sums \\[7\\] and builds on the principles proposed by Ghosh \\[8\\], \\[9\\] and by Bennell et al. \\[10\\]. Further, the paper includes an algorithmic procedure for eliciting the true boundary of the NFP, including holes, slits and exact fits. It should be noted that the polygons considered in this paper are two-dimensional and restricted to translational motion i.e. rotations are not considered. The next section outlines the most commonly cited approaches for calculating the NFP and points out their positive features and disadvantages. Section 3 reviews in more detail the Minkowski sum approach. This is followed by a description of our new procedure based on Minkowski sums. Section 5, develops our approach for removing redundant internal points and therefore identifying the true boundary. In both cases the full algorithmic steps are provided. Finally, we develop some theoretical and empirical analysis of the approach to demonstrate its robustness with respect to being capable of handling all combinations of simple polygons.\n\n## Section snippets\n\n## Documented approaches for generating the nofit polygon\n\nThe NFP is a combination of the properties of two component polygons that, as a result, represents all the relative positions of the two polygons in which they either touch or overlap. It is well documented that the NFP can reduce the complexity of detecting overlap between two pieces from O(nm+n+m), where n and m are the number of edges in each polygon, obtained from direct trigonometry, to a simple point inclusion test of O(k), where k is the number of edges in the NFP.

In this paper we make a systematic study of the problem and develop an exact Branch &amp; Bound Algorithm. The initial existing mixed integer formulations are reviewed, tested and used as a starting point to develop a new and more efficient formulation. We also study several branching strategies, lower bounds and procedures for fixing variables, reducing the size of the problem to be solved at each node. An extensive computational study allows us first to determine the best strategies to be used in the Branch &amp; Bound Algorithm and then to explore its performance and limits. The results show that the algorithm is able to solve instances of up to 16 pieces to[optimality](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/optimality).\n## Introduction\nNesting problems are two-dimensional cutting and packing problems involving irregular shapes. These problems arise in a wide variety of industries like garment manufacturing, sheet metal cutting, furniture making and shoe manufacturing. The wide range of applications implies many different variants of the problem. The placement areas into which the pieces have to be packed or cut can be rectangular, as in the case of materials provided in rolls, or can have irregular shapes, as in the case of leather hides for making shoes. This placement area can have a uniform quality or different qualities depending on the region, including sometimes defective parts that cannot be used for pieces. The pieces to be cut can be described as polygons, convex or not, or can include curved edges. Depending on the real application, the pieces can be rotated freely, at specific angles only (90\u00b0, 180\u00b0, \u2026), or not rotated at all. There may also be different objectives, usually involving the minimization of the area required for cutting the pieces or the maximization of the value of the pieces cut. Using the typology proposed by W\u00e4scher et al. (2007), nesting problems, in general, are open-dimension problems with irregular pieces.\nIn this paper we consider a nesting problem in which we have to arrange a set of two-dimensional irregular shapes without overlapping in a rectangular stock sheet of a fixed width, where the objective is to minimize the required length. We will consider the pieces to be described as polygons, not necessarily convex, which cannot be rotated.\nThe main difficulty of nesting problems is to ensure that the pieces have a non-overlapping configuration. This question has been studied extensively in recent years and there are several approaches which determine when two polygons overlap. Bennell and Oliveira (2008) give a tutorial on the different approaches which study the geometry of nesting problems. The problem is NP-complete and as a result solution methodologies predominantly utilize heuristics.\n*Pixel/Raster*methods transform the continuous stock sheet into a discrete grid represented by a matrix, and the position of each piece adds a given coded value to each matrix element. Identifying possible overlapping comes down to checking the matrix values. There are three known codification schemes the first one proposed by Segenreich and Braga (1986), the second one by Oliveira and Ferreira (1993), and the last one by Babu and Babu (2001).\nWhen pieces are represented (or approximated) using polygons, there are tests for edge intersection and for point inclusion that can be used for identifying overlapping (Konopasek, 1981, Ferreira et al., 1998). The most widely used tool for checking whether two polygons overlap is the No-Fit Polygon (NFP). It can be used, along with the vector difference of the position of the two polygons, to determine whether these polygons overlap, touch or are separated, by conducting a simple test to identify whether the resulting vector is inside the NFP. There are three approaches to generating the NFP the orbiting algorithm by Mahadevan (1984), improved by Burke et al. (2007); the Minkowski sums used by Milenkovic et al. (1991) and Bennell and Dowsland (2001); and the decomposition into star-shaped polygons (Daniels et al., 1994) or convex polygons (Watson and Tobias, 1999, Agarwal et al., 2002).\nA more general tool that generalizes the NFP is the*Phi-function*. Its purpose is to represent all the mutual positions of two polygons. The*Phi-functions*for cutting and packing were conceived of and applied by Stoyan et al., 2001, Stoyan et al., 2004, Scheithauer et al. (2005). Bennell et al. (2010) provide a good explanation of how the*Phi-functions*can be built, as well as some applications for them.\nMany different heuristic and metaheuristic approaches have been proposed for solving nesting problems. Simple heuristic rules are used for building a solution step by step, placing one piece at a time, using different placement procedures and different piece sequences. Metaheuristic procedures are used for working with complete solutions and modifying them iterat...",

The paper\npresents a new algorithmic procedure for deriving this tool.\nSubmitted: June 2005\nSubject classification: cutting stock, geometric, algorithm\nArea of review: Optimisation\n2\nAbstract\nThe nofit polygon is a powerful and effective tool for handling the geometric\nrequirements of solution approaches to irregular cutting and packing problems. Although\nthe concept was first described in 1966, it was not until the early 90s that the general\ntrend of research moved away from direct trigonometry to favour the nofit polygon. Since\nthen, the ability to calculate the nofit polygon has practically become a pre-requisite for\nresearching irregular packing problems. However, realisation of this concept in the form\nof a robust algorithm is a highly challenging task with few instructive approaches\npublished. In this paper, a procedure using the mathematical concept of Minkowski sums\nfor the calculation of the nofit polygon is presented. The described procedure is more\nrobust than other approaches using Minkowski Sum knowledge and includes details of\nthe removal of internal edges to find holes, slits and lock and key positions. The\nprocedure is tested on benchmark data sets and gives examples of complicated cases. In\naddition the paper includes a description of how the procedure is modified in order to\nrealise the inner-fit polygon.\n3\n1. INTRODUCTION\nThe paper specifically addresses the geometric calculations required for tackling\ncutting and packing problems involving irregular shapes. Such problems are common in\nmanufacturing processes and occur whenever a piece of irregular shape is to be cut from\na sheet of stock material. Examples include dye-cutting in the engineering sector, parts\nnesting for shipbuilding, marker layout in the garment industry, and leather cutting for\nshoes, furniture and other goods. Here we consider that shapes are irregular if they are;\npolygonal, i.e no arcs; simple, i.e. do not self-cross; and non-rectangular. Even when all\nthe components are rectangular the problem of finding layouts that minimize waste is\nknown to be NP-hard. Where irregular components are involved an extra dimension of\ncomplexity is generated by the geometry.\nThe precise requirements of a good layout will differ from industry to industry and\nthis has lead to a variety of algorithmic approaches. In spite of their differences, all the\nmethods have a common requirement in which they need to be able to identify whether a\nlayout is feasible or not, i.e. do any of the pieces overlap. Early research handled this\nproblem in a number of ways. Adamowicz and Albano (1976) chose to nest pieces into\nsimpler shapes where the geometry can be more easily calculated. If the shapes are used\ndirectly then the intersection of pieces can be handled by direct trigonometric approaches\nsuch as the D function (Mehadavan, 1984; Konopasek, 1981). Alternatively the stock\nsheet and the pieces can be approximated as grid squares, often referred to as the raster\nmethod. Hence, if a piece occupies, fully or partially, a grid square it is coded as occupied\n(Oliveira and Ferreira, 1993; Babu and Babu, 2001).\n4\nAlthough all these approaches have merit, it is widely recognized that the nofit\npolygon (NFP) is more efficient, provided you have a robust and efficient NFP generator,\nand has become the principle approach for handling the geometry in nesting problems.\nUnfortunately, some researchers believe that despite the value of this tool, its introduction\nmay have stifled research into this variant of packing problems. W\u00e4scher, Hau\u00dfner and\nSchumann (2005) reports that there have been only 21 publications in irregular problems\nin the last 10 years. Researchers attribute this to the fact that the realization of the NFP as\na robust algorithm is, in itself, a highly challenging task. Those considering embarking on\nresearch into irregular shaped packing may be discouraged by the significant investment\nof time required in first developing an NFP generator. Hence, it is essential that robust\nand easily realizable algorithms are available in order to facilitate new interest into this\nimportant problem.\nThe primary purpose of this paper is to introduce a new procedure for calculating the\nNFP. The method is developed from the theory of Minkowski sums and builds on the\nprinciples proposed by Ghosh (1993) and by Bennell, Dowsland and Dowsland (2001).\nFurther, the paper includes an algorithmic procedure for eliciting the true boundary of the\nNFP, including holes, slits and exact fits. The next section outlines the most commonly\ncited approaches for calculating the NFP and points out their positive features and\ndisadvantages. Section 3 reviews in more detail the Minkowski sum approach. This is\nfollowed by a description of our new procedure based on Minkowski sums. Section 5,\ndevelops our approach for removing redundant internal points and therefore identifying\nthe true boundary. In both cases the full algorithmic steps are provided. Section 6 outlines\n5\nthe modification required in order to determine the inner-fit polygon. Finally, we develop\nsome theoretical and empirical analysis of the approach to demonstrate its robustness.\n2. DOCUMENTED APPROACHES FOR GENERATING THE NOFIT\nPOLYGON\nThe nofit polygon (NFP) is a combination of the properties of two component\npolygons that, as a result, represents all the relative positions of the two polygons in\nwhich they either touch or overlap. It is well documented that the NFP can reduce the\ncomplexity of detecting overlap between two pieces from O(nm+n+m), where n and m\nare the number of edges in each polygon, obtained from direct trigonometry, to a simple\npoint inclusion test of O(k), where k is the number of edges in the NFP. Full explanations\nof the concept can be found in (Mehadevan, 1984; Ghosh, 1991; Bennell, 1998; Bennell\nDowsland and Dowsland, 2001), where the most intuitive description is found in\nCunningham-Green (1989), who describes the motion of one polygon sliding around the\nboundary of the other; often referred to as the orbiting method. Figure 1a and 1b\nillustrates the motion of polygon B, the orbiting polygon, sliding around A, the fixed\npolygon, tracing the locus of a reference point on B. He also notes that when both\npolygons are convex, the NFP is an exact replication of the edges of both polygons, with\nopposite orientation, sorted into their slope order. Figure 1c shows the edges of both\npolygons, where A has counterclockwise orientation and B has clockwise orientation,\nsorted into slope order; these can be directly mapped onto the NFP in figure 1b. Note that\nthis role and orientation of polygons A and B will be adopted for the remainder of the\npaper. Cunningham-Green\u2019s (1989) observations underpin two of the most common\n6\napproaches to generating the NFP; the orbiting method that simulates the sliding motion,\nand Minkowski sums that sort the edges according to the the slope order and edge\nprecedence, i.e the sequential order of edges around the polygons. A further approach\ncommonly employed is that of decomposition. A brief description of each is provided\nhere.\nFigure 1: The locus of the reference point on B traces the NFP as it slides around A.\nThis is equivalent to connecting the edges in slope order.\nMinkowski sum\nClearly, when both component polygons are convex the NFP is very simple to\ncalculate by sorting the edges into slope order. Further, when one of the polygons is\n(b)\n(c)\n(a)\nB\nNFPAB\nA\n= Reference point on B\n7\nconvex and the other is an arbit...",

Both the shapes and material resource can be arbitrary nonconvex polygons. Moreover, the shapes can have holes and the material can have defective areas. Finally, the shapes can be arranged using both translations and*arbitrary*rotations (as opposed to a finite set of rotation angles, such as 0\\\\(^\\\\circ \\\\)and 180\\\\(^\\\\circ \\\\)). The insight that has made all this possible is a novel way to relax the constraint that the shapes not overlap. The key idea is to inscribe a few circles in each irregular shape and then relax the non-overlap constraints for the*shapes*by replacing them with non-overlap constraints for the*inscribed circles*. These relaxed problems have the form of quadratic programming problems (QPs) and can be solved to optimality to provide valid lower bounds. Valid upper bounds can be found via local search with strict non-overlap constraints. If the shapes overlap in the solution to the relaxed problem, new circles are inscribed in the shapes to prevent this overlapping configuration from recurring, and the QP is then resolved to obtain improved lower bounds. Convergence to any fixed tolerance is guaranteed in a finite number of iterations. A specialized branch-and-bound algorithm, together with some heuristics, are introduced to find the initial inscribed circles that approximate the shapes. The new approach, called \u201cQP-Nest,\u201d is applied to three problems as proof of concept. The most complicated of these is a problem due to Milenkovic that has four nonconvex polygons with 94, 72, 84, and 74 vertices, respectively. QP-Nest is able prove global optimality when nesting the first*two*or the first*three*of these shapes. When all*four*shapes are considered, QP-Nest finds the best known solution, but cannot prove optimality.\nThis is a preview of subscription content,[log in via an
