      "finding": "Baseline greedy approach: Place trees one-by-one, starting far away and moving toward center until collision, then back up. Uses weighted random angles (sin(2*angle)) to favor diagonal placements for better corner packing. Uses Shapely for collision detection with STRtree spatial indexing.",

      "finding": "Advanced approach uses bbox3 binary optimizer with phased runs: Phase A (short 2min runs), Phase B (medium 10min), Phase C (long 20min). Key technique: rotation tightening via convex hull optimization - finds optimal rotation angle to minimize bounding box. Uses scipy.optimize.minimize_scalar on hull points. Also includes overlap repair mechanism.",
