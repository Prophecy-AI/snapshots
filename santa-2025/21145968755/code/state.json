Submit the result to verify improvement\n\n## CRITICAL: Previous experiments showed SA on pre-optimized = 0 improvement\nThe strategy document notes that previous runs showed SA, backward propagation, and C++ optimizers produced 0 improvement on pre-optimized solutions. This suggests:\n1. The pre-optimized solutions are already at local optima\n2. We need CONSTRUCTIVE approaches that find different basins\n3. Focus on small N (1-20) where efficiency is worst and construction might find better solutions\n4. Try lattice-based construction for large N\n\n## Alternative Next Experiment: 002_small_n_construction\nIf C++ optimizer shows 0 improvement, pivot to:\n1. Implement bottom-left beam search for N=1-20\n2. Try multiple random constructions with different starting configurations\n3. Use jostle moves (swap + rotate) to escape local optima",
  "evaluator_feedback": "## What I Understood\n\nThe junior researcher conducted experiment 002 to test the C++ SA optimizer from Jonathan Chan's kernel on the pre-optimized solution. The hypothesis was to verify whether the pre-optimized solution is truly at a local optimum (as suggested by previous experiments). They successfully compiled and ran the optimizer, which confirmed 0 improvement after 132 seconds of optimization. They also performed a valuable per-N efficiency analysis showing that N=1 has the worst efficiency (0.529) while large N values (150-200) have the best efficiency (~1.05).\n\n## Technical Execution Assessment\n\n**Validation**: \u2705 Sound. The scoring function is correctly implemented (side\u00b2/n summed over all N). The C++ optimizer was properly compiled and executed with reasonable parameters (-n 5000, -r 3).\n\n**Leakage Risk**: None - this is a pure optimization problem with no train/test split concerns.\n\n**Score Integrity**: \u2705 Verified. The optimizer output clearly shows:\n- Initial: 70.659959\n- Final: 70.659959\n- Improvement: 0.000000 (0.00%)\n\nThe LB submission from exp_000 confirmed perfect calibration: CV=70.659959, LB=70.659959225347.\n\n**Code Quality**: Good. The notebook handles the GLIBC incompatibility of the pre-compiled bbox3 binary by extracting and compiling the C++ code from the kernel. The code properly removes the Jupyter magic (`%%writefile`) before compilation.\n\nVerdict: **TRUSTWORTHY** - Results are reliable and confirm the hypothesis.\n\n## Strategic Assessment\n\n**Approach Fit**: \u2705 This experiment was appropriate to verify the local optimum hypothesis. The result confirms that local search methods (SA, fractional translation) cannot improve the pre-optimized solution. This is valuable information that validates the strategy document's assertion.\n\n**Effort Allocation**: The experiment was efficient - it took ~2 minutes of optimizer runtime and provided clear confirmation. However, the team is now at a critical decision point: **local search is exhausted, constructive approaches are needed**.\n\n**Assumptions Being Validated**:\n1. \u2705 Pre-optimized solutions are at local optima - CONFIRMED\n2. \u2705 LB matches CV - CONFIRMED (perfect calibration)\n3. \u26a0\ufe0f The gap of 1.74 points requires fundamentally different approaches - NEEDS ACTION\n\n**Blind Spots - CRITICAL**:\n\n1. **No constructive approaches tried yet**: The strategy document clearly states that constructive heuristics (bottom-left beam search, random multi-start construction) are needed, but none have been implemented. This is the highest priority gap.\n\n2. **Per-N analysis reveals optimization targets**: The analysis shows:\n   - N=1-20: Avg efficiency 0.62, contributes 11.4% of score\n   - N=151-200: Avg efficiency 0.73, contributes 23.8% of score\n   - **Key insight**: Improving large N values has more impact on total score\n\n3. **Discussions not fully leveraged**:\n   - \"Why winning solutions will be Asymmetric\" (33 votes) - suggests symmetric solutions have limits\n   - \"Symmetric solutions that are apparently optimal\" (42 votes) - important geometric insights\n   - \"Efficient basin search\" (7 votes) - different initialization strategies\n   - \"k-mer exploration\" (10 votes) - recent discussion about pattern-based approaches\n\n4. **Available tools not yet explored**:\n   - `fix_direction` rotation optimization (from saspav kernel)\n   - Interactive editor for manual refinement\n   - tree_packer_v21 with different parameters\n\n**Trajectory**: The team has completed the verification phase (2 experiments). The trajectory is correct - they've confirmed the baseline and verified local optimum. **Now is the time to pivot to constructive approaches.**\n\n## What's Working\n\n1. \u2705 Excellent LB calibration (CV matches LB almost exactly)\n2. \u2705 Thorough verification of local optimum hypothesis\n3. \u2705 Good per-N efficiency analysis identifying optimization targets\n4. \u2705 Proper handling of binary compatibility issues (compiling from source)\n5. \u2705 Clear documentation of results and conclusions\n\n## Key Concerns\n\n### 1. No Constructive Approaches Implemented Yet (CRITICAL)\n- **Observation**: Two experiments have verified the baseline and local optimum, but no constructive approaches have been tried.\n- **Why it matters**: The strategy document and discussions clearly indicate that local search cannot close the 1.74 point gap. Top teams (68.9 score) are using fundamentally different construction methods.\n- **Suggestion**: Immediately implement one of:\n  a) **Bottom-left beam search construction** - research shows this is highly effective for irregular packing\n  b) **Random multi-start construction** with 1000+ restarts per N\n  c) **Lattice-based construction** with 2-4 tree repeating blocks (mentioned in discussions)\n\n### 2. Focus on High-Impact N Values\n- **Observation**: N=151-200 contributes 23.8% of total score with avg efficiency 0.73\n- **Why it matters**: Improving large N configurations has more impact than small N\n- **Suggestion**: When implementing constructive approaches, prioritize N > 100 for maximum score improvement\n\n### 3. Discussion Insights Not Leveraged\n- **Observation**: Key discussions mention lattice-based approaches, asymmetric solutions, and k-mer patterns\n- **Why it matters**: Top teams are using these techniques to achieve 67-68 scores\n- **Suggestion**: Read and implement insights from:\n  - \"Why winning solutions will be Asymmetric\" - try non-symmetric configurations\n  - \"k-mer exploration\" - pattern-based construction\n  - \"Efficient basin search\" - different initialization strategies\n\n### 4. Submissions Budget Underutilized\n- **Observation**: 1/100 submissions used, 94 remaining today\n- **Why it matters**: Submissions are valuable for validating improvements\n- **Suggestion**: Use submissions strategically to test promising constructive approaches\n\n## Top Priority for Next Experiment\n\n**IMPLEMENT A CONSTRUCTIVE APPROACH - specifically bottom-left beam search or random multi-start construction.**\n\nThe verification phase is complete. The team has confirmed:\n1. Best available pre-optimized score: 70.659959\n2. LB matches CV perfectly\n3. Local search cannot improve the solution\n\nThe path forward is clear: **constructive heuristics that can find different basins of attraction**. The strategy document outlines several approaches:\n\n1. **Bottom-left beam search** (RECOMMENDED FIRST):\n   - For each N, try multiple starting angles (0\u00b0, 30\u00b0, 45\u00b0, 60\u00b0, 90\u00b0)\n   - Use beam width of 10-20 to explore multiple configurations\n   - Keep best configuration per N\n\n2. **Random multi-start construction**:\n   - Generate 1000+ random valid configurations per N\n   - Keep the best one\n   - Can be parallelized for speed\n\n3. **Lattice-based construction** (from discussions):\n   - Use 2-4 tree repeating blocks\n   - Particularly effective for large N values\n\nThe target of 68.919154 is achievable - teams have reached 67-68 scores. The gap of 1.74 points (~2.5%) requires finding better basins of attraction, not optimizing within the current basin.\n\n**Time is valuable** - with 94 submissions remaining and the verification phase complete, focus all effort on constructive approaches that can produce fundamentally better configurations.\n",

Need constructive approaches.**\n\n## Available Pre-optimized Resources\nBest pre-optimized CSVs:\n- `/home/nonroot/snapshots/santa-2025/21116303805/code/preoptimized/santa-2025-csv/santa-2025.csv` (~70.676)\n- `/home/nonroot/snapshots/santa-2025/21116303805/code/preoptimized/bucket-of-chump/submission.csv`\n- `/home/nonroot/snapshots/santa-2025/21116303805/code/preoptimized/best_ensemble.csv`\n- bbox3 binary: `/home/nonroot/snapshots/santa-2025/21116303805/code/preoptimized/bbox3`\n\n## MANDATORY FIRST EXPERIMENT: Baseline Verification\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport shutil\n\n# Copy best pre-optimized\nsrc = '/home/nonroot/snapshots/santa-2025/21116303805/code/preoptimized/santa-2025-csv/santa-2025.csv'\nshutil.copy(src, 'submission.csv')\n\n# Verify score ~70.676\n```\n\n## Approaches That MUST Be Tried (Priority Order)\n\n### 1. External Dataset Search (HIGHEST PRIORITY)\nTop teams (68.9 score) likely have better pre-optimized solutions.\n```bash\nkaggle datasets list -s \"santa 2025\" --sort-by votes\n```\n\n### 2. Bottom-Left Constructive Heuristic with Beam Search\nResearch shows bottom-left placement is highly effective for irregular packing:\n```python\ndef bottom_left_beam_search(n_trees, beam_width=20):\n    \"\"\"Build configuration using bottom-left placement with beam search\"\"\"\n    states = [{'trees': [], 'polygons': []}]\n    \n    for tree_idx in range(n_trees):\n        candidates = []\n        for state in states:\n            # Try multiple angles\n            for angle in np.linspace(0, 360, 72):\n                # Find bottom-left valid position\n                pos = find_bottom_left_position(state['polygons'], angle)\n                if pos:\n                    new_state = add_tree(state, pos, angle)\n                    score = compute_bounding_side(new_state['polygons'])\n                    candidates.append((score, new_state))\n        \n        # Keep top beam_width states\n        candidates.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])\n        states = [c[1] for c in candidates[:beam_width]]\n    \n    return min(states, key=lambda s: compute_score(s))\n```\n\n### 3. DJD Selection Heuristic (From Research)\nThe Djang-Finch heuristic outperforms conventional selection for irregular packing:\n- Sort pieces by size/shape characteristics\n- Use placement heuristic (bottom-left or jostle)\n- Apply local refinement after construction\n\n### 4. Jostle-Style Moves\nResearch shows jostle moves (swap + rotate) significantly improve density:\n```python\ndef jostle_optimization(config, iterations=1000):\n    \"\"\"Apply jostle moves to improve packing\"\"\"\n    for _ in range(iterations):\n        # Try swapping two trees\n        i, j = random.sample(range(len(config)), 2)\n        new_config = swap_trees(config, i, j)\n        if valid(new_config) and score(new_config) < score(config):\n            config = new_config\n        \n        # Try rotating a tree\n        i = random.randint(0, len(config)-1)\n        for delta_angle in [5, -5, 10, -10, 45, -45]:\n            new_config = rotate_tree(config, i, delta_angle)\n            if valid(new_config) and score(new_config) < score(config):\n                config = new_config\n                break\n    return config\n```\n\n### 5. Random Multi-Start Construction\nGenerate many random configurations and keep best:\n```python\ndef random_construction(n_trees, num_restarts=1000):\n    best_config = None\n    best_score = float('inf')\n    \n    for restart in range(num_restarts):\n        config = build_random_config(n_trees)\n        if config and not has_overlap(config):\n            score = compute_side(config)**2 / n_trees\n            if score < best_score:\n                best_score = score\n                best_config = config\n    \n    return best_config\n```\n\n### 6. Per-N Independent Optimization\nFor each N from 1 to 200:\n- Try 10+ different construction strategies\n- Use different seed angles (0\u00b0, 30\u00b0, 45\u00b0, 60\u00b0, 90\u00b0)\n- Try different placement orders (center-out, spiral, random)\n\n### 7. Corner Extraction from Larger N\nExtract subsets from larger configurations:\n```python\ndef corner_extraction(source_n, target_n):\n    \"\"\"Try using corners of N=source_n for N=target_n\"\"\"\n    source_trees = load_config(source_n)\n    corner_trees = get_boundary_trees(source_trees)\n    for subset in combinations(corner_trees, target_n):\n        if not has_overlap(subset):\n            score = compute_score(subset)\n            # Compare with current best\n```\n\n## Key Techniques from Top Kernels\n\n### bbox3 C++ Optimizer\n```cpp\n// Key parameters\nconstexpr double NEIGHBOR_RADIUS = 0.5;\nconstexpr double PIVOT_ANGLE_MAX = 10.0;\nconstexpr double GLOBAL_TENSION_STRENGTH = 0.05;\n// Run: ./bbox3 -n <iterations> -r <restarts>\n```\n\n### tree_packer_v21 C++ Optimizer\n```cpp\n// Key operations:\n// 1. Squeeze: scale 0.9995 to 0.98 toward center\n// 2. Compaction: move trees toward center\n// 3. Local search: 8 directions + rotations\n// 4. Swap moves: exchange positions\n// 5. Multi-start: different initial angles\n```\n\n### fix_direction Rotation Optimization\n```python\nfrom scipy.optimize import minimize_scalar\nfrom scipy.spatial import ConvexHull\n\ndef optimize_rotation(trees):\n    \"\"\"Rotate entire config to minimize bounding box\"\"\"\n    points = get_all_vertices(trees)\n    hull_points = points[ConvexHull(points).vertices]\n    \n    def bbox_at_angle(angle):\n        rotated = rotate_points(hull_points, angle)\n        return max(rotated.max(0) - rotated.min(0))\n    \n    result = minimize_scalar(bbox_at_angle, bounds=(0, 90), method='bounded')\n    return result.x, result.fun\n```\n\n## Validation Requirements\n- All trees must not overlap (intersect but not touch is OK)\n- Coordinates must be in range [-100, 100]\n- Format: `id,x,y,deg` with 's' prefix on values\n\n## Scoring Function\n```python\ndef compute_total_score(df):\n    total = 0\n    for n in range(1, 201):\n        trees = load_trees_for_n(df, n)\n        side = compute_bounding_box_side(trees)\n        total += side**2 / n\n    return total\n```\n\n## Overlap Detection (Fast)\n```python\nfrom shapely.geometry import Polygon\nfrom shapely.strtree import STRtree\n\ndef has_overlap(trees):\n    polygons = [create_tree_polygon(t) for t in trees]\n    tree_index = STRtree(polygons)\n    \n    for i, poly in enumerate(polygons):\n        candidates = tree_index.query(poly)\n        for j in candidates:\n            if i != j and poly.intersects(polygons[j]) and not poly.touches(polygons[j]):\n                return True\n    return False\n```\n\n## Recommended Experiment Order\n\n1. **001_baseline**: Load best pre-optimized CSV, verify score ~70.676\n2. **002_dataset_search**: Search for external datasets with better solutions\n3. **003_ensemble**: Combine all available sources, pick best per-N\n4. **004_bottom_left_beam**: Bottom-left construction with beam search\n5. **005_random_multi**: Random construction with 1000+ restarts per N\n6. **006_jostle**: Apply jostle moves to best configurations\n7. **007_corner_extract**: Systematic corner extraction search\n\n## DO NOT WASTE TIME ON:\n- More SA iterations on pre-optimized solutions\n- Different SA parameters (temperature, cooling rate)\n- Backward propagation from pre-optimized\n- Lattice-based construction (produces worse results)\n- Local search variants on pre-optimized\n\n## FOCUS ON:\n- Finding better external pre-optimized solutions\n- Constructive approaches (bottom-left, beam search)\n- Random initialization with many restarts\n- Jostle-style moves (swap + rotate)\n- Ensemble of diverse construction methods\n\n## Key Files\n- Sample submission: `/home/data/sample_submission.csv`\n- Pre-optimized: `/home/nonroot/snapshots/santa-2025/21116303805/code/preoptimized/`\n- bbox3 binary: Copy from pre-optimized directory\n\n\nStart with a simple baseline following this strategy.

External Dataset Search (HIGHEST PRIORITY)\\nTop teams (68.9 score) likely have better pre-optimized solutions.\\n```bash\\nkaggle datasets list -s \\\"santa 2025\\\" --sort-by votes\\n```\\n\\n### 2. Bottom-Left Constructive Heuristic with Beam Search\\nResearch shows bottom-left placement is highly effective for irregular packing:\\n```python\\ndef bottom_left_beam_search(n_trees, beam_width=20):\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"Build configuration using bottom-left placement with beam search\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    states = [{'trees': [], 'polygons': []}]\\n    \\n    for tree_idx in range(n_trees):\\n        candidates = []\\n        for state in states:\\n            # Try multiple angles\\n            for angle in np.linspace(0, 360, 72):\\n                # Find bottom-left valid position\\n                pos = find_bottom_left_position(state['polygons'], angle)\\n                if pos:\\n                    new_state = add_tree(state, pos, angle)\\n                    score = compute_bounding_side(new_state['polygons'])\\n                    candidates.append((score, new_state))\\n        \\n        # Keep top beam_width states\\n        candidates.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])\\n        states = [c[1] for c in candidates[:beam_width]]\\n    \\n    return min(states, key=lambda s: compute_score(s))\\n```\\n\\n### 3. DJD Selection Heuristic (From Research)\\nThe Djang-Finch heuristic outperforms conventional selection for irregular packing:\\n- Sort pieces by size/shape characteristics\\n- Use placement heuristic (bottom-left or jostle)\\n- Apply local refinement after construction\\n\\n### 4. Jostle-Style Moves\\nResearch shows jostle moves (swap + rotate) significantly improve density:\\n```python\\ndef jostle_optimization(config, iterations=1000):\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"Apply jostle moves to improve packing\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    for _ in range(iterations):\\n        # Try swapping two trees\\n        i, j = random.sample(range(len(config)), 2)\\n        new_config = swap_trees(config, i, j)\\n        if valid(new_config) and score(new_config) < score(config):\\n            config = new_config\\n        \\n        # Try rotating a tree\\n        i = random.randint(0, len(config)-1)\\n        for delta_angle in [5, -5, 10, -10, 45, -45]:\\n            new_config = rotate_tree(config, i, delta_angle)\\n            if valid(new_config) and score(new_config) < score(config):\\n                config = new_config\\n                break\\n    return config\\n```\\n\\n### 5. Random Multi-Start Construction\\nGenerate many random configurations and keep best:\\n```python\\ndef random_construction(n_trees, num_restarts=1000):\\n    best_config = None\\n    best_score = float('inf')\\n    \\n    for restart in range(num_restarts):\\n        config = build_random_config(n_trees)\\n        if config and not has_overlap(config):\\n            score = compute_side(config)**2 / n_trees\\n            if score < best_score:\\n                best_score = score\\n                best_config = config\\n    \\n    return best_config\\n```\\n\\n### 6. Per-N Independent Optimization\\nFor each N from 1 to 200:\\n- Try 10+ different construction strategies\\n- Use different seed angles (0\\u00b0, 30\\u00b0, 45\\u00b0, 60\\u00b0, 90\\u00b0)\\n- Try different placement orders (center-out, spiral, random)\\n\\n### 7. Corner Extraction from Larger N\\nExtract subsets from larger configurations:\\n```python\\ndef corner_extraction(source_n, target_n):\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"Try using corners of N=source_n for N=target_n\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    source_trees = load_config(source_n)\\n    corner_trees = get_boundary_trees(source_trees)\\n    for subset in combinations(corner_trees, target_n):\\n        if not has_overlap(subset):\\n            score = compute_score(subset)\\n            # Compare with current best\\n```\\n\\n## Key Techniques from Top Kernels\\n\\n### bbox3 C++ Optimizer\\n```cpp\\n// Key parameters\\nconstexpr double NEIGHBOR_RADIUS = 0.5;\\nconstexpr double PIVOT_ANGLE_MAX = 10.0;\\nconstexpr double GLOBAL_TENSION_STRENGTH = 0.05;\\n// Run: ./bbox3 -n <iterations> -r <restarts>\\n```\\n\\n### tree_packer_v21 C++ Optimizer\\n```cpp\\n// Key operations:\\n// 1. Squeeze: scale 0.9995 to 0.98 toward center\\n// 2. Compaction: move trees toward center\\n// 3. Local search: 8 directions + rotations\\n// 4. Swap moves: exchange positions\\n// 5. Multi-start: different initial angles\\n```\\n\\n### fix_direction Rotation Optimization\\n```python\\nfrom scipy.optimize import minimize_scalar\\nfrom scipy.spatial import ConvexHull\\n\\ndef optimize_rotation(trees):\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"Rotate entire config to minimize bounding box\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    points = get_all_vertices(trees)\\n    hull_points = points[ConvexHull(points).vertices]\\n    \\n    def bbox_at_angle(angle):\\n        rotated = rotate_points(hull_points, angle)\\n        return max(rotated.max(0) - rotated.min(0))\\n    \\n    result = minimize_scalar(bbox_at_angle, bounds=(0, 90), method='bounded')\\n    return result.x, result.fun\\n```\\n\\n## Validation Requirements\\n- All trees must not overlap (intersect but not touch is OK)\\n- Coordinates must be in range [-100, 100]\\n- Format: `id,x,y,deg` with 's' prefix on values\\n\\n## Scoring Function\\n```python\\ndef compute_total_score(df):\\n    total = 0\\n    for n in range(1, 201):\\n        trees = load_trees_for_n(df, n)\\n        side = compute_bounding_box_side(trees)\\n        total += side**2 / n\\n    return total\\n```\\n\\n## Overlap Detection (Fast)\\n```python\\nfrom shapely.geometry import Polygon\\nfrom shapely.strtree import STRtree\\n\\ndef has_overlap(trees):\\n    polygons = [create_tree_polygon(t) for t in trees]\\n    tree_index = STRtree(polygons)\\n    \\n    for i, poly in enumerate(polygons):\\n        candidates = tree_index.query(poly)\\n        for j in candidates:\\n            if i != j and poly.intersects(polygons[j]) and not poly.touches(polygons[j]):\\n                return True\\n    return False\\n```\\n\\n## Recommended Experiment Order\\n\\n1. **001_baseline**: Load best pre-optimized CSV, verify score ~70.676\\n2. **002_dataset_search**: Search for external datasets with better solutions\\n3. **003_ensemble**: Combine all available sources, pick best per-N\\n4. **004_bottom_left_beam**: Bottom-left construction with beam search\\n5. **005_random_multi**: Random construction with 1000+ restarts per N\\n6. **006_jostle**: Apply jostle moves to best configurations\\n7. **007_corner_extract**: Systematic corner extraction search\\n\\n## DO NOT WASTE TIME ON:\\n- More SA iterations on pre-optimized solutions\\n- Different SA parameters (temperature, cooling rate)\\n- Backward propagation from pre-optimized\\n- Lattice-based construction (produces worse results)\\n- Local search variants on pre-optimized\\n\\n## FOCUS ON:\\n- Finding better external pre-optimized solutions\\n- Constructive approaches (bottom-left, beam search)\\n- Random initialization with many restarts\\n- Jostle-style moves (swap + rotate)\\n- Ensemble of diverse construction methods\\n\\n## Key Files\\n- Sample submission: `/home/data/sample_submission.csv`\\n- Pre-optimized: `/home/nonroot/snapshots/santa-2025/21116303805/code/preoptimized/`\\n- bbox3 binary: Copy from pre-optimized directory\\n\",\n      \"agent\": \"explorer\",\n      \"timestamp\": \"2026-01-19T17:20:04.761524\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"feedback_history\": [],\n  \"data_findings\": [\n    {\n      \"finding\": \"This is a 2D packing optimization problem: pack Christmas tree-shaped polygons (N=1 to 200) into smallest square bounding box.

Their goal was to establish a baseline by loading and comparing all available pre-optimized CSV files from various sources (snapshots, external Kaggle datasets). They found the best available score is 70.659959 from the saspav/santa-2025-csv dataset, which is 1.74 points away from the target of 68.919154. They also attempted to create an ensemble by picking the best configuration per N from all sources, but it matched the saspav score exactly.\n\n## Technical Execution Assessment\n\n**Validation**: The scoring function implementation is correct - it computes the bounding box side for each N configuration and calculates score = side\u00b2/n, then sums across all N from 1 to 200. The code properly handles the 's' prefix in the CSV values.\n\n**Leakage Risk**: None - this is a pure optimization problem, not a prediction task. No leakage concerns apply.\n\n**Score Integrity**: \u2705 Verified in notebook output. Multiple sources were tested:\n- santa-2025.csv: 70.676102\n- best_ensemble.csv: 70.676102  \n- bucket-of-chump: 70.676501\n- saspav external dataset: 70.659959 (best)\n- Ensemble of all sources: 70.659959 (matches best single source)\n\n**Code Quality**: Good. The notebook is well-structured with clear comments. The scoring function is correctly implemented. The ensemble approach correctly picks the best configuration per N.\n\nVerdict: **TRUSTWORTHY** - The baseline is correctly established and the score is verified.\n\n## Strategic Assessment\n\n**Approach Fit**: \u2705 Appropriate for a first experiment. Establishing a baseline from existing pre-optimized solutions is the right starting point. The strategy document correctly identifies that this is a 2D geometric packing optimization problem.\n\n**Effort Allocation**: The baseline experiment is efficient - it quickly surveys available resources and establishes the gap to target. However, the experiment notes reveal a critical insight from previous work: **pre-optimized solutions are at local optima** - SA, backward propagation, lattice construction, and C++ optimizers showed 0 improvement.\n\n**Assumptions Being Made**:\n1. The best public pre-optimized solutions are the best available starting point\n2. The gap of 1.74 points can be closed through optimization\n3. The ensemble approach (picking best per-N) is optimal\n\n**Blind Spots - CRITICAL**:\n\n1. **No LB submission yet**: With 95 submissions remaining, the team should submit the baseline to verify the local score matches LB. This is essential for this type of optimization competition.\n\n2. **The 1.74 point gap is SIGNIFICANT**: The discussions mention teams achieving 67-68 scores. The gap suggests the top teams have fundamentally different approaches, not just better optimization of the same solutions.\n\n3. **Key techniques from kernels not yet explored**:\n   - `fix_direction` rotation optimization (from saspav kernel) - rotates entire configurations to minimize bounding box\n   - `bbox3` C++ optimizer with simulated annealing, fluid dynamics, hinge pivot\n   - `tree_packer_v21` with squeeze, compaction, swap moves\n   - These are all available in the snapshots but haven't been run yet\n\n4. **Discussion insights not leveraged**:\n   - \"Why the winning solutions will be Asymmetric\" - suggests symmetric solutions have limits\n   - \"Symmetric solutions that are apparently optimal\" - 42 votes, important insight\n   - \"Efficient basin search\" - suggests different initialization strategies matter\n\n**Trajectory**: This is experiment 001 - the trajectory is just starting. The baseline is solid, but the real work begins now.\n\n## What's Working\n\n1. \u2705 Correct scoring function implementation\n2. \u2705 Comprehensive survey of available pre-optimized solutions\n3. \u2705 Ensemble approach correctly implemented (though it didn't improve over best single source)\n4. \u2705 Clear documentation of the gap to target (1.74 points)\n5. \u2705 Strategy document correctly identifies that local search on pre-optimized solutions doesn't work\n\n## Key Concerns\n\n### 1. No LB Submission Yet\n- **Observation**: 0 submissions made, 95 remaining today\n- **Why it matters**: For optimization competitions, verifying local score matches LB is critical. There could be precision issues, validation differences, or other surprises.\n- **Suggestion**: Submit the baseline immediately to establish LB correlation.\n\n### 2. The Gap Requires Fundamentally Different Approaches\n- **Observation**: Gap of 1.74 points (70.66 vs 68.92 target). Previous experiments showed 0 improvement from local search methods.\n- **Why it matters**: The top teams (68.9 score) are using approaches that produce fundamentally better configurations, not just better-optimized versions of the same configurations.\n- **Suggestion**: Focus on:\n  a) **Constructive heuristics**: Bottom-left beam search, random multi-start construction\n  b) **Different initialization strategies**: The \"basin search\" discussion suggests this matters\n  c) **Asymmetric solutions**: The discussion \"Why winning solutions will be Asymmetric\" has 33 votes\n\n### 3. Available Tools Not Yet Utilized\n- **Observation**: bbox3 binary and fix_direction code are available but not run\n- **Why it matters**: These tools might squeeze out small improvements, and more importantly, running them will confirm whether the solutions are truly at local optima\n- **Suggestion**: Run bbox3 with different parameters (-n 1000 -r 96) on the current best solution to verify it's at local optimum. Also apply fix_direction rotation optimization.\n\n### 4. Per-N Analysis Missing\n- **Observation**: The ensemble picked best per-N but all came from the same source (saspav)\n- **Why it matters**: Understanding which N values have the most room for improvement could focus optimization efforts\n- **Suggestion**: Analyze score contribution by N. Larger N values contribute more to total score (more trees = larger bounding boxes). Focus optimization on high-N configurations.\n\n## Top Priority for Next Experiment\n\n**SUBMIT THE BASELINE TO LEADERBOARD IMMEDIATELY**, then focus on **constructive approaches** rather than local search optimization.\n\nSpecifically:\n1. **Submit baseline** (candidate_000.csv) to verify LB score matches local score of 70.659959\n2. **Implement bottom-left beam search construction** - research shows this is highly effective for irregular packing\n3. **Try random multi-start construction** with 1000+ restarts per N\n4. **Analyze per-N score contributions** to identify which configurations have the most room for improvement\n\nThe key insight from the strategy document is correct: **local search methods DO NOT WORK on pre-optimized baselines**. The team needs constructive approaches that can find different basins of attraction, not better optimization of existing solutions.\n\nThe target of 68.919154 is achievable - teams have reached 67-68 scores according to discussions. The path forward is through fundamentally different construction methods, not incremental optimization.\n\n\n## Updated Strategy\n# Santa 2025 - Christmas Tree Packing Optimization\n\n## Current Status\n- Best CV score: 70.659959 from exp_000 (001_baseline)\n- Best LB score: 70.6600 (PERFECT CV-LB MATCH!)\n- Target: 68.919154 | Gap to target: 1.74 points (2.53%)\n\n## CV-LB Relationship Analysis\n- CV and LB match exactly (70.659959 \u2248 70.6600)\n- This is an optimization problem, not prediction - no distribution shift concerns\n- Our scoring function is correctly calibrated\n\n## Response to Evaluator\nThe evaluator correctly identified:\n1. \u2705 Baseline is solid and verified\n2. \u2705 LB submission confirmed CV-LB match (now done)\n3. \u2705 Gap of 1.74 points requires fundamentally different approaches\n4. \u2705 Local search on pre-optimized solutions doesn't work\n\nKey insight from evaluator: \"The top teams (68.9 score) are using approaches that produce fundamentally better configurations, not just better-optimized versions of the same configurations.\"\n\n## Key Findings from Analysis\n\n### Per-N Score Distribution\n- N=1-20: 11.4% of score, avg efficiency 0.62 (WORST - most room for improvement)\n- N=21-50: 15.5% of score, avg efficiency 0.67\n- N=51-100: 25.0% of score, avg efficiency 0.70\n- N=101-150: 24.3% of score, avg efficiency 0.72\n- N=151-200: 23.8% of score, avg efficiency 0.73 (BEST)\n\n### Theoretical Analysis\n- Best packing efficiency achieved: 0.7444 at N=181\n- If ALL N matched this efficiency: score would be 65.99 (4.67 points better!)\n- Current average efficiency: 0.6982\n- Target requires ~2.5% improvement across all N\n\n### What Top Teams Do (from research)\n1. **Lattice-based approaches** with 3-4 tree repeating blocks for N>=58\n2. **Chaotic/SA packing** for N<58\n3. **Fractional translation** with tiny steps (0.001 to 0.00001)\n4. **C++ optimizers** with AVX2 vectorization for speed\n5. **Multi-source ensemble** picking best per-N from 15+ sources\n\n## Recommended Approaches (Priority Order)\n\n### 1. **[HIGHEST PRIORITY]** Run C++ SA Optimizer on Current Best\nThe Jonathan Chan kernel shows significant improvements from SA + fractional translation.\n```bash\n# Compile and run the C++ optimizer\ng++ -O3 -march=native -std=c++17 -fopenmp -o sa_optimizer sa_v1_parallel.cpp\n./sa_optimizer -i submission.csv -o optimized.csv -n 20000 -r 80\n```\nThis should squeeze out small improvements from the current baseline.\n\n### 2. **[HIGH PRIORITY]** Implement Bottom-Left Beam Search Construction\nFor small N (1-20) where efficiency is worst:\n- Use bottom-left placement heuristic\n- Beam search with width 20-50\n- Try multiple starting angles (0\u00b0, 30\u00b0, 45\u00b0, 60\u00b0, 90\u00b0)\n- This could improve the 11.4% of score from N=1-20\n\n### 3. **[HIGH PRIORITY]** Search for Better External Datasets\nTop teams may have shared better solutions:\n```bash\nkaggle datasets list -s \"santa 2025\" --sort-by dateCreated\n```\nLook for datasets updated after our current best (saspav).\n\n### 4. **[MEDIUM PRIORITY]** Lattice Construction for Large N\nFor N>=58, construct crystalline lattice patterns:\n- 2-tree alternating up-down pattern\n- 3-tree and 4-tree repeating blocks\n- Systematic search over lattice parameters\n\n### 5. **[MEDIUM PRIORITY]** Fix Direction Rotation Optimization\nApply rotation optimization to minimize bounding box:\n```python\nfrom scipy.optimize import minimize_scalar\n# Rotate entire configuration to minimize max(width, height)\n```\n\n## What NOT to Try\n- \u274c More SA on pre-optimized solutions without new construction (already at local optimum)\n- \u274c Random perturbation without systematic search\n- \u274c Reinforcement learning (proven ineffective for this problem)\n- \u274c Neural network approaches (combinatorial optimization beats them here)\n\n## SUBMISSION STRATEGY\n- Remaining submissions: 94\n- **SUBMIT AFTER EVERY EXPERIMENT** - we have abundant submissions\n- LB feedback is free information - USE IT!\n\n## Validation Notes\n- Score = \u03a3(side_n\u00b2/n) for n=1 to 200\n- Lower is better\n- No overlap allowed (trees can touch but not intersect)\n- Coordinates must be in [-100, 100]\n\n## Available Resources\n- bbox3 binary: `/home/code/external_data/saspav/bbox3`\n- Best CSV: `/home/code/external_data/saspav/santa-2025.csv` (score: 70.659959)\n- Jonathan Chan C++ code: `research/kernels/jonathanchan_santa25-ensemble-sa-fractional-translation/`\n\n## Next Experiment: 002_cpp_optimizer\n1. Extract and compile the C++ SA optimizer from Jonathan Chan's kernel\n2. Run it on our current best submission\n3. Apply fractional translation refinement\n4. Submit the result to verify improvement\n\n## CRITICAL: Previous experiments showed SA on pre-optimized = 0 improvement\nThe strategy document notes that previous runs showed SA, backward propagation, and C++ optimizers produced 0 improvement on pre-optimized solutions. This suggests:\n1. The pre-optimized solutions are already at local optima\n2. We need CONSTRUCTIVE approaches that find different basins\n3. Focus on small N (1-20) where efficiency is worst and construction might find better solutions\n4. Try lattice-based construction for large N\n\n## Alternative Next Experiment: 002_small_n_construction\nIf C++ optimizer shows 0 improvement, pivot to:\n1. Implement bottom-left beam search for N=1-20\n2. Try multiple random constructions with different starting configurations\n3. Use jostle moves (swap + rotate) to escape local optima\n\nContinue experimenting based on the updated guidance above."

Extract and compile the C++ SA optimizer from Jonathan Chan's kernel\n2. Run it on our current best submission\n3. Apply fractional translation refinement\n4. Submit the result to verify improvement\n\n## CRITICAL: Previous experiments showed SA on pre-optimized = 0 improvement\nThe strategy document notes that previous runs showed SA, backward propagation, and C++ optimizers produced 0 improvement on pre-optimized solutions. This suggests:\n1. The pre-optimized solutions are already at local optima\n2. We need CONSTRUCTIVE approaches that find different basins\n3. Focus on small N (1-20) where efficiency is worst and construction might find better solutions\n4. Try lattice-based construction for large N\n\n## Alternative Next Experiment: 002_small_n_construction\nIf C++ optimizer shows 0 improvement, pivot to:\n1. Implement bottom-left beam search for N=1-20\n2. Try multiple random constructions with different starting configurations\n3. Use jostle moves (swap + rotate) to escape local optima\n\nStart with a simple baseline following this strategy. Reference the notebooks mentioned in the strategy for data understanding."

Bottom-Left Constructive Heuristic with Beam Search\\nResearch shows bottom-left placement is highly effective for irregular packing:\\n```python\\ndef bottom_left_beam_search(n_trees, beam_width=20):\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"Build configuration using bottom-left placement with beam search\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    states = [{'trees': [], 'polygons': []}]\\n    \\n    for tree_idx in range(n_trees):\\n        candidates = []\\n        for state in states:\\n            # Try multiple angles\\n            for angle in np.linspace(0, 360, 72):\\n                # Find bottom-left valid position\\n                pos = find_bottom_left_position(state['polygons'], angle)\\n                if pos:\\n                    new_state = add_tree(state, pos, angle)\\n                    score = compute_bounding_side(new_state['polygons'])\\n                    candidates.append((score, new_state))\\n        \\n        # Keep top beam_width states\\n        candidates.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])\\n        states = [c[1] for c in candidates[:beam_width]]\\n    \\n    return min(states, key=lambda s: compute_score(s))\\n```\\n\\n### 3. DJD Selection Heuristic (From Research)\\nThe Djang-Finch heuristic outperforms conventional selection for irregular packing:\\n- Sort pieces by size/shape characteristics\\n- Use placement heuristic (bottom-left or jostle)\\n- Apply local refinement after construction\\n\\n### 4. Jostle-Style Moves\\nResearch shows jostle moves (swap + rotate) significantly improve density:\\n```python\\ndef jostle_optimization(config, iterations=1000):\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"Apply jostle moves to improve packing\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    for _ in range(iterations):\\n        # Try swapping two trees\\n        i, j = random.sample(range(len(config)), 2)\\n        new_config = swap_trees(config, i, j)\\n        if valid(new_config) and score(new_config) < score(config):\\n            config = new_config\\n        \\n        # Try rotating a tree\\n        i = random.randint(0, len(config)-1)\\n        for delta_angle in [5, -5, 10, -10, 45, -45]:\\n            new_config = rotate_tree(config, i, delta_angle)\\n            if valid(new_config) and score(new_config) < score(config):\\n                config = new_config\\n                break\\n    return config\\n```\\n\\n### 5. Random Multi-Start Construction\\nGenerate many random configurations and keep best:\\n```python\\ndef random_construction(n_trees, num_restarts=1000):\\n    best_config = None\\n    best_score = float('inf')\\n    \\n    for restart in range(num_restarts):\\n        config = build_random_config(n_trees)\\n        if config and not has_overlap(config):\\n            score = compute_side(config)**2 / n_trees\\n            if score < best_score:\\n                best_score = score\\n                best_config = config\\n    \\n    return best_config\\n```\\n\\n### 6. Per-N Independent Optimization\\nFor each N from 1 to 200:\\n- Try 10+ different construction strategies\\n- Use different seed angles (0\\u00b0, 30\\u00b0, 45\\u00b0, 60\\u00b0, 90\\u00b0)\\n- Try different placement orders (center-out, spiral, random)\\n\\n### 7. Corner Extraction from Larger N\\nExtract subsets from larger configurations:\\n```python\\ndef corner_extraction(source_n, target_n):\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"Try using corners of N=source_n for N=target_n\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    source_trees = load_config(source_n)\\n    corner_trees = get_boundary_trees(source_trees)\\n    for subset in combinations(corner_trees, target_n):\\n        if not has_overlap(subset):\\n            score = compute_score(subset)\\n            # Compare with current best\\n```\\n\\n## Key Techniques from Top Kernels\\n\\n### bbox3 C++ Optimizer\\n```cpp\\n// Key parameters\\nconstexpr double NEIGHBOR_RADIUS = 0.5;\\nconstexpr double PIVOT_ANGLE_MAX = 10.0;\\nconstexpr double GLOBAL_TENSION_STRENGTH = 0.05;\\n// Run: ./bbox3 -n <iterations> -r <restarts>\\n```\\n\\n### tree_packer_v21 C++ Optimizer\\n```cpp\\n// Key operations:\\n// 1.

Multi-start: different initial angles\\n```\\n\\n### fix_direction Rotation Optimization\\n```python\\nfrom scipy.optimize import minimize_scalar\\nfrom scipy.spatial import ConvexHull\\n\\ndef optimize_rotation(trees):\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"Rotate entire config to minimize bounding box\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    points = get_all_vertices(trees)\\n    hull_points = points[ConvexHull(points).vertices]\\n    \\n    def bbox_at_angle(angle):\\n        rotated = rotate_points(hull_points, angle)\\n        return max(rotated.max(0) - rotated.min(0))\\n    \\n    result = minimize_scalar(bbox_at_angle, bounds=(0, 90), method='bounded')\\n    return result.x, result.fun\\n```\\n\\n## Validation Requirements\\n- All trees must not overlap (intersect but not touch is OK)\\n- Coordinates must be in range [-100, 100]\\n- Format: `id,x,y,deg` with 's' prefix on values\\n\\n## Scoring Function\\n```python\\ndef compute_total_score(df):\\n    total = 0\\n    for n in range(1, 201):\\n        trees = load_trees_for_n(df, n)\\n        side = compute_bounding_box_side(trees)\\n        total += side**2 / n\\n    return total\\n```\\n\\n## Overlap Detection (Fast)\\n```python\\nfrom shapely.geometry import Polygon\\nfrom shapely.strtree import STRtree\\n\\ndef has_overlap(trees):\\n    polygons = [create_tree_polygon(t) for t in trees]\\n    tree_index = STRtree(polygons)\\n    \\n    for i, poly in enumerate(polygons):\\n        candidates = tree_index.query(poly)\\n        for j in candidates:\\n            if i != j and poly.intersects(polygons[j]) and not poly.touches(polygons[j]):\\n                return True\\n    return False\\n```\\n\\n## Recommended Experiment Order\\n\\n1. **001_baseline**: Load best pre-optimized CSV, verify score ~70.676\\n2. **002_dataset_search**: Search for external datasets with better solutions\\n3. **003_ensemble**: Combine all available sources, pick best per-N\\n4. **004_bottom_left_beam**: Bottom-left construction with beam search\\n5. **005_random_multi**: Random construction with 1000+ restarts per N\\n6. **006_jostle**: Apply jostle moves to best configurations\\n7. **007_corner_extract**: Systematic corner extraction search\\n\\n## DO NOT WASTE T\n...(truncated)...\nurvey of available pre-optimized solutions\\n3. \\u2705 Ensemble approach correctly implemented (though it didn't improve over best single source)\\n4. \\u2705 Clear documentation of the gap to target (1.74 points)\\n5. \\u2705 Strategy document correctly identifies that local search on pre-optimized solutions doesn't work\\n\\n## Key Concerns\\n\\n### 1. No LB Submission Yet\\n- **Observation**: 0 submissions made, 95 remaining today\\n- **Why it matters**: For optimization competitions, verifying local score matches LB is critical. There could be precision issues, validation differences, or other surprises.\\n- **Suggestion**: Submit the baseline immediately to establish LB correlation.\\n\\n### 2. The Gap Requires Fundamentally Different Approaches\\n- **Observation**: Gap of 1.74 points (70.66 vs 68.92 target). Previous experiments showed 0 improvement from local search methods.\\n- **Why it matters**: The top teams (68.9 score) are using approaches that produce fundamentally better configurations, not just better-optimized versions of the same configurations.\\n- **Suggestion**: Focus on:\\n  a) **Constructive heuristics**: Bottom-left beam search, random multi-start construction\\n  b) **Different initialization strategies**: The \\\"basin search\\\" discussion suggests this matters\\n  c) **Asymmetric solutions**: The discussion \\\"Why winning solutions will be Asymmetric\\\" has 33 votes\\n\\n### 3. Available Tools Not Yet Utilized\\n- **Observation**: bbox3 binary and fix_direction code are available but not run\\n- **Why it matters**: These tools might squeeze out small improvements, and more importantly, running them will confirm whether the solutions are truly at local optima\\n- **Suggestion**: Run bbox3 with different parameters (-n 1000 -r 96) on the current best solution to verify it's at local optimum. Also apply fix_direction rotation optimization.\\n\\n### 4. Per-N Analysis Missing\\n- **Observation**: The ensemble picked best per-N but all came from the same source (saspav)\\n- **Why it matters**: Understanding which N values have the most room for improvement could focus optimization efforts\\n- **Suggestion**: Analyze score contribution by N. Larger N values contribute more to total score (more trees = larger bounding boxes). Focus optimization on high-N configurations.\\n\\n## Top Priority for Next Experiment\\n\\n**SUBMIT THE BASELINE TO LEADERBOARD IMMEDIATELY**, then focus on **constructive approaches** rather than local search optimization.\\n\\nSpecifically:\\n1. **Submit baseline** (candidate_000.csv) to verify LB score matches local score of 70.659959\\n2. **Implement bottom-left beam search construction** - research shows this is highly effective for irregular packing\\n3. **Try random multi-start construction** with 1000+ restarts per N\\n4. **Analyze per-N score contributions** to identify which configurations have the most room for improvement\\n\\nThe key insight from the strategy document is correct: **local search methods DO NOT WORK on pre-optimized baselines**.

Need constructive approaches.**\n\n## Available Pre-optimized Resources\nBest pre-optimized CSVs:\n- `/home/nonroot/snapshots/santa-2025/21116303805/code/preoptimized/santa-2025-csv/santa-2025.csv` (~70.676)\n- `/home/nonroot/snapshots/santa-2025/21116303805/code/preoptimized/bucket-of-chump/submission.csv`\n- `/home/nonroot/snapshots/santa-2025/21116303805/code/preoptimized/best_ensemble.csv`\n- bbox3 binary: `/home/nonroot/snapshots/santa-2025/21116303805/code/preoptimized/bbox3`\n\n## MANDATORY FIRST EXPERIMENT: Baseline Verification\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport shutil\n\n# Copy best pre-optimized\nsrc = '/home/nonroot/snapshots/santa-2025/21116303805/code/preoptimized/santa-2025-csv/santa-2025.csv'\nshutil.copy(src, 'submission.csv')\n\n# Verify score ~70.676\n```\n\n## Approaches That MUST Be Tried (Priority Order)\n\n### 1. External Dataset Search (HIGHEST PRIORITY)\nTop teams (68.9 score) likely have better pre-optimized solutions.\n```bash\nkaggle datasets list -s \"santa 2025\" --sort-by votes\n```\n\n### 2. Bottom-Left Constructive Heuristic with Beam Search\nResearch shows bottom-left placement is highly effective for irregular packing:\n```python\ndef bottom_left_beam_search(n_trees, beam_width=20):\n    \"\"\"Build configuration using bottom-left placement with beam search\"\"\"\n    states = [{'trees': [], 'polygons': []}]\n    \n    for tree_idx in range(n_trees):\n        candidates = []\n        for state in states:\n            # Try multiple angles\n            for angle in np.linspace(0, 360, 72):\n                # Find bottom-left valid position\n                pos = find_bottom_left_position(state['polygons'], angle)\n                if pos:\n                    new_state = add_tree(state, pos, angle)\n                    score = compute_bounding_side(new_state['polygons'])\n                    candidates.append((score, new_state))\n        \n        # Keep top beam_width states\n        candidates.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])\n        states = [c[1] for c in candidates[:beam_width]]\n    \n    return min(states, key=lambda s: compute_score(s))\n```\n\n### 3. DJD Selection Heuristic (From Research)\nThe Djang-Finch heuristic outperforms conventional selection for irregular packing:\n- Sort pieces by size/shape characteristics\n- Use placement heuristic (bottom-left or jostle)\n- Apply local refinement after construction\n\n### 4. Jostle-Style Moves\nResearch shows jostle moves (swap + rotate) significantly improve density:\n```python\ndef jostle_optimization(config, iterations=1000):\n    \"\"\"Apply jostle moves to improve packing\"\"\"\n    for _ in range(iterations):\n        # Try swapping two trees\n        i, j = random.sample(range(len(config)), 2)\n        new_config = swap_trees(config, i, j)\n        if valid(new_config) and score(new_config) < score(config):\n            config = new_config\n        \n        # Try rotating a tree\n        i = random.randint(0, len(config)-1)\n        for delta_angle in [5, -5, 10, -10, 45, -45]:\n            new_config = rotate_tree(config, i, delta_angle)\n            if valid(new_config) and score(new_config) < score(config):\n                config = new_config\n                break\n    return config\n```\n\n### 5. Random Multi-Start Construction\nGenerate many random configurations and keep best:\n```python\ndef random_construction(n_trees, num_restarts=1000):\n    best_config = None\n    best_score = float('inf')\n    \n    for restart in range(num_restarts):\n        config = build_random_config(n_trees)\n        if config and not has_overlap(config):\n            score = compute_side(config)**2 / n_trees\n            if score < best_score:\n                best_score = score\n                best_config = config\n    \n    return best_config\n```\n\n### 6. Per-N Independent Optimization\nFor each N from 1 to 200:\n- Try 10+ different construction strategies\n- Use different seed angles (0\u00b0, 30\u00b0, 45\u00b0, 60\u00b0, 90\u00b0)\n- Try different placement orders (center-out, spiral, random)\n\n### 7. Corner Extraction from Larger N\nExtract subsets from larger configurations:\n```python\ndef corner_extraction(source_n, target_n):\n    \"\"\"Try using corners of N=source_n for N=target_n\"\"\"\n    source_trees = load_config(source_n)\n    corner_trees = get_boundary_trees(source_trees)\n    for subset in combinations(corner_trees, target_n):\n        if not has_overlap(subset):\n            score = compute_score(subset)\n            # Compare with current best\n```\n\n## Key Techniques from Top Kernels\n\n### bbox3 C++ Optimizer\n```cpp\n// Key parameters\nconstexpr double NEIGHBOR_RADIUS = 0.5;\nconstexpr double PIVOT_ANGLE_MAX = 10.0;\nconstexpr double GLOBAL_TENSION_STRENGTH = 0.05;\n// Run: ./bbox3 -n <iterations> -r <restarts>\n```\n\n### tree_packer_v21 C++ Optimizer\n```cpp\n// Key operations:\n// 1. Squeeze: scale 0.9995 to 0.98 toward center\n// 2. Compaction: move trees toward center\n// 3. Local search: 8 directions + rotations\n// 4. Swap moves: exchange positions\n// 5. Multi-start: different initial angles\n```\n\n### fix_direction Rotation Optimization\n```python\nfrom scipy.optimize import minimize_scalar\nfrom scipy.spatial import ConvexHull\n\ndef optimize_rotation(trees):\n    \"\"\"Rotate entire config to minimize bounding box\"\"\"\n    points = get_all_vertices(trees)\n    hull_points = points[ConvexHull(points).vertices]\n    \n    def bbox_at_angle(angle):\n        rotated = rotate_points(hull_points, angle)\n        return max(rotated.max(0) - rotated.min(0))\n    \n    result = minimize_scalar(bbox_at_angle, bounds=(0, 90), method='bounded')\n    return result.x, result.fun\n```\n\n## Validation Requirements\n- All trees must not overlap (intersect but not touch is OK)\n- Coordinates must be in range [-100, 100]\n- Format: `id,x,y,deg` with 's' prefix on values\n\n## Scoring Function\n```python\ndef compute_total_score(df):\n    total = 0\n    for n in range(1, 201):\n        trees = load_trees_for_n(df, n)\n        side = compute_bounding_box_side(trees)\n        total += side**2 / n\n    return total\n```\n\n## Overlap Detection (Fast)\n```python\nfrom shapely.geometry import Polygon\nfrom shapely.strtree import STRtree\n\ndef has_overlap(trees):\n    polygons = [create_tree_polygon(t) for t in trees]\n    tree_index = STRtree(polygons)\n    \n    for i, poly in enumerate(polygons):\n        candidates = tree_index.query(poly)\n        for j in candidates:\n            if i != j and poly.intersects(polygons[j]) and not poly.touches(polygons[j]):\n                return True\n    return False\n```\n\n## Recommended Experiment Order\n\n1. **001_baseline**: Load best pre-optimized CSV, verify score ~70.676\n2. **002_dataset_search**: Search for external datasets with better solutions\n3. **003_ensemble**: Combine all available sources, pick best per-N\n4. **004_bottom_left_beam**: Bottom-left construction with beam search\n5. **005_random_multi**: Random construction with 1000+ restarts per N\n6. **006_jostle**: Apply jostle moves to best configurations\n7. **007_corner_extract**: Systematic corner extraction search\n\n## DO NOT WASTE TIME ON:\n- More SA iterations on pre-optimized solutions\n- Different SA parameters (temperature, cooling rate)\n- Backward propagation from pre-optimized\n- Lattice-based construction (produces worse results)\n- Local search variants on pre-optimized\n\n## FOCUS ON:\n- Finding better external pre-optimized solutions\n- Constructive approaches (bottom-left, beam search)\n- Random initialization with many restarts\n- Jostle-style moves (swap + rotate)\n- Ensemble of diverse construction methods\n\n## Key Files\n- Sample submission: `/home/data/sample_submission.csv`\n- Pre-optimized: `/home/nonroot/snapshots/santa-2025/21116303805/code/preoptimized/`\n- bbox3 binary: Copy from pre-optimized directory\n",

Extract and compile the C++ SA optimizer from Jonathan Chan's kernel\n2. Run it on our current best submission\n3. Apply fractional translation refinement\n4. Submit the result to verify improvement\n\n## CRITICAL: Previous experiments showed SA on pre-optimized = 0 improvement\nThe strategy document notes that previous runs showed SA, backward propagation, and C++ optimizers produced 0 improvement on pre-optimized solutions. This suggests:\n1. The pre-optimized solutions are already at local optima\n2. We need CONSTRUCTIVE approaches that find different basins\n3. Focus on small N (1-20) where efficiency is worst and construction might find better solutions\n4. Try lattice-based construction for large N\n\n## Alternative Next Experiment: 002_small_n_construction\nIf C++ optimizer shows 0 improvement, pivot to:\n1. Implement bottom-left beam search for N=1-20\n2. Try multiple random constructions with different starting configurations\n3. Use jostle moves (swap + rotate) to escape local optima",

      "feedback": "## What I Understood\n\nThe junior researcher completed the first baseline experiment for the Santa 2025 Christmas Tree Packing challenge. Their goal was to establish a baseline by loading and comparing all available pre-optimized CSV files from various sources (snapshots, external Kaggle datasets). They found the best available score is 70.659959 from the saspav/santa-2025-csv dataset, which is 1.74 points away from the target of 68.919154. They also attempted to create an ensemble by picking the best configuration per N from all sources, but it matched the saspav score exactly.\n\n## Technical Execution Assessment\n\n**Validation**: The scoring function implementation is correct - it computes the bounding box side for each N configuration and calculates score = side\u00b2/n, then sums across all N from 1 to 200. The code properly handles the 's' prefix in the CSV values.\n\n**Leakage Risk**: None - this is a pure optimization problem, not a prediction task. No leakage concerns apply.\n\n**Score Integrity**: \u2705 Verified in notebook output. Multiple sources were tested:\n- santa-2025.csv: 70.676102\n- best_ensemble.csv: 70.676102  \n- bucket-of-chump: 70.676501\n- saspav external dataset: 70.659959 (best)\n- Ensemble of all sources: 70.659959 (matches best single source)\n\n**Code Quality**: Good. The notebook is well-structured with clear comments. The scoring function is correctly implemented. The ensemble approach correctly picks the best configuration per N.\n\nVerdict: **TRUSTWORTHY** - The baseline is correctly established and the score is verified.\n\n## Strategic Assessment\n\n**Approach Fit**: \u2705 Appropriate for a first experiment. Establishing a baseline from existing pre-optimized solutions is the right starting point. The strategy document correctly identifies that this is a 2D geometric packing optimization problem.\n\n**Effort Allocation**: The baseline experiment is efficient - it quickly surveys available resources and establishes the gap to target. However, the experiment notes reveal a critical insight from previous work: **pre-optimized solutions are at local optima** - SA, backward propagation, lattice construction, and C++ optimizers showed 0 improvement.\n\n**Assumptions Being Made**:\n1. The best public pre-optimized solutions are the best available starting point\n2. The gap of 1.74 points can be closed through optimization\n3. The ensemble approach (picking best per-N) is optimal\n\n**Blind Spots - CRITICAL**:\n\n1. **No LB submission yet**: With 95 submissions remaining, the team should submit the baseline to verify the local score matches LB. This is essential for this type of optimization competition.\n\n2. **The 1.74 point gap is SIGNIFICANT**: The discussions mention teams achieving 67-68 scores. The gap suggests the top teams have fundamentally different approaches, not just better optimization of the same solutions.\n\n3. **Key techniques from kernels not yet explored**:\n   - `fix_direction` rotation optimization (from saspav kernel) - rotates entire configurations to minimize bounding box\n   - `bbox3` C++ optimizer with simulated annealing, fluid dynamics, hinge pivot\n   - `tree_packer_v21` with squeeze, compaction, swap moves\n   - These are all available in the snapshots but haven't been run yet\n\n4. **Discussion insights not leveraged**:\n   - \"Why the winning solutions will be Asymmetric\" - suggests symmetric solutions have limits\n   - \"Symmetric solutions that are apparently optimal\" - 42 votes, important insight\n   - \"Efficient basin search\" - suggests different initialization strategies matter\n\n**Trajectory**: This is experiment 001 - the trajectory is just starting. The baseline is solid, but the real work begins now.\n\n## What's Working\n\n1. \u2705 Correct scoring function implementation\n2. \u2705 Comprehensive survey of available pre-optimized solutions\n3. \u2705 Ensemble approach correctly implemented (though it didn't improve over best single source)\n4. \u2705 Clear documentation of the gap to target (1.74 points)\n5. \u2705 Strategy document correctly identifies that local search on pre-optimized solutions doesn't work\n\n## Key Concerns\n\n### 1. No LB Submission Yet\n- **Observation**: 0 submissions made, 95 remaining today\n- **Why it matters**: For optimization competitions, verifying local score matches LB is critical. There could be precision issues, validation differences, or other surprises.\n- **Suggestion**: Submit the baseline immediately to establish LB correlation.\n\n### 2. The Gap Requires Fundamentally Different Approaches\n- **Observation**: Gap of 1.74 points (70.66 vs 68.92 target). Previous experiments showed 0 improvement from local search methods.\n- **Why it matters**: The top teams (68.9 score) are using approaches that produce fundamentally better configurations, not just better-optimized versions of the same configurations.\n- **Suggestion**: Focus on:\n  a) **Constructive heuristics**: Bottom-left beam search, random multi-start construction\n  b) **Different initialization strategies**: The \"basin search\" discussion suggests this matters\n  c) **Asymmetric solutions**: The discussion \"Why winning solutions will be Asymmetric\" has 33 votes\n\n### 3. Available Tools Not Yet Utilized\n- **Observation**: bbox3 binary and fix_direction code are available but not run\n- **Why it matters**: These tools might squeeze out small improvements, and more importantly, running them will confirm whether the solutions are truly at local optima\n- **Suggestion**: Run bbox3 with different parameters (-n 1000 -r 96) on the current best solution to verify it's at local optimum. Also apply fix_direction rotation optimization.\n\n### 4. Per-N Analysis Missing\n- **Observation**: The ensemble picked best per-N but all came from the same source (saspav)\n- **Why it matters**: Understanding which N values have the most room for improvement could focus optimization efforts\n- **Suggestion**: Analyze score contribution by N. Larger N values contribute more to total score (more trees = larger bounding boxes). Focus optimization on high-N configurations.\n\n## Top Priority for Next Experiment\n\n**SUBMIT THE BASELINE TO LEADERBOARD IMMEDIATELY**, then focus on **constructive approaches** rather than local search optimization.\n\nSpecifically:\n1. **Submit baseline** (candidate_000.csv) to verify LB score matches local score of 70.659959\n2. **Implement bottom-left beam search construction** - research shows this is highly effective for irregular packing\n3. **Try random multi-start construction** with 1000+ restarts per N\n4. **Analyze per-N score contributions** to identify which configurations have the most room for improvement\n\nThe key insight from the strategy document is correct: **local search methods DO NOT WORK on pre-optimized baselines**. The team needs constructive approaches that can find different basins of attraction, not better optimization of existing solutions.\n\nThe target of 68.919154 is achievable - teams have reached 67-68 scores according to discussions. The path forward is through fundamentally different construction methods, not incremental optimization.\n",

      "feedback": "## What I Understood\n\nThe junior researcher conducted experiment 002 to test the C++ SA optimizer from Jonathan Chan's kernel on the pre-optimized solution. The hypothesis was to verify whether the pre-optimized solution is truly at a local optimum (as suggested by previous experiments). They successfully compiled and ran the optimizer, which confirmed 0 improvement after 132 seconds of optimization. They also performed a valuable per-N efficiency analysis showing that N=1 has the worst efficiency (0.529) while large N values (150-200) have the best efficiency (~1.05).\n\n## Technical Execution Assessment\n\n**Validation**: \u2705 Sound. The scoring function is correctly implemented (side\u00b2/n summed over all N). The C++ optimizer was properly compiled and executed with reasonable parameters (-n 5000, -r 3).\n\n**Leakage Risk**: None - this is a pure optimization problem with no train/test split concerns.\n\n**Score Integrity**: \u2705 Verified. The optimizer output clearly shows:\n- Initial: 70.659959\n- Final: 70.659959\n- Improvement: 0.000000 (0.00%)\n\nThe LB submission from exp_000 confirmed perfect calibration: CV=70.659959, LB=70.659959225347.\n\n**Code Quality**: Good. The notebook handles the GLIBC incompatibility of the pre-compiled bbox3 binary by extracting and compiling the C++ code from the kernel. The code properly removes the Jupyter magic (`%%writefile`) before compilation.\n\nVerdict: **TRUSTWORTHY** - Results are reliable and confirm the hypothesis.\n\n## Strategic Assessment\n\n**Approach Fit**: \u2705 This experiment was appropriate to verify the local optimum hypothesis. The result confirms that local search methods (SA, fractional translation) cannot improve the pre-optimized solution. This is valuable information that validates the strategy document's assertion.\n\n**Effort Allocation**: The experiment was efficient - it took ~2 minutes of optimizer runtime and provided clear confirmation. However, the team is now at a critical decision point: **local search is exhausted, constructive approaches are needed**.\n\n**Assumptions Being Validated**:\n1. \u2705 Pre-optimized solutions are at local optima - CONFIRMED\n2. \u2705 LB matches CV - CONFIRMED (perfect calibration)\n3. \u26a0\ufe0f The gap of 1.74 points requires fundamentally different approaches - NEEDS ACTION\n\n**Blind Spots - CRITICAL**:\n\n1. **No constructive approaches tried yet**: The strategy document clearly states that constructive heuristics (bottom-left beam search, random multi-start construction) are needed, but none have been implemented. This is the highest priority gap.\n\n2. **Per-N analysis reveals optimization targets**: The analysis shows:\n   - N=1-20: Avg efficiency 0.62, contributes 11.4% of score\n   - N=151-200: Avg efficiency 0.73, contributes 23.8% of score\n   - **Key insight**: Improving large N values has more impact on total score\n\n3. **Discussions not fully leveraged**:\n   - \"Why winning solutions will be Asymmetric\" (33 votes) - suggests symmetric solutions have limits\n   - \"Symmetric solutions that are apparently optimal\" (42 votes) - important geometric insights\n   - \"Efficient basin search\" (7 votes) - different initialization strategies\n   - \"k-mer exploration\" (10 votes) - recent discussion about pattern-based approaches\n\n4. **Available tools not yet explored**:\n   - `fix_direction` rotation optimization (from saspav kernel)\n   - Interactive editor for manual refinement\n   - tree_packer_v21 with different parameters\n\n**Trajectory**: The team has completed the verification phase (2 experiments). The trajectory is correct - they've confirmed the baseline and verified local optimum. **Now is the time to pivot to constructive approaches.**\n\n## What's Working\n\n1. \u2705 Excellent LB calibration (CV matches LB almost exactly)\n2. \u2705 Thorough verification of local optimum hypothesis\n3. \u2705 Good per-N efficiency analysis identifying optimization targets\n4. \u2705 Proper handling of binary compatibility issues (compiling from source)\n5. \u2705 Clear documentation of results and conclusions\n\n## Key Concerns\n\n### 1. No Constructive Approaches Implemented Yet (CRITICAL)\n- **Observation**: Two experiments have verified the baseline and local optimum, but no constructive approaches have been tried.\n- **Why it matters**: The strategy document and discussions clearly indicate that local search cannot close the 1.74 point gap. Top teams (68.9 score) are using fundamentally different construction methods.\n- **Suggestion**: Immediately implement one of:\n  a) **Bottom-left beam search construction** - research shows this is highly effective for irregular packing\n  b) **Random multi-start construction** with 1000+ restarts per N\n  c) **Lattice-based construction** with 2-4 tree repeating blocks (mentioned in discussions)\n\n### 2. Focus on High-Impact N Values\n- **Observation**: N=151-200 contributes 23.8% of total score with avg efficiency 0.73\n- **Why it matters**: Improving large N configurations has more impact than small N\n- **Suggestion**: When implementing constructive approaches, prioritize N > 100 for maximum score improvement\n\n### 3. Discussion Insights Not Leveraged\n- **Observation**: Key discussions mention lattice-based approaches, asymmetric solutions, and k-mer patterns\n- **Why it matters**: Top teams are using these techniques to achieve 67-68 scores\n- **Suggestion**: Read and implement insights from:\n  - \"Why winning solutions will be Asymmetric\" - try non-symmetric configurations\n  - \"k-mer exploration\" - pattern-based construction\n  - \"Efficient basin search\" - different initialization strategies\n\n### 4. Submissions Budget Underutilized\n- **Observation**: 1/100 submissions used, 94 remaining today\n- **Why it matters**: Submissions are valuable for validating improvements\n- **Suggestion**: Use submissions strategically to test promising constructive approaches\n\n## Top Priority for Next Experiment\n\n**IMPLEMENT A CONSTRUCTIVE APPROACH - specifically bottom-left beam search or random multi-start construction.**\n\nThe verification phase is complete. The team has confirmed:\n1. Best available pre-optimized score: 70.659959\n2. LB matches CV perfectly\n3. Local search cannot improve the solution\n\nThe path forward is clear: **constructive heuristics that can find different basins of attraction**. The strategy document outlines several approaches:\n\n1. **Bottom-left beam search** (RECOMMENDED FIRST):\n   - For each N, try multiple starting angles (0\u00b0, 30\u00b0, 45\u00b0, 60\u00b0, 90\u00b0)\n   - Use beam width of 10-20 to explore multiple configurations\n   - Keep best configuration per N\n\n2. **Random multi-start construction**:\n   - Generate 1000+ random valid configurations per N\n   - Keep the best one\n   - Can be parallelized for speed\n\n3. **Lattice-based construction** (from discussions):\n   - Use 2-4 tree repeating blocks\n   - Particularly effective for large N values\n\nThe target of 68.919154 is achievable - teams have reached 67-68 scores. The gap of 1.74 points (~2.5%) requires finding better basins of attraction, not optimizing within the current basin.\n\n**Time is valuable** - with 94 submissions remaining and the verification phase complete, focus all effort on constructive approaches that can produce fundamentally better configurations.\n",
