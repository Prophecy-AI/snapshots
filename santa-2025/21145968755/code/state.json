Because the problem is combinatorial and NP\u2011hard, researchers rely on a mix of exact, approximation, heuristic and meta\u2011heuristic methods to obtain high\u2011quality solutions in reasonable time\u202f([frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmech.2022.966691/full)).\n\nThe most effective practical approaches combine a fast constructive phase with powerful improvement phases.  Classical constructive heuristics such as the **bottom\u2011left (BL) placement** and **shelf\u2011packing** schemes provide quick initial layouts; recent work shows that sorting polygons by height and orientation before applying shelf packing yields improved approximation guarantees for convex polygons\u202f([export.arxiv.org](https://export.arxiv.org/pdf/2308.08523v1.pdf)).
