## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.659958593 from exp_011 (Long bbox3 Multi-Phase)
- Best LB score: 70.6600 (verified - 6 submissions all at ~70.66)
- Target: 68.919154 | Gap to target: 1.74 (2.5%)

## CV-LB Relationship Analysis
- **CV = LB EXACTLY** - This is an optimization problem, not prediction
- No distribution shift - the score is deterministic
- All 12 experiments converge to ~70.66 - STRONG LOCAL OPTIMUM

## Response to Evaluator

The evaluator correctly identified that:
1. **Local optimization has hit a wall** - 12 experiments, all at ~70.66
2. **The target is below public LB best** - We need novel techniques
3. **Small N values have worst efficiency** - N=1-10 contribute 6.1% of score

I AGREE with the evaluator's assessment. We MUST pivot to fundamentally different approaches.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: LOCAL OPTIMIZATION IS EXHAUSTED

**DO NOT TRY:**
- ❌ More SA iterations (already tried 250k+)
- ❌ Different SA parameters (already tried multiple)
- ❌ bbox3 with different n/r values (already tried 15+ combinations)
- ❌ Rotation optimization (baseline already optimal)
- ❌ Tree removal (no improvement)
- ❌ Ensembling existing solutions (no valid sources better than baseline)

**MUST TRY:**
- ✅ Genetic Algorithm with crossover of configurations
- ✅ Basin Hopping (random perturbations + local opt)
- ✅ CP-SAT for small N values (exact solver)
- ✅ Different initial configurations (not starting from saspav)

## Recommended Approaches (Priority Order)

### 1. **[HIGHEST PRIORITY] Genetic Algorithm for Packing**

Implement a GA that:
1. **Population**: Start with multiple configurations per N
   - Current best (saspav baseline)
   - Random perturbations of best
   - Lattice-based configurations
   
2. **Crossover**: Combine tree positions from two parents
   - Take trees 1-k from parent A, trees k+1-n from parent B
   - Repair overlaps after crossover
   
3. **Mutation**: Small random perturbations
   - Move a random tree by small delta
   - Rotate a random tree by small angle
   
4. **Selection**: Keep best configurations
   - Tournament selection
   - Elitism (always keep best)
   
5. **Local optimization**: Apply bbox3 to refine after crossover

**Focus on N=1-50 first** - These have worst efficiency and contribute 26.9% of total score.

### 2. **[HIGH PRIORITY] Basin Hopping**

For each N value:
1. Start from current best configuration
2. Apply random perturbation (move all trees by random delta)
3. Run local optimization (bbox3)
4. If better, accept. If worse, accept with probability exp(-delta/T)
5. Repeat for many iterations

### 3. **[MEDIUM PRIORITY] CP-SAT for Small N**

For N=1-20:
1. Discretize the search space (grid of possible positions)
2. Add non-overlap constraints
3. Minimize bounding box side length
4. Use Google OR-Tools CP-SAT solver
