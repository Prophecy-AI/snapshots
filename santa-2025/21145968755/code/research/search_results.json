      "text": "Top\u2011scoring submissions rely on carefully engineered geometric lattices rather than generic learning\u2011based methods.  In the competition discussion, a participant noted that a simple \u201calternating\u2011up\u2011and\u2011down\u201d lattice of two trees already pushes the score just above\u202f74, showing how much of the gain comes from the basic packing pattern itself\u202f([kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/santa-2025/discussion/665669)).  To break the 69\u2011point barrier, the leading teams extend this idea by constructing larger repeating units (e.g., 3\u2011 or 4\u2011tree blocks) that fit together without gaps, and they fine\u2011tune the orientation and offset of each block with deterministic search heuristics (simulated\u2011annealing\u2011style or greedy local\u2011search) that explore the combinatorial space far more efficiently than random trial\u2011and\u2011error.\n\nThe community also agrees that reinforcement\u2011learning approaches have not been competitive for this problem; a Medium post explicitly calls out RL as \u201cfailing\u201d for Santa\u202f2025, which has pushed teams toward classic combinatorial\u2011optimization techniques such as branch\u2011and\u2011bound, integer\u2011programming relaxations, and custom geometric heuristics\u202f([medium.com](https://hmnshudhmn24.medium.com/kaggle-santa-2025-why-reinforcement-learning-is-failing-087f3f04fa97)).  By combining dense lattice designs with fast, deterministic search or exact solvers, the best teams consistently achieve normalized\u2011area scores below\u202f69.",

We expect a fun puzzle. We get a nightmare of Combinatorial Optimization.\nThis year\u2019s edition,**\u201cSanta 2025: The Christmas Tree Packing Challenge,\u201d**is no exception. The goal? Pack $N$ irregular \u201cTree Polygons\u201d into the smallest possible square bounding box for $N=1$ to $200$.\nIf you checked the leaderboard today (Dec 21), you noticed a trend:**Reinforcement Learning (RL) is getting crushed.**\nDespite the massive hype around \u201cReasoning Models\u201d and PPO agents this year, the top 100 teams aren\u2019t using neural networks. They are using 1980s physics simulations. Here is why the \u201cOld School\u201d is winning, and how the pros are using LLMs to cheat the system.\n## The Problem: Why RL Hates \u201cPacking\u201d\nOn paper, this looks like a game.*Place a tree, check for overlap, repeat.*Perfect for a DQN agent, right?\nWrong. The geometry kills the gradient.\n1. **Continuous Precision:**The leaderboard metric cares about floating-point precision to the 6th decimal. RL agents (which output discrete actions or probability distributions) struggle to make the \u201cmicro-adjustments\u201d needed to squeeze a tree into a 0.001mm gap.\n2. **The \u201cCollision\u201d Cliff:**In packing, a move is either valid (reward = 1) or it overlaps by a pixel (reward = -100). This sparse, binary feedback loop makes it nearly impossible for an agent to \u201clearn\u201d a gradient. It doesn\u2019t know*how*to fix the overlap, just that it failed.## The Solution: Simulated Annealing (on Steroids)\nThe \u201cSecret Sauce\u201d currently dominating the leaderboard is**Simulated Annealing (SA)**combined with**Lattice Generation**.\nInstead of training a model to*predict*the position, teams are writing physics engines that*shake*the box.\n* **High Temperature:**Randomly spin and throw trees into the box (Explorer Phase).\n* **Low Temperature:**Jiggle the trees by microscopic amounts to resolve collisions (Exploiter Phase).\nThe best solutions right now use a \u201cHybrid\u201d strategy:\n* **N &lt; 58:**Use Simulated Annealing to find unstructured, chaotic packings.\n* **N &gt; 58:**Switch to \u201cCrystalline Packing\u201d (regular geometric lattices) which is mathematically superior for large numbers.## The Twist: How LLMs are Actually Helping\nIf RL is dead, where is the AI?\nTop competitors aren\u2019t using LLMs to*solve*the puzzle; they are using LLMs to**write the solver**.\nPython is too slow for 10 billion annealing steps. The meta this year is to prompt Gemini 3 or Claude to:\n\u201cRewrite this Python overlap-check function in Rust/C++ with AVX2 vectorization.\u201d\nWe are seeing \u201cHybrid\u201d workflows where the**Human**defines the heuristics, the**LLM**writes the highly optimized C++ kernels, and**Simulated Annealing**does the heavy lifting.\n## The Starter Code: A Simple Annealer\nIf you want to jump in before the January deadline, don\u2019t start with PyTorch. Start here.\nHere is a conceptual snippet for a \u201cPerturbation\u201d mover \u2014the heart of any good annealing solution.\n```\nimport numpy as np\nimport math\ndef anneal(layout, max\\_temps=10000):\n# layout: Array of [x, y, rotation] for N trees\ncurrent\\_score = calculate\\_area(layout)\ntemperature = 1.0\ncooling\\_rate = 0.9995\nfor i in range(max\\_temps):\n# 1.

      "text": "[iframe](about:blank)\n\nTable of Contents\n\nExpand\n\nTable of Contents\n\n- [The Christmas Tree Options Strategy](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/christmastree.asp#toc-what-is-a-christmas-tree-options-strategy)\n\n- [How Christmas Trees Work](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/christmastree.asp#toc-how-christmas-trees-work)\n\n- [Examples](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/christmastree.asp#toc-examples)\n\n\nClose\n\n## What Is a Christmas Tree Options Strategy?\n\nA Christmas tree is an [options trading](https://www.investopedia.com/options-basics-tutorial-4583012) spread strategy achieved by buying and selling six call (or six put) options with different strikes but the same expiration dates for a neutral to bullish forecast. When using calls, the strategy is termed a long call Christmas tree. It is a put Christmas tree when the trader uses put options.\n\nThe strategy is available long (bullish) or short (bearish).\n\nThis spread is essentially the combination of a long vertical spread and two short vertical spreads.\n\n### Key Takeaways\n\n- A Christmas tree is an options spread strategy that involves 6 call (or put) options: buying one ATM call (put) selling 3x calls (puts) two strikes out of the money and then buy 2x more call (put) three strikes out of the money.\n- This strategy pays off with a neutral to slightly bullish outcome in the underlying security.\n- Christmas trees can be constructed with either all calls or all puts and may be structured as either long or short.\n\n## How Christmas Trees Work\n\nThe Christmas tree name comes from the strategy's very loose resemblance to a tree when viewed on an options chain display. The connection is tenuous at best.\n\nChristmas trees are similar to [butterfly spreads](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/butterflyspread.asp) in that they use multiple [vertical spreads](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/verticalspread.asp) to box in a desired potential return. The difference is that one of the strike prices is skipped, which introduces a directional bias.\n\nFor instance, if a condor spread involved the 50-55-60-65 strikes, the corresponding Christmas tree would involve just the 50-55-65 strikes (skipping the 60 strike).\n\nThe regular, or long Christmas tree with calls (sometimes referred to simply as a \"call tree\"), involves buying one call option with an [at-the-money](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/atthemoney.asp) strike, skipping the next strike, and then selling three options with the following strike. Finally, buy two more calls with the next higher strike. The 1-3-2 structure supposedly appears as a tree.\n\nThe strategy profits from a small increase in the price of the underlying asset and maxes when the underlying closes at the middle option strike price at options expiration.\n\n- Maximum profit equals middle [strike](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/strikeprice.asp) minus lower strike minus the premium.\n- Maximum loss is the net debit paid for the strategy.\n- Breakeven occurs at the lowest strike plus the premium paid or the highest strike minus half the premium.\n\nTime decay is on the holder's side as the holder wants all options except the lowest to expire worthless.\n\n## Examples\n\n### Long Christmas Tree With Calls\n\nFor example, with the underlying asset at $50.00:\n\n- Buy 1 call strike price 50.00\n- Sell 3 calls strike price 54.00\n- Buy 2 calls strike price 56.00\n\n### Long Christmas Tree With Puts\n\nWith this strategy, the holder is neutral to bearish. Sometimes referred to simply as a \"put tree.\"\n\n- Buy 1 put strike price 50.00\n- Sell 3 puts strike price 46.00\n- Buy 2 puts strike price 44.00\n\nMaximum profit is at an underlying asset price of 48.00 at expiration.\n\n- Maximum profit equals middle strike minus higher strike minus the premium.\n- Maximum loss is the net debit paid for the strategy.\n- Breakeven occurs at the lower strike plus half the premium paid or the highest strike minus the premium.\n\nMaximum loss is the premium paid to initiate the strategy.\n\n### Short Christmas Tree With Calls\n\nShort strategies should result in a net credit to the account when initiated. This strategy profits when the underlying asset moves by a minimum direction in either direction but it is capped. The bias is bearish because it does not take much of a move lower in the underlying asset to make the strategy profitable. However, a larger move higher may also result in a profit.\n\n- Sell 1 call strike price 50.00\n- Buy 3 calls strike price 54.00\n- Sell 2 calls strike price 56.00\n\nThe maximum profit is the net credit received.\n\n### Short Christmas Tree With Puts\n\nThis strategy results in a net credit to the account and profits when the underlying moves by a minimum in either direction. Profits come quicker with a smaller upside move although a larger downside move would also be profitable. Therefore, this strategy leans bullish.\n\n- Sell 1 put strike price 50.00\n- Buy 3 puts strike price 46.00\n- Sell 2 puts strike price 44.00\n\nThe maximum profit is the net credit received.\n\nTake the Next Step to Invest\n\nAdvertiser Disclosure\n\n\u00d7\n\nThe offers that appear in this table are from partnerships from which Investopedia receives compensation.

Participants are tasked with determining the optimal way to pack Christmas tree toys into the smallest possible square box, allowing Santa Claus to mail them efficiently around the globe. The challenge is to find the dimensions of the smallest square box that can fit between 1 to 200 trees.\nThe competition is designed to encourage innovation and problem-solving skills, with a focus on packing efficiency. Participants are encouraged to submit their solutions, which will be evaluated based on the normalized area of the square bounding box for each puzzle configuration.\n### Description\nThe challenge is inspired by Santa&#x27;s need for the smallest box to fit all the tiny trees for his Christmas deliveries. Participants are required to find the best packing solution to help Santa Claus and win the competition&#x27;s prize.\n### Evaluation\nSubmissions are evaluated on the sum of the normalized area of the square bounding box for each puzzle. The formula for the score is:\n```\n`score = \u2211(sn^2/n)`\n```\nwhere`sn`is the side of the square box bounding the trees and`n`is the total number of trees in the configuration.\n### Submission File\nEach submission must include the tree position (`x`,`y`) and rotation (`deg`) for each`id`in the submission. The values must be converted to a string and prepended with an`s`before submission. Submissions with overlapping trees will result in an error. Location values must be constrained to -100 \u2264x, y \u2264100.\nThe file should have the following format:\n```\n`id,x,y,deg\n001\\_0,s0.0,s0.0,s20.411299\n002\\_0,s0.0,s0.0,s20.411299\n002\\_1,s-0.541068,s0.259317,s51.66348\netc.`\n```\n### Timeline\n* **November 17, 2025**: Start Date\n* **January 23, 2026**: Entry Deadline\n* **January 23, 2026**: Team Merger Deadline\n* **January 30, 2026**: Final Submission Deadline\nAll deadlines are at 11:59 PM UTC unless otherwise noted.\n### Prizes\n* **First Prize**: $12,000\n* **Second Prize**: $10,000\n* **Third Prize**: $10,000\n* **Fourth Prize**: $8,000\nAdditionally, a**Rudolph Prize**of $10,000 is awarded to the team holding 1st place on the leaderboard for the longest period of time between November 17, 2025, and January 30, 2026.\n### Citation\nWalter Reade and Ashley Oldacre.

The final solution is evaluated by an ensemble score that combines all cases.\n**Notebook Link**:[Santa 2025 - Christmas Tree Packing Challenge V1](https://www.kaggle.com/code/adityapawar327/santa-2025-christmas-tree-packing-challenge-v1)\n**Public Score**: 85.92\n## Table of Contents\n[](#table-of-contents)\n* Library Imports and Environment Setup\n* Global Configuration and Precision Settings\n* ChristmasTree Class Definition\n* Utility Functions (Scoring/Collision)\n* Simulated Annealing Algorithm (N &lt; 20)\n* Grid Search Algorithm (N &gt;= 20)\n* Hybrid &amp; Ensemble Solvers\n* Main Computation Loop (N = 1 to 200)\n* Submission Formatting and Export\n## Methodology\n[](#methodology)\n* **Small N (&lt; 20):**Uses Simulated Annealing for efficient search in small configuration spaces.\n* **Large N (&gt;= 20):**Uses a tailored Grid Search for tractable solution space exploration.\n* **Hybrid/Ensemble:**Runs multiple seeds and chooses the best solution for each N.\n* **Collision Detection:**Employs Shapely geometry operations to prevent tree overlap.\n* **Performance:**Code leverages parallelization (`ProcessPoolExecutor`) and high-precision (Decimal) arithmetic.\n## Usage\n[](#usage)\n1. Install dependencies:\n* `shapely`,`numpy`,`pandas`,`matplotlib`,`tqdm`\n* Run the notebook or script sequentially to output results and save a`submission.csv`.\n* Check the score on important N cases (e.g., 1, 10, 25, 50, 100, 150, 200).\n## Output\n[](#output)\n* The notebook prints key logs during computation.\n* A`submission.csv`is generated with columns:`id`,`x`,`y`,`deg`(example row:`001\\_0, s-9.146226, s-0.12832, s-224.999647`).\n## License\n[](#license)\nThis project is released under the[Apache 2.0 License](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).\n## Author\n[](#author)\nAditya Pawar ([Kaggle Profile](https://www.kaggle.com/adityapawar327))\nFor questions or collaboration, feel free to reach out via Kaggle discussions or connect on[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adityapawar327).\n## About\nIn this re-defined optimization problem, help Santa fit Christmas tree toys into the smallest (2-dimension) parcel size possible so that ...",
