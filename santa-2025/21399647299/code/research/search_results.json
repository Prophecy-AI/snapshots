Introduction\n\nIrregular shape packing is a classic challenge in operation research, with significant implications for various applications such as texture atlas generation and material utilization in manufacturing\u00a0(Wang et\u00a0al., [2021](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib34)). Its NP-hard nature requires practical and effective packing algorithms to optimize space utilization.\n\nTraditional numerical optimization methods are often slow and costly. Recently, learning-based methods have emerged as a promising alternative for irregular packing, mainly using reinforcement learning\u00a0(Xu et\u00a0al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib37); Yang et\u00a0al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib39)).\nAnother promising approach is the diffusion model, which learns geometric relationships from teacher packing examples and establishes a gradient field for all objects, guiding them to move simultaneously\u00a0(Hosseini et\u00a0al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib11); Xue et\u00a0al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib38)).\nIn particular, the work of (Xue et\u00a0al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib38)), namely GFPack, achieves a notable trade-off between computational cost and space utilization, demonstrating scalability in terms of polygon count and generalizability to rectangular container boundaries.\nHowever, it still faces unresolved issues, notably the lack of support for rotation, a relatively high occurrence of object collisions in results, and limited adaptability to arbitrary boundaries.\n\nThe main idea of the learning-based packing framework is to capture the geometric relationships between shapes, which are essential for the gradient computation.\nSuch relationships in latent space encompass multiple facets: the _spatial (position, orientation) relationship_ of the shapes, the _geometric features relationship_ among them, and the _container boundary conditions_ that constrain them.\nHowever, GFPack falls short in fully representing these relationships.\nIt solely focuses on the positional aspect, neglecting orientation, thus hindering rotational capabilities. Furthermore, it relies on PointNeXt\u00a0(Qian et\u00a0al., [2022](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib24)) for geometric feature extraction, ignoring critical details like polygon edges and resulting in a loss of topological and local features.\nThus, we argue that the full potential of gradient learning has not been thoroughly exploited in GFPack.\n\nIn this study, we introduce two primary strategies to tackle the challenge of learning packing policies.\nFirstly, we use a graph to represent each object and encode it with an _attention-based geometric encoder_, which can capture polygonal geometry information effectively.\nSecondly, we design an _attention-based relation encoding_ mechanism to encode intricate relationships both between polygons and among polygons and boundaries, eliminating the need to explicitly represent the relationships with a graph.\nThis attention-based diffusion model enhances the understanding of how objects interact with each other and the boundaries, resulting in superior performance in both training and inference.\nWe also investigate the utilization distribution between the teacher and inference data and design a weighting function to prioritize tighter teacher data during training, confirmed to be effective.\n\nThis paper makes the following contributions:\n\n1. -\n\n\nWe propose GFPack++, a novel packing framework that employs attention-based learning of gradient fields, supporting continuous rotation and enhancing generalization.\n\n2. -\n\n\nAdvancing beyond GFPack, we encapsulate geometric relationships in an attention-based encoder, incorporating mutual spatial (position, orientation) relationships of objects, their geometric features, and container boundary conditions, and a weighting function to facilitate effective learning policies.\n\n3. -\n\n\nGFPack++ achieves superior irregular packing results, demonstrating higher space utilization over several widely used baselines, one order of magnitude faster than the previous diffusion-based method, coupled with promising generalization for arbitrary boundaries.\n\n\n## 2\\. Related Work\n\n#### Traditional packing approaches\n\nTraditional methods usually involve placement optimization and sequence planning ( _c.f_.surveys\u00a0(Bennell and Oliveira, [2009](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib3); Leao et\u00a0al., [2020](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib18))). Most research focuses on placement optimization with heuristic rules (e.g., BL, BLF), NFP-based search\u00a0(Bennell and Song, [2008](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib4)), or mathematical models\u00a0(Hopper and Turton, [2001](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib10)). Novel approaches include SDF-based placement\u00a0(Pan et\u00a0al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib23)) and spectral domain correlation\u00a0(Cui et\u00a0al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib6)), but they only support limited rotations.

Being a joint, combinatorial decision-making problem involving all patch positions and orientations, this problem has well-known NP-hard complexity. Prior solutions either assume a heuristic packing order or modify the upstream mesh cut and UV mapping to simplify the problem, which either limits the packing ratio or incurs robustness or generality issues. Instead, we introduce a learning-assisted 2D irregular shape packing method that achieves a high packing quality with minimal requirements from the input. Our method iteratively selects and groups subsets of UV patches into near-rectangular super patches, essentially reducing the problem to bin-packing, based on which a joint optimization is employed to further improve the packing ratio. In order to efficiently deal with large problem instances with hundreds of patches, we train deep neural policies to predict nearly rectangular patch subsets and determine their relative poses, leading to linear time scaling with the number of patches. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on three datasets for UV packing, where our method achieves a higher packing ratio over several widely used baselines with competitive computational speed.\n\ngeometry processing, deep reinforcement learning, combinatorial optimization\n\n\u2020\u2020price: 15.00\u2020\u2020copyright: acmlicensed\u2020\u2020journal: TOG\u2020\u2020journalyear: 2023\u2020\u2020journalvolume: 42\u2020\u2020journalnumber: 6\u2020\u2020publicationmonth: 12\u2020\u2020price: 15.00\u2020\u2020doi: 10.1145/3618348\u2020\u2020ccs: Computing methodologies\u00a0Computer graphics\u2020\u2020ccs: Computing methodologies\u00a0Machine learning\n\n|     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![Refer to caption](https://arxiv.org/html/extracted/5118135/fig/fig1/part_model.jpg) | ![Refer to caption](https://arxiv.org/html/extracted/5118135/fig/fig1/part_xatlas_0.698.jpg) | ![Refer to caption](https://arxiv.org/html/extracted/5118135/fig/fig1/part_ours_0.774.jpg) | ![Refer to caption](https://arxiv.org/html/extracted/5118135/fig/fig1/chinsehouse_model.jpg) | ![Refer to caption](https://arxiv.org/html/extracted/5118135/fig/fig1/chinsehouse_xatlas_0.662.jpg) | ![Refer to caption](https://arxiv.org/html/extracted/5118135/fig/fig1/chinsehouse_ours_0.764.jpg) | ![Refer to caption](https://arxiv.org/html/extracted/5118135/fig/fig1/tigerhead_model.jpg) | ![Refer to caption](https://arxiv.org/html/extracted/5118135/fig/fig1/tigerhead_xatlas_0.610.jpg) | ![Refer to caption](https://arxiv.org/html/extracted/5118135/fig/fig1/tigerhead_ours_0.729.jpg) |\n|  | XAtlas pr: 69.8% | Ours pr: 77.4% |  | XAtlas pr: 66.2% | Ours pr: 76.4% |  | XAtlas pr: 61.0% | Ours pr: 72.9% |\n\nFigure 1.

Introduction\n\n2D irregular shape packing lies the theoretical foundation for a wide spectrum of applications across various industrial areas, e.g. material parts assembly\u00a0\\[Ke\net\u00a0al., [2020](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.10329#bib.bib22)\\], VLSI module placements\u00a0\\[Cheng\net\u00a0al., [2005](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.10329#bib.bib8)\\], and 2D shelf arrangements in automatic warehouses\u00a0\\[\u00d6n\u00fct et\u00a0al., [2008](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.10329#bib.bib28)\\]. The most prominent packing application in computer graphics is UV chart packing, where a set of 2D shapes corresponding to patches of 3D models are packed together into a single texture atlas for mapping various appearance details onto the 3D surface for downstream rendering. In the realm of digital games where many 3D models are rendered in the virtual world, improving the UV packing ratio could significantly save the graphical memory, improve the loading speed, and reduce rendering overhead. This problem was recognized decades ago, e.g., by\u00a0Soucy\net\u00a0al. \\[ [1996](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.10329#bib.bib39)\\] and\u00a0Sander\net\u00a0al. \\[ [2001](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.10329#bib.bib33)\\], which has recently revived as an active area of graphic research\u00a0\\[Limper\net\u00a0al., [2018](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.10329#bib.bib24); Liu\net\u00a0al., [2019](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.10329#bib.bib25); Zhang\net\u00a0al., [2020](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.10329#bib.bib47)\\].\n\nAn packing algorithm needs to search for both the position and orientation of each patch. Due to its combinatorial nature, finding optimal 2D shape packing has been well-understood as being NP-complete and APX-hard. Prior research efforts are focused on heuristic or genetic algorithms to determine the order of objects to be packed, and then search for the pose of each shape, e.g., using no-fit polygon (NFP) and the \u201cTetris\u201d algorithm. However, the sub-optimality gap of these heuristics can be substantial. On the other hand, when the problem size is small, globally optimal stochastic optimization algorithms have been proposed to search for the near-optimal packing orders. Although these techniques can scale to tens of 2D shapes, UV unwrapping approaches and commercial 3D modeling software can oftentimes generate hundreds of patches for one 3D model, which is far beyond the capabilities of the global search algorithms.\n\nWe propose a learning-assisted 2D packing pipeline for general irregular-shaped patches. The design of our approach is based on two observations: 1) Prior works generate sub-optimal solutions by assuming objects are packed sequentially. 2) Prior works try all possible poses and orientations for each to-be-packed object to find the best solution, leading to slow computation. To tackle these issues, we propose to hierarchically group patches into nearly rectangular super-patches, allowing a larger search space for patch combination and a smaller optimality gap. Instead of exhaustively trying all possible combinations, we train a high-level group selector network (HSN) to efficiently predict how likely a candidate patch subset can be grouped into a rectangular super-patch. Given an identified patch subset, we use the sequential ordering technique, similar to prior works. Specifically, we use a low-level sorter network (LSN) to determine the suitable order of packing within the subset. Next, a low-level pose network (LPN) infers the rough initial pose of each patch. The ultimate pose of these patches is determined by local numerical optimization. These two networks are trained using reinforcement learning to efficiently infer near optimal sequential packing policies.\n\nWe have evaluated our method on 3 datasets, containing highly irregular UV patches generated from both organic and man-made 3D models. We show the effectiveness of our approach by comparing against widely used algorithm baselines, including piecewise linear NFP, XAtlas\u00a0\\[Young, [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.10329#bib.bib46)\\], and\u00a0\\[Sander et\u00a0al., [2003](https://arxiv.org/html/2309.10329#bib.bib34)\\], where we achieve a 5%\u221210%percent5percent105\\\\%-10\\\\%5 % - 10 % packing ratio improvement across all the tested datasets.

To\ntackle the challenges of irregular packing, including object validity\nconstraints and collision avoidance, our method employs the score\u0002based diffusion model to learn a series of gradient fields. These\ngradient fields encode the correlations between constraint satisfac\u0002tion and the spatial relationships of polygons, learned from teacher\nexamples. During the testing phase, packing solutions are gener\u0002ated using a coarse-to-fine refinement mechanism guided by the\nlearned gradient fields.

It is also known as cutting or\nnesting problem, which involves arranging a collection of irregu\u0002larly shaped pieces onto one or multiple boards. The objective is to\nposition each piece entirely within the board(s) without overlaps,\nall while minimizing the waste material produced.\narXiv:2310.19814v1 [cs.LG] 18 Oct 2023\nTianyang Xue, Mingdong Wu, Lin Lu, Haoxuan Wang, Hao Dong, and Baoquan Chen\nOne of the key applications of irregular packing is manufacturing.\nIn these scenarios, packing problems take on different forms, such\nas packing parts to be cut from a larger piece of material in order\nto minimize waste and save costs in traditional manufacturing\nindustries like garment manufacturing, furniture making, metal\nsheet cutting, or arranging multiple models within the build volume\nfor simultaneous 3D printing to increase model production while\nminimizing material waste, and reducing print time.\nIn manufacturing applications, a fast, scalable, and generalizable\npacking algorithm is crucial for real-world deployment.\n\u2022 Efficient algorithms streamline decision-making, simplify\u0002ing deployment for end-users.\n\u2022 The size and aspect ratio of the container may vary depend\u0002ing on the raw material or machines used.\n\u2022 Packed objects may have similar shapes with slight devia\u0002tions due to customization and personalization preferences.\nThese objectives motivate us to propose a learning-based method\nto understand the relationships and similarities among the well\u0002packed examples from a dataset with limited size, instead of solving\nthe packing case individually without considering any priors.\nAs a classic NP-hard problem [Milenkovic 1999], the irregular\npacking problem is typically tackled using heuristic algorithms and\nglobal optimization strategies [Guo et al. 2022], which can be very\ntime-consuming. In recent years, machine learning approaches have\nemerged as potential solutions to address the challenging problem\nof packing optimization. The success of employing reinforcement\nlearning to address the bin packing problem [Verma et al. 2020; Zhao\net al. 2022] underscores its potential for aiding in the sequential\noptimization of packing. While researchers have strived to enhance\nthe initialization [Wo\u0142czyk 2018] or packing sequence [Fang et al.\n2023] for irregular packing, a trade-off between computational time\nand utilization rate persists.\nTo realize a fast, scalable, and generalizable packing algorithm,\nour key insight is to reframe the packing problem into modeling\nthe data distribution of sub-optimal packing examples. These ex\u0002amples can be generated by arbitrary packing algorithms, which\nwe refer to as the teacher algorithms. Specifically, such a learning\napproach should learn the correlations between the packing opti\u0002mality and the spatial relationships of polygons from the examples.\nBy modeling the local and global correlations together, the learned\nknowledge can generalize to unseen shapes, varying quantities,\nand diverse rectangular containers, which enables scalable and\ngeneralizable in-distribution packing.\nDuring testing, a solution can be generated via several neural\nnetwork inferences, without further online exploration or exhaus\u0002tive optimization, which enables a fast packing process. Thanks to\nthe inherent parallelism of deep learning, we can generate multiple\nsolution candidates in parallel and preserve the best one, which\nfurther improves the time efficiency of the packing process.\nInspired by [Wu et al. 2022], which proposes a score-based frame\u0002work that estimates a target gradient field (TarGF) to guide object\nrearrangement, we aim to develop a score-based approach for mod\u0002eling the teacher data. However, adapting this technique to the\nirregular packing problem is non-trivial due to the hard constraints\non the validity of packed objects, i.e., non-overlapping. As a result,\nsolving the irregular packing requires a coarse-to-fine refinement\nprocess guided by multiple levels of gradient fields, rather than a\nsingle gradient update (TarGF).\nTo achieve this goal, we introduce two key designs for the score\nnetwork: multi-scale feature extraction and coarse-to-fine relation\nextraction. The former incorporates a multi-scale feature extraction\nnetwork that encodes the geometric features of polygons at different\nscales. The latter employs a multi-layered coarse-to-fine graph\nconvolutional network (GCN) with varying neighbor ranges for\neffective message-passing. By combining these two key designs, our\napproach tailors the score network to effectively support the coarse\u0002to-fine refinement process, resulting in improved generalization\nand scalability for solving the 2D irregular packing problem.\nWe evaluate our method in two industrial packing domains,\nconsidering only translations. Empirical results demonstrate our\nmethod achieves spatial utilization rates that are either similar to or\nexceed those of teacher packing examples. Furthermore, our method\nscales with polygon count and generalizes to diverse container\nconstraints and polygon shapes within the training distribution.\nIn summary, our contributions are listed as follows:\n\u2022 We propose a score-based generative modeling approach to\ntackle th...",

An efficient 2D irregular packing algorithm can effectively improve material utilization and reduce processing costs. The reduction in material consumption will also have a beneficial impact on the environment ([Ke et al., 2020](#B76)). Therefore, research of the packing problem is of great significance for technology and social interest.\nThe 2D packing problem is a type of combinatorial optimization problems to locate parts with different shapes compactly in one or more master sheet material to minimize the occupied space or maximize the utilization of the material. The 2D packing problem is currently recognized as a NP problem, which is mainly solved by heuristic algorithms. In recent years, many scholars have conducted research on 2D irregular packing problems with a verity of solutions.\nThere exists a number of review articles on packing and cutting problems. We have summarized the main review literature in the field of 2D packing and cutting as shown in[Table 1](#T1). Brown ([Brown, 1971](#B17)) introduced an optimum packing and depletion problem with optimization of space and resource usage. Harvey ([Salkin and De Kluyver, 1975](#B116)) surveyed the application of mathematical optimization models such as linear programming to the knapsack problem. Bruce ([Golden, 1976](#B50)) surveyed various approaches to the cutting stock problem. Hinxman ([Hinxman, 1980](#B65)) surveyed the trim-loss and assortment problems, this research paid more attention to cutting and packaging problems in practical applications, and did not mention much about theoretical methods. Garey and Coffman ([Garey and Johnson, 1981](#B47);[Coffman et al., 1984](#B27)) surveyed the approximation algorithms for bin packing problems. Israni ([Israni and Sanders, 1982](#B72)) reviewed the 2D cutting stock problem including almost all 2D packaging problems. The author also proposed a rectangular layout method. Sarin ([Sarin, 1983](#B118)) reviewed methodologies and literature to solve 2D stock cutting problems and introduced an interactive optimization procedure for a general 2D stock cutting problem. Dyckhoff ([Dyckhoff et al., 1985](#B38)) described a trim loss and related problems and categorized them briefly. Dudzi&#x00144;ski ([Dudzi&#x00144;ski and Walukiewicz, 1987](#B36)) summarized the exact methods for knapsack problems, such as linear programming. Matthias ([Rode and Rosenberg, 1987](#B114)) analyzed the algorithm for the trim-loss problems. Haessler ([Haessler and Sweeney, 1991](#B59)) reviewed the solution process of cutting stock problems, including placement algorithm and sequence optimization algorithm. Dowsland ([Dowsland and Dowsland, 1992](#B34)) reviewed the application of operations research methods to the packing problem and summarized some exact heuristics. Sweeney ([Sweeney and Paternoster, 1992](#B128)) categorized cutting and packing problems and made application-oriented research records. Cheng ([Cheng et al., 1994](#B22)) discussed 2D cutting stock problems and their application cases including the pallet loading problem and VLSI placement problem. With the gradual deepening of research on 2D layout problems, typology becomes a common research topic. 2D regular and irregular layout problems are clearly distinguished in practical applications and theoretical methods. Dowsland ([Dowsland and Dowsland, 1995](#B29)) gave a special review of the 2D irregular nesting problem for the first time. Mavridou ([Mavridou and Pardalos, 1997](#B98)) summarized applications of the genetic algorithm and simulated annealing algorithm in the optimization of facility layout problems. Dyckhoff ([Dyckhoff, 1990](#B37)) made a typology of the cutting and packing problems in detail, and W&#x000e4;scher ([W&#x000e4;scher et al., 2007](#B135)) improved the typology later. Hopper ([Hopper and Turton, 1999](#B67);[Hopper and Turton, 2001a](#B68);[Hopper and Turton, 2001b](#B69)) investigated the application of meta-heuristic and heuristic algorithms in 2D and 3D packing problems. Lodi ([Lodi et al., 2002a](#B90);[Lodi et al., 2002b](#B91)) reviewed algorithms proposed in the 1990s of 2D packing problems. Bennell et al. ([Bennell and Oliveira, 2008](#B10);[Bennell and Oliveira, 2009](#B9)) discussed 2D irregular packing problems and related geometric problems. Leao ([Leao et al., 2020](#B81)) introduced the mathematical models in the 2D irregular packing problem.\nTABLE 1\n[![www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/966691/fmech-08-966691-HTML/image_m/fmech-08-966691-t001.jpg)](https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/966691/fmech-08-966691-HTML/image_m/fmech-08-966691-t001.jpg)\n**TABLE 1**.

It adopts two neighborhoods, swapping two given polygons in a placement and placing one polygon into a new position. The local search algorithm is used to minimize the overlap on the basis of the neighborhoods mentioned above and the unconstrained[nonlinear programming](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/nonlinear-programming)model is adopted to further minimize the overlap during the search process. Moreover, the[tabu](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/tabu)search algorithm is used to avoid[local minima](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/local-minimum), and a compact algorithm is presented to improve the result. The results of standard test instances indicate that when compared with other existing algorithms, the presented algorithm does not only show some signs of competitive power but also updates several best known results.\n## Introduction\nThe irregular strip packing problem, also known as the nesting problem, has a wide area of applications. Given a set of irregular shapes and a rectangular strip with a fixed width and an arbitrary length, the target of the two-dimensional irregular strip packing problem is to place all shapes within the strip such that the length of the strip is minimized and the irregular shapes do not overlap. A classic example application is clothing industry. Several pieces of clothes will be cut from a roll of fabric and the objective is to minimize the waste of fabric. The fabric has a fixed width and its length can be generally assumed infinite; so the problem is to minimize the length required for producing the specified number of irregular shapes.\nThe irregular strip packing problem is a NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem [1]. Numerous papers on nesting problem have been published since the first paper by Art [2]. Meta-heuristics are often used to solve this problem. Hopper and Turton [3] reviewed these methods, and a summary of geometric methods was published by Bennell and Oliveira [4]. As research progressed, further breakthroughs in algorithms for this problem have achieved in recent years. When compared with the previous years, these solutions have markedly improved the effect and speed of nesting results. The typical methods include Burke et al. [5], Gomes and Oliveira [6], Egeblad et al. [7], Imamichi et al. [8], etc.\nAlbano and Sapuppo [9] proposed an algorithm that places each shape at the bottom-left position, and the sequence of places is obtained by tree search. Jakobs [10] proposed a two-stage solution which first generates the rectangular enclosure of each irregular shape, and then finds the placement for these enclosures through a genetic algorithm. Secondly, a shrinking algorithm moves the shapes to another one as close as possible using the idea of the bottom-left heuristic. Gomes and Oliveira [11] based on bottom-left heuristic and find a good placement by exchanging two shapes in the layout. Dowsland et al. [12] developed a compact algorithm to improve the bottom-left heuristic algorithm. The algorithm first gets the initial placement by the bottom-left heuristic, and then uses a shaking process to compact the placement. Burke et al. [5] presented a new bottom-left heuristic algorithm based on discretization, and combination with hill climbing or tabu search to get a high quality solution. This algorithm can also pack the shapes with circular arcs and holes. Egeblad et al. [7] proposed an efficient fast local search method whose neighborhood is any horizontal or vertical translation of a given shape. They also formulated a polynomial time algorithm to find a translation with minimum overlap area between the given polygon and the other polygons in the current placement. Gomes and Oliveira [6] presented a separation algorithm to locally optimize the placement based on linear programming models, and used simulated annealing to guide the search. A new separation algorithm based on unconstrained nonlinear programming is proposed by Imamichi et al. [8]. They also designed an algorithm that swaps two polygons in a placement, and then the algorithms are combined as a component into an iterated local search algorithm for the overlap minimization problem. This method yielded several best known results on the standard test instances. Our algorithm is based on a separation algorithm presented by Imamichi et al. [8], and local search is adopted to guide the search. Moreover, a tabu search algorithm is used to avoid local minima and a compacted algorithm is used to improve the packing results.\n## Section snippets\n## Formulation\nIn this section, some fundamental elements of geometry are first defined, before formulation of the irregular strip packing problem algorithm is given.\n**Definition 1 (point)**\nA point*p*in two-dimensional space is represented by a pair:p=(px,py)\u2208R2.\n**Definition 2 (line segment)**\nA line segment*s*is a point set defined by two endpoints*p**a*and*p**b*:s={p\u2208R2,t\u2208[0,1]|p=pa+t(pb\u2212pa)}.\n**Definition 3 (polygon)**\nA polygon is a plane figure bounded by a closed path composes of a finite sequence of line segments denoted by*S*.

The proposed algorithm\nconstructively creates layouts from an ordered list of items and a placement heuristic. A\nmoveable item is exclusively placed on a collision free region vertex. The container has a fixed\nwidth, while its length can change so that all items are placed on it. The objective is to find a\nlayout of the set of items that minimizes the length of the container. The proposed algorithm has\ntwo hierarchical levels: core level with a simulated annealing algorithm, and the external level\ncontrolling the container length. The simulated annealing algorithm controls the ordered list of\nitems and the placement of the items. If a feasible layout is found, the external level decreases\nthe container length and applies the simulated annealing again. Otherwise, the container length\nis increased and the simulated annealing is applied again.

INTRODUCTION\nCutting and packing are classic problems of finding the\nmost efficient layout for a set of input items out of a\ngiven container with the objective of minimizing the waste\nmaterial. The applications of cutting and packing, e.g.\nclothing, shipbuilding, and furniture industry are numer\u0002ous. W\u00a8ascher et al. (2007) have developed a typology that\nclassifies the nesting problems according to dimension,\nobjective, assortment of item type, as well as the number\nand nature of the container where the items are to be\nallocated. In this paper, we consider the irregular shape\npacking problem, classified as a two-dimensional irregular\nopen dimension problem (ODP).\nThe problem is NP-complete (Fowler et al., 1981) and\nas a result solution methodologies predominantly utilize\nheuristics. Although there are many different solution\napproaches presented in the literature, there appears to\nbe two key strategies for representing and searching the\nsolution space. The first approach represents the solution\nas an ordered list of items and applies a placement rule\nto construct the solution (Babu and Babu, 2001; Gomes\nand Oliveira, 2002; Burke et al., 2007, 2006). The second\napproach represents the solution as a physical layout on\nthe container and moves items within the layout (Bennell\n1 e-mail: andre.kubagawa@gmail.com.

This author was partially supported by\nCNPq (grant 304258/2007-5) and FAPESP (grant 2009/07173-2).\nand Dowsland, 1999; Gomes and Oliveira, 2006; Egeblad\net al., 2007). The former strategy is dependent on two\ncritical characteristics of the algorithm; the placement rule\nand the placement order of the items.\nWhen irregular shaped items are involved an extra di\u0002mension of complexity is generated by the geometry. The\nno-fit polygon is the principal approach for handling the\ngeometry in cutting and packing problems with irregular\nshaped items (Burke et al., 2007; Bennell and Song, 2008;\nCosta et al., 2009). The no-fit polygon is used to ensure\nfeasible layouts; i.e. layouts where the items do not overlap\nand fit inside the container.\nIn this paper, the solution is represented as an ordered\nlist of items and a constructive heuristic is applied se\u0002quentially. A simulated annealing algorithm controls how\nthe items are ordered in the list and where the items are\nconstructively placed. The proposed algorithm has two\nhierarchical levels. The inner level solves the placement\nproblem where the container has fixed dimensions. The\nexternal level reduces or increases the container dimen\u0002sion that must be minimized. Experiments show that the\nproposed method is very efficient compared with other\npublished methods.\n2. PREVIOUS WORKS\nThe no-fit polygon alone has limited utility in cutting\nand packing problems. Some recent works are using the\ncollision free region to determine feasible layouts in con\u0002tainers with fixed dimensions. Martins and Tsuzuki (2006)\nproposed a constructive heuristic where the collision free\nPreprints of the 18th IFAC World Congress\nMilano (Italy) August 28 - September 2, 2011\nCopyright by the\nInternational Federation of Automatic Control (IFAC)\n3968\nFig. 1. Cost function behavior when the container has fixed\ndimensions. The cost function assumes only discrete\nvalues, while the rotating angle \u03b8 is continuous.\nregion represents feasible placements for a moveable item\nconsidering the already placed items and the container.\nThe cost function is the non occupied area inside the\ncontainer with fixed dimensions. As the non occupied\narea can change only by adding or removing areas of\nitems, the cost function can assume only a finite set of\nvalues, becoming discontinuous (see Fig. 1). A simulated\nannealing algorithm with adaptive neighborhood (Martins\nand Tsuzuki, 2008, 2009a) controls the sequence of items\nand the placement on the collision free region boundary.\nThe collision free region was calculated using regularized\nBoolean operations implemented with limited precision\n(Hobby, 1999).\nMartins and Tsuzuki (2007) combined the simulated an\u0002nealing with deterministic heuristics (larger first and bot\u0002tom left). They showed that it is possible to create problem\ninstances where deterministic heuristics cannot reach the\nlayout associated with the global optimum.\nSato et al. (2010) implemented a robust algorithm to\ndetermine the collision free region with two dimension\nnon manifold Boolean operations. They created a problem\ninstance where the the global optimum can not be reached\nby placing the moveable item exclusively on collision free\nregion vertices. Such situation rarely occurs considering\nstudied and practical problems. They showed several re\u0002sults where the area of the container was exactly equal\nto the total area of the items. The layout associated with\nglobal optimum was reached in averagely 15 times fewer\niterations when compared to previously published results\n(Martins and Tsuzuki, 2009b, 2010) where the area of the\ncontainer was larger than the total area of the items. The\ncorrect calculation of the collision free region showed to be\nan effective tool to obtain such results.\n3. NO-FIT POLYGONS AND COLLISION FREE\nREGION\nNo-fit polygons represent set of translations of an item\nand are mathematically represented by a set of vectors.\nFor a better understanding of the properties of the no-fit\npolygons, the set of translations of an item is represented\nby polygons in the plane. Every item has a reference point\nthat can be internal or external to it. The no-fit polygon\nrepresents a set of forbidden translations, as shown in\nFig. 2. For an item P, let i(P) be its interior, \u2202P be its\nboundary and c(P) be its complement.\nFig. 2. Set of translations of a shape represented as a region\ncontaining all possible translations from its reference\npoint.\nDefinition 3.1. The no-fit polygon induced by item Pi to\nitem Pj , denoted by \u03a5(Pi, Pj ), is the set of translation\nvectors applied to Pj that leads it to a collision with Pi.\nThus,\n\u03a5(Pi, Pj ) = i(Pi) \t i(Pj ) (1)\n= {v | \u2203 a \u2208 i(Pj ), a + v \u2208 i(Pi)}\nThe no-fit polygon can be obtained by the Minkowski\nsum algorithm (Agarwal et al., 2002), that can be calcu\u0002lated very efficiently for convex polygons.
