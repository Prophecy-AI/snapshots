This is the game-changer:\nNo Compression: Since the exact polygonal shape is given, optimization through deformation (like real-world netting) is excluded.\nThe Constraint: We are strictly limited to finding the optimal rotation and translation for up to 200 rigid shapes while ensuring zero strict overlap (collision), only allowing for perfect contact.\n2\\. The Algorithmic Imperative\nTo succeed, the solution must focus entirely on robust geometric algorithms and advanced optimization techniques:\nPrecision is Key: The notebook's use of the Decimal type is a huge hint. This mandates that our solution relies on high-precision arithmetic to manage the complex geometry and avoid floating-point errors, especially in the crucial collision checks.\nThe Solving Method: The heavy lifting requires a powerful Metaheuristic like Simulated Annealing (SA). SA is necessary to efficiently search the vast, multi-dimensional solution space of 3N variables and minimize the side of the Minimum Bounding Square (our cost function).\n3\\. Conclusion\nThis challenge boils down to mastering Algorithmic Geometry and Stochastic Optimization (the core of the SA algorithm). Our submission will be the precise set of coordinates and angles that yields the mathematically tightest fit. It's a deep test of mathematical implementation!\n[https://lnkd.in/e-vyv4NJ](https://lnkd.in/e-vyv4NJ?trk=public_post-text)

Participants are tasked with determining the optimal way to pack Christmas tree toys into the smallest possible square box, allowing Santa Claus to mail them efficiently around the globe. The challenge is to find the dimensions of the smallest square box that can fit between 1 to 200 trees.\nThe competition is designed to encourage innovation and problem-solving skills, with a focus on packing efficiency. Participants are encouraged to submit their solutions, which will be evaluated based on the normalized area of the square bounding box for each puzzle configuration.\n### Description\nThe challenge is inspired by Santa&#x27;s need for the smallest box to fit all the tiny trees for his Christmas deliveries. Participants are required to find the best packing solution to help Santa Claus and win the competition&#x27;s prize.\n### Evaluation\nSubmissions are evaluated on the sum of the normalized area of the square bounding box for each puzzle. The formula for the score is:\n```\n`score = \u2211(sn^2/n)`\n```\nwhere`sn`is the side of the square box bounding the trees and`n`is the total number of trees in the configuration.\n### Submission File\nEach submission must include the tree position (`x`,`y`) and rotation (`deg`) for each`id`in the submission. The values must be converted to a string and prepended with an`s`before submission. Submissions with overlapping trees will result in an error. Location values must be constrained to -100 \u2264x, y \u2264100.\nThe file should have the following format:\n```\n`id,x,y,deg\n001\\_0,s0.0,s0.0,s20.411299\n002\\_0,s0.0,s0.0,s20.411299\n002\\_1,s-0.541068,s0.259317,s51.66348\netc.`\n```\n### Timeline\n* **November 17, 2025**: Start Date\n* **January 23, 2026**: Entry Deadline\n* **January 23, 2026**: Team Merger Deadline\n* **January 30, 2026**: Final Submission Deadline\nAll deadlines are at 11:59 PM UTC unless otherwise noted.\n### Prizes\n* **First Prize**: $12,000\n* **Second Prize**: $10,000\n* **Third Prize**: $10,000\n* **Fourth Prize**: $8,000\nAdditionally, a**Rudolph Prize**of $10,000 is awarded to the team holding 1st place on the leaderboard for the longest period of time between November 17, 2025, and January 30, 2026.\n### Citation\nWalter Reade and Ashley Oldacre.

The final solution is evaluated by an ensemble score that combines all cases.\n**Notebook Link**:[Santa 2025 - Christmas Tree Packing Challenge V1](https://www.kaggle.com/code/adityapawar327/santa-2025-christmas-tree-packing-challenge-v1)\n**Public Score**: 85.92\n## Table of Contents\n[](#table-of-contents)\n* Library Imports and Environment Setup\n* Global Configuration and Precision Settings\n* ChristmasTree Class Definition\n* Utility Functions (Scoring/Collision)\n* Simulated Annealing Algorithm (N &lt; 20)\n* Grid Search Algorithm (N &gt;= 20)\n* Hybrid &amp; Ensemble Solvers\n* Main Computation Loop (N = 1 to 200)\n* Submission Formatting and Export\n## Methodology\n[](#methodology)\n* **Small N (&lt; 20):**Uses Simulated Annealing for efficient search in small configuration spaces.\n* **Large N (&gt;= 20):**Uses a tailored Grid Search for tractable solution space exploration.\n* **Hybrid/Ensemble:**Runs multiple seeds and chooses the best solution for each N.\n* **Collision Detection:**Employs Shapely geometry operations to prevent tree overlap.\n* **Performance:**Code leverages parallelization (`ProcessPoolExecutor`) and high-precision (Decimal) arithmetic.\n## Usage\n[](#usage)\n1. Install dependencies:\n* `shapely`,`numpy`,`pandas`,`matplotlib`,`tqdm`\n* Run the notebook or script sequentially to output results and save a`submission.csv`.\n* Check the score on important N cases (e.g., 1, 10, 25, 50, 100, 150, 200).\n## Output\n[](#output)\n* The notebook prints key logs during computation.\n* A`submission.csv`is generated with columns:`id`,`x`,`y`,`deg`(example row:`001\\_0, s-9.146226, s-0.12832, s-224.999647`).\n## License\n[](#license)\nThis project is released under the[Apache 2.0 License](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).\n## Author\n[](#author)\nAditya Pawar ([Kaggle Profile](https://www.kaggle.com/adityapawar327))\nFor questions or collaboration, feel free to reach out via Kaggle discussions or connect on[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adityapawar327).\n## About\nIn this re-defined optimization problem, help Santa fit Christmas tree toys into the smallest (2-dimension) parcel size possible so that he can efficiently mail these stocking stuffers aro...",
