## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.315653 (exp_032 - but FAILED Kaggle validation)
- Best LB score: 70.316492 (exp_022) - VERIFIED ON KAGGLE
- Target: 68.871657 | Gap to target: 1.44 points (2.1%)
- Submissions remaining: 86

## CRITICAL: LAST SUBMISSION FAILED

exp_032 failed with "Overlapping trees in group 044" because:
1. The submission had 397 angles outside [0,360) range
2. N=44 tree 35 had angle 5103.6° (should be normalized)
3. I've restored the known-good exp_022 submission

## SITUATION ANALYSIS

After 33 experiments:
1. **External data EXHAUSTED** - Our baseline (70.315653) is BETTER than ALL public sources
2. **Ensemble approach hit ceiling** - No more improvements from external data
3. **All optimization approaches failed** - SA, GA, B&B, lattice, CP, gradient all produced same score
4. **Gap is 1.44 points (2.1%)** - Too large for micro-optimizations

## WHAT HAS NOT BEEN TRIED

### 1. EXTENDED C++ OPTIMIZATION (HOURS, NOT MINUTES)
The discussion "Why the winning solutions will be Asymmetric (Results from 24 CPUs)" suggests:
- Top competitors run optimization for HOURS or DAYS
- We've only run for ~10 minutes
- Extended compute might find better local optima

### 2. ASYMMETRIC SOLUTIONS
Same discussion suggests asymmetric solutions beat symmetric ones.

### 3. PER-N ANALYSIS
Identify which N values have most room for improvement and focus there.

## NEXT EXPERIMENT: EXTENDED C++ OPTIMIZATION

**TASK**: Run bbox3 C++ optimizer for EXTENDED time (2+ hours minimum)

```bash
# Compile with maximum optimization
g++ bbox3.cpp -o bbox3 -std=c++17 -fopenmp -O3 -march=native -Ofast

# Run for extended time with maximum iterations
./bbox3 -n 100000 -r 200  # 100K iterations, 200 restarts per N
```

**CRITICAL VALIDATION BEFORE SUBMISSION**:
```python
# 1. Normalize all angles to [0, 360)
for row in df.iterrows():
    angle = parse_s(row['deg'])
    angle = angle % 360.0
    if angle < 0:
        angle += 360.0

# 2. Use high precision (20 decimal places)
x_str = f"s{x:.20f}"

# 3. Validate with integer arithmetic
SCALE = 10**12
int_vertices = [(int(round(vx * SCALE)), int(round(vy * SCALE))) for vx, vy in vertices]
```

## ⛔ FORBIDDEN

- ❌ Creating new ensemble from external data (EXHAUSTED - already tried)
- ❌ Running SA/bbox3 for short periods (already tried many times)
- ❌ Submitting without strict overlap validation
- ❌ Using angles outside [0, 360) range
- ❌ Logging experiments that don't produce new results

## ✅ REQUIRED

1. Run extended C++ optimization (2+ hours)
2. Validate ALL angles are in [0, 360) before submission
3. Validate NO overlaps using integer arithmetic before submission
4. Submit ONLY if score improves AND validation passes
5. Track which N values improved

## SUBMISSION STRATEGY

With 86 submissions remaining:
1. Current submission is exp_022 (70.316492) - known good
2. Run extended optimization
3. If improvement found AND validation passes → SUBMIT
4. Track LB feedback to understand what works
