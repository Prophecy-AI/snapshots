## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.316492 from exp_022
- Best LB score: 70.316492 (verified)
- Target: 68.866853 | Gap to target: 1.45 points (2.1%)

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: SUBMISSION FAILED - FIX APPLIED

**exp_037 failed with "Overlapping trees in group 152"**

Root cause: The submission was from exp_038 (improved_ensemble) which modified 23 N values.
Local validation passed but Kaggle's stricter precision rejected it.

**FIX APPLIED:** Reverted /home/submission/submission.csv to exp_022 (verified working).

## What We've Learned (from 37 experiments)

### WHAT WORKS:
- **Ensemble approach**: Combining best per-N from external sources → 0.30 improvement
- **High-precision validation**: Must use integer-scaled coordinates (SCALE=10^18)
- **Preserving original angles**: DO NOT normalize angles outside [0,360)

### WHAT DOESN'T WORK:
- SA, GA, B&B, NFP, BLF, gradient descent, tessellation, jostle, interlock → ZERO improvement
- All 13+ algorithmic approaches converged to same score
- The baseline is at an EXTREMELY strong local optimum

### KEY INSIGHT:
The gap to target (1.45 points) is LARGE. Micro-optimizations won't work.
Top competitors run bbox3 for HOURS/DAYS, not 10 minutes.

## Response to Evaluator

The evaluator correctly identified:
1. ✅ Extended C++ optimization (hours, not minutes) - NOT FULLY TESTED
2. ✅ N=24 showed 0.348 improvement potential (but had NaN issues)
3. ✅ Need to verify current submission passes Kaggle

**Action taken:** Reverted to exp_022 which passed Kaggle validation.

## ⛔ FORBIDDEN (WILL BE REJECTED)
- Creating "improved" ensembles that modify verified working solutions
- Any approach that changes coordinates without strict Kaggle-level validation
- Submitting files that haven't been verified against exp_022's validation

## ✅ NEXT EXPERIMENT: EXTENDED C++ OPTIMIZATION

The single highest-leverage action is running bbox3 for EXTENDED time (4-8 hours).

### STEP 1: Compile bbox3 from "Why Not" kernel
```bash
# The "Why Not" kernel has advanced bbox3 with:
# - Complex Number Vector Coordination
# - Fluid Dynamics simulation
# - Hinge Pivot optimization
# - Global Boundary Tension

# Compile it
cd /home/code/experiments
g++ bbox3.cpp -o bbox3 -std=c++17 -fopenmp -O3 -march=native -Ofast
```

### STEP 2: Run for EXTENDED time
```bash
# Run for 4-8 hours with aggressive parameters
./bbox3 -i /home/submission/submission.csv -o optimized.csv -n 2000 -r 96

# Monitor progress - check if score improves over time
```

### STEP 3: Validate STRICTLY before submission
```python
# CRITICAL: Use Kaggle-level validation
from decimal import Decimal, getcontext
getcontext().prec = 50
SCALE = 10**18

def validate_kaggle_level(trees):
    # Convert to integer-scaled coordinates
    # Check for ANY overlap (area > 0)
    # Only accept if ZERO overlaps
    pass
```

### STEP 4: Only submit if validation passes
- Compare to exp_022 per-N
- Only keep N values that BOTH improve AND pass strict validation
- Fall back to exp_022 for any N that fails

## Alternative: Focus on N=24

exp_007 found a dramatically better N=24 (0.348 improvement) but it had NaN values.
If extended optimization doesn't help, investigate what made N=24 better.

## What NOT to Try
- ❌ More ensemble variations (we've exhausted external sources)
- ❌ More algorithmic approaches (13+ already failed)
- ❌ Modifying verified working solutions without strict validation
- ❌ Short optimization runs (10 minutes is NOT enough)

## Success Criteria
- Score improves by > 0.01 from 70.316492
- Solution passes Kaggle validation (no overlaps)
- Per-N improvements are validated individually
