## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.315389 from exp_034 (snapshot_best)
- Best LB score: 70.316492 (exp_022, verified on Kaggle)
- Target: 68.871657 | Gap to target: 1.44 points (2.10%)
- Submissions used: 14/100 (86 remaining)

## CRITICAL DISCOVERY THIS LOOP

### Found Better Valid Submission in Snapshots!
- Searched 6168 CSV files in snapshots
- Found 6 valid files with scores better than 70.316492
- Best: 70.315389 from 21399642626/experiments/031_backpacking/ensemble_output.csv
- Improvement: 0.001103 over previous best
- All files with scores < 70 have OVERLAPS and are INVALID

### Key Insight: We've Exhausted All Available Data
- Our current submission (70.315389) is the BEST VALID submission among ALL 6168 snapshot files
- Files with lower scores (39.5, 51.4, etc.) have overlapping trees
- The PUBLIC KERNEL CEILING is confirmed at ~70.31

## Response to Evaluator

The evaluator suggested:
1. "Recover exp_007's valid improvements" - NOT POSSIBLE (N=24 had NaN values, not real improvements)
2. "Run extended C++ optimization for hours" - This is the only remaining path

I agree with the evaluator's assessment:
- All Python-based approaches have been exhausted
- All snapshot data has been exhausted
- The only remaining path is extended C++ optimization

## Submission Log
| Exp | Approach | CV | LB | Notes |
|-----|----------|----|----|-------|
| 001 | valid_baseline | 70.615 | 70.615 | First valid submission |
| 010 | safe_ensemble | 70.365 | 70.365 | Ensemble from snapshots |
| 022 | extended_cpp | 70.316 | 70.316 | Previous best |
| 034 | snapshot_best | 70.315 | pending | Found in snapshots |

## Next Experiment: SUBMIT exp_034

**IMMEDIATE ACTION**: Submit exp_034 to verify the 70.315389 score on Kaggle.

This is a small improvement (0.001) but it's VALID and should be submitted to:
1. Verify the score on Kaggle
2. Establish a new baseline
3. Use remaining submissions for further experiments

## Strategy Going Forward

### Option A: Extended C++ Optimization (RECOMMENDED)
If the strategy allows running binaries for extended periods:
- Run bbox3 for 2+ hours
- This is how top competitors achieve sub-70 scores
- Requires significant compute time but is the only proven path

### Option B: Accept the Ceiling
If extended C++ optimization is not allowed:
- Current score (70.315389) is the best achievable with available resources
- Gap to target (1.44 points) requires resources we don't have:
  - Extended compute (days of C++ optimization)
  - Private solutions (not publicly available)
  - 900+ submissions (accumulating best per-N)

## ⛔ FORBIDDEN
- Running bbox3/sa_fast for SHORT periods (already tried 30+ times)
- Creating more ensembles from the same sources (exhausted)
- Assuming files with low scores are valid (they have overlaps)

## ✅ REQUIRED ACTIONS

1. **SUBMIT exp_034** (70.315389) to get LB feedback
2. **DECIDE**: Extended C++ optimization OR accept ceiling
3. **TRACK**: Any new improvements from extended optimization

## Reality Check

After 33 experiments and searching 6168 snapshot files:
- Best valid score: 70.315389
- Target: 68.871657
- Gap: 1.44 points (2.10%)

The gap cannot be closed with:
- More ensembles (all data exhausted)
- More Python optimization (all approaches tried)
- Short C++ runs (already tried many times)

The gap CAN potentially be closed with:
- Extended C++ optimization (hours/days)
- Private solutions (not available)
- Novel algorithms not yet discovered

**RECOMMENDATION**: Submit exp_034, then attempt extended C++ optimization if allowed.
