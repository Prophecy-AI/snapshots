## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.316492 from exp_022
- Best LB score: 70.316492 (verified on Kaggle)
- Target: 68.870074 | Gap to target: 1.45 points (2.10%)

## CRITICAL SITUATION ANALYSIS

After 34 experiments, the score is STUCK at 70.316492. Here's what we know:

### What Has Been Tried (ALL FAILED):
1. **Local search methods**: SA, exhaustive search, NFP, backward propagation, multi-start - ALL found ZERO improvement
2. **Constructive algorithms**: BLF, lattice packing, interlock pattern - ALL found ZERO improvement
3. **Meta-heuristics**: Genetic algorithm, jostle algorithm - ALL found ZERO improvement
4. **Mathematical approaches**: Branch-and-bound, constraint programming, gradient density flow - ALL found ZERO improvement
5. **Ensemble approaches**: Combined 121 snapshot directories - achieved current best but no further improvement

### Why exp_007's "Improvement" Was Fake:
The exp_007 claimed CV=70.265 (0.35 improvement) but N=24 had ALL x-coordinates as NaN. This was a corrupted solution that failed Kaggle validation.

### The Real Situation:
- The baseline is at an EXTREMELY strong local optimum
- ALL perturbation-based methods find NO improvement
- The gap to target (1.45 points, 2.10%) is SIGNIFICANT
- Top teams achieve sub-70 scores through:
  1. Extended C++ optimization (DAYS, not minutes)
  2. Private solutions from Discord/Telegram
  3. Accumulating improvements over 900+ submissions

## Response to Evaluator

The evaluator correctly identified that:
1. exp_007's N=24 solution had NaN values - this is why it failed
2. Integer validation (SCALE=10^12) is TOO STRICT compared to Kaggle
3. Float validation with tolerance 1e-9 matches Kaggle's behavior
4. The current approach is LIMITED - we're at the PUBLIC KERNEL CEILING

I agree with the evaluator's assessment. The path forward requires:
1. **Recovering any valid improvements from exp_007** (excluding N=24)
2. **Extended C++ optimization** (if allowed)
3. **Trying fundamentally different approaches**

## ⛔ FORBIDDEN (WILL BE REJECTED)
- Running bbox3/sa_fast for SHORT periods (already tried many times)
- "Optimizing" existing CSV files with same parameters
- Expecting local search to find improvements (proven impossible)
- Logging experiments that don't produce new solutions

## ✅ REQUIRED NEXT STEPS

### STEP 1: RECOVER exp_007's VALID IMPROVEMENTS

The exp_007 had 43 N values with improvements. Only N=24 was invalid (NaN).
Create a hybrid submission that uses:
- exp_007's valid improvements for N values that pass validation (excluding N=24)
- Current baseline (exp_022) for N=24 and any other invalid N values

```python
# Load exp_007 submission
df_007 = pd.read_csv('experiments/007_ensemble_fractional/submission.csv')

# For each N, check if valid (no NaN, no overlaps)
# If valid AND better than current, use it
# Otherwise use current baseline
```

### STEP 2: SUBMIT THE HYBRID TO GET LB FEEDBACK

Even if the improvement is small, submit it! We have 86 submissions remaining.
LB feedback tells us if the approach works.

### STEP 3: IF STEP 1 DOESN'T WORK - TRY EXTENDED C++ OPTIMIZATION

The top kernels run bbox3 for HOURS with:
- Multiple random seeds
- Best-keeping strategy (only keep improvements)
- Parallel execution on multiple CPUs

Run bbox3 for 2+ hours with best-keeping strategy.

### STEP 4: TRACK PER-N SCORES

For any experiment, track which N values improved:
```python
for n in range(1, 201):
    my_score = compute_score_for_n(my_solution, n)
    base_score = compute_score_for_n(baseline, n)
    if my_score < base_score - 1e-6:
        print(f"✅ N={n}: IMPROVED by {base_score - my_score:.6f}")
```

## What NOT to Try (Proven Dead Ends)
- SA with different parameters (tried 10+ times)
- Exhaustive search for small N (baseline is optimal)
- NFP placement (no improvement found)
- Multi-start random (cannot generate valid configs)
- Branch-and-bound (no improvement found)
- Genetic algorithm (no improvement found)
- Lattice packing (no improvement found)
- Constraint programming (no improvement found)

## REALITY CHECK

The target (68.870074) requires a 2.10% improvement. This is SIGNIFICANT.
Top public kernels converge to ~70.3. The gap to 1st place (Rafbill at 69.99) is only 0.33 points.

Reaching the target likely requires:
- Private solutions not publicly available
- Extended compute resources (days of C++ optimization)
- Novel algorithms not yet discovered

However, **recovering exp_007's valid improvements is achievable** and should be the immediate focus.

## SUBMISSION STRATEGY

With 86 submissions remaining:
- SUBMIT after every experiment that produces a valid submission
- Even small improvements are valuable for per-N tracking
- LB feedback is FREE information - use it!
