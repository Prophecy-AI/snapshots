## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.315653 (exp_032)
- Best LB score: 70.316492 (exp_022) - VERIFIED ON KAGGLE
- Target: 68.871657 | Gap to target: 1.44 points (2.1%)

## CRITICAL SITUATION ANALYSIS

### What We Know:
1. **External data EXHAUSTED**: Our baseline (70.315653) is BETTER than ALL public sources
   - Closest external: bbox3-ensemble-update at 70.319733 (+0.004 worse)
   - All 297 CSV files scanned - ZERO improvements found
   
2. **Overlap validation is CRITICAL**: 
   - exp_032 failed with "Overlapping trees in group 044" 
   - The submission had 397 angles outside [0,360) range
   - Kaggle uses stricter validation than our local checks
   
3. **33 experiments completed**, all converging to ~70.31-70.32:
   - SA, GA, B&B, lattice, CP, gradient, tessellation - ALL FAILED
   - Only ensemble approach worked (improved from 70.615 to 70.316)
   - But ensemble has hit its ceiling - no more external data to use

### The Gap Analysis:
- Current: 70.316492 (verified LB)
- Target: 68.871657
- Gap: 1.44 points (2.1%)
- This requires ~2% improvement across ALL N values

## Response to Evaluator

The evaluator correctly identified:
1. **NO LB VERIFICATION** - We have 87+ submissions remaining but haven't been using them effectively
2. **BEST SCORE NEVER TESTED** - exp_007 (70.26573) was never submitted
3. **EXTENDED COMPUTE NOT TRIED** - bbox3 only run for short periods

However, the evaluator's suggestion to "submit current solution" resulted in FAILURE due to overlaps. The current submission file had corrupted angles (397 outside [0,360) range).

**IMMEDIATE ACTION**: I've restored the known-good exp_022 submission (70.316492) which passed Kaggle validation.

## ⛔ WHAT DOES NOT WORK (PROVEN BY 33 EXPERIMENTS)

1. **Running bbox3/sa_fast with more iterations** → Same score (~70.31)
2. **Ensemble from external data** → EXHAUSTED (our baseline is best)
3. **Local search (SA, exhaustive, NFP)** → Baseline is at strong local optimum
4. **Novel algorithms (GA, B&B, lattice, CP, gradient)** → All failed to improve

## ✅ WHAT MIGHT WORK (NOT YET TRIED)

### 1. EXTENDED C++ OPTIMIZATION (HOURS, NOT MINUTES)
The discussion "Why the winning solutions will be Asymmetric (Results from 24 CPUs)" suggests top competitors run optimization for HOURS or DAYS with massive compute. We've only run for ~10 minutes.

**EXPERIMENT**: Run bbox3 C++ optimizer overnight (8+ hours) with maximum iterations.

### 2. ASYMMETRIC SOLUTIONS
The same discussion suggests asymmetric solutions beat symmetric ones. Our current solutions may be too symmetric.

**EXPERIMENT**: Implement asymmetric placement strategy that breaks symmetry.

### 3. PER-N SPECIALIZATION
Different N values may need different strategies:
- N=1-10: Exhaustive search (already optimal?)
- N=11-50: Custom constructive heuristics
- N=51-200: Pattern-based placement

**EXPERIMENT**: Analyze which N values have the most room for improvement.

### 4. PRIVATE SOLUTIONS
Top competitors share solutions via Discord/Telegram that aren't in public kernels. We don't have access to these.

## NEXT EXPERIMENT: EXTENDED C++ OPTIMIZATION

Since external data is exhausted, the only path forward is:
1. Run bbox3 C++ optimizer for EXTENDED time (8+ hours)
2. Use maximum iterations and restarts
3. Focus on N values with most room for improvement

**CRITICAL**: Before submitting, validate:
1. All angles in [0, 360) range
2. No overlaps using strict integer validation
3. High-precision coordinates (20 decimal places)

## SUBMISSION STRATEGY

With 87 submissions remaining:
1. **SUBMIT exp_022** (already verified at 70.316492) as baseline
2. **Run extended optimization** for 8+ hours
3. **Submit any improvement** immediately for LB verification
4. **Track per-N improvements** to understand where gains come from

## ⚠️ OVERLAP VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS

Before ANY submission:
```python
# 1. Normalize all angles to [0, 360)
angle = angle % 360.0
if angle < 0:
    angle += 360.0

# 2. Use high precision (20 decimal places)
x_str = f"s{x:.20f}"

# 3. Validate with integer arithmetic (SCALE=10^12)
int_vertices = [(int(round(vx * SCALE)), int(round(vy * SCALE))) for vx, vy in vertices]
```

## FORBIDDEN (DO NOT DO)

- ❌ Creating new ensemble from external data (EXHAUSTED)
- ❌ Running SA/bbox3 for short periods (already tried)
- ❌ Submitting without strict overlap validation
- ❌ Using angles outside [0, 360) range
