## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.316492 from exp_022
- Best LB score: 70.316492 (verified)
- Target: 68.866853 | Gap to target: 1.45 points (2.1%)

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: PREVIOUS SUBMISSION FAILED - FIX APPLIED

**exp_037 failed with "Overlapping trees in group 152"**

Root cause: The submission was from exp_038 (improved_ensemble) which modified 23 N values.
Local validation passed but Kaggle's stricter precision rejected it.

**FIX APPLIED:** Reverted /home/submission/submission.csv to exp_022 (verified working).
The current submission.csv is now exp_022 which passed Kaggle with LB 70.316492.

## What We've Learned (from 37 experiments)

### WHAT WORKS:
- **Ensemble approach**: Combining best per-N from external sources → 0.30 improvement
- **High-precision validation**: Must use integer-scaled coordinates (SCALE=10^18)
- **Preserving original angles**: DO NOT normalize angles outside [0,360)

### WHAT DOESN'T WORK:
- SA, GA, B&B, NFP, BLF, gradient descent, tessellation, jostle, interlock → ZERO improvement
- All 13+ algorithmic approaches converged to same score
- The baseline is at an EXTREMELY strong local optimum

### KEY INSIGHT:
The gap to target (1.45 points) is LARGE. Micro-optimizations won't work.
Top competitors run bbox3 for HOURS/DAYS, not 10 minutes.

## ⛔ FORBIDDEN (WILL BE REJECTED)
- Creating "improved" ensembles that modify verified working solutions without STRICT validation
- Any approach that changes coordinates without Kaggle-level validation
- Submitting files that haven't been verified to pass Kaggle's overlap check
- Running bbox3 for only 10 minutes (NOT ENOUGH TIME)

## ✅ NEXT EXPERIMENT: EXTENDED C++ OPTIMIZATION (4-8 HOURS)

The single highest-leverage action is running bbox3 for EXTENDED time.

### STEP 1: Get bbox3 from "Why Not" kernel
The "Why Not" kernel (research/kernels/jazivxt_why-not/) has advanced bbox3 with:
- Complex Number Vector Coordination
- Fluid Dynamics simulation
- Hinge Pivot optimization
- Global Boundary Tension

Extract and compile bbox3.cpp from the kernel.

### STEP 2: Run for EXTENDED time (4+ hours)
```bash
# Run with aggressive parameters for HOURS, not minutes
./bbox3 -i /home/submission/submission.csv -o optimized.csv -n 2000 -r 96

# Let it run for at least 4 hours
# Monitor progress periodically
```

### STEP 3: Validate STRICTLY before submission
```python
# CRITICAL: Use Kaggle-level validation with integer scaling
from decimal import Decimal, getcontext
getcontext().prec = 50
SCALE = 10**18

def validate_kaggle_level(trees):
    # Convert to integer-scaled coordinates
    # Check for ANY overlap (area > 0)
    # Only accept if ZERO overlaps
    pass

# Compare to exp_022 per-N
# Only keep N values that BOTH improve AND pass strict validation
# Fall back to exp_022 for any N that fails validation
```

### STEP 4: Create hybrid submission
- For each N: use optimized if (improved AND passes validation), else use exp_022
- Verify final submission passes validation
- Only submit if total score improves

## Alternative Approach: Investigate N=24

exp_007 found a dramatically better N=24 (0.348 improvement) but it had NaN values.
If extended optimization doesn't help after 4+ hours, investigate:
1. What made N=24 so much better in exp_007?
2. Can we reconstruct a valid N=24 solution with similar quality?
3. Focus bbox3 specifically on N=24 for extended time

## What NOT to Try
- ❌ More ensemble variations (we've exhausted external sources)
- ❌ More algorithmic approaches (13+ already failed)
- ❌ Short optimization runs (10 minutes is NOT enough)
- ❌ Modifying exp_022 without strict Kaggle-level validation

## Success Criteria
- Score improves by > 0.01 from 70.316492
- Solution passes Kaggle validation (no overlaps)
- Per-N improvements are validated individually before inclusion

## IMPORTANT: Validation Requirements

Before ANY submission, verify:
1. All N values have correct number of trees
2. No NaN values in any coordinates
3. All coordinates pass integer-scaled overlap check (SCALE=10^18)
4. Compare hash to exp_022 - if different, validate EVERY changed N value

The current /home/submission/submission.csv is exp_022 (hash: f5c4acd82c8d7ad64c55ce72983219e7).
DO NOT modify it unless the new solution passes ALL validation checks.
