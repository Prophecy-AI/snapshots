## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.316492 from exp_022
- Best LB score: 70.316492 (exp_022 passed Kaggle)
- Target: 68.866853 | Gap to target: 1.45 points (2.1%)

## CRITICAL DISCOVERY: SUBMISSION FILES WERE DIFFERENT!

**The submissions exp_033, exp_035, exp_036 were NOT the same as exp_022!**

Analysis revealed:
- exp_022 hash: f5c4acd82c8d7ad64c55ce72983219e7
- exp_033 hash: 1495ba86dc8497b0c9c19baddd4ca5cf (DIFFERENT!)
- exp_035 hash: da9e98be6980f3c1f493f04ac0b2526b (DIFFERENT!)

This explains why they failed - they were modified versions, not the original exp_022.

## Current Submission: Hybrid Approach

Created a hybrid submission:
- Uses exp_022 for all N values EXCEPT N=105
- Uses exp_010's N=105 (which passed Kaggle validation)
- Score: 70.316492 (same as exp_022 since N=105 has same bbox)

## Submission Log
| Exp | Approach | CV | LB | Notes |
|-----|----------|----|----|-------|
| 001 | baseline | 70.615 | 70.615 | PASSED |
| 010 | safe_ensemble | 70.365 | 70.365 | PASSED |
| 016 | mega_ensemble | 70.354 | 70.354 | PASSED |
| 019 | comprehensive | 70.343 | 70.343 | PASSED |
| 022 | extended_cpp | 70.316 | 70.316 | PASSED - BEST! |
| 037 | hybrid | 70.316 | pending | Uses exp_010's N=105 |

## Response to Evaluator

The evaluator correctly identified that:
1. The original exp_022 passed Kaggle with LB 70.316492
2. Extended C++ optimization hasn't been fully explored
3. The gap to target (1.45 points) is significant

However, the key insight is that the subsequent submissions were NOT the same file as exp_022. They were modified versions that introduced overlaps.

## Next Steps

1. **SUBMIT the hybrid submission** - This should pass since it uses exp_010's N=105
2. **If it passes, continue with extended C++ optimization**
3. **If it fails, investigate which N values are causing issues**

## Long-term Strategy

Once we have a reliable submission process:
1. **Extended C++ optimization** - Run bbox3 for 4-8 hours
2. **Per-N specialization** - Focus on N values with most improvement potential
3. **Ensemble from multiple sources** - Combine best per-N from all experiments

## Key Insight

The gap to target (1.45 points) requires:
1. Extended compute (hours/days of C++ optimization)
2. Novel algorithms not yet discovered
3. Private techniques not publicly available

The top public LB is ~69.99, which is 0.32 points better than our best. This suggests the target may require techniques beyond what's publicly available.

## What NOT to Try
- Angle normalization (this BREAKS the solution)
- Creating new files without verifying they match exp_022
- Assuming submissions are identical without checking hashes
