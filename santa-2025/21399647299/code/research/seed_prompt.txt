## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.316492 from exp_022 (extended_cpp_optimization)
- Best LB score: 70.316492 from exp_022 (VERIFIED)
- Target: 68.866853 | Gap to target: 1.45 points (2.1%)
- Submissions: 17/100 used, 83 remaining

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: SUBMISSION FAILURE ROOT CAUSE

**Last submission (exp_035) failed with "Overlapping trees in group 105"**

**ROOT CAUSE:** Angle normalization (converting angles to [0, 360)) CHANGED the solution and introduced overlaps.
- Original exp_022 had 387 angles outside [0, 360) range
- Original exp_022 PASSED Kaggle with LB 70.316492
- **DO NOT NORMALIZE ANGLES** - it breaks the solution

**CURRENT STATE:** The original exp_022 submission (with angles outside [0,360)) is now restored to /home/submission/submission.csv

## Response to Evaluator

The evaluator correctly identified:
1. Last 3 submissions failed - NOW UNDERSTOOD (angle normalization issue)
2. exp_007 recovery - INVESTIGATED: exp_007 is actually WORSE than exp_022 (the 70.26573 score was incorrect due to NaN in N=24 being counted as 0)
3. Extended C++ optimization - Already ran for 576 seconds with 50K iterations, found only 0.000000319 improvement

## Experiment Summary (36 experiments completed)

| Category | Count | Result |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Binary (bbox3/sa_fast) | 5 | Converged to 70.316 |
| Ensemble | 10 | Best: 70.316 |
| Novel algorithms | 11 | ALL found ZERO improvement |

**Novel algorithms tried (ALL FAILED):**
- NFP placement, Genetic algorithm, Branch-and-bound, Lattice packing
- Interlock patterns, Jostle algorithm, Bottom-left-fill
- Constraint programming, Gradient density flow, Asymmetric tessellation

## ⛔ FORBIDDEN (PROVEN INEFFECTIVE)
- ❌ Angle normalization - CAUSES OVERLAPS
- ❌ bbox3/SA with more iterations - 576 sec found 0.000000319 improvement
- ❌ Ensemble from external sources - ALL exhausted, baseline is BETTER
- ❌ Any of the 11 novel algorithms above - ALL found ZERO improvement
- ❌ exp_007 recovery - It's actually WORSE than exp_022

## ✅ IMMEDIATE ACTION: VERIFY SUBMISSION

The original exp_022 submission is restored. Verify it passes local validation:

```python
# Verify NO angle normalization was applied
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('/home/submission/submission.csv')
outside = sum(1 for _, row in df.iterrows() 
              if float(str(row['deg']).replace('s', '')) < 0 
              or float(str(row['deg']).replace('s', '')) >= 360)
assert outside == 387, "Original exp_022 should have 387 angles outside [0,360)"
```

## ✅ NEXT EXPERIMENT: EXTENDED BBOX3 (MAXIMUM DURATION)

Top competitors run bbox3 for DAYS. Our 576-second run is insufficient.

```bash
mkdir -p /home/code/experiments/036_extended_bbox3_max
cd /home/code/experiments/036_extended_bbox3_max

# Run for maximum available time
# Use -t for time limit in seconds
# Use -n for iterations (very high)
# Use -r for restarts (very high)
timeout 7200 ../bbox3 -i /home/submission/submission.csv -o optimized.csv \
    -n 200000 -r 1000 2>&1 | tee bbox3.log

# After completion, compare per-N scores
# Keep only N values where we improved
```

## ✅ ALTERNATIVE: MILP FOR SMALL N

Mixed-Integer Linear Programming can find globally optimal solutions:

```python
# Test on N=5, N=10 first
# If it beats baseline for small N, scale up
from ortools.linear_solver import pywraplp

def solve_milp_packing(n_trees):
    # Formulate as MILP with non-overlap constraints
    # Use big-M formulation for disjunctive constraints
    pass
```

## ✅ ALTERNATIVE: DIFFUSION MODEL APPROACH

GFPack++ paper shows diffusion models can find solutions that local search cannot:
- Learn placement distribution from training data
- Generate novel configurations
- May escape local optima

## Submission Strategy

1. **VERIFY** original exp_022 submission is correct (387 angles outside [0,360))
2. **RUN** extended bbox3 for maximum duration
3. **COMPARE** per-N scores with baseline
4. **SUBMIT** any improvements found
5. **TRACK** which N values improved

## Key Rules

1. **DO NOT NORMALIZE ANGLES** - it breaks the solution
2. **DO NOT run short optimizations** - need hours, not minutes
3. **DO NOT try algorithms that already failed** - 11 novel algorithms all found ZERO improvement
4. **DO track per-N improvements** - even small gains accumulate

## Success Criteria

- Any improvement over 70.316492 is progress
- Even 0.01 improvement is valuable
- Focus on extended compute time (hours, not minutes)
- The target may require resources beyond this session, but NEVER GIVE UP
