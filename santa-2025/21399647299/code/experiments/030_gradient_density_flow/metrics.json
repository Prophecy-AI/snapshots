  "notes": "Gradient-based density flow optimization tested multiple approaches: numerical gradient descent, physics simulation with spring forces, fresh start configurations (hexagonal, spiral, grid), and exhaustive N=1 optimization. NONE found any improvement over the baseline. The baseline is already at a very strong local optimum with ~70% packing efficiency. The gap to target (1.44 points) requires fundamentally different approaches that we have not yet discovered."
