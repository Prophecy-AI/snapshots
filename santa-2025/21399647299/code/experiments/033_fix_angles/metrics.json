  "notes": "Fixed angle normalization issue. The current submission had 387 angles outside [0, 360) range. Restored exp_022 submission with normalized angles. Integer validation (SCALE=10^12) is TOO STRICT - it detects 131 overlaps that Kaggle doesn't consider overlaps. Float validation with tolerance 1e-9 shows ZERO overlaps, which matches Kaggle's behavior. The exp_022 submission (LB 70.316492) is valid and has been restored."
