    "Large N solutions (100, 150, 200) use bimodal angle distribution (~67° and ~247°)",

    "Minimum tree width is at 23° (0.6444), not 67°",
    "Minimum bbox is at 45° (0.8132)",
    "Grid spacing is around 0.55-0.60 for large N",
    "Average slack is 74.7% - most trees are NOT on boundary",
    "Only N=1, 2, 4 have zero slack (fully constrained)",
    "Fresh tessellation configurations have overlaps at tight spacings",
    "Boundary tree optimization found ZERO improvement",

  "notes": "Asymmetric tessellation optimization analyzed the bimodal pattern in baseline solutions and tried multiple approaches: (1) Creating checkerboard tessellations from scratch with alternating angles - all had overlaps at tight spacings. (2) Optimizing boundary trees that determine the bbox - found ZERO improvement. (3) Enforcing bimodal angles on existing solution - found ZERO improvement. (4) Slack analysis showed 74.7% of trees are not on boundary, but they are still constrained by neighbors. The baseline is at an EXTREMELY strong local optimum that cannot be improved by any of these approaches."
