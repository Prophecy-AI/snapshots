  "notes": "Constraint Programming with OR-Tools tested on N=3,4,5,6,7,8. The CP solver found solutions but ALL had overlaps because the Manhattan distance constraint is too simple for the complex tree polygon shape. The tree has 15 vertices and irregular geometry that cannot be accurately modeled with simple distance constraints. Would need full NFP (No-Fit Polygon) constraints which are computationally expensive to precompute for all angle combinations."
