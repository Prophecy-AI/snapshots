    "### The Core Problem\n",
    "We are at a **strong local optimum** at 70.316492. All local search methods (SA, exhaustive, NFP, backward propagation) cannot escape this optimum.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why the Gap Exists\n",
    "1. **Top teams have 900+ submissions** - They've accumulated per-N improvements over weeks\n",
    "2. **We have 43 experiments** - Much less exploration\n",
    "3. **The gap is 1.455 points** - This is 2.07% improvement needed\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Could Work\n",
    "1. **More diverse starting points** - Different initial configurations\n",
    "2. **Per-N specialization** - Focus on specific N values that have room for improvement\n",
    "3. **Longer optimization runs** - Hours instead of minutes\n",
    "4. **Novel algorithms** - Something fundamentally different from SA/bbox3\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Reality\n",
    "The target of 68.861114 is the **#1 score on the leaderboard**. Achieving this requires:\n",
    "- Either finding a breakthrough algorithm\n",
    "- Or accumulating many small improvements over hundreds of submissions\n",
    "\n",
    "With 80 submissions remaining, we can still make progress, but we need to be strategic."
