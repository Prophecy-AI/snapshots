Although there are no stairs, elevators, escalators, tunnels, chutes, teleporters, firepoles, or conduits here that would take you deeper into the North Pole base, there*is*a ventilation duct. You jump in.\nAfter bumping around for a few minutes, you emerge into a large, well-lit cavern full of Christmas trees!\nThere are a few Elves here frantically decorating before the deadline. They think they'll be able to finish most of the work, but the one thing they're worried about is the*presents*for all the young Elves that live here at the North Pole. It's an ancient tradition to put the presents under the trees, but the Elves are worried they won't*fit*.\nThe presents come in a few standard but very weird shapes. The shapes and the regions into which they need to fit are all measured in standard*units*. To be aesthetically pleasing, the presents need to be placed into the regions in a way that follows a standardized two-dimensional unit grid; you also can't stack presents.\nAs always, the Elves have a summary of the situation (your puzzle input) for you. First, it contains a list of the presents' shapes. Second, it contains the size of the region under each tree and a list of the number of presents of each shape that need to fit into that region. For example:\n```\n`0:\n###\n##.\n##.\n1:\n###\n##.\n.##\n2:\n.##\n###\n##.\n3:\n##.\n###\n##.\n4:\n###\n#..\n###\n5:\n###\n.#.\n###\n4x4: 0 0 0 0 2 0\n12x5: 1 0 1 0 2 2\n12x5: 1 0 1 0 3 2`\n```\nThe first section lists the standard present*shapes*. For convenience, each shape starts with its*index*and a colon; then, the shape is displayed visually, where`#`is part of the shape and`.`is not.\nThe second section lists the*regions*under the trees. Each line starts with the width and length of the region;`12x5`means the region is`12`units wide and`5`units long. The rest of the line describes the presents that need to fit into that region by listing the*quantity of each shape*of present;`1 0 1 0 3 2`means you need to fit one present with shape index 0, no presents with shape index 1, one present with shape index 2, no presents with shape index 3, three presents with shape index 4, and two presents with shape index 5.\nPresents can be*rotated and flipped*as necessary to make them fit in the available space, but they have to always be placed perfectly on the grid. Shapes can't overlap (that is, the`#`part from two different presents can't go in the same place on the grid), but they*can*fit together (that is, the`.`part in a present's shape's diagram does not block another present from occupying that space on the grid).\nThe Elves need to know*how many of the regions*can fit the presents listed. In the above example, there are six unique present shapes and three regions that need checking.\nThe first region is 4x4:\n```\n`....\n....\n....\n....`\n```\nIn it, you need to determine whether you could fit two presents that have shape index`4`:\n```\n`###\n#..\n###`\n```\nAfter some experimentation, it turns out that you*can*fit both presents in this region. Here is one way to do it, using`A`to represent one present and`B`to represent the other:\n```\n`AAA.\nABAB\nABAB\n.BBB`\n```\nThe second region,`12x5: 1 0 1 0 2 2`, is`12`units wide and`5`units long. In that region, you need to try to fit one present with shape index`0`, one present with shape index`2`, two presents with shape index`4`, and two presents with shape index`5`.\nIt turns out that these presents*can*all fit in this region. Here is one way to do it, again using different capital letters to represent all the required presents:\n```\n`....AAAFFE.E\n.BBBAAFFFEEE\nDDDBAAFFCECE\nDBBB....CCC.\nDDD.....C.C.`\n```\nThe third region,`12x5: 1 0 1 0 3 2`, is the same size as the previous region; the only difference is that this region needs to fit one additional present with shape index`4`. Unfortunately, no matter how hard you try, there is*no way to fit all of the presents*into this region.\nSo, in this example,`*2*`regions can fit all of their listed presents.\nConsider the regions beneath each tree and the presents the Elves would like to fit into each of them.*How many of the regions can fit all of the presents listed?*\nTo play, please identify yourself via one of these services:\n[[GitHub]](https://adventofcode.com/auth/github)[[Google]](https://adventofcode.com/auth/google)[[Twitter]](https://adventofcode.com/auth/twitter)[[Reddit]](https://adventofcode.com/auth/reddit)-[[How Does Auth Work?]](https://adventofcode.com/2025/about#faq_auth)",

      "text": "Treegonometry: The Math Behind the Perfect Christmas Tree &#8211; VisitMath Project[Skip to content](#content)\nMain Menu\n# Treegonometry: The Math Behind the Perfect Christmas Tree\nBy[logopsycom](https://visitmath.eu/author/logopsycom/)/20/12/2023\nAs the holiday season approaches, the quest for the perfect Christmas tree becomes an annual tradition for many. While the selection process often involves considerations of size, shape, and overall aesthetics, there is a surprising amount of mathematics involved in creating the ideal festive centrepiece. \u201cTreegonometry\u201d is a term coined to describe the mathematical principles used to design the perfect Christmas tree. In this article, we\u2019ll delve into the world of treegonometry, exploring the specific mathematical formulas that contribute to the creation of a flawless holiday icon.\nTwo University of Sheffield students, Nicole Wrightham and Alex Craig have unveiled a formula that promises to guide the meticulous decoration of your Christmas tree:\n\u2022Number of baubles = h \u221a17 / 20\nThis formula, linear in the height of the tree (h), has raised eyebrows and led to intriguing discussions within the mathematical community.This is because a distribution on a linear surface in height would only be uneven as the height varies: tall trees would appear too bare, and short trees too covered! Let\u2019s take a closer look at it in order to attempt to demystify the rationale behind it.\n![](https://visitmath.eu/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/eugenivy_now-uCil1eMg5Bg-unsplash-1024x683.jpg)Photo by \u0404\u0432\u0433\u0435\u043d\u0456\u044f\u0412\u0438\u0441\u043e\u0447\u0438\u043d\u0430on Unsplash\nTo achieve a more accurate representation, the initial formula, which was linear in h, must consider the baubles\u2019 surface density (\u03c3) in the context of the tree\u2019s cone shape. Essentially, the parameter \u03c3represents how decorated a tree is with baubles: high \u03c3values will result in very covered trees, and low sigma values will result in bare trees. Afterwards, we will estimate the \u03c3value to have a balanced tree (neither too covered nor too bare). Now, let\u2019s try to express the formula for the number of baubles as a function of \u03c3and height. Since the lateral surface of the cone is \u03c0r \u221a(r\u00b2+h\u00b2), we can represent our distribution as the number of baubles equal to \u03c3\u03c0r \u221a(r\u00b2+h\u00b2). Let\u2019s now try to express the dependence only on height, namely by writing the radius as a function of height. In general, there are more squat cones and more slender cones, so it would be impossible to express the radius generally in height only. However, dealing with trees rather than abstract cones, we enjoy some constancy in the angle at the vertex, which we can more or less expect. An average Christmas tree has a (half) opening angle of about 21 \u00b14\u00b0, so its radius it\u2019s r = h tan (21 \u00b14\u00b0) = h (0.38 \u00b10.08), hence:\n\u2022Number of baubles = \u03c3\u03c0r \u221a(r\u00b2+h\u00b2) = \u03c3\u03c0h (0.38 \u00b10.08) \u221a(h\u00b2 (0.38 \u00b10.08)\u00b2+h\u00b2) =\n= \u03c3\u03c0h (0.38 \u00b10.08) h\u221a((0.38 \u00b10.08)\u00b2+1) = \u03c3\u03c0h\u00b2 (0.38 \u00b10.08)\u221a((0.38 \u00b10.08)\u00b2+1)\nSo we need an estimate for the value (0.38 \u00b10.08)\u221a((0.38 \u00b10.08)\u00b2+1), and it is taking the mean 0.38\u221a((0.38)\u00b2+1)=0.41\nSo the (mean) number of baubles is equal to: \u03c3\u03c0h\u00b2 0.41\nThe improved formula suggests that the number of baubles required is proportional to 0.41 times the surface density, multiplied by \u03c0and the square of the tree\u2019s height. But what\u2019s the value of that density? If our tree has a height of 200cm and a radius of 73cm, according to the original formula, we should use 41 baubles, so its density is 8.4 baubles per square meter. Converting that value in cm would lead to the final \u201cbaubles formula\u201d:\nNumber of baubles = (0.00108 \u00b10.00025) h\u00b2 (with h in cm!)\n![](https://visitmath.eu/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/jess-bailey-nxIBXqmUOu8-unsplash-1024x768.jpg)Photo by Jess Bailey on Unsplash\nAs you stand in awe of your beautifully adorned Christmas tree this holiday season, take a moment to appreciate the mathematical precision that contributes to its perfection. Treegonometry not only enhances the tree\u2019s visual appeal but also ensures that it stands proudly, embodying the spirit of the season with a touch of mathematical elegance.\nWhat do Treegonometry and VisitMath project have in common? Maths is everywhere, so we can learn by visiting famous monuments and interesting cities and studying what surrounds us more closely.\nMerry Christmas and a Happy New Year from VisitMath!\nScroll to Top",

With our method, kids learn how to graph and draw their own shapes, enhancing the learning process.\n\n![Christmas tree tessellations, two examples plus templates.](https://www.whatdowedoallday.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/tree-tessellations-top.jpg)\n\n## Table of contents\n\n- [Materials](https://www.whatdowedoallday.com/christmas-tree-tessellations/#h-materials)\n- [Simple Triangle Tessellations](https://www.whatdowedoallday.com/christmas-tree-tessellations/#h-simple-triangle-tessellations)\n- [Christmas Tree Shape Tessellations](https://www.whatdowedoallday.com/christmas-tree-tessellations/#h-christmas-tree-shape-tessellations)\n- [More Christmas Math Art](https://www.whatdowedoallday.com/christmas-tree-tessellations/#h-more-christmas-math-art)\n\n**Quick review:** A tessellation is a repetitive patterns of\u00a0shapes that fit perfectly together across a 2-dimensional plane of space. The tessellated shape can be regular, as are these Christmas tessellations, or irregular, as are the shapes in our [original tessellations activity post and video](https://www.whatdowedoallday.com/math-art-tessellations/).\n\nWe made Christmas tessellations using simple triangles, as well as traditional fir or pine tree shapes. The concept of how to tessellate each pattern is the same, so once kids understand how it works they will want to experiment!\n\n## Materials\n\n- Graph paper\n- Plain white paper, such as art or construction paper\n- Scissors\n- Pencil\n- Ruler\n- Markers, colored pencils, crayons, for coloring and decorating the trees\n\n![Christmas Tessellation supplies including graph paper with shapes drawn on it, cut out templates, pencil, ruler and scissors.](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201200%20800'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\n**MORE:** Decorate trees with DIY [tomten garlands](https://www.whatdowedoallday.com/tomten-garland/) and [\"unwoven\" paper hearts](https://www.whatdowedoallday.com/swedish-christmas-craft-for-kids/)\n\n## Simple Triangle Tessellations\n\nMaking Christmas tree tessellations with an isosceles triangle is the easiest way, so we will start with that.\n\nOn the graph paper, draw an isosceles triangle. An isosceles triangle has two equal sides. In our photos you can see examples of two different isosceles triangles we used as our pattern.\n\nTo form an isosceles triangle, draw a rectangle or square on the graph paper. Any size will do; it can be tall or squat, your choice. The top point of the triangle starts in the midpoint in the top side of the rectangle. Draw two lines, one each from the top point to each of the bottom corners of the rectangle. Ta da!\n\nNow, cut out the triangle. This will be the template for the tessellation. If you wish, glue it to a piece of heavy paper or card stock and cut on the outline to have a sturdier template.\n\n![Triangle tessellation in progress with template and markers.](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201200%20699'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\nPlace the triangle template on your white paper and draw the outline of the triangle. Then, move the template over and line up the bottom edge with the triangle you just drew. Continue in this manner until you have a line of triangles.\n\nAt this point, savvy kids will realize that the space between the triangles is exactly the same shape as their template, only upside down. They will be quick to understand how to fill the paper with this new, groovy tessellation pattern.\n\nThe next row of triangles can either sit evenly atop the first row, or they can be staggered. The tessellations will work either way so kids can make their own decisions how to do it. And we all know kids love to make their own decision!\n\nColor each triangle individually and give them trunks, if desired. Or, group triangles together to form larger trees ( _shown below_)! Note that if the rows of triangles are staggered, they can't be confined into a larger triangle-shaped tree.\n\n![Two triangle Christmas tree tessellation with stars.](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201200%20855'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\nGrouping the tessellated Christmas trees into a larger triangle shape is a great way to turn the activity into a collaborative project, with each young math artist making one or more triangles to contribute to the Christmas tree. Perhaps your tree will be as big as [our family Christmas tree art project](https://www.whatdowedoallday.com/diy-christmas-tree/)!\n\n![Christmas tree tessellation in large triangle shape.](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201159%201323'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\n## Christmas Tree Shape Tessellations\n\nThis slightly fancier tree shape based on fir or pine tree shapes takes a bit more skill to draw, but it's still easy!\n\nBegin by counting out a rectangle on graph paper with an x-axis of 10 squares and a y-axis of 12 squares. Make a dot at the mid point of the top line (5,12). That is the tippy top of the tree.\n\n![Christmas tree tessellation with template](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201200%20887'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\nDraw lines from:\n\n- (0,0) to (2,3)\n- (2,3) to (1,3)\n- (1,3) to (3,6)\n- (3,6) to (2,6)\n- (2,6) to (4,9)\n- (4,9) to (3,9)\n- (3,9) to (5,12)\n\nThe connected lines will form the left side of the tree. Kids can now use this pattern to determine how to form the right side of the tree. ( _Make them work their brains a little to figure it out!_) See the image above in the materials section for an example.\n\nFinally cut out the Christmas tree template and follow the instructions as f...",

Formally, a tiling is a collection of disjoint open sets, the closures of which cover\nthe plane. Given a single tile, the so-called first [corona](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Corona.html)\nis the set of all tiles that have a common boundary point with the tile (including\nthe original tile itself).\n\n[Wang's conjecture](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/WangsConjecture.html) (1961) stated that if a set of tiles tiled the plane, then they could always be arranged to do so periodically.\nA periodic tiling of the [plane](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Plane.html) by [polygons](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Polygon.html)\nor [space](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Space.html) by [polyhedra](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Polyhedron.html) is\ncalled a [tessellation](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Tessellation.html). The conjecture was refuted\nin 1966 when R.\u00a0Berger showed that an aperiodic set of tiles exists. By 1971, R.\u00a0Robinson had reduced the\nnumber to six and, in 1974, R.\u00a0Penrose discovered an aperiodic set (when color-matching\nrules are included) of two tiles: the so-called [Penrose\\\ntiles](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/PenroseTiles.html).

      "title": "The maths of Christmas - BBC Bitesize",
      "text": "## OK, OK - Maths may not sound like the most Christmassy of subjects.\n\nBut a bit of adding up and multiplying can actually make one of the [traditions of the festive season](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/articles/zrpnp4j) feel a little less stressful, help the environment and, perhaps even more amazingly, answer an age old question on Santa\u2019s Christmas Eve shift.\n\nReady to dive in? Let\u2019s start with wrapping paper.\n\n## Reduce your giftwrap wastage\n\nMathematician Dr Sara Santos developed a formula for wrapping square presents which doesn\u2019t just reduce waste, it also helps match patterns together at the join. She shared this technique on The One Show in 2012.\n\nThe exact formula Dr Santos uses may look a bit complicated when written down. It\u2019s:\n\n### 1/2 (d+2h+w)\u00b2 = 2(w+h)\u00b2\n\nNot just complicated, terrifying even. But you don\u2019t need to double up on fingers and toes to work it out. Here\u2019s the step-by-step method:\n\nFirstly, take your square gift and measure the diagonal of its largest side in centimetres (if it\u2019s a cube, measure the diagonal of any side).\n\n![](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/976xn/p07ycwtw.png)\n\nImage caption,\n\nDr Sara Santos' method of wrapping gifts can even help the pattern match up\n\nAdd this measurement to one-and-a-half times the present\u2019s height. The result is the measurement in cm you\u2019re going to use for the four sides of a square on your wrapping paper (so if the result of your sum is 28, you\u2019re going to measure out a 28 x 28 cm square on your giftwrap).\n\nCut out the square. Then, place your gift diagonally in the centre of the paper. When viewed from above, your gift will look like a diamond inside a square.\n\nBring in the four corners and then fold in the tabs that are created. If you are using a simple patterned paper, such as a stripe, these should also match up at the joins.\n\nPop on a bow and a gift tag and there\u2019s one perfectly wrapped present.\n\nDr Santos\u2019s formula also works for oblong presents - except it won\u2019t make the pattern match up.\n\n## The perfect bauble ratio\n\nIf you want your Christmas tree to look as aesthetically pleasing as possible, take a tip from Sheffield University Maths Society (SUMS for short). They developed a series of formulae to stop your creation in the corner of the living room looking too cluttered. Just make sure you have the height of your tree handy.\n\nPi - or \u03c0 - (approximately 3.141592) is not only a mathematical device useful for measuring circles, it works with tinsel and tree lights too.\n\n![](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/976xn/p07ycx6j.png)\n\nImage caption,\n\nSheffield University Maths Society (SUMS) has devised a series of formulae to maximise your Christmas decoration mission\n\nYou\u2019ll need a calculator for the next bit. For the amount of tinsel required to go round your tree, multilpy \u03c0 by 13, then divide it by eight. Multiply the result by the height (in cm) of your tree. Your answer is the optimum length of tinsel, in cm, that will look smashing draped around the branches.\n\nIt\u2019s a little easier to work out how many tree lights are required. Multiply the height of your tree, in cm, by \u03c0 to reveal the best length, also in cm.\n\nYou won\u2019t need \u03c0 for your baubles. Instead, SUMS suggest you first take the square root of 17 (around 4.123) and divide it by 20. Multiply the result by the height of your tree in cm. This gives the number of baubles which are just right for arranging in regularly spaced gaps around the pine needles (whether they\u2019re fake or not).\n\nAnd last but not least, the Christmas star at the top. That height of the tree you\u2019re still keeping handy? Divide it by 10. Hey presto, the perfect height of your Christmas star. In centimetres.\n\n## Santa\u2019s big night\n\nBut now it\u2019s time for the ultimate festive headscratcher. How does Father Christmas find the time to deliver all those presents to so many nice, well-behaved children in just one evening? He must have to maintain a massive average speed in miles per hour.\n\nWe all know there\u2019s a bit of magic involved because Santa has sackfuls of it, protecting him, his elves, his reindeer, sleigh and all the presents loaded upon it from the incredibly swift speeds they have to operate by.\n\nLuckily, Santa maths expert Larry Silverberg, a professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering at North Carolina State University in America has, with the help of his students, been able to weave in a bit of number crunching around the elf-powered amazingness. They revealed their findings in a much-quoted study from 2006.\n\n![](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/976xn/p07ycxxw.png)\n\nImage caption,\n\nProfessor Larry Silverberg and his students devised this sum to determine Santa's average speed. And that's some speed\n\nFather Christmas has just 24 hours to complete his deliveries. In that time, Prof Silverberg and his students have worked out he must deliver gifts to an estimated 200m excited youngsters. They\u2019re spread over an area of 200m square miles and 75m homes.\n\nWith an average distance between each home of 1.63 miles, that means the man in the red suit has a beard-quaking 122m miles to cover. In 24 hours.\n\nBut we\u2019re forgetting that this is all possible through Christmas magic. To complete his shift and be back with Mrs Claus in time to open his own stocking, Santa\u2019s sleigh would need to travel at 5,083,000 mph. It\u2019s fast, but not the fastest thing around. Light travels at 669,600,000 mph, 130 times faster than Santa would need to travel at to get all those presents delivered.\n\nNow, this is the science bit. Light already exists, and moves at a proven speed. Therefore, it must be possible for something to move slower than the speed of light. And because Santa exists, and has magical powers, it\u2019s perfectly plausible he can do just that.\n\nSo don\u2019t worry if you can\u2019t spot that sleigh in the sky on Christmas Eve. It will be going so fast, you won\u2019t be able to see it. But it is there. Promise.\n\n[Five Christmas mysteries unwrapped](https://www.bbc.com/bitesize/articles/z42fpg8)\n\nHave you ever wondered what makes Christmas so Christmassy?
