      "query": "What are the best algorithms for 2D irregular polygon packing?",
      "finding": "Two\u2011dimensional irregular\u2011polygon packing is usually tackled with a hierarchy of exact, constructive\u2011heuristic and meta\u2011heuristic methods, each exploiting the geometry\u2011specific tool **no\u2011fit polygons (NFPs)** to test feasibility.  The most widely\u2011cited exact approaches (e.g., branch\u2011and\u2011bound or mixed\u2011integer programming) guarantee optimality but scale only to very small instances, so practical solvers rely on fast NFP generation \u2013 the \u201csliding\u201d algorithm that improves classic NFP construction is a common backbone for many heuristics\u30103\u3011.  Among constructive heuristics, the **bottom\u2011left (BL) placement** combined with a carefully ordered item list remains a simple yet powerful baseline; extensions such as the **Djang\u2011Finch (DJD) selection heuristic** paired with BL have shown significant gains on convex\u2011polygon benchmarks\u30108\u3011.  For larger, industrial\u2011scale problems, **local\u2011search** and **genetic algorithms** dominate: an extended local\u2011search scheme that embeds a nonlinear\u2011programming s",

      "finding": "Based on recent research that combines rigid\u2011body dynamics with learning\u2011based decision making, you can set up a physics\u2011simulation workflow for packing irregular polygons (or 3D shapes) as follows\u202f([Dynamics simulation\u2011based packing of irregular 3D objects](https://quaoar.su/files/papers/nesting/1-s2.0-S0097849324001316-main.pdf);\u202f[Learning Physically Realizable Skills for Online Packing of General 3D Shapes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02094)):\n\n1. **Prepare the geometry and simulation environment**  \n   - Export each irregular polygon (or polyhedron) as a mesh file (e.g.,\u202fOBJ or STL).  \n   - Load the meshes into a rigid\u2011body physics engine (e.g., PyBullet, PhysX, or the `environment/physics0` module provided in the IR\u2011BPP GitHub repository\u202f([IR\u2011BPP](https://github.com/alexfrom0815/IR-BPP))).  \n   - Define a container as a static rigid body with the desired dimensions.\n\n2. **Generate initial placement candidates**  \n   - Use fast heuristic strategies (e.g., bottom\u2011left\u2011fill, skyline, ",
