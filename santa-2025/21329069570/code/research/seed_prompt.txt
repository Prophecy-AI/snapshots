## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.618925 from ensemble_repair (exp_003)
- Best LB score: 70.647327 (from exp_000 baseline)
- Target: 68.891380 | Gap to target: 1.73 points (2.5%)

## CRITICAL FINDING: WE ARE AT A STRONG LOCAL OPTIMUM

**All optimization approaches have FAILED to improve beyond 70.62:**
- SA optimizer (sa_v1_parallel): No improvement after 3+ generations
- bbox3 optimizer: No improvement with any n,r combination (tested n=[1000-2000], r=[30-90])
- fix_direction rotation tightening: 0 improvement
- Differential evolution on small N: Found WORSE solutions than current

**The current solution is at a STRONG local optimum that standard optimization cannot escape.**

## CV-LB Relationship Analysis
- CV-LB alignment is PERFECT (gap = 0.0000)
- Any CV improvement will directly translate to LB improvement
- The problem is NOT distribution shift - it's that we're stuck in a local optimum

## Response to Evaluator
The evaluator correctly identified that:
1. Standard SA/local search has hit its limits
2. The solution is at a local optimum
3. We need fundamentally different approaches

I agree with all points. The 3-phase bbox3 approach and fix_direction were tried but produced ZERO improvement. The ensemble approach with overlap repair gave a tiny improvement (0.0086 points) but we're still 1.72 points from target.

**The evaluator's suggestion to try per-N ensemble was partially successful** - we found a better solution in snapshots (70.523) but it had overlaps. After repair, we got 70.618925.

## What We've Learned
1. **Pre-optimized solutions are at local optima** - Running more SA/bbox3 iterations is useless
2. **Ensemble helps marginally** - Best-per-N selection with overlap repair gave 0.0086 improvement
3. **The gap is 1.73 points (2.5%)** - This is too large for micro-optimization
4. **Target 68.891380 is BELOW current #1 on LB** - We need novel techniques

## Recommended Approaches (Priority Order)

### 1. **[HIGHEST PRIORITY] Genetic Algorithm with Custom Operators**
Standard SA is stuck. Try evolutionary approach:
- Population of diverse solutions (not just one)
- Custom crossover: swap N-configurations between solutions
- Custom mutation: perturb positions/rotations
- Selection pressure toward lower scores
- This can escape local optima by combining good parts of different solutions

### 2. **[HIGH PRIORITY] Constructive Heuristics from Scratch**
Instead of optimizing existing solutions, BUILD new ones:
- Bottom-left fill algorithm
- Greedy placement with different orderings (by N, by tree size, random)
- Tessellation patterns as starting points
- This creates solutions in DIFFERENT basins of attraction

### 3. **[MEDIUM PRIORITY] Branch-and-Bound for Small N**
For N=1-20, try to find OPTIMAL solutions:
- These contribute 8+ points to total score
- Small enough for exhaustive/near-exhaustive search
- Even small improvements here have high impact

### 4. **[RESEARCH] No-Fit Polygon (NFP) Approach**
Academic literature suggests NFP for efficient packing:
- Precompute collision-free placement regions
- O(1) overlap checks instead of O(n²)
- Enables much faster optimization iterations

## What NOT to Try
- ❌ More SA iterations (already stuck)
- ❌ Different bbox3 parameters (all tested, no improvement)
- ❌ fix_direction (already 0 improvement)
- ❌ Ensemble without overlap repair (creates invalid submissions)

## SUBMISSION STRATEGY
- Remaining submissions: 97
- **SUBMIT AGGRESSIVELY** - We have abundant submissions
- Submit after EVERY experiment to get LB feedback
- Even failed approaches teach us what doesn't work

## Validation Notes
- Use Shapely with STRtree for efficient overlap checking
- Always verify 0 overlaps before submission
- CV = LB for this problem (deterministic scoring)
