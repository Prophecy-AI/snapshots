      "text": "The best algorithms for irregular polygon packing optimization in 2D generally fall into categories such as heuristics, metaheuristics, and exact methods, with recent research emphasizing hybrid approaches. For instance, a hybrid approach combining genetic algorithms with linear programming has shown promising results in optimizing irregular packing problems, effectively handling complex shape arrangements ([MDPI](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/13/22/12474)). Additionally, simulated annealing-based algorithms have been successfully applied to irregular shape packing, demonstrating the ability to improve solutions and update best-known results on benchmark problems ([Sato et al., 2011](https://skoge.folk.ntnu.no/prost/proceedings/ifac11-proceedings/data/html/papers/0563.pdf)). \n\nOther notable methods include local search heuristics and multi-level algorithms that incorporate collision-free regions, which are effective in managing irregular shapes and minimizing waste ([Abeysooriya et al., 2017](https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/415314/1/ICCL17_paper_43.pdf)). Exact algorithms, such as no-fit polygon generation, are also used for precise solutions in stock cutting problems involving irregular shapes ([Adamowicz, 2007](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0377221706001639)). Overall, recent advances favor hybrid algorithms that combine metaheuristics with geometric and nonlinear programming techniques, providing flexible and high-quality solutions for complex irregular polygon packing problems in 2D ([Frontiers](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmech.2022.966691/full)).",

An efficient 2D irregular packing algorithm can effectively improve material utilization and reduce processing costs. The reduction in material consumption will also have a beneficial impact on the environment ([Ke et al., 2020](#B76)). Therefore, research of the packing problem is of great significance for technology and social interest.\nThe 2D packing problem is a type of combinatorial optimization problems to locate parts with different shapes compactly in one or more master sheet material to minimize the occupied space or maximize the utilization of the material. The 2D packing problem is currently recognized as a NP problem, which is mainly solved by heuristic algorithms. In recent years, many scholars have conducted research on 2D irregular packing problems with a verity of solutions.\nThere exists a number of review articles on packing and cutting problems. We have summarized the main review literature in the field of 2D packing and cutting as shown in[Table 1](#T1). Brown ([Brown, 1971](#B17)) introduced an optimum packing and depletion problem with optimization of space and resource usage. Harvey ([Salkin and De Kluyver, 1975](#B116)) surveyed the application of mathematical optimization models such as linear programming to the knapsack problem. Bruce ([Golden, 1976](#B50)) surveyed various approaches to the cutting stock problem. Hinxman ([Hinxman, 1980](#B65)) surveyed the trim-loss and assortment problems, this research paid more attention to cutting and packaging problems in practical applications, and did not mention much about theoretical methods. Garey and Coffman ([Garey and Johnson, 1981](#B47);[Coffman et al., 1984](#B27)) surveyed the approximation algorithms for bin packing problems. Israni ([Israni and Sanders, 1982](#B72)) reviewed the 2D cutting stock problem including almost all 2D packaging problems. The author also proposed a rectangular layout method. Sarin ([Sarin, 1983](#B118)) reviewed methodologies and literature to solve 2D stock cutting problems and introduced an interactive optimization procedure for a general 2D stock cutting problem. Dyckhoff ([Dyckhoff et al., 1985](#B38)) described a trim loss and related problems and categorized them briefly. Dudzi&#x00144;ski ([Dudzi&#x00144;ski and Walukiewicz, 1987](#B36)) summarized the exact methods for knapsack problems, such as linear programming. Matthias ([Rode and Rosenberg, 1987](#B114)) analyzed the algorithm for the trim-loss problems. Haessler ([Haessler and Sweeney, 1991](#B59)) reviewed the solution process of cutting stock problems, including placement algorithm and sequence optimization algorithm. Dowsland ([Dowsland and Dowsland, 1992](#B34)) reviewed the application of operations research methods to the packing problem and summarized some exact heuristics. Sweeney ([Sweeney and Paternoster, 1992](#B128)) categorized cutting and packing problems and made application-oriented research records. Cheng ([Cheng et al., 1994](#B22)) discussed 2D cutting stock problems and their application cases including the pallet loading problem and VLSI placement problem. With the gradual deepening of research on 2D layout problems, typology becomes a common research topic. 2D regular and irregular layout problems are clearly distinguished in practical applications and theoretical methods. Dowsland ([Dowsland and Dowsland, 1995](#B29)) gave a special review of the 2D irregular nesting problem for the first time. Mavridou ([Mavridou and Pardalos, 1997](#B98)) summarized applications of the genetic algorithm and simulated annealing algorithm in the optimization of facility layout problems. Dyckhoff ([Dyckhoff, 1990](#B37)) made a typology of the cutting and packing problems in detail, and W&#x000e4;scher ([W&#x000e4;scher et al., 2007](#B135)) improved the typology later. Hopper ([Hopper and Turton, 1999](#B67);[Hopper and Turton, 2001a](#B68);[Hopper and Turton, 2001b](#B69)) investigated the application of meta-heuristic and heuristic algorithms in 2D and 3D packing problems. Lodi ([Lodi et al., 2002a](#B90);[Lodi et al., 2002b](#B91)) reviewed algorithms proposed in the 1990s of 2D packing problems. Bennell et al. ([Bennell and Oliveira, 2008](#B10);[Bennell and Oliveira, 2009](#B9)) discussed 2D irregular packing problems and related geometric problems. Leao ([Leao et al., 2020](#B81)) introduced the mathematical models in the 2D irregular packing problem.\nTABLE 1\n[![www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/966691/fmech-08-966691-HTML/image_m/fmech-08-966691-t001.jpg)](https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/966691/fmech-08-966691-HTML/image_m/fmech-08-966691-t001.jpg)\n**TABLE 1**.

INTRODUCTION\nCutting and packing are classic problems of finding the\nmost efficient layout for a set of input items out of a\ngiven container with the objective of minimizing the waste\nmaterial. The applications of cutting and packing, e.g.\nclothing, shipbuilding, and furniture industry are numer\u0002ous. W\u00a8ascher et al. (2007) have developed a typology that\nclassifies the nesting problems according to dimension,\nobjective, assortment of item type, as well as the number\nand nature of the container where the items are to be\nallocated. In this paper, we consider the irregular shape\npacking problem, classified as a two-dimensional irregular\nopen dimension problem (ODP).\nThe problem is NP-complete (Fowler et al., 1981) and\nas a result solution methodologies predominantly utilize\nheuristics. Although there are many different solution\napproaches presented in the literature, there appears to\nbe two key strategies for representing and searching the\nsolution space. The first approach represents the solution\nas an ordered list of items and applies a placement rule\nto construct the solution (Babu and Babu, 2001; Gomes\nand Oliveira, 2002; Burke et al., 2007, 2006). The second\napproach represents the solution as a physical layout on\nthe container and moves items within the layout (Bennell\n1 e-mail: andre.kubagawa@gmail.com. This author was partially\nsupported by CNPq.\n2 e-mail: thiago@usp.br. This author was partially supported by\nFAPESP (grant 2009/14699-0).\n3 e-mail: mtsuzuki@usp.br. This author was partially supported by\nCNPq (grant 304258/2007-5) and FAPESP (grant 2009/07173-2).\nand Dowsland, 1999; Gomes and Oliveira, 2006; Egeblad\net al., 2007). The former strategy is dependent on two\ncritical characteristics of the algorithm; the placement rule\nand the placement order of the items.\nWhen irregular shaped items are involved an extra di\u0002mension of complexity is generated by the geometry. The\nno-fit polygon is the principal approach for handling the\ngeometry in cutting and packing problems with irregular\nshaped items (Burke et al., 2007; Bennell and Song, 2008;\nCosta et al., 2009). The no-fit polygon is used to ensure\nfeasible layouts; i.e. layouts where the items do not overlap\nand fit inside the container.\nIn this paper, the solution is represented as an ordered\nlist of items and a constructive heuristic is applied se\u0002quentially. A simulated annealing algorithm controls how\nthe items are ordered in the list and where the items are\nconstructively placed. The proposed algorithm has two\nhierarchical levels. The inner level solves the placement\nproblem where the container has fixed dimensions. The\nexternal level reduces or increases the container dimen\u0002sion that must be minimized. Experiments show that the\nproposed method is very efficient compared with other\npublished methods.\n2. PREVIOUS WORKS\nThe no-fit polygon alone has limited utility in cutting\nand packing problems. Some recent works are using the\ncollision free region to determine feasible layouts in con\u0002tainers with fixed dimensions. Martins and Tsuzuki (2006)\nproposed a constructive heuristic where the collision free\nPreprints of the 18th IFAC World Congress\nMilano (Italy) August 28 - September 2, 2011\nCopyright by the\nInternational Federation of Automatic Control (IFAC)\n3968\nFig. 1. Cost function behavior when the container has fixed\ndimensions. The cost function assumes only discrete\nvalues, while the rotating angle \u03b8 is continuous.\nregion represents feasible placements for a moveable item\nconsidering the already placed items and the container.\nThe cost function is the non occupied area inside the\ncontainer with fixed dimensions. As the non occupied\narea can change only by adding or removing areas of\nitems, the cost function can assume only a finite set of\nvalues, becoming discontinuous (see Fig. 1). A simulated\nannealing algorithm with adaptive neighborhood (Martins\nand Tsuzuki, 2008, 2009a) controls the sequence of items\nand the placement on the collision free region boundary.\nThe collision free region was calculated using regularized\nBoolean operations implemented with limited precision\n(Hobby, 1999).\nMartins and Tsuzuki (2007) combined the simulated an\u0002nealing with deterministic heuristics (larger first and bot\u0002tom left). They showed that it is possible to create problem\ninstances where deterministic heuristics cannot reach the\nlayout associated with the global optimum.\nSato et al. (2010) implemented a robust algorithm to\ndetermine the collision free region with two dimension\nnon manifold Boolean operations. They created a problem\ninstance where the the global optimum can not be reached\nby placing the moveable item exclusively on collision free\nregion vertices. Such situation rarely occurs considering\nstudied and practical problems. They showed several re\u0002sults where the area of the container was exactly equal\nto the total area of the items. The layout associated with\nglobal optimum was reached in averagely 15 times fewer\niterations when compared to previously published results\n(Martins and Tsuzuki, 2009b, 2010) where the area of the\ncontainer was larger than the total area of the items. The\ncorrect calculation of the collision free region showed to be\nan effective tool to obtain such results.\n3. NO-FIT POLYGONS AND COLLISION FREE\nREGION\nNo-fit polygons represent set of translations of an item\nand are mathematically represented by a set of vectors.\nFor a better understanding of the properties of the no-fit\npolygons, the set of translations of an item is represented\nby polygons in the plane. Every item has a reference point\nthat can be internal or external to it. The no-fit polygon\nrepresents a set of forbidden translations, as shown in\nFig. 2. For an item P, let i(P) be its interior, \u2202P be its\nboundary and c(P) be its complement.\nFig. 2. Set of translations of a shape represented as a region\ncontaining all possible translations from its reference\npoint.\nDefinition 3.1.

Previously, the no-fit polygon (NFP) has not been widely applied because of the perception that it is difficult to implement and because of the lack of generic approaches that can cope with all problem cases without specific case-by-case handling. This paper introduces a robust orbital method for the creation of no-fit polygons which does not suffer from the typical problem cases found in the other approaches from the literature. Furthermore, the algorithm only involves two simple geometric stages so it is easily understood and implemented. We demonstrate how the approach handles known degenerate cases such as holes, interlocking concavities and jigsaw type pieces and we give generation times for 32 irregular packing benchmark problems from the literature, including real world datasets, to allow further comparison with existing and future approaches.\n## Introduction\nThe irregular two-dimensional variant of the cutting and packing problem impacts upon several important manufacturing industries such as textiles, plastics, metal cutting and others. These problems usually consist of a number of irregular pieces that are to be placed onto one or more sheets of material in the most efficient layout possible, so that all pieces are assigned and do not overlap. Additionally, there are usually rotational constraints enforced on the pieces due to the physical properties of the problem such as grain on the material, patterns on textiles and the cutting technology being employed. Sometimes rotational constraints may be used for non-physical reasons such as to restrict pieces to a finite set of rotations thus simplifying layout construction procedures and allowing for faster solutions to be obtained. The two-dimensional stock cutting problem has been shown to be NP hard and is therefore intrinsically difficult to solve (Garey and Johnson, 1979). There have been many different strategies for producing solutions to the irregular stock cutting problem. These include linear programming approaches, heuristic placement methods, metaheuristic guided search techniques and other novel approaches such as the iterative jostling of pieces (Dowsland et al., 1998). Survey papers can be found in (Dowsland and Dowsland, 1992, Sweeney and Paternoster, 1992, Dyckhoff, 1990). However, the feature that connects all of the approaches is that they are all required to cope with the geometry of the problem. This can be especially complicated when highly irregular shapes are used which may include holes or concavities. The implementation of robust and efficient geometry routines can be laborious and can often take considerably longer than the packing strategies themselves. In particular, the geometry must handle all of the interactions between shapes such as detecting whether two shapes are overlapping and calculating the translation distance required in a given direction so that the overlap is resolved. As we show in the following section, although these tests can be implemented using trigonometric techniques, the no-fit polygon represents a considerably more efficient solution.\nWhilst the generation of the no-fit polygon is academically challenging, it is a \u2018tool\u2019 and not a \u2018solution\u2019 and this is perhaps one of the reasons why there are many publications in the literature which state that the no-fit polygon is used but which provide relatively little or no details on its implementation. In this paper we concentrate specifically on the no-fit polygon and provide an overview of the previous techniques that have been used for its creation. Furthermore, we describe and provide full implementation details for a new robust orbital approach that can cope with the traditional problem cases that many other approaches cannot handle. Hopefully this will help in the further dissemination of the benefits of using the no-fit polygon (as opposed to traditional trigonometry based approaches) within both the industrial and the academic communities.\n## Section snippets\n## The no-fit polygon \u2013an overview\nIn this section we describe the functionality of the no-fit polygon and we compare it to the more traditional trigonometric based overlap and intersection tests. We also give brief overviews of the many techniques that have been used to generate no-fit polygons within the previous literature.\n## The new no-fit polygon construction algorithm\nWe now describe our new approach for robust no-fit polygon generation through the use of orbital methods utilising standard trigonometrical techniques. For the intersection calculations within our presented implementation, it is important to use a robust geometry library. It is also beneficial to implement routines that are as fast and as close to optimal as possible in order to promote fast no-fit polygon generation and packing algorithms. We have implemented such a library. Although this can\n## Problem cases\nIn this section we discuss each of the problem cases that cause difficulties with other methods and show why our approach is able to handle them without specific case-by-case implementations.

This is used to trace the loops of the no-fit polygon (which we number).

      "text": "Efficient Local Search Heuristics for Packing\nIrregular Shapes in Two-Dimensional\nHeterogeneous Bins\nRanga P. Abeysooriya1, Julia A. Bennell1, and Antonio Martinez-Sykora1\nBusiness School, University of Southampton, SO17 1BJ, Southampton, UK\nAbstract. In this paper we proposed a local search heuristic and a ge\u0002netic algorithm to solve the two-dimensional irregular multiple bin-size\nbin packing problem. The problem consists of placing a set of pieces rep\u0002resented as 2D polygons in rectangular bins with different dimensions\nsuch that the total area of bins used is minimized. Most packing algo\u0002rithms available in the literature for 2D irregular bin packing consider\nsingle size bins only. However, for many industries the material can be\nsupplied in a number of standard size sheets, for example, metal, foam,\nplastic and timber sheets. For this problem, the cut plans must decide\nthe set of standard size stock sheets as well as which pieces to cut from\neach bin and how to arrange them in order to minimise waste material.\nMoreover, the literature constrains the orientation of pieces to a single\nor finite set of angles. This is often an artificial constraint that makes\nthe solution space easier to navigate. In this paper we do not restrict\nthe orientation of the pieces. We show that the local search heuristic and\nthe genetic algorithm can address all of these decisions and obtain good\nsolutions, with the local search performing better. We also discuss the\naffect of different groups of stock sheet sizes.\nKeywords: Irregular shapes, Multiple bin size bin packing, Jostle Al\u0002gorithm\n1 Introduction\nThe two dimensional bin packing problem consists of placing a set of pieces,\nusually represented as rectangles or polygons, in one or several stock sheets\n(bins) in such a way the total waste generated is minimized. This problem arises\nin several industries where metal, foam, wood, plastic, paper or leather need to\nbe cut. Depending on the industrial application this problem has several variants\ndescribed by the properties of both the pieces to be placed and the bins. In this\npaper we address the problem where the pieces to be cut are irregular and may\nhave concavities. Pieces can be placed in any orientation within rectangular bins\nthat have a variety of different dimensions (heterogeneous bin sizes). We assume\nthat there are a limited number of bin types and there are enough bins of each\ntype to place all the demanded pieces in any set of bins. In this paper we denote\nthis problem as the two-dimensional irregular shape multiple bin size bin packing\nproblem (2D-IMBSBPP) and propose a local search heuristic, called jostle, and\na genetic algorithm to find efficient solutions.\nMost of the publications in the literature that consider heterogeneous bins\nare focused on packing rectangular pieces. Pisinger and Sigurad [19] consider a\nvariable bin cost when solving this problem. They propose a MILP model which\nis then solved by column generation. The model is intractable for large instances\nand difficult to solve even for small instances. Ortmann et al. [18] propose a\ntwo-phase approach. During the first phase they use first-fit decreasing with the\nlargest bins first. A second phase repacks bins into smaller bins. The two phase\nalgorithm is implemented with different bin sizes and aims to minimise the total\narea of the occupied bins. Wei et al. [21] propose a tabu search that uses a\nsequential packing heuristic, a local search, and a post-improvement procedure\nto reduce the total area of used bins in a feasible solution. Alvarez-Valdes et\nal. [2] implement meta-heuristic algorithms with variable bin costs which are\nnot proportional to the size of the bin. The objective is to minimize the cost of\nthe occupied bins, and the authors employ a greedy randomized adaptive search\nprocedure with path re-linking strategies to combine the best solutions obtained\nin the iterative process. In order to compare their results with Ortmann et al.\n[18]\u2019s, they modify the objective function to maximize the overall utilization of\nthe occupied bins.\nThe vast majority of research publications considering the packing of 2D\nirregular shapes address the 2D strip packing problem, also known as the nesting\nproblem. Instead of placing pieces into bins the aim is to place all the pieces into\na strip with fixed width and infinite length in such a way the total required length\nis minimized. However, recent publications of packing algorithms for irregular\npieces consider the bin packing problem with homogeneous bins, see [14], [20],\n[16] and [1]. However, in many situations bins are readily available to purchase\nas rectangular sheets in different standard sizes. In these industries companies\nusually handle several bin sizes in order to satisfy customer demand. The aim of\nthe companies is not only to reduce the waste generated in the cutting process,\nbut also charge a competitive price to the customers, which usually depends on\nthe area of material needed to meet the demand. There are several publications\nconsidering heterogeneous irregular bins, see [4] and [5], who solve an applied\nproblem which arises in the leather industry. In these publications the pieces\nare approximated by grid squares or pixels rather than polygons. While this\nsimplifies the geometry, solutions suffer from inaccuracy in shape representation.\nIt is important to highlight that in this paper we use the direct representa\u0002tions of the pieces as polygons and do not restrict the rotation of pieces to a\npredefined set of angles. Han et al. [13] and Martinez-Sykora et al. [15] considered\nfree rotation for the 2D irregular bin packing problem with guillotine cuts, solving\nan application derived from the glass industry. More recently, Martinez-Sykora\net al. [16] and Abeysooriya et al. [1] considered free rotation for the problem with\nhomogeneous bins and also report results with restricted and fixed rotations. For\ncomparison purposes, we also address the problem where a finite set of rotations\nare allowed.\nThe main contribution of this paper is to efficiently solve the 2D-IMBSBPP\nconsidering continuous rotation of pieces by using an adaptation of the jostle\nprocedure. Jostle was first proposed by Dowsland et al. [10] for the strip packing\nproblem and then used in [1] in bin packing problems with homogeneous bins.\nOne of the most important properties of the jostle procedure is that it explores\nefficient solutions with a relatively low computational effort, compared with other\navailable algorithms. The jostle procedure works over the sequence of pieces that\nrepresents the order pieces are inserted in the layout. The constructive heuristic\niterates between packing from one end of the strip and then the other end taking\nthe sequence from the last iteration. The results presented in this paper show\na considerable improvement when using a heterogeneous set of bin sizes, which\ndemonstrates the efficiency of the algorithms presented.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we describe the problem and\nwe discuss the measure of performance used to evaluate the quality of feasible\nsolutions. Section 3 explains the jostle algorithms and the genetic algorithm to\nsolve 2D-IMBSBPP. Computational tests are presented in Section 4. Finally, in\nSection 5 we present the conclusions of the paper.\n2 Problem Description\nLet N0 be the number of rectangular bin types (stock sheets) and let Lk and\nWk be, respectively, the length and the width of bin type k \u2208 {1, . . . , N0}.

In the two-dimensional case, not only is it the case that the piece\u2019s size is important but its shape also has a significant influence. Therefore, DJD as a selection heuristic has to be paired with a placement heuristic to completely construct a solution to the underlying packing problem. A successful adaptation of the DJD requires a routine to reduce computational costs, which is also proposed and successfully tested in this paper. Results, on a wide variety of instance types with convex polygons, are found to be significantly better than those produced by more conventional selection heuristics.\n\nThis is a preview of

It adopts two neighborhoods, swapping two given polygons in a placement and placing one polygon into a new position. The local search algorithm is used to minimize the overlap on the basis of the neighborhoods mentioned above and the unconstrained[nonlinear programming](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/nonlinear-programming)model is adopted to further minimize the overlap during the search process. Moreover, the[tabu](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/tabu)search algorithm is used to avoid[local minima](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/local-minimum), and a compact algorithm is presented to improve the result. The results of standard test instances indicate that when compared with other existing algorithms, the presented algorithm does not only show some signs of competitive power but also updates several best known results.\n## Introduction\nThe irregular strip packing problem, also known as the nesting problem, has a wide area of applications. Given a set of irregular shapes and a rectangular strip with a fixed width and an arbitrary length, the target of the two-dimensional irregular strip packing problem is to place all shapes within the strip such that the length of the strip is minimized and the irregular shapes do not overlap. A classic example application is clothing industry. Several pieces of clothes will be cut from a roll of fabric and the objective is to minimize the waste of fabric. The fabric has a fixed width and its length can be generally assumed infinite; so the problem is to minimize the length required for producing the specified number of irregular shapes.\nThe irregular strip packing problem is a NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem [1]. Numerous papers on nesting problem have been published since the first paper by Art [2]. Meta-heuristics are often used to solve this problem. Hopper and Turton [3] reviewed these methods, and a summary of geometric methods was published by Bennell and Oliveira [4]. As research progressed, further breakthroughs in algorithms for this problem have achieved in recent years. When compared with the previous years, these solutions have markedly improved the effect and speed of nesting results. The typical methods include Burke et al. [5], Gomes and Oliveira [6], Egeblad et al. [7], Imamichi et al. [8], etc.\nAlbano and Sapuppo [9] proposed an algorithm that places each shape at the bottom-left position, and the sequence of places is obtained by tree search. Jakobs [10] proposed a two-stage solution which first generates the rectangular enclosure of each irregular shape, and then finds the placement for these enclosures through a genetic algorithm. Secondly, a shrinking algorithm moves the shapes to another one as close as possible using the idea of the bottom-left heuristic. Gomes and Oliveira [11] based on bottom-left heuristic and find a good placement by exchanging two shapes in the layout. Dowsland et al. [12] developed a compact algorithm to improve the bottom-left heuristic algorithm. The algorithm first gets the initial placement by the bottom-left heuristic, and then uses a shaking process to compact the placement. Burke et al. [5] presented a new bottom-left heuristic algorithm based on discretization, and combination with hill climbing or tabu search to get a high quality solution. This algorithm can also pack the shapes with circular arcs and holes. Egeblad et al. [7] proposed an efficient fast local search method whose neighborhood is any horizontal or vertical translation of a given shape. They also formulated a polynomial time algorithm to find a translation with minimum overlap area between the given polygon and the other polygons in the current placement. Gomes and Oliveira [6] presented a separation algorithm to locally optimize the placement based on linear programming models, and used simulated annealing to guide the search. A new separation algorithm based on unconstrained nonlinear programming is proposed by Imamichi et al. [8]. They also designed an algorithm that swaps two polygons in a placement, and then the algorithms are combined as a component into an iterated local search algorithm for the overlap minimization problem. This method yielded several best known results on the standard test instances. Our algorithm is based on a separation algorithm presented by Imamichi et al. [8], and local search is adopted to guide the search. Moreover, a tabu search algorithm is used to avoid local minima and a compacted algorithm is used to improve the packing results.\n## Section snippets\n## Formulation\nIn this section, some fundamental elements of geometry are first defined, before formulation of the irregular strip packing problem algorithm is given.\n**Definition 1 (point)**\nA point*p*in two-dimensional space is represented by a pair:p=(px,py)\u2208R2.\n**Definition 2 (line segment)**\nA line segment*s*is a point set defined by two endpoints*p**a*and*p**b*:s={p\u2208R2,t\u2208[0,1]|p=pa+t(pb\u2212pa)}.\n**Definition 3 (polygon)**\nA polygon is a plane figure bounded by a closed path composes of a finite sequence of line segments denoted by*S*.

The container has a fixed width, while its length can change so that all items are placed in it. The objective is to find a layout of the set of polygons that minimizes the length of the container. The proposed algorithm constructively creates layouts from an ordered list of items and a placement heuristic. The placement determines the collision free region (represents the set of translations to create a feasible layout) for the item to be placed. It is shown that the collision free region must be calculated using non-regularized Boolean operations, as contours of no-fit polygons should be ignored. The proposed algorithm to solve the placement problem has two levels, in the internal level the container has fixed dimensions, and the external level reduces or increases the variable dimension. The placement heuristic searches for degenerated vertices and edges as they represent local maximum compaction. Computational comparisons on benchmark problems show that the proposed algorithm generated highly competitive solutions. Moreover, our algorithm updated some best known results.\n...Read more\n## Key takeaways\n![sparkles](https://a.academia-assets.com/images/icons/sparkle.svg)\nAI\n1.

This problem is approached with an heuristic based on simulated annealing. Traditional &quot;external penalization&quot; techniques are avoided through the application of the no-fit polygon, that determinates the collision-free region for each small item before its placement. The simulated annealing controls: the rotation applied and the placement of the small item. For each non-placed small item, a limited depth binary search is performed to find a scale factor that when applied to the small item, would allow it to be fitted in the large object. Three possibilities to define the sequence on which the small items are placed are studied: larger-first, random permutation and weight sorted. The proposed algorithm is suited for non-convex small items and large objects.\ndownloadDownload free PDF[View PDFchevron\\_right](https://www.academia.edu/58884840/Rotational_Placement_of_Irregular_Polygons_over_Containers_with_Fixed_Dimensions_using_Simulated_Annealing_and_No_Fit_Polygons)\n[An effective heuristic for the two-dimensional irregular bin packing problem](https://www.academia.edu/69875946/An_effective_heuristic_for_the_two_dimensional_irregular_bin_packing_problem)\n[Gabriela Ochoa](https://independent.academia.edu/GabrielaOchoa10)\nAnnals of Operations Research, 2013\nThis paper proposes an adaptation, to the two-dimensional irregular bin packing problem of the Djang and Finch heuristic (DJD), originally designed for the one-dimensional bin packing problem. In the two-dimensional case, not only is it the case that the piece&#39;s size is important but its shape also has a significant influence. Therefore, DJD as a selection heuristic has to be paired with a placement heuristic to completely construct a solution to the underlying packing problem. A successful adaptation of the DJD requires a routine to reduce computational costs, which is also proposed and successfully tested in this paper. Results, on a wide variety of instance types with convex polygons, are found to be significantly better than those produced by more conventional selection heuristics.\ndownloadDownload free PDF[View PDFchevron\\_right](https://www.academia.edu/69875946/An_effective_heuristic_for_the_two_dimensional_irregular_bin_packing_problem)\n[Irregular rotational placement of shapes over non-convex containers with fixed dimensions](https://www.academia.edu/104990568/Irregular_rotational_placement_of_shapes_over_non_convex_containers_with_fixed_dimensions)\n[Thiago de Castro Martins](https://independent.academia.edu/ThiagodeCastroMartins)\n8th IFAC International Workshop on Intelligent Manufacturing Systems, 2007, 2007\nThis work deals with the problem of minimize the waste of space that occurs on a placement of a set of bi-dimensional items inside a bi-dimensional container with fixed dimensions.
