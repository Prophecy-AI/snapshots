Among the important Christmas tree producing areas in the U.S. are [Wisconsin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin), [North Carolina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina), [Pennsylvania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania) and the [Pacific Northwest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Northwest). In 2002 [Christmas tree production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_tree_production) in the United States totaled 20.8 million trees and the U.S. was one of the world's leading producers of natural [Christmas trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_trees). That same year, Pennsylvania was the top producer in the United States.\n\n## History\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Christmas_tree_production_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=1)\\]\n\nThe first Christmas tree farm in the United States is believed to have begun in 1888 when George E. Wagner founded the Wagner Tree Farm on 1,700 acres near Pocono Lake, PA. He and his son, Sterling R. Wagner, achieved recognition in the fields of forestry and conservation. A WB&E rail spur provided an outlet for forest products, coal, blueberries, and 1,500 Christmas trees annually. \" [\\[1\\]](https://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=97721)\" Despite the early pioneers of the industry, by the late 1940s 90 percent of all natural Christmas trees sold in the United States were still harvested from forests. The most popular species during that era, [Balsam Fir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balsam_Fir), [Douglas-fir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas-fir), [Black Spruce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Spruce) and [White Spruce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Spruce), were all readily available from forests.[\\[1\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-chastagner-1)\n\nFollowing World War II more trees began to be planted in [plantations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plantation). Other changes were taking place as well, in the late 1940s and early 1950s farmers began to shear trees in response to customer demand for denser trees.[\\[1\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-chastagner-1) During the 1960s the market for [Christmas trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_trees) in the United States began to change. The number of part-time growers declined, while some part-time growers ceased operations others expanded their operations and became full-time Christmas tree farmers. Expansion occurred in all major U.S. Christmas tree growing regions, [Michigan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan), the [Pacific Northwest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Northwest) and [North Carolina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina).[\\[2\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-msu-2)\n\nThe number of plantings increased during the late 1970s and continued to do so into the 1980s.[\\[2\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-msu-2) From 1977 to 1979 total U.S. production reached about 29 million Christmas trees annually.[\\[3\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-rma-3) One species, [Scots Pine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scots_Pine) was planted in numbers which far exceeded [demand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demand) for the product. As the number of individual farmers increased, better marketing strategies and promotion programs were developed.[\\[2\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-msu-2) [Helicopters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter) became a fixture on large farms during the early 1980s as growers used them to move trees from the field to the shipping yard.[\\[1\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-chastagner-1) Between 1988 and 1994 U.S. the number of Christmas trees harvested in the U.S. was about 34\u201336 million per year.[\\[3\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-rma-3)\n\nChristmas tree farm in Texas\n\nIn 2002, in the United States, 21,904 Christmas tree farms covered 447,000 acres (1,810\u00a0km2) of cropland and accounted for 20.8 million Christmas trees cut.[\\[4\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-usda1-4) Of those farms, 686 harvested 100 acres (0.40\u00a0km2) or more, which accounted for over 196,000 of the total acres of trees harvested. That same year, there were only three U.S. Christmas tree farms with more than 10,000 acres (40\u00a0km2) of cropland in production.[\\[4\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-usda1-4) Pennsylvania was home to the most American Christmas tree farms in 2002; the state boasted 2,164 farms. [Oregon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon), however, had the most acreage devoted to the crop with 67,800 acres being used for Christmas tree farming.[\\[5\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-census05-5)\n\nThe total U.S. crop in 2004 was valued at $506 million with $143 million attributed to the nation's leading producer in 2004, Oregon.[\\[5\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-census05-5) Oregon was followed in production numbers by North Carolina, [Washington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)), and Michigan.[\\[5\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-census05-5)\n\n## North Carolina\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Christmas_tree_production_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=2)\\]\n\nIn 2002 about 2.9 million Christmas trees were harvested in the state of North Carolina, second behind only Oregon in terms of trees cut.[\\[4\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-usda1-4) By 2004 the crop in North Carolina was worth more than $100 million.[\\[6\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-ncda-6) The North Carolina Department of Agriculture stated that 18% of natural Christmas tree harvested in the United States come from the 42 million trees planted by 1,500 growers in the states.[\\[6\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-ncda-6)\n\n## Pacific Northwest\n\n\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Christmas_tree_production_in_the_United_States&action=edit&section=3)\\]\n\nA Christmas tree lot in the suburbs of Portland, Oregon\n\nOregon and Washington are among the most important U.S. states in the production of Christmas trees. 92% of the crop produced in this region consists of Douglas fir and Noble fir species.[\\[7\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-Facts_at_a_Glance-7) Other species produced in this region include grand fir, balsam fir, Nordmann fir, Colorado blue spruce and Norway spruce trees.\n\nCurrently approximately 92% of Christmas trees grown in the Pacific Northwest are exported out of the region. California is the largest market for Pacific Northwest Christmas trees, purchasing 45% of the crop. Other large foreign export destinations include China, Japan, Mexico and Philippines.[\\[7\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-Facts_at_a_Glance-7)\n\nIn 2015, Oregon had approximately 700 Christmas tree farms with a combined 63,000 acres, yielding 7.2 million Christmas trees valued at approximately $120 million. The majority of Christmas tree production occurs in the Willamette Valley region including Benton, Clackamas, Marion, Polk and Yamhill counties.[\\[7\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-Facts_at_a_Glance-7)\n\nIn 2015, Washington State had approximately 250 Christmas tree farms with a combined 23,000 acres, yielding 2.3 mi...",

Successful harvest of Christmas trees from any plantation is largely determined by the decisions made during this establishment phase. Suitability of the site for the species to be grown is of critical importance. Selection of an optimum site can minimize the risk of a number of production problems. Careful planning and layout of fields and farm roads can reduce pest management and harvesting costs. Proper site preparation can cut a year or two from the production cycle by providing an optimum environment for young trees. By planting only the highest quality planting stock, the health and quality of a plantation can be enhanced. A grower should proceed with establishment thoughtfully \u2014 mistakes made at this point have a tendency to grow and multiply.\n\n## **Species Selection**\n\nThe choice of Christmas tree species to be grown is largely governed by geographic region and climate. Some species require the mountain climate. Other species have traditionally been grown and marketed only in the coastal plain and Piedmont of North Carolina.\n\nWhile species such as Fraser fir are primarily marketed through national or regional wholesale markets, other species, such as Virginia pine, are primarily marketed through local choose-and-cut markets. A potential Christmas tree grower must carefully weigh the growing requirements and business aspects of each species. Some of the questions to be answered before deciding which species to grow are:\n\n- Will there be a market for these trees when they are ready to harvest?\n- Can this species be grown on the land available, or am I willing to relocate to a more appropriate area to grow the species I want to grow?\n- What special problems are involved growing this species?\n\nThe final choice of species depends on the availability of suitable land. Planting in areas not recommended usually leads to poor survival and growth, and subsequent reduced financial income.\n\n## **Site Selection**\n\nDetermination of site suitability for the selected species is one of the most important decisions. A potential Christmas tree producer should focus on finding land with the best possible characteristics. A landowner cannot simply choose a species based on local selling price for that crop. It would be better to succeed in a less profitable enterprise than to fail at Christmas tree production because the site was unsuitable.\n\nSite suitability is governed largely by soil characteristics. A grower should inspect the soil conditions on potential sites. Is the topsoil more than 6 inches deep? Is the subsoil a heavy clay or a clay loam? Is there a hardpan? How deep do weed or existing tree roots grow? Is the soil compacted? Is there ever standing water on the site after a rain? Are there weeds on the site that indicate periodic water saturation, such as swamp grass or rushes? Any of these factors could indicate a problem. County soil survey maps can help determine soil type and suitability. A preliminary soil sample is also needed to evaluate the fertility of the soil.\n\nThe elevation and aspect of a site should be considered. Both of these factors influence microclimate and, to a large extent, the characteristics of the soil at a given location. Sites that face south and southwest and sites at lower elevations typically have warmer, drier soils in contrast to north and east aspects or higher elevations, which are cooler and more moist. In the mountains, elevations above 3,000 feet and north-facing slopes usually have more soil organic matter, while clay content tends to increase at lower elevations or on south-facing slopes.\n\nThe microclimate of a site determines the risk of freeze damage to buds or new growth. Trees may tend to break bud as much as 2 weeks earlier in the spring on warmer south- or southwest-facing slopes, as compared to cooler north-facing slopes. When there are risks of late hard freezes in an area, early budbreak is a liability that can cost a year\u2019s growth. The extent of frost damage can be compounded by other site factors that create a frost pocket. Any factor that reduces air drainage can keep cold air on site. Cold air drains poorly from flat land. Hills or ridges above the planted area can trap cold air, as can a wall of trees along a property line.\n\nThe pattern of water flow and drainage in a site should be considered in site evaluation. Obviously, creeks and intermittent streams should be noted, as well as drainage ditches or culverts above the area. Surface evaluation not only indicates potential flood areas but also where soil may be saturated for extended periods. Flat or concave areas are particularly subject to slow water drainage. Moisture retention can also be evaluated in terms of aspect. Soils on south-facing slopes will be drier than those on adjacent north- or east-facing slopes. Such conditions can effect survival after planting, or tree growth during seasons in which a drought or flood occurs.\n\nThere are several other factors that might reduce the effective production area without eliminating the site altogether. Are there areas that are too rocky, wet, or steep to plant? Such areas might serve as staging areas for harvesting or road turn-arounds, even if they are lost to production. The prevailing slope may be severe enough to impede cultural management. Trees generally cost less to manage, and achieve market size faster on gentler slopes. Topography may restrict the use of mechanization. Are there \u201c...",
