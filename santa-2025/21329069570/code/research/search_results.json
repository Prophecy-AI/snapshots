      "text": "Tessellation patterns for packing identical irregular shapes efficiently involve arranging shapes in a way that covers a surface without gaps or overlaps. While regular tessellations typically use polygons like triangles, squares, or hexagons, irregular shapes can also tessellate if they meet certain conditions. For example, all triangles and quadrilaterals can tessellate regardless of their specific shape, and some irregular pentagons are capable of tessellating, with only 15 types proven to do so ([studypug](https://www.studypug.com/us/grade6/understand-tessellations); [mathcuriosity](https://www.mathcuriosity.com/tessellations)). \n\nEfficient packing of irregular shapes often employs heuristic and optimization approaches, such as continuous and combinatorial optimization, to improve surface coverage and tile arrangement. These methods iteratively partition the surface into regions and optimize the positions and orientations of the shapes to maximize coverage while minimizing gaps. Such techniques are used in surface mosaics, large-scale packing problems, and industrial nesting algorithms, demonstrating their practical relevance in fields like surface decoration and material utilization ([surface mosaic synthesis](https://haopan.github.io/papers/surface_mosaic.pdf); [science direct](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0377221707009320)). \n\nOverall, the key to efficient tessellation of irregular shapes lies in understanding shape conditions that allow tessellation, combined with advanced computational methods to optimize their placement for maximum surface coverage.",

From there, tessellation became a part of the culture of many civilizations, from Egyptians to Greeks, from Byzantines to Chinese.\nSince there are endless possibilities every culture came up with its own tiling style. At this point, the classification of tesselations became needed for mathematicians and artists to explore more.\n##### Types of Tessellations\nThere are several types of tessellations. the most well-known ones are regular tessellations which made up of only one regular polygon. If you try regular polygons, you ll see that only equilateral triangles, squares, and regular hexagons can create regular tessellations.\n\u200bClick here for the lesson plan ofRegular Tessellations.\n\u200bIf one is allowed to use more than one type of regular polygons to create a tiling, then it is called semi-regular tessellation.\n\u200bClick here for the lesson plan ofSemi - Regular Tessellations.\n\u200bThe good news is, we do not need to use regular polygons all the time. We can use any polygon, any shape, or any figure like the famous artist and mathematician Escher to createIrregular tessellations\n\u200bAmong the irregular polygons, we know that all triangle and quadrilateral types can tessellate. Among the irregular pentagons, it is proven that only 15 of them can tesselate. You can use[Polypad](https://mathigon.org/polypad)to have a closer look to these 15 irregular pentagons and create tessellations with them.\n\u200bIf you use only congruent shapes to make a tessellation, then it is calledMonohedral Tessellationno matter the shape is. All regular tessellations are also monohedral. It may be better to show a counter-example here to explain the monohedral tessellations.\n\u200bAll the tessellations mentioned up to this point arePeriodic tessellations. They consist of one pattern that is repeated again and again. Whatever direction you go, they will look the same everywhere.\n\u200bIn the 1970s, the British mathematician and physicist Roger Penrose discoverednon-periodic tessellations.The pattern ofshapes still goes infinitely in all directions, but the design never looks exactly the same. The most famous pair of such tiles are the dart and the kite.\n\u200bClick here for the lesson plan of non-periodic Tessellations.\n\u200b![IMG_5140.HEIC](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/0e77c8_823008e766054abe9d789e7cf2ed8204~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_245,h_384,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_avif,quality_auto/IMG_5140_HEIC.png)\n![IMG_5141.HEIC](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/0e77c8_595def3faaef4399b82fb21e31ede473~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_205,h_271,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_avif,quality_auto/IMG_5141_HEIC.png)\n![Image by Thomas Renaud](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/nsplsh_5f693275416d736b5a6351~mv2_d_3648_3648_s_4_2.jpg/v1/fill/w_268,h_248,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_avif,quality_auto/Image%20by%20Thomas%20Renaud.jpg)\n![Image by Andy Holmes](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/nsplsh_725a6e4e2d594099961d2c3fff029409~mv2.jpg/v1/crop/x_0,y_883,w_2623,h_2795/fill/w_273,h_284,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_avif,quality_auto/Image%20by%20Andy%20Holmes.jpg)\n##### World Tessellation Day\n![1worldtessellationday1.jpeg](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/0e77c8_c7916a53c71146d9a47bf2acde26886c~mv2.jpeg/v1/fill/w_273,h_193,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_avif,quality_auto/1worldtessellationday1.jpeg)\nExcept where otherwise noted, graphics and photos copyright &copy;&copy;2016[Emily Grosvenor](http://www.tessalationbook.com/).

A particular case of the nesting problem occurs when congruent copies of one single shape have to fill, as much as possible, a limited sheet. Traditional approaches to the nesting problem have difficulty to tackle with high number of pieces to place. Additionally, if the orientation of the given shape is not a constraint, the general nesting approaches are not particularly successful. This problem arises in practice in several industrial contexts such as footwear, metalware and furniture. A possible approach is the periodic placement of the shapes, in a lattice way. In this paper, we propose three heuristic approaches to solve this particular case of nesting problems. Experimental results are compared with published results in literature and additional results obtained from new instances are also provided.\n## Introduction\nNesting has been widely studied (Dowsland and Dowsland, 1992), as it is a common problem in several industrial production processes (textile, garment, footwear, metalware, furniture, etc.). Most of the published papers impose orientation constraints: the shape can only be rotated a predetermined number of fixed angles (the most common is 180\u00b0 and, less commonly, 90\u00b0) or it cannot be rotated at all. However, in certain particular cases, orientation constraints do not arise. Additionally, some industries frequently need to cut big quantities of each type of shape. In these two situations, the periodic packing of the shapes (lattice packing) proved to be a very competitive approach, because:\n* \u2013good cutting patterns, with very small waste, can be obtained;\n* \u2013the automatic cutting process is more efficient when a periodic placement is considered;\n* \u2013reduced computational time (when compared with general nesting approaches, where each piece has to be treated individually), which allows to tackle problems of greater dimension.\nIn this section, we start by describing the problem and refer to related works in a brief review. In Section 2, we point out the geometric considerations necessary to understand this work. Section 3 describes the underlying rules and criteria used to build the three heuristic approaches, which are proposed in the fourth section. In Section 5, the instances used to evaluate the quality of the proposed approaches are defined and the results obtained with all the three heuristics are presented and compared. Finally, in the last section, we draw conclusions and make some comments about future work.\nThe periodic placement of congruent copies of one shape can be found in literature under the keywords \u201cperiodic packing\u201d, \u201cregular packing\u201d or \u201clattice packing\u201d. The lattice packing may be defined over an infinite plane or a limited sheet. If it is the plane, the main objective is to regularly place the shapes so that the density obtained is maximised. When lattice packing on a limited stock sheet, the goal is to maximise the percentage of stock sheet utilisation, which is equivalent to maximise the number of shapes placed inside the plate. As will be shown later, these two \u201capparently\u201d similar objectives are not quite equivalent. However, the definition of a lattice is identical in the two situations. A lattice is generated by two linearly independent vectors,*v*0and*v*1, whose linear combinations will produce a grid that guarantees that pieces do not overlap. The shapes are located in each node of the grid.\nThe problem we propose to solve does not considerer orientation constraints, so, any rotation of the given shape can be allowed. However, after a specific orientation is chosen, all the shapes must follow the same orientation (*Single-Lattice*\u2013 Fig. 1a) or be alternately rotated 180\u00b0 (*Double-Lattice*\u2013 Fig. 1b). According to the typology by W\u00e4scher et al. (2007), the problem described in this paper is a 2-dimensional irregular IIPP (Identical Item Packing Problem).\nThe orientation of the shapes is not relevant when lattice packing on the plane, as maximum density remains unchanged. However, when stock sheet borders need to be taken into account, the orientation of the shapes may be extremely important as will be shown in the following sections.\nIn this work, we propose to solve the problem of Periodic Packing of Irregular Shapes (PPIS) on a limited stock sheet (a rectangle) by heuristic methods.\nThere are references in the literature to the Lattice Packing Problem since the fifties, the first results concerning only theoretical aspects of the lattice packing of a single convex polygon on the plane (Rogers, 1951). However, only a few publications during the next 30 years can be found, and some of them are just marginally related to lattice packing. O\u2019Rourke et al. (1986) have considered the problem of finding minimal enclosing triangles and Dori and Ben Bassat (1983) have dealt with the problem of finding minimal enclosing convex polygons with fewer sides. Those approaches can be seen as a pre-processing to lattice packing, as regular convex polygons can be easily packed than the original ones.\nBetween 1990 and 2000, essentially theoretical results on lattice lacking have been published, mostly considering unlimited sheets and convex shapes (Mount and Silverman, 1990, Mount, 1991, Kuperberg and Kuperberg, 1990, Stoyan and Patsuk, 2000).\nMore recently, results concerning real industrial problems, with limited sheets, irregular shapes and no orientation constraints, have been published. Prasad et al. (1995) describe a nesting problem of irregular shaped metal blanks and propose a heuristic search, considering the variation in the or...",

      "text": "Surface Mosaic Synthesis with Irregular Tiles\nWenchao Hu, Zhonggui Chen, Hao Pan, Yizhou Yu, Eitan Grinspun,\nand Wenping Wang, Member, IEEE\nAbstract\u2014Mosaics are widely used for surface decoration to produce appealing visual effects. We present a method for synthesizing\ndigital surface mosaics with irregularly shaped tiles, which are a type of tiles often used for mosaics design. Our method employs both\ncontinuous optimization and combinatorial optimization to improve tile arrangement. In the continuous optimization step, we iteratively\npartition the base surface into approximate Voronoi regions of the tiles and optimize the positions and orientations of the tiles to achieve\na tight fit. Combination optimization performs tile permutation and replacement to further increase surface coverage and diversify tile\nselection. The alternative applications of these two optimization steps lead to rich combination of tiles and high surface coverage. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our solution with extensive experiments and comparisons.\nIndex Terms\u2014Simulated mosaics, irregular packing, polygon containment, surface tessellation\n\u00c7\n1 INTRODUCTION\nMOSAICS represent a popular method for decorating\nsurfaces and can often be seen in churches, parks, or\non sidewalks. Because of their appealing visual effects,\nmosaic patterns are regarded as a popular form of folk art.\nSince tiles, called tesserae, used in mosaics are often broken\npieces of crockery, ceramics, or glass, they may come with a\nwide range of shapes and colors. There are many different\nways to make mosaic patterns, such as Opus Regulatum,\nOpus Tessellatum, Opus Vermiculatum, and Opus Palladia\u0002num [1]. We are particularly interested in Opus Palladianum,\nalso known as \u201ccrazy paving\u201d, which makes use of irregu\u0002larly shaped tiles to form a pattern. Manually generating\naesthetic mosaic patterns in Opus Palladianum, especially in\nlarge scale, is a demanding task. A rule of thumb used by\nartists is that adjacent tiles should have complementary\nshapes which fit each other.\nWe shall propose an effective method for synthesizing\nmosaics with irregularly shaped tiles, with the aim of deco\u0002rating virtual objects and scenes for special visual effects in\nthe entertainment industry. There are two important goals.\nFirst, the developed technique should be able to work well\nwith any set of input tiles. Second, the synthetically gener\u0002ated mosaics should be visually pleasant, meanwhile the\nsynthetic approach should be more efficient than manual\nwork when similar results are obtained. Irregularly shaped\ntiles, especially concave ones, make it harder to achieve these\ngoals. Given a collection of input tiles, a mosaic synthesis\nalgorithm needs to determine a subset of tiles that not only\nfit each other well in shape but are also diverse enough to\navoid undesirable repetitive layout of similar tiles. Further\u0002more, an aesthetic mosaic pattern should have a tight cover\u0002age of the base surface, without any overlap among the tiles.\nOur solution is optimization-based. It alternates between\ncontinuous tile configuration optimization and combinato\u0002rial tile selection optimization. Here, the title configuration\nrefers to the position and orientation of a tile in a mosaic.\nMore specifically, the configurations of individual tiles are\noptimized continuously, and the mosaic tiles are selected\nwith combinatorial optimization. Because a large number of\nvariables are used to represent the configurations of the\ntiles, we need to solve an optimization problem with a large\nnumber of unknowns. To make the problem tractable, we\ndecouple interactions among different tiles by partitioning\nthe base surface into approximate Voronoi regions of the\ntiles. This partition is dynamically computed while the tile\nconfigurations are updated. With such a partition, increas\u0002ing surface coverage by the tiles becomes the problem of\nincreasing the coverage of individual regions by their corre\u0002sponding tiles. Finally, combinatorial tile selection optimi\u0002zation is used to further reduce the uncovered area of the\nsurface by tile permutation and tile replacements so that the\nnew tiles better fit their neighboring tiles in shape to reduce\nthe gaps between neighboring tiles.\n2 RELATED WORK\n2.1 Irregular Packing\nThe problem of packing irregularly shaped objects into a\ngiven region or volume (called a container) is widely studied\nin industrial applications, including garment manufactur\u0002ing, furniture making, and metal sheet cutting. The problem\nis to find the tightest non-overlapping spatial arrangement\nof a set of irregularly shaped objects in the container. The\npacking problem is NP-hard [2]. Hence, heuristics are usu\u0002ally used to obtain suboptimal solutions with reasonable\ntime complexity. A comprehensive review of the work on\n2D irregular packing can be found in [3], [4].

      "text": "- [Home](https://abakus-center.com/)\n- [Blog](https://abakus-center.com/blog/)\n- Tessellation Pattern: How to Create Simple Geometric Designs\n\n# Tessellation Pattern: How to Create Simple Geometric Designs\n\n## What Is Tessellation?\n\nTessellation refers to the process of covering a surface with repeating shapes in such a way that there are no gaps or overlaps. This concept is observed in natural formations like honeycombs and man-made designs, such as tiled floors. In mathematics, tessellation plays an important role in understanding geometry, symmetry, and patterns. The meaning of tessellation lies in its ability to demonstrate how shapes fit together to form a continuous surface.\n\n## What Is Tessellation in Math?\n\nIn mathematics, tessellation involves covering a two-dimensional plane using one or more geometric shapes, called tiles, that fit together perfectly. These shapes repeat across the surface without leaving any gaps or overlapping. Tessellation in math helps explore the properties of shapes, such as triangles and squares, and their ability to transform through translation, rotation, and reflection. A tessellation pattern highlights how these transformations can create uniform designs across a plane.\n\n## Key Features of Tessellations\n\n- **Repetition**: The same shape or combination of shapes is repeated to cover the entire surface, forming a tessellation pattern.\n- **Geometric Shapes**: Common polygons like squares, triangles, and hexagons are frequently used to create tessellation examples.\n- **Symmetry**: Tessellations often exhibit different types of symmetry, such as rotational or reflectional symmetry, adding to the design's mathematical beauty.\n\n## Types of Tessellations\n\n### 1\\. Regular Tessellations\n\nA regular tessellation is created by using only one type of regular polygon. A regular polygon has equal sides and angles. In regular tessellations, only three shapes are capable of completely covering a plane without gaps or overlaps:\n\n- Equilateral Triangles\n- Squares\n- Regular Hexagons\n\nThese shapes tessellate easily because their interior angles divide evenly into 360 degrees. This simple yet effective design makes regular tessellations a common pattern in both math and art.\n\n### 2\\. Semi-Regular Tessellations\n\nSemi-regular tessellations consist of two or more different regular polygons arranged in a repeating pattern. The key feature is that the same arrangement surrounds each vertex. For example, a combination of triangles and squares or hexagons and triangles can form a semi-regular tessellation. This type of tessellation provides more complex and visually interesting patterns for design and geometry.\n\n### 3\\. Non-Regular Tessellations\n\nNon-regular tessellations are made from irregular polygons or a mixture of different types of polygons. These can include both convex and concave shapes. A famous example of a non-regular tessellation is the Penrose tiling, which uses two shapes to create an aperiodic pattern that does not repeat.\n\n## What Is a Tessellation Pattern?\n\nA tessellation pattern is the repeating arrangement of shapes that completely covers a surface without gaps or overlaps. These patterns can be formed using basic shapes like triangles, squares, and hexagons, but they can also include more complex polygons or irregular shapes. Simple tessellation patterns are easy to create using regular polygons, while more advanced tessellations involve combining different shapes to form intricate designs. Patterns created by tessellation are found in both nature and human-made art.\n\n## Tessellation Examples\n\nTessellation examples can be found everywhere, from tile floors to intricate mosaics in architecture. A simple tessellation pattern is often used in designs like tiled walls or floors, while more elaborate tessellations appear in works of art and graphic design. Nature also provides tessellation examples, such as the arrangement of honeycomb cells, turtle shells, and the patterned skin of reptiles.\n\n## Applications of Tessellations\n\n### 1\\. In Nature\n\nTessellations are found in various natural structures. One of the most notable tessellation pattern examples is the honeycomb, where hexagonal cells tessellate to form a highly efficient and durable structure. The shells of turtles and certain fish scales also form tessellated patterns, making them excellent tessellation examples in nature. These natural tessellations highlight the practical use of geometry in creating strong, efficient structures.\n\n### 2\\. In Architecture and Design\n\nTessellations are widely used in architecture and design. Many ancient civilizations, particularly in Islamic art, utilized geometric tessellations to create intricate and visually appealing designs. Modern architects often use tessellations to create both functional and decorative surfaces. The regular repetition of polygons, like triangles and squares, provides a simple yet effective design method that can be adapted in numerous ways.\n\n### 3\\. In Modern Technology\n\nTessellations also play a critical role in computer graphics and 3D modeling. Tessellations help break down complex surfaces into smaller, tileable shapes for easier rendering. This is essential in video games and simulations, where large-scale models must be displayed with precision and efficiency. Computer scientists use tessellation ideas to create more detailed and accurate visual models, making tessellations vital in modern technology.\n\n## What Is a Tessellation?\n\nA tessellation is the arrangement of shapes that fit together without leaving gaps or overlaps. In mathematics, tessellations are particularly useful for studying symmetry and geometry, as they demonstrate how shapes can fill a space evenly. Tessellations can be regular, using only one type of polygon like squares or triangles, or irregular, using multiple shapes. The study of tessellations helps explain the structure of various natural and man-made patterns, from mosaic tiles to beehives.\n\n## Mathematical Properties of Tessellations\n\n### 1\\. Angle Measures\n\nFor a tessellation to be possible, the interior angles of the shapes meeting at each vertex must add up to 360 degrees. For instance, in a tessellation of regular hexagons, three hexagons meet at each point, and each has an interior angle of 120 degrees, which sums to 360\u00b0. This property explains why certain polygons, like squares and triangles, tessellate so easily.\n\n### 2\\. Symmetry and Transformations\n\nTessellations often exhibit several types of symmetry:\n\n- **Translational Symmetry**: The pattern can be shifted along a plane without changing its appearance.\n- **Rotational Symmetry**: The pattern looks the same after being rotated by a specific angle.\n- **Reflectional Symmetry**: The pattern can be reflected across a line or axis.\n\nThe study of symmetry in tessellations involves exploring how shapes can transform and still fit together perfectly. Symmetry adds to the visual appeal and mathematical meaning of tessellation patterns.\n\n### 3\\. Tiling the Euclidean Plane\n\nTessellations in mathematics are directly related to tiling the Euclidean plane, which is a flat, two-dimensional surface. This concept investigates which shapes can fill the plane without gaps or overlaps. Aperiodic tilings, such as Penrose tilings, do not repeat in a predictable pattern and are a fascinating area of study.\n\n## Tessellation Ideas for Exploration\n\nThere are countless tessellation ideas to explore, from creating simple geometric patterns with squares or triangles to designing complex tessellation patterns inspired by nature. Experimenting with a variety of polygons or even irregular shapes can lead to unique tessellation ideas for art, design, or even mathematical study.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nTessellations are a fundamental concept in mathematics, combining geometry, symmetry, and artistic expression. Whether found in nature, architecture, or computer graphics, tessellations offer insight into how shapes interact with space. By understanding t...",

Open this page[with map](https://ltb.itc.utwente.nl/page/498/concept/81533)instead.\n## Introduction&#xfeff;\nA regular tessellation is a partitioning of space into mutually exclusive cells that together make up the complete study area and in which the cells have the same shape and size. A simple example of this is a rectangular raster of unit squares, represented in a computer in the 2D case as an array of*n x m*elements.\n## Explanation&#xfeff;\nAll regular tessellations have in common that the cells have the same shape and size, and that the field attribute value assigned to a cell is associated with the entire area occupied by the cell. Square cell tessellation is commonly used, mainly because georeferencing of such a cell is straightforward. This type of tessellation is known under various names in different GIS packages: e.g.&ldquo;&ldquo;**raster**&rdquo; or &ldquo;raster map&rdquo;.\nThere are some issues related to cell-based partitioning of the study space. The field value of a cell can be interpreted as one for the complete tessellation cell, in which case the field is discrete, not continuous or even differentiable. Some convention is needed to state which value prevails on cell boundaries. With square cells, this convention states that lower and left boundaries belong to the cell. There are two approaches to refining the solution of this continuity issue: make the cell size smaller, so as to make the &ldquo;continuity gaps&rdquo; between the cells smaller; and/or assume that a cell value only represents elevation for one specific location in the cell, and to provide a good interpolation function for all other locations that have the continuity characteristic. If one wants to use rasters for continuous field representation, one usually uses the first approach but not the second, as the second technique is usually considered computationally too intensive for large rasters.\nThe location associated with a raster cell is fixed by convention: it may be the cell centroid (mid-point) or, for instance, its left lower corner. Values for other positions are computed using an interpolation function applied to one or more nearby field values. This allows us to represent continuous, even differentiable, functions. An important advantage of regular tessellations is that we know how they partition space, and that we can make our computations specific to this partitioning. This leads to fast algorithms. An obvious disadvantage is that they are not adaptive to the spatial phenomenon we want to represent. The cell boundaries are both artificial and fixed: they may or may not coincide with the boundaries of the phenomena of interest. If we use any of the above regular tessellations to represent an area with minor elevation differences, then, clearly we would need just as many cells as in a strongly undulating terrain: the data structure does not adapt to the lack of relief. We would, for instance, still use the*m &times; n*cells for the raster, even though variations in elevation are irrelevant.\n## Learning outcomes\n* [**2 - Spatial data modelling: computer representations**](https://ltb.itc.utwente.nl/498/learningoutcome/show/59268)\nExplain and be able to apply basic vector and raster spatial data structures including selecting a suitable data structure for geographic phenomena (level 1, 2 and 3).\n## Prior knowledge\n* [Tessellation](https://ltb.itc.utwente.nl/498/concept/81618)## Outgoing relations\n* Regular Tessellation*is a kind of*[Tessellation](https://ltb.itc.utwente.nl/498/concept/81618)## Incoming relations\n* [Continuous Field](https://ltb.itc.utwente.nl/498/concept/81530)*is modelled by*Regular Tessellation\n* [Discrete Field](https://ltb.itc.utwente.nl/498/concept/81500)*is modelled by*Regular Tessellation## Learning paths\n* [1.02 Spatial Data Modelling - Computer Representation](https://ltb.itc.utwente.nl/498/learningpath/show/709)\n[\n](https://www.itc.nl)[\n](https://www.utwente.nl)",

Irregular shape packing is one of the most recent variants to be widely researched and its history extends over 40 years. The evolution of solution approaches to this problem can be attributed to increased computer power and advances in geometric techniques as well as more sophisticated and insightful algorithm design. In this paper we will focus on the latter. Our aim is not to give a chronological account or an exhaustive review, but to draw on the literature to describe and evaluate the core approaches. Irregular packing is combinatorial and as a result solution methods are heuristic, save a few notable exceptions. We will explore different ways of representing the problem and mechanisms for moving between solutions. We will also propose where we see the future challenges for researchers in this area.\n\n## Suggested Citation\n\nJ A Bennell & J F Oliveira, 2009.\n\" **[A tutorial in irregular shape packing problems](https://ideas.repec.org/a/pal/jorsoc/v60y2009i1d10.1057_jors.2008.169.html)**,\"\n[Journal of the Operational Research Society](https://ideas.repec.org/s/pal/jorsoc.html), Palgrave Macmillan;The OR Society, vol. 60(1), pages 93-105, May.\nHandle: _RePEc:pal:jorsoc:v:60:y:2009:i:1:d:10.1057\\_jors.2008.169_\n\nDOI: 10.1057/jors.2008.169\n\nas\n\nHTMLHTML with abstractplain textplain text with abstractBibTeXRIS (EndNote, RefMan, ProCite)ReDIFJSON\n\n## Download full text from publisher\n\n**File URL:** http://link.springer.com/10.1057/jors.2008.169\n\n**File Function:** Abstract\n\n**Download Restriction:** Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.\n\n* * *\n\n**File URL:** https://libkey.io/10.1057/jors.2008.169?utm\\_source=ideas\n\n**LibKey link**: if access is restricted and if your library uses this service, LibKey will redirect you to where you can use your library subscription to access this item\n\n---><---\n\nAs the access to this document is restricted, you may want to [search](https://ideas.repec.org/cgi-bin/htsearch2?q=%22A+tutorial+in+irregular+shape+packing+problems%22) for a different version of it.\n\n## References listed on IDEAS\n\nas\n\nHTMLHTML with abstractplain textplain text with abstractBibTeXRIS (EndNote, RefMan, ProCite)ReDIFJSON\n\n01.
