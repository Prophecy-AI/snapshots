      "query": "What are the best algorithms for irregular polygon packing optimization in 2D?",
      "finding": "The best algorithms for irregular polygon packing optimization in 2D generally fall into categories such as heuristics, metaheuristics, and exact methods, with recent research emphasizing hybrid approaches. For instance, a hybrid approach combining genetic algorithms with linear programming has shown promising results in optimizing irregular packing problems, effectively handling complex shape arrangements ([MDPI](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/13/22/12474)). Additionally, simulated annealing-based algorithms have been successfully applied to irregular shape packing, demonstrating the ability to improve solutions and update best-known results on benchmark problems ([Sato et al., 2011](https://skoge.folk.ntnu.no/prost/proceedings/ifac11-proceedings/data/html/papers/0563.pdf)). \n\nOther notable methods include local search heuristics and multi-level algorithms that incorporate collision-free regions, which are effective in managing irregular shapes and minimizing waste ([Abeysooriya et al",

      "query": "What are tessellation patterns for packing identical irregular shapes efficiently?",
      "finding": "Tessellation patterns for packing identical irregular shapes efficiently involve arranging shapes in a way that covers a surface without gaps or overlaps. While regular tessellations typically use polygons like triangles, squares, or hexagons, irregular shapes can also tessellate if they meet certain conditions. For example, all triangles and quadrilaterals can tessellate regardless of their specific shape, and some irregular pentagons are capable of tessellating, with only 15 types proven to do so ([studypug](https://www.studypug.com/us/grade6/understand-tessellations); [mathcuriosity](https://www.mathcuriosity.com/tessellations)). \n\nEfficient packing of irregular shapes often employs heuristic and optimization approaches, such as continuous and combinatorial optimization, to improve surface coverage and tile arrangement. These methods iteratively partition the surface into regions and optimize the positions and orientations of the shapes to maximize coverage while minimizing gaps. Su",
