      "query": "What are the best algorithms for irregular polygon packing optimization in 2D?",
      "finding": "The best algorithms for irregular polygon packing optimization in 2D generally fall into categories such as heuristics, metaheuristics, and exact methods, with recent research emphasizing hybrid approaches. For instance, a hybrid approach combining genetic algorithms with linear programming has shown promising results in optimizing irregular packing problems, effectively handling complex shape arrangements ([MDPI](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/13/22/12474)). Additionally, simulated annealing-based algorithms have been successfully applied to irregular shape packing, demonstrating the ability to improve solutions and update best-known results on benchmark problems ([Sato et al., 2011](https://skoge.folk.ntnu.no/prost/proceedings/ifac11-proceedings/data/html/papers/0563.pdf)). \n\nOther notable methods include local search heuristics and multi-level algorithms that incorporate collision-free regions, which are effective in managing irregular shapes and minimizing waste ([Abeysooriya et al",
