The goal is to place all polygons inside the smallest possible axis\u2011aligned rectangle (or strip) while avoiding overlap.  Because the problem is NP\u2011hard, most state\u2011of\u2011the\u2011art approaches fall into two families: **exact/branch\u2011and\u2011bound formulations** that guarantee optimality for modest instance sizes, and **high\u2011performance heuristics** that give near\u2011optimal solutions on industrial\u2011scale data.\n\n**Exact and mixed\u2011integer models.**  A recent mixed\u2011integer programming (MIP) model slices the strip into vertical columns and encodes non\u2011overlap with binary variables; this formulation yields provably optimal layouts for small to medium sets of irregular pieces but quickly becomes computationally expensive as the number of polygons grows\u202f([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.00032)).
