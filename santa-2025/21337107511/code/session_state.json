      "strategy": "# Santa 2025 - Christmas Tree Packing Challenge: Seed Prompt\n\n## Problem Overview\n\nThis is a 2D irregular polygon packing optimization problem. The goal is to pack Christmas tree shapes (15-vertex polygons) into the smallest square bounding box for N=1 to 200 trees.\n\n**Scoring Formula:** score = \u03a3(side_n\u00b2/n) for n=1 to 200\n- Lower is better\n- N=1 contributes ~0.66 to score (HIGHEST per-tree impact!)\n- Small N values (1-20) are critical - they contribute disproportionately to the total score\n\n**Target Score:** Beat 68.888293\n\n## \u26d4 ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN (EXPERIMENT WILL BE REJECTED)\n\nThe following are PERMANENTLY FORBIDDEN after baseline:\n- bbox3 - FORBIDDEN\n- sa_fast_v2 - FORBIDDEN  \n- eazy_optimizer - FORBIDDEN\n- tree_packer - FORBIDDEN\n- shake_public - FORBIDDEN\n- subprocess.run() - FORBIDDEN\n- os.system() - FORBIDDEN\n- ANY pre-compiled binary or executable - FORBIDDEN\n- \"Optimizing\" existing CSV files with any tool - FORBIDDEN\n- Running \"more iterations\" on any optimizer - FORBIDDEN\n\nIf your experiment runs ANY binary, it will produce ~70.6.\nThe target is 68.89. BINARIES CANNOT GET THERE.\n\n## \u2705 MANDATORY FIRST TASK: SOLVE N=1-10 OPTIMALLY\n\nBEFORE any other work, implement exhaustive search for small N:\n\n**For N=1 (contributes ~0.66 to score - HIGHEST!):**\n- Test EVERY rotation angle from 0\u00b0 to 360\u00b0 in 0.01\u00b0 increments\n- Find the angle that minimizes bounding box\n- This alone can improve score by 0.05-0.1 points\n\n**For N=2-10:**\n- Implement branch-and-bound or exhaustive placement search\n- These contribute ~2.5 points total - worth optimizing!\n\n## \u2705 MANDATORY: PER-N SOLUTION TRACKING\n\nTrack best solution for EACH N value separately:\n1. Load baseline per-N scores from existing submission\n2. After your algorithm runs, compare per-N scores\n3. SAVE any N where you improved (even if total is worse)\n4. Accumulate improvements across experiments\n\n## \u2705 REQUIRED: IMPLEMENT ALGORITHM IN PYTHON\n\nWrite YOUR OWN code. Choose ONE:\n1. Bottom-left constructive heuristic (easiest)\n2. Genetic algorithm with crossover (medium)\n3. Custom local search written from scratch (medium)\n4. Branch-and-bound for exact solutions (hardest)\n\nNO BINARIES. NO SUBPROCESS. NO OS.SYSTEM.\nWRITE THE ALGORITHM YOURSELF IN PYTHON.\n\n## Existing Baseline Solutions\n\nPre-optimized solutions exist in `/home/nonroot/snapshots/santa-2025/`. There are 112 snapshot directories with submission files. Use these as starting points:\n\n```python\n# Load a baseline submission\nimport pandas as pd\nbaseline = pd.read_csv('/home/nonroot/snapshots/santa-2025/20952569566/submission/submission.csv')\n```\n\n## Tree Geometry (15 vertices)\n\n```python\n# Tree polygon vertices (center at origin, tip at top)\nTX = [0, 0.125, 0.0625, 0.2, 0.1, 0.35, 0.075, 0.075, -0.075, -0.075, -0.35, -0.1, -0.2, -0.0625, -0.125]\nTY = [0.8, 0.5, 0.5, 0.25, 0.25, 0, 0, -0.2, -0.2, 0, 0, 0.25, 0.25, 0.5, 0.5]\n\n# Tree dimensions:\n# - Height: 1.0 (from trunk bottom at -0.2 to tip at 0.8)\n# - Max width: 0.7 (at base tier)\n# - Trunk: 0.15 wide, 0.2 tall\n```\n\n## Insights from Discussions (MANDATORY)\n\n- Discussion \"Why the winning solutions will be Asymmetric\" (39 votes): Asymmetric solutions outperform symmetric lattice patterns. Don't constrain to 90\u00b0 rotations.\n- Discussion \"IMPORTANT: Santa Etiquette\" (78 votes): Competition etiquette guidelines from staff.\n- Discussion \"Expected Leaderboard Progression\" (20 votes): Staff expectations for score progression.\n- Discussion \"Where do these high-scoring CSVs originate from?\" (13 votes): Top solutions come from extensive optimization runs.\n- Discussion \"Symmetric solutions that are apparently optimal\" (43 votes): Some N values have provably optimal symmetric solutions.\n- Discussion \"What are the best approaches?\" (6 votes): Community discussion on effective techniques.\n\n## What Discussions Say DOESN'T Work\n- Simple greedy placement without optimization\n- Symmetric lattice patterns for most N (asymmetric is better)\n- Running binaries without understanding the algorithm\n- Claude Code alone: \"7,850 Rounds of Optimization, 0 Improvements\" (13 votes discussion)\n\n## Key Techniques from Research\n\n### 1. No-Fit Polygon (NFP) - CRITICAL for efficiency\nThe NFP enables O(1) overlap checking between two polygons:\n- Precompute NFP for tree shape at different rotation angles\n- If reference point is inside NFP \u2192 overlap\n- If on boundary \u2192 touching\n- If outside \u2192 no overlap\n\n### 2. Bottom-Left-Fill Heuristic\nPlace each tree at the lowest, leftmost valid position:\n1. Sort trees by some criteria (area, height, etc.)\n2. For each tree, find all valid positions\n3. Choose the position that minimizes bounding box increase\n\n### 3. Local Search Moves\n- **Translation**: Move tree by small delta (0.001 to 0.01 units)\n- **Rotation**: Rotate tree by small angle (0.1\u00b0 to 5\u00b0)\n- **Squeeze**: Scale all positions toward center\n- **Compaction**: Move each tree toward centroid\n\n### 4. Simulated Annealing Framework\n```python\ndef simulated_annealing(config, T_start=1.0, T_end=0.001, cooling=0.9999):\n    T = T_start\n    best = config.copy()\n    while T > T_end:\n        # Generate neighbor by random move\n        neighbor = apply_random_move(config)\n        if not has_overlap(neighbor):\n            delta = neighbor.score() - config.score()\n            if delta < 0 or random() < exp(-delta/T):\n                config = neighbor\n                if config.score() < best.score():\n                    best = config\n        T *= cooling\n    return best\n```\n\n### 5. Boundary Tree Focus\nTrees touching the bounding box boundary determine the score:\n- Identify boundary trees (those at min/max x or y)\n- Focus optimization on these trees\n- Moving interior trees rarely improves score\n\n### 6. Backward Propagation\nUse N+1 solution to improve N solution:\n- Start from N=200 configuration\n- Remove one tree at a time\n- If resulting N-1 config is better than stored, save it\n\n## Algorithm Implementation Strategy\n\n### Phase 1: Exact Solutions for Small N (N=1-10)\n```python\ndef solve_small_n_exactly(n):\n    if n == 1:\n        # Find optimal rotation for single tree\n        best_angle = 0\n        best_side = float('inf')\n        for angle in range(0, 36000):  # 0.01\u00b0 increments\n            tree = create_tree(0, 0, angle/100)\n            side = get_bounding_box_side(tree)\n            if side < best_side:\n                best_side = side\n                best_angle = angle/100\n        return [(0, 0, best_angle)]\n    \n    # For N=2-10, use exhaustive search with pruning\n    # ...\n```\n\n### Phase 2: Constructive Heuristic for Medium N (N=11-50)\n```python\ndef bottom_left_fill(n, existing_trees=None):\n    trees = existing_trees or []\n    while len(trees) < n:\n        best_pos = None\n        best_score = float('inf')\n        # Try many positions and rotations\n        for angle in range(0, 360, 5):\n            for pos in candidate_positions(trees, angle):\n                if not has_overlap(trees, pos, angle):\n                    score = evaluate_score(trees + [(pos, angle)])\n                    if score < best_score:\n                        best_score = score\n                        best_pos = (pos, angle)\n        trees.append(best_pos)\n    return trees\n```\n\n### Phase 3: Local Search for Large N (N=51-200)\n```python\ndef local_search(trees, max_iter=10000):\n    best = trees.copy()\n    for _ in range(max_iter):\n        # Pick random tree\n        i = random.randint(0, len(trees)-1)\n        # Try small perturbation\n        for move in generate_moves(trees[i]):\n            new_trees = apply_move(trees, i, move)\n            if not has_overlap(new_trees) and score(new_trees) < score(best):\n                best = new_trees\n                trees = new_trees\n                break\n    return best\n```\n\n## Overlap Detection (CRITICAL)\n\n```python\nfrom shapely.geometry import Polygon\nfrom shapely import affinity\n\ndef create_tree_polygon(x, y, angle):\n    TX = [0, 0.125, 0.0625, 0.2, 0.1, 0.35, 0.075, 0.075, -0.075, -0.075, -0.35, -0.1, -0.2, -0.0625, -0.125]\n    TY = [0.8, 0.5, 0.5, 0.25, 0.25, 0, 0, -0.2, -0.2, 0, 0, 0.25, 0.25, 0.5, 0.5]\n    poly = Polygon(zip(TX, TY))\n    poly = affinity.rotate(poly, angle, origin=(0, 0))\n    poly = affinity.translate(poly, x, y)\n    return poly\n\ndef has_overlap(trees):\n    polys = [create_tree_polygon(*t) for t in trees]\n    for i in range(len(polys)):\n        for j in range(i+1, len(polys)):\n            if polys[i].intersects(polys[j]) and not polys[i].touches(polys[j]):\n                return True\n    return False\n```\n\n## Score Calculation\n\n```python\ndef calculate_score(all_solutions):\n    \"\"\"Calculate total score for all N=1 to 200\"\"\"\n    total = 0\n    for n in range(1, 201):\n        trees = all_solutions[n]\n        polys = [create_tree_polygon(*t) for t in trees]\n        from shapely.ops import unary_union\n        bounds = unary_union(polys).bounds\n        side = max(bounds[2] - bounds[0], bounds[3] - bounds[1])\n        contribution = (side ** 2) / n\n        total += contribution\n    return total\n\ndef calculate_per_n_scores(all_solutions):\n    \"\"\"Calculate score contribution for each N\"\"\"\n    scores = {}\n    for n in range(1, 201):\n        trees = all_solutions[n]\n        polys = [create_tree_polygon(*t) for t in trees]\n        from shapely.ops import unary_union\n        bounds = unary_union(polys).bounds\n        side = max(bounds[2] - bounds[0], bounds[3] - bounds[1])\n        scores[n] = (side ** 2) / n\n    return scores\n```\n\n## Submission Format\n\n```python\ndef create_submission(all_solutions):\n    rows = []\n    for n in range(1, 201):\n        trees = all_solutions[n]\n        for idx, (x, y, angle) in enumerate(trees):\n            rows.append({\n                'id': f'{n:03d}_{idx}',\n                'x': f's{x:.6f}',\n                'y': f's{y:.6f}',\n                'deg': f's{angle:.6f}'\n            })\n    return pd.DataFrame(rows)\n```\n\n## Recommended Experiment Priority\n\n1. **FIRST**: Implement exact solver for N=1 (find optimal rotation)\n2. **SECOND**: Implement exact solver for N=2-5 \n3. **THIRD**: Implement bottom-left-fill for N=6-50\n4. **FOURTH**: Implement local search refinement for all N\n5. **FIFTH**: Implement backward propagation from large N to small N\n\n## Key Insights for Winning\n\n1. **Small N matters most**: N=1 alone contributes 0.66 to score. Perfect N=1-10 can save 0.5+ points.\n\n2. **Asymmetric beats symmetric**: Don't constrain rotations to 90\u00b0 increments. Use continuous angles.\n\n3. **Boundary trees are key**: Only trees touching the bounding box affect the score. Focus optimization there.\n\n4. **Per-N tracking is essential**: Track best solution for each N separately. Combine best across experiments.\n\n5. **Python can win**: The top solutions use C++ for speed, but a well-designed Python algorithm with good heuristics can achieve competitive results.\n\n6. **Use existing baselines**: Start from pre-optimized solutions in snapshots, don't build from scratch.\n\n## Validation\n\nAlways validate before submission:\n```python\ndef validate_submission(df):\n    for n in range(1, 201):\n        group = df[df['id'].str.startswith(f'{n:03d}_')]\n        trees = [(float(r['x'][1:]), float(r['y'][1:]), float(r['deg'][1:])) \n                 for _, r in group.iterrows()]\n        if has_overlap(trees):\n            print(f\"OVERLAP at N={n}!\")\n            return False\n    return True\n```\n\n## DO NOT\n\n- Do NOT use pre-compiled binaries\n- Do NOT just run more iterations of existing optimizers\n- Do NOT copy solutions without understanding them\n- Do NOT ignore small N values\n- Do NOT use symmetric-only rotations\n\n## DO\n\n- DO implement your own algorithms in Python\n- DO focus on small N first (N=1-20)\n- DO track per-N improvements\n- DO use Shapely for geometry\n- DO validate before every submission\n- DO start from existing baseline solutions in snapshots\n",

Local Shapely validation shows NO overlaps in the baseline\n2. Kaggle rejected with \"Overlapping trees in group 040\"\n3. When coordinates are rounded to 6 decimals, 161/200 N values develop overlaps\n4. The original coordinates are EXTREMELY precisely tuned\n\n**BEFORE ANY SUBMISSION, you MUST:**\n1. Use a snapshot that has been validated by Kaggle (if available)\n2. OR implement stricter overlap validation matching Kaggle's precision\n\n## Response to Evaluator\n\nThe evaluator correctly identified that:\n1. N=1 is ALREADY OPTIMAL at 45\u00b0 (confirmed - no improvement possible)\n2. The code directory is empty - no algorithm implementation yet\n3. Per-N tracking infrastructure is needed\n\nHowever, the evaluator missed the critical overlap validation issue that caused the submission to fail. This must be addressed FIRST before any optimization work.\n\n## Recommended Approaches (Priority Order)\n\n### 1. **[HIGHEST PRIORITY]** Fix Overlap Validation & Get Valid Baseline\n- Use snapshot 21328310479 (score 70.615745) which passed local validation\n- Submit to verify it passes Kaggle's validation\n- If it fails, we need to understand Kaggle's exact validation algorithm\n\n### 2. **[HIGH PRIORITY]** Implement Stricter Overlap Validation\nBefore generating ANY new solutions, implement validation that matches Kaggle:\n```python\n# Use buffer-based validation with small negative buffer\ndef validate_no_overlap_strict(trees, buffer=-1e-9):\n    polys = [create_tree_polygon(*t).buffer(buffer) for t in trees]\n    for i in range(len(polys)):\n        for j in range(i+1, len(polys)):\n            if polys[i].intersects(polys[j]) and not polys[i].touches(polys[j]):\n                return False, f\"Trees {i} and {j} overlap\"\n    return True, \"OK\"\n```\n\n### 3. **[MEDIUM PRIORITY]** Implement N=2-10 Optimization\nOnce we have a valid baseline, optimize small N values:\n- N=2-10 contribute ~3.67 points total\n- Even 10% improvement = 0.37 points (significant!)\n- Use exhaustive search with pruning for N=2-5\n- Use local search for N=6-10\n\n### 4. **[LOWER PRIORITY]** Implement Novel Algorithms\nAfter small N optimization:\n- Bottom-left constructive heuristic\n- Custom simulated annealing (NOT using binaries)\n- Genetic algorithm with crossover\n\n## \u26d4 FORBIDDEN (WILL BE REJECTED)\n- bbox3, sa_fast_v2, eazy_optimizer, tree_packer - FORBIDDEN\n- subprocess.run() or os.system() - FORBIDDEN\n- Running ANY binary or executable - FORBIDDEN\n- Generating solutions without strict overlap validation - FORBIDDEN\n\n## \u2705 MANDATORY FIRST TASK\n\n**Submit the new baseline (snapshot 21328310479) to verify it passes Kaggle validation.**\n\nThe submission file is already at /home/submission/submission.csv (copied from snapshot 21328310479).\n\nIf it passes:\n- We have a valid baseline at 70.615745\n- We can proceed with optimization\n\nIf it fails:\n- We need to investigate Kaggle's exact validation algorithm\n- May need to use sample_submission.csv as fallback (score ~173.6)\n\n## Per-N Score Analysis\n\nFrom baseline analysis:\n- N=1: 0.661250 (ALREADY OPTIMAL - no improvement possible)\n- N=2: 0.450779 (theoretical min ~0.246, gap = 0.205)\n- N=3: 0.434745 (theoretical min ~0.246, gap = 0.189)\n- N=4: 0.416545 (theoretical min ~0.246, gap = 0.171)\n- N=5: 0.416850 (theoretical min ~0.246, gap = 0.171)\n\n**Focus on N=2-10 where there's significant gap to theoretical minimum.**\n\n## Validation Code (MANDATORY)\n\n```python\nfrom shapely.geometry import Polygon\nfrom shapely import affinity\n\nTX = [0, 0.125, 0.0625, 0.2, 0.1, 0.35, 0.075, 0.075, -0.075, -0.075, -0.35, -0.1, -0.2, -0.0625, -0.125]\nTY = [0.8, 0.5, 0.5, 0.25, 0.25, 0, 0, -0.2, -0.2, 0, 0, 0.25, 0.25, 0.5, 0.5]\n\ndef create_tree_polygon(x, y, angle):\n    poly = Polygon(zip(TX, TY))\n    poly = affinity.rotate(poly, angle, origin=(0, 0))\n    poly = affinity.translate(poly, x, y)\n    return poly\n\ndef validate_solution(trees):\n    \"\"\"Validate that trees don't overlap.\"\"\"\n    polys = [create_tree_polygon(*t) for t in trees]\n    for i in range(len(polys)):\n        for j in range(i+1, len(polys)):\n            if polys[i].intersects(polys[j]):\n                intersection = polys[i].intersection(polys[j])\n                if intersection.area > 1e-15:  # Very strict threshold\n                    return False, f\"Trees {i} and {j} overlap (area={intersection.area:.2e})\"\n    return True, \"OK\"\n\n# ALWAYS validate before submission!\nfor n in range(1, 201):\n    ok, msg = validate_solution(solutions[n])\n    if not ok:\n        raise ValueError(f\"N={n}: {msg}\")\n```\n\n## Submission Strategy\n- Remaining submissions: 94\n- Submit the new baseline IMMEDIATELY to verify it passes Kaggle\n- If it passes, we have a valid starting point\n- If it fails, investigate further before any optimization work\n\n## Existing Baseline Solutions\n\nPre-optimized solutions exist in `/home/nonroot/snapshots/santa-2025/`.

      "feedback": "## What I Understood\n\nThe junior researcher has completed the baseline experiment (exp_000) which establishes the starting point for this optimization competition. They identified the best pre-existing solution from 112 snapshots (snapshot 21331543270) with a score of 70.615791. The target is 68.888293, requiring an improvement of ~1.73 points. They also analyzed per-N score contributions, correctly identifying that N=1 contributes the most (0.661) and small N values (1-10) contribute ~4.03 points total.\n\n## Technical Execution Assessment\n\n**Validation**: The baseline selection methodology is sound - they evaluated multiple snapshots and selected the best one. The score calculation using Shapely for geometry operations is correct.\n\n**Leakage Risk**: Not applicable for this optimization problem - there's no train/test split or data leakage concern.\n\n**Score Integrity**: Verified in the notebook output - the score of 70.615791 is correctly computed and matches the metrics.json file.\n\n**Code Quality**: The code is clean and functional. The helper functions (create_tree_polygon, parse_submission, calculate_score) are well-implemented and will be reusable for future experiments.\n\nVerdict: **TRUSTWORTHY**\n\n## Strategic Assessment\n\n**Approach Fit**: This is an appropriate first step - establishing a baseline before implementing improvements. The analysis of per-N contributions is valuable for prioritizing optimization efforts.\n\n**Effort Allocation**: Correct prioritization. The seed prompt is clear that:\n1. N=1 alone contributes 0.661 to the score - finding the optimal rotation could save 0.05-0.1 points\n2. N=1-10 together contribute ~4.03 points - significant optimization potential\n3. Binaries are FORBIDDEN - must implement algorithms in Python\n\n**Assumptions**: The baseline assumes the snapshot solutions are the best available starting point. This is reasonable given 112 pre-optimized snapshots exist.\n\n**Blind Spots**: \n- The code directory is EMPTY - no algorithm implementation has been started yet\n- The seed prompt's MANDATORY FIRST TASK (solve N=1-10 optimally) has not been attempted\n- No submission has been made to verify LB score matches CV score\n\n**Trajectory**: This is experiment 0 - the foundation is solid, but the real work hasn't started. The gap to target (1.73 points) is substantial and will require significant algorithmic innovation.\n\n## What's Working\n\n1. **Solid baseline selection**: Found the best available pre-optimized solution (70.615791)\n2. **Per-N analysis**: Correctly identified that small N values are the highest-leverage targets\n3. **Reusable code**: The geometry functions (create_tree_polygon, calculate_score) are well-implemented\n4. **Clear understanding of constraints**: The seed prompt correctly identifies that binaries cannot reach the target\n\n## Key Concerns\n\n### 1. No Algorithm Implementation Yet\n- **Observation**: The code directory is empty. No optimization algorithm has been written.\n- **Why it matters**: The baseline is just a starting point. To beat 68.888293, you need to implement actual optimization algorithms in Python. The seed prompt explicitly states binaries produce ~70.6 and CANNOT reach the target.\n- **Suggestion**: Immediately implement the N=1 optimal rotation finder. This is the MANDATORY FIRST TASK per the seed prompt. It's simple (just test all rotations from 0\u00b0 to 360\u00b0 in 0.01\u00b0 increments) and can improve the score by 0.05-0.1 points.\n\n### 2. N=1 Optimization is Low-Hanging Fruit\n- **Observation**: N=1 contributes 0.661 to the score. The current solution uses angle 230.193647\u00b0.\n- **Why it matters**: For a single tree, the optimal rotation minimizes the bounding box. This is a simple 1D optimization that can be solved exactly by exhaustive search.\n- **Suggestion**: Implement exhaustive search for N=1:\n```python\nbest_angle = 0\nbest_side = float('inf')\nfor angle in range(0, 36000):  # 0.01\u00b0 increments\n    tree = create_tree_polygon(0, 0, angle/100)\n    bounds = tree.bounds\n    side = max(bounds[2] - bounds[0], bounds[3] - bounds[1])\n    if side < best_side:\n        best_side = side\n        best_angle = angle/100\n```\n\n### 3. No LB Verification\n- **Observation**: 0 submissions have been made (94 remaining today, 100 total).\n- **Why it matters**: The CV score (70.615791) should be verified against the LB to ensure the scoring methodology is correct.\n- **Suggestion**: Submit the baseline to verify CV-LB alignment before investing in optimization.\n\n### 4. Per-N Tracking Infrastructure Needed\n- **Observation**: The seed prompt emphasizes tracking best solutions for EACH N separately.\n- **Why it matters**: Even if total score doesn't improve, individual N improvements should be saved and accumulated across experiments.\n- **Suggestion**: Create a \"best_per_n.json\" file that tracks the best solution for each N value. Update it whenever any experiment improves a specific N.\n\n## Top Priority for Next Experiment\n\n**IMPLEMENT N=1 OPTIMAL ROTATION FINDER**\n\nThis is explicitly the MANDATORY FIRST TASK in the seed prompt. Here's why it's the highest priority:\n\n1. **Highest per-tree impact**: N=1 contributes 0.661 to the score - more than any other single N\n2. **Simplest to implement**: Just test all rotations and pick the best one\n3. **Guaranteed improvement**: The current angle (230.193647\u00b0) is unlikely to be exactly optimal\n4. **Quick win**: Can be implemented in <30 minutes and provides immediate score improvement\n\nAfter N=1, extend to N=2-5 using exhaustive placement search with pruning. The seed prompt estimates that perfect N=1-10 can save 0.5+ points - that's nearly 30% of the gap to target!\n\n**Do NOT:**\n- Use any binaries (bbox3, sa_fast_v2, etc.) - they're FORBIDDEN\n- Skip small N to work on large N - small N has higher leverage\n- Assume the baseline is close to optimal - there's significant room for improvement\n\n**DO:**\n- Implement the N=1 solver immediately\n- Track per-N improvements separately\n- Submit the baseline to verify CV-LB alignment\n- Build toward N=2-10 exact solvers next\n",
