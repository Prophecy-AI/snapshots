      "finding": "This is a 2D polygon packing problem: pack Christmas tree shapes (15-vertex polygons) into smallest square bounding box for N=1 to 200 trees. Score = sum(side^2/N) for all N. Key insight: N=1 contributes ~0.66 to score (highest per-tree impact), small N values are critical.",

      "finding": "Top kernels use C++ compiled binaries (bbox3, shake_public, tree_packer) for simulated annealing optimization. They start from pre-optimized CSV files and run SA with moves: translation, rotation, squeeze, compaction. Key techniques: boundary tree identification, swap moves, multi-start SA.",
