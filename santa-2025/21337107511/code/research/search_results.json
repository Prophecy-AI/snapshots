      "text": "Symmetric and asymmetric solutions in 2D polygon packing optimization differ primarily in how they handle object placement and problem constraints. Symmetric solutions typically involve placing polygons in a manner that maintains certain symmetry properties, such as mirror or rotational symmetry, which can simplify the problem and reduce the search space ([Invited Review, 2002](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0377221702001236)). These solutions often exploit geometric symmetry to improve packing efficiency and computational performance.\n\nIn contrast, asymmetric solutions do not impose symmetry constraints, allowing polygons to be placed freely without regard to symmetry considerations. This flexibility can lead to more optimal packings in complex or irregular configurations but generally increases computational complexity. Asymmetric packing strategies are common in practical applications where symmetry is either undesirable or infeasible, and they often require more sophisticated algorithms to handle the increased solution space ([Frontiers, 2022](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmech.2022.966691/full)).",

In*two-dimensional bin packing problems*these units are finite rectangles, and the objective is to pack all the items into the minimum number of units, while in*two-dimensional strip packing problems*there is a single standardized unit of given width, and the objective is to pack all the items within the minimum height. We discuss mathematical models, and survey lower bounds, classical approximation algorithms, recent heuristic and metaheuristic methods and exact enumerative approaches. The relevant special cases where the items have to be packed into rows forming levels are also discussed in detail.\n## Introduction\nIn several industrial applications one is required to allocate a set of rectangular items to larger rectangular standardized stock units by minimizing the waste. In wood or glass industries, rectangular components have to be cut from large sheets of material. In warehousing contexts, goods have to be placed on shelves. In newspapers paging, articles and advertisements have to be arranged in pages. In these applications, the standardized stock units are rectangles, and a common objective function is to pack all the requested items into the minimum number of units: the resulting optimization problems are known in the literature as two-dimensional bin packing problems. In other contexts, such as paper or cloth industries, we have instead a single standardized unit (a roll of material), and the objective is to obtain the items by using the minimum roll length: the problems are then referred to as two-dimensional strip packing problems. As we will see in the following, the two problems have a strict relation in almost all algorithmic approaches to their solution.\nMost of the contributions in the literature are devoted to the case where the items to be packed have a fixed orientation with respect to the stock unit(s), i.e., one is not allowed to rotate them. This case, which is the object of the present article, reflects a number of practical contexts, such as the cutting of corrugated or decorated material (wood, glass, cloth industries), or the newspapers paging. For variants allowing rotations (usually by 90\u00b0) and/or constraints on the items placement (such as the \u201cguillotine cuts\u201d), the reader is referred to Lodi et al. [41], [42], where a three-field classification of the area is also introduced. General surveys on cutting and packing problems can be found in Dyckhoff and Finke [17], Dowsland and Dowsland [16] and Dyckhoff et al. [18]. Results on the probabilistic analysis of packing algorithms can be found in Coffman and Shor [12] and Coffman and Lueker [11].\nLet us introduce the problems in a more formal way. We are given a set of*n*rectangular*items**j*\u2208*J*={1,\u2026,*n*}, each defined by a*width*,*w**j*, and a*height*,*h**j*:\n* (i)\nin the*Two-Dimensional Bin Packing Problem*(2BP), we are further given an unlimited number of identical rectangular*bins*of width*W*and height*H*, and the objective is to allocate all the items to the minimum number of bins;\n* (ii)\nin the*Two-Dimensional Strip Packing Problem*(2SP), we are further given a bin of width*W*and infinite height (hereafter called*strip*), and the objective is to allocate all the items to the strip by minimizing the height to which the strip is used.\nIn both cases, the items have to be packed with their*w*-edges parallel to the*W*-edge of the bins (or strip). We will assume, with no loss of generality, that all input data are positive integers, and that*w**j*\u2a7d*W*and*h**j*\u2a7d*H*(*j*=1,\u2026,*n*).\nBoth problems are strongly NP-hard, as is easily seen by transformation from the strongly NP-hard (one-dimensional)*Bin Packing Problem*(1BP), in which*n*items, each having an associated size*h**j*, have to be partitioned into the minimum number of subsets so that the sum of the sizes in each subset does not exceed a given capacity*H*.\nA third relevant case of rectangle packing is the following. Each item*j*has an associated profit*p**j*&gt;0, and the problem is to select a subset of items, to be packed in a single finite bin, which maximizes the total selected profit. This problem is usually denoted as (*Two-Dimensional*)*Cutting Stock*, although it had been introduced by Gilmore and Gomory [29] as (*Two-Dimensional*)*Cutting Knapsack*.\nIn this survey we concentrate on two-dimensional problems in which all items have to be packed, i.e., on 2SP and 2BP. The reader is referred to Dyckhoff et al. [18, Section 5] for an annotated bibliography on two-dimensional cutting stock problems. For both 2SP and 2BP, we also consider the special case where the items have to be packed into rows forming levels.\nIn Section 2 we discuss mathematical models for the various problems introduced above. In Section 3 we survey classical approximation algorithms as well as more recent heuristic and metaheuristic methods. In Section 4 we introduce lower bounding techniques, while in Section 5 we describe exact enumerative approaches.\n## Section snippets\n## Modeling two-dimensional problems\nThe first attempt to model two-dimensional packing problems was made by Gilmore and Gomory [29], through an extension of their approach to 1BP (see [27], [28]). They proposed a column generation approach (see [53] for a recent survey) based on the enumeration of all subsets of items (*patterns*) that can be packed into a single bin. Let*A**j*be a binary column vector of*n*elements*a**ij*(*i*=1,\u2026,*n*) taking the value 1 if item*i*belongs to the*j*th pattern, and the value 0 otherwise.

An efficient 2D irregular packing algorithm can effectively improve material utilization and reduce processing costs. The reduction in material consumption will also have a beneficial impact on the environment ([Ke et al., 2020](#B76)). Therefore, research of the packing problem is of great significance for technology and social interest.\nThe 2D packing problem is a type of combinatorial optimization problems to locate parts with different shapes compactly in one or more master sheet material to minimize the occupied space or maximize the utilization of the material. The 2D packing problem is currently recognized as a NP problem, which is mainly solved by heuristic algorithms. In recent years, many scholars have conducted research on 2D irregular packing problems with a verity of solutions.\nThere exists a number of review articles on packing and cutting problems. We have summarized the main review literature in the field of 2D packing and cutting as shown in[Table 1](#T1). Brown ([Brown, 1971](#B17)) introduced an optimum packing and depletion problem with optimization of space and resource usage. Harvey ([Salkin and De Kluyver, 1975](#B116)) surveyed the application of mathematical optimization models such as linear programming to the knapsack problem. Bruce ([Golden, 1976](#B50)) surveyed various approaches to the cutting stock problem. Hinxman ([Hinxman, 1980](#B65)) surveyed the trim-loss and assortment problems, this research paid more attention to cutting and packaging problems in practical applications, and did not mention much about theoretical methods. Garey and Coffman ([Garey and Johnson, 1981](#B47);[Coffman et al., 1984](#B27)) surveyed the approximation algorithms for bin packing problems. Israni ([Israni and Sanders, 1982](#B72)) reviewed the 2D cutting stock problem including almost all 2D packaging problems. The author also proposed a rectangular layout method. Sarin ([Sarin, 1983](#B118)) reviewed methodologies and literature to solve 2D stock cutting problems and introduced an interactive optimization procedure for a general 2D stock cutting problem. Dyckhoff ([Dyckhoff et al., 1985](#B38)) described a trim loss and related problems and categorized them briefly. Dudzi&#x00144;ski ([Dudzi&#x00144;ski and Walukiewicz, 1987](#B36)) summarized the exact methods for knapsack problems, such as linear programming. Matthias ([Rode and Rosenberg, 1987](#B114)) analyzed the algorithm for the trim-loss problems. Haessler ([Haessler and Sweeney, 1991](#B59)) reviewed the solution process of cutting stock problems, including placement algorithm and sequence optimization algorithm. Dowsland ([Dowsland and Dowsland, 1992](#B34)) reviewed the application of operations research methods to the packing problem and summarized some exact heuristics. Sweeney ([Sweeney and Paternoster, 1992](#B128)) categorized cutting and packing problems and made application-oriented research records. Cheng ([Cheng et al., 1994](#B22)) discussed 2D cutting stock problems and their application cases including the pallet loading problem and VLSI placement problem. With the gradual deepening of research on 2D layout problems, typology becomes a common research topic. 2D regular and irregular layout problems are clearly distinguished in practical applications and theoretical methods. Dowsland ([Dowsland and Dowsland, 1995](#B29)) gave a special review of the 2D irregular nesting problem for the first time. Mavridou ([Mavridou and Pardalos, 1997](#B98)) summarized applications of the genetic algorithm and simulated annealing algorithm in the optimization of facility layout problems. Dyckhoff ([Dyckhoff, 1990](#B37)) made a typology of the cutting and packing problems in detail, and W&#x000e4;scher ([W&#x000e4;scher et al., 2007](#B135)) improved the typology later. Hopper ([Hopper and Turton, 1999](#B67);[Hopper and Turton, 2001a](#B68);[Hopper and Turton, 2001b](#B69)) investigated the application of meta-heuristic and heuristic algorithms in 2D and 3D packing problems. Lodi ([Lodi et al., 2002a](#B90);[Lodi et al., 2002b](#B91)) reviewed algorithms proposed in the 1990s of 2D packing problems. Bennell et al. ([Bennell and Oliveira, 2008](#B10);[Bennell and Oliveira, 2009](#B9)) discussed 2D irregular packing problems and related geometric problems. Leao ([Leao et al., 2020](#B81)) introduced the mathematical models in the 2D irregular packing problem.\nTABLE 1\n[![www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/966691/fmech-08-966691-HTML/image_m/fmech-08-966691-t001.jpg)](https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/966691/fmech-08-966691-HTML/image_m/fmech-08-966691-t001.jpg)\n**TABLE 1**.

The bidirectional best-fit heuristic is a deterministic approach which has previously been shown to outperform existing heuristic methods as well as many metaheuristics from the literature. Here, we propose a modification to the original bidirectional best-fit heuristic whereby combinations of pairs of rectangles are considered generating improved results over standard benchmark sets.\n\n### Highlights\n\n\u25ba A modified version of the bidirectional best-fit heuristic is presented. \u25ba The modified heuristic also considers placement of rectangles in pairs. \u25ba Modified BBF is tested on five different benchmark sets from the literature with varying properties. \u25ba The modified heuristic offers improved performance in over two-thirds of benchmark instances. \u25ba The performance of this deterministic method is comparable to state-of-the-art methods.\n\n## Introduction\n\nCutting and packing problems arise in many areas, particularly in manufacturing industries where a given stock material must be cut into a smaller set of shapes. The problem addressed in this paper is the NP-hard (Garey & Johnson, 1979) two dimensional orthogonal rectangular strip packing problem (SPP). In this problem a set of rectangular shapes must be arranged on a given sheet of fixed width and infinite height with the objective of minimising the highest point of any rectangle in the solution. Using the typology of W\u00e4scher, Hau\u00dfner, and Schumann (2007) the exact problem considered is a _two dimensional, open dimension_ problem. As all rectangular shapes may be rotated by 90\u00b0 and no guillotine cutting is required, this is referred to as the \u2018RF\u2019 (rotated, free cutting) subtype using the categorisation of Lodi, Martello, and Vigo (1999). More information on cutting and packing problems can be found in a number of survey papers (Dowsland and Dowsland, 1992, Dyckhoff, 1990, Lodi et al., 2002, W\u00e4scher et al., 2007).\n\nA\u015fik and \u00d6zcan (2009) introduced the bidirectional best-fit heuristic for solving such problems. The bidirectional best-fit heuristic (BBF) is an elegant approach which considers both orientations of each rectangle yet to be packed when deciding which rectangle to place. Here we consider an extension to the original bidirectional best-fit heuristic which considers not only placing single rectangles but also placing different combinations of pairs of rectangles. We show that considering rectangles in pairs yields improved results over the original bidirectional best-fit heuristic and a number of metaheuristics from the literature.\n\nSection 2 provides an overview of the two dimensional strip packing literature outlining previously used heuristic, metaheuristic and exact methods. Section 3 describes the original bidirectional best-fit heuristic in detail. Section 4 introduces a modified version of the bidirectional best-fit heuristic which considers compound shapes in the form of pairs of combined rectangles when searching for a shape to place. A number of new policies are described which are required in the modified heuristic. Section 5 defines the benchmarks which will be used and provides results and discussion of the application of the new method to these instances. Finally, Section 6 draws some conclusions based on our results.\n\n## Section snippets\n\n## Exact methods\n\nAlthough not the subject of our approach, there have been a large amount exact methods used to solve strip packing problems. Gilmore and Gomory (1961) developed a linear programming approach to solve very small strip packing problems to optimality. Christofides and Whitlock, 1977, Beasley, 1985 used methods based on tree-search to solve the guillotine and non-guillotine variants of the strip packing problems respectively. The approach of Christofides and Whitlock (1977) was improved by Hifi and\n\n## The bidirectional best-fit heuristic (BBF)\n\nA\u015fik and \u00d6zcan (2009) proposed the bidirectional best-fit heuristic (BBF) as an improvement to the best-fit (BF) heuristic of Burke et al. (2004). The core idea of BF is to first find the lowest available portion of the skyline a rectangle can be placed, the lowest _horizontal gap_, before searching for a rectangle that best fits that space. This idea is extended in BBF by also considering placement of rectangles into the _vertical niche_ formed between the left edge of the skyline and the expected\n\n## Modified bidirectional best-fit heuristic\n\nSo far the bidirectional best-fit heuristic has been used to place a simple set of rectangles onto a fixed with strip of a given stock material. Here we propose a modification of the BBF heuristic which also considers compound polygons consisting of combinations of two rectangles during the packing phase. A simple method to do this is to pair up two rectangles of equal length or height to form a larger rectangle. The drawback of this approach is that in the worst case where no any two\n\n## Experimentation and results\n\nA number of datasets from the literature are used to test the modified BBF and compare it to both the original BBF heuristic and other methods from the literature and are summarised in Table 3. J1 and J2 are two small instances taken from Jakobs (1996) with known optimum heights. Ramesh Babu and Ramesh Babu (1999) introduced a single problem instance. The instances provided by Hopper and Turton (2001) are grouped into seven categories each with three instances. Each set of three instances share\n\n## Conclusions\n\nThe bidirectional best-fit heuristic is a deterministic heuristic which has previously been shown to outperform existing packing heuristics in the literature when applied to the two dimensional orthogonal rectangular strip packing problem. We have presented a modified version of the bidirectional best-fit heuristic which also considers placement of rectangles in pairs. We have shown that modifying the heuristics behaviour in such a way leads to improved performance in over two-thirds of the\n\nRecommended articles\n\n- A.

Despite its relevance to industry, research publications are relatively low when compared to other cutting and packing problems. One explanation offered is the perceived difficulty and substantial time investment of developing a geometric tool box to assess computer generated solutions. In this paper we set out to provide a tutorial covering the core geometric methodologies currently employed by researchers in cutting and packing of irregular shapes. The paper is not designed to be an exhaustive survey of the literature but instead will draw on the literature to illustrate the theory and implementation of the approaches. We aim to provide a sufficiently instructive description to equip new and current researchers in the area to select the most appropriate methodology for their needs.\n## Introduction\nCutting and packing problems involving irregular shapes arise in a wide variety of industries including; garment manufacturing, sheet metal cutting, furniture making and shoe manufacturing. An example of a layout from the garment manufacturing industry is provided in Fig. 1. As a result the range of problem variants involving irregular shapes, referred to here as nesting problems, is a core area of research in the field of cutting and packing. The problem is NP-complete and as a result solution methodologies predominantly utilise heuristics. A further defining characteristic of nesting problems is the requirement to develop powerful geometric tools to handle the wide variety and complexity of shapes that need to be packed. In this paper we propose to provide detailed explanations of the most popular techniques for handling the geometry when solving nesting problems and provide guidance on their implementation, strengths and weaknesses.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized in six sections. In the next section the nesting problem is defined more precisely and the key differences between nesting problems and other cutting and packing problems are highlighted. In particular, the importance of the geometry is explained. In Section 3 geometric approaches based on pixel or raster representations are introduced. In Section 4 the concept of the*D*function is presented including algorithms to handle geometric tasks that use this function. In the following section, the nofit polygon is introduced and two different algorithms for its generation are described, one based on the sliding analogy and another using Minkowski sums. Polygon decomposition is also discussed in this section. In Section 6 the concept of Phi function is presented with illustrative examples.\n## Section snippets\n## Problem definition\nNesting problems are one of many terms used to identify the group of problems that will be discussed. A discussion of nomenclature is beyond the scope of this paper, however, it is helpful to identify the other names under which these problems are referenced. Some commonly used terms are irregular shape stock cutting, irregular packing, polygon placement, marker making, non-convex cutting stock, 2-D packing problems or some combination of any of these terms. The term*nesting problems*is adopted\n## Pixel/raster method\nRaster methods are approaches that divide the continuous stock sheet into discrete areas, hence reducing the geometric information to coding the data by a grid represented by a matrix. However, different authors have used different codification schemes, which are largely driven by the placement algorithm that will use this geometric information.\nOliveira and Ferreira (1993) propose the simplest coding scheme that uses the value of 1 to code the existence of piece and the value of 0 to denote the\n## Direct trigonometry and the*D*function\nGiven that the raster representation cannot accurately represent the irregular shape of the pieces, the alternative is to use the polygons directly. When representing the pieces as polygons the amount of information is proportional to the number of vertices and does not depend on the absolute size of the pieces or of the layout. However unlike the raster method, the feasibility or quality of a placement is not implied by the geometry and as a result another evaluation method must be employed.\n## The nofit polygon\nThe nofit polygon has become an increasingly popular option for dealing with the geometry since it is more efficient than direct trigonometry, particularly when using an iterative search, yet shares the benefit of accuracy by using the original edges of the polygon. In addition, the concept opens up new options for placement strategies. In essence the NFP is a polygon derived from aggregating the two component polygons. It can be used, along with the vector difference of the position of the two\n## Phi function\nThe phi-function is the most recent innovation in dealing with the geometric issues for nesting problems. Its purpose is to represent all mutual positions of two objects (in this context polygons), and therefore it is often associated with the NFP. However, this association is misleading as the NFP is only a special case of the broader theory. The Phi-function for cutting and packing were conceived and applied by Stoyan et al., 2001, Stoyan et al., 2004 and this research group continue to be\n## Conclusion\nThe paper has given a detailed description of the operations of a number of different approaches for dealing with the geometry required in the solution of nesting problems, these are; the raster method, direct trigonometry, the Nofit polygon and phi-functions. Each has its advantages and limitations and a common theme is that the more computationally efficient the approach the more complex it is to realise. There is no doubt that there is a sign...",

One particular category of these packing problems is\ntwo-dimensional packing, which is encountered in everyday scenarios like arranging items\non a shelf and in industrial applications such as cutting cookies from rolled-out dough\nor manufacturing sets of tiles from standard-sized panels made of wood, glass, or metal.\nAnother intriguing example involves cutting fabric pieces for clothing production. In this\ncase, the pieces often cannot be rotated freely, as they must adhere to a desired pattern\nin the final product, which is tailored of multiple elements. The widespread applicability\nof two-dimensional packing problems has led to a surge of interest in designing efficient\nalgorithms to address them. In this paper, we follow the line of research and study the\nproblem of packing convex polygons without rotations in various settings depending on the\ntype of containers used.\nPast research focusing on theoretical considerations of two-dimensional packings mainly\nconcentrates on the scenario when all objects are axis-parallel rectangles. In this paper, we\nwill discuss packing without rotations, in which only translations are permitted. There are\ntwo main classes of the problem depending on whether the size of the container is fixed and\nwe want to minimize the number of containers used or whether we want to minimize the\ncontainer\u2019s size with respect to some objective function.\nA seminal example of the first class is the Geometric Bin Packing problem in which\na number of unit size squared bins to pack is to be minimized. The problem is arguably\nthe most natural generalization of the regular (1D) Bin Packing to two dimensions, and\nits absolute approximability has been fully understood. Unless P = N P, the best possible\nefficient constant factor approximation is 2 [15], and such an algorithm is known [10].\nIn the second class, there are several variants to be considered. An example is the\nStrip Packing Problem which is concerned with packing objects into a strip of width\n1 and infinite height in such a way that the maximum of all the heights of the placed\nobjects is minimized. Like Geometric Bin Packing, Strip Packing generalizes (1D)\nBin Packing. The best known efficient constant factor approximation for Strip Packing\nhas approximation factor (5/3 + \u03f5) [9]. It is known that there can not exist a polynomial\ntime algorithm with an approximation ratio of (3/2 \u2212 \u03f5) for any \u03f5 > 0 unless P = N P, which\nfollows directly from the approximation hardness of (1D) Bin Packing. Both classes of\nproblems have been also considered in the asymptotic setting, see e.g. [11, 5, 12].\nIn younger time, there was also an increase of interest in cases where the objects in\nquestion are general convex polygons. Alt, de Berg and Knauer [2, 3] considered the problem\nof packing an instance consisting of a number of convex polygons of the form p \u2282 [0, 1]2into\na minimum area axis-parallel rectangular container. We refer to this problem as Polygon\nArea Minimization throughout this paper. In the special case where the instance consists\nof rectangles only, the problem is known to admit a PTAS [4]. They proved the existence of\nthe following efficient algorithm:\nA 23.78-approximation for Polygon Area Minimization.\nRecently, Aamand, Abrahamsen, Beretta and Kleist [1] showed that the algorithm of Alt,\nde Berg and Knauer can be leveraged to obtain also efficient approximation algorithms of\nfurther problems:\nA 7-approximation for Polygon Perimeter Minimization.\nA 51-approximation for Polygon Strip Packing.\nAn 11-approximation for Polygon Bin Packing for polygons with diameter at most 1\n10 .\nA. Kurpisz and S. Suter 3\n1.1 Our results\nThe results of Alt, de Berg and Knauer [2, 3] and Aamand et al. [1] are heavily based on\nso-called shelf packing algorithms. In shelf packing algorithms, the objects are first placed\non the shelves, possibly ordered by height, which are later stacked on one another to build\na final solution. Compared to axis-parallel rectangles, the main challenge in designing an\napproximation algorithm for polygon packing problems is that objects cannot be sorted by\nheight and orientation simultaneously. As a result, the algorithm and its analysis in [2, 3]\nhave such a large approximation guarantee. In this paper, we provide new insight into how\nshelf packing algorithms should be applied to polygon packing problems. We introduce a\nsequence of transformations of the objects that allow us first to sort them by height and later\nby orientation to build a solution of a much better approximation guarantee. More precisely,\nwe design polynomial-time algorithms with the following factors:\nA 9.45-approximation for Polygon Area Minimization.\nUsing this algorithm as a subroutine, we build upon the methods from Aamand et al. [1] to\nobtain the following efficient approximation algorithms:\nA (3.75 + \u03f5)-approximation for Polygon Perimeter Minimization.\nA 21.89-approximation for Polygon Strip Packing.\nA 5.09-approximation for Polygon Bin Packing for polygons which have their diameter\nbounded by 1\n10 .\nThe results are proved in Sections 4, 5, 6, and 7 respectively. Furthermore, in Section 8\nwe show the following results, which make progress towards solving an open question of a\nO(1)-approximation algorithm for Polygon Bin Packing for arbitrary polygons.\nThere is an efficient O(\n1\n\u03b4\n)-approximation algorithm for Polygon Bin Packing for\ninstances where each polygon has width or height at most 1 \u2212 \u03b4.\nThere is an efficient O(1)-approximation algorithm for Polygon Bin Packing for\ninstances with the property that all polygons share a spine (up to translation) with height\nat least 3\n4\n.\n2 Preliminaries\nWe start out considerations by recalling a classical and well-known problem in theoretical\ncomputer science, the Bin Packing problem: Given a list of numbers s1, . . . , sn \u2208 (0, 1] \u2229 Q,\nrepresenting the sizes of n objects, the goal is to find the minimum number of bins of size 1,\nso that we can pac...",

The aim in packing problems is to decide if a given set of pieces can be placed\ninside a given container. A packing problem is defined by the types of pieces and containers to be\nhandled, and the motions that are allowed to move the pieces. The pieces must be placed so that\nin the resulting placement, they are pairwise interior-disjoint. We establish a framework which\nenables us to show that for many combinations of allowed pieces, containers and motions, the\nresulting problem is \u2203R-complete. This means that the problem is equivalent (under polynomial\ntime reductions) to deciding whether a given system of polynomial equations and inequalities\nwith integer coefficients has a real solution.\nWe consider packing problems where only translations are allowed as the motions, and\nproblems where arbitrary rigid motions are allowed, i.e., both translations and rotations. When\nrotations are allowed, we show that it is an \u2203R-complete problem to decide if a set of convex\npolygons, each of which has at most 7 corners, can be packed into a square.\nRestricted to translations, we show that the following problems are \u2203R-complete: (i) pieces\nbounded by segments and hyperbolic curves to be packed in a square, and (ii) convex polygons\nto be packed in a container bounded by segments and hyperbolic curves.\nThe paper was presented at the 61st Annual IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS 2020) [6].

Introduction\nPacking problems are everywhere in our daily lives. To give a few examples, you solve packing\nproblems when finding room for your tupperware in the kitchen, the manufacturer of your\nclothing arranges cutting patterns on a large piece of fabric in order to minimize waste, and at\nChristmas time you are trying to cut out as many cookies from a dough as you can. In a large\nnumber of industries, it is crucial to solve complicated instances of packing problems efficiently.\nIn addition to clothing manufacturing, we mention leather, glass, wood and sheet metal cutting,\nselective laser sintering, shipping (packing goods in containers) and 3D printing (arranging the\nparts to be printed in the printing volume); see Figure 1.\nPacking problems can be easily and precisely defined in a mathematical manner, but many\nimportant questions are still completely elusive. In this work, we uncover a fundamental aspect\nof many versions of geometric packing by settling their computational difficulty.\nWe denote Pack[P \u2192 C,M] as the packing problem with pieces of the type P, containers\nof type C and motions of type M. In an instance of Pack[P \u2192 C,M], we are given pieces\n\ud835\udc5d1, . . . , \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5b of type P and a container \ud835\udc36 of type C. We want to decide if there is a motion of type M\nfor each piece such that after moving the pieces by these motions, each piece is in \ud835\udc36 and the\npieces are pairwise interior-disjoint. Such a placement of the pieces is called a valid placement.\nAs the allowed motions, we consider translations ( ) and rigid motions ( ), where a\nrigid motion is a combination of a translation and a rotation. As containers and pieces, we\nconsider squares (\u25a1), convex polygons ( ), simple polygons ( ) and curved polygons ( ), where\na curved polygon is a region enclosed by a simple closed curve consisting of a finite number\nof line segments and arcs contained in hyperbolae (such as the graph of \ud835\udc66 = 1/\ud835\udc65). Note that\nhyperbolae, like all conic sections, can be represented as rational quadratic Bezier curves \u00b4 [32],\nwhich are extensively used for computer-aided design and manufacturing. It would therefore\nnot be uncommon that curved pieces as the ones used here could appear in practical settings.\nThe problems with only translations allowed are relevant to some industries; for instance\nwhen arranging cutting patterns on a roll of fabric for clothing production, where the orientation\n3 / 78 Framework for \u2203R-Completeness of Two-Dimensional Packing Problems\nof each piece has to follow the orientation of the weaving or a pattern printed on the fabric. In\nother contexts such as leather, glass, or sheet metal cutting, there are usually no such restrictions,\nso rotations can be used to minimize waste. As can be seen from Figure 1, it is relevant to study\npacking problems where the pieces as well as the containers may be non-convex and have\nboundaries consisting of many types of curves (not just straight line segments).\nWe show that many of the above mentioned variants of packing are \u2203R-complete. The\ncomplexity class \u2203R will be defined below. We call the techniques we developed a framework,\nsince the same techniques turn out to be applicable to prove hardness for many versions of\npacking. With adjustments or additions, they can likely be used for other versions or proofs of\nother types of hardness as well.\nThe Existential Theory of the Reals\nThe term Existential Theory of the Reals refers ambiguously to a formal language, a correspond\u0002ing algorithmic problem (ETR) and a complexity class (\u2203R). Let us start with the formal logic.\nLet\n\u03a3 := {\u2200, \u2203, 0, 1, \ud835\udc651, . . . , \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b, +, \u00b7, =, \u2264, <, \u2227, \u2228, \u00ac}\nbe an alphabet for some \ud835\udc5b \u2265 1. A sentence over \u03a3 is a well-formed formula with no free variables,\ni.e., so that every variable is bound to a quantifier. The Existential Theory of the Reals is the set\nof true sentences of the form\n\u2203\ud835\udc651, . . . , \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b \u03a6(\ud835\udc651, . . . , \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b),\nwhere \u03a6 is a quantifier-free formula. The algorithmic problem ETR is to decide whether a\nsentence of this form is true or not. At last, this leads us to the complexity class Existential\nTheory of the Reals (\u2203R), which consists of all those languages that are many-one reducible to\nETR in polynomial time. Given a quantifier-free formula \u03a6, we define the solution space of \u03a6\nas \ud835\udc49 (\u03a6) := {x \u2208 R\n\ud835\udc5b\n: \u03a6(x)}. Thus in other words, ETR is to decide if \ud835\udc49 (\u03a6) is empty or not. It is\ncurrently known that\nNP \u2286 \u2203R \u2286 PSPACE. (1)\nTo show the first inclusion is an easy exercise, whereas the second is non-trivial and was first\nproven by Canny [17]. A problem \ud835\udc43 is \u2203R-hard if ETR is many-one reducible to \ud835\udc43 in polynomial\ntime, and \ud835\udc43 is \u2203R-complete if \ud835\udc43 is \u2203R-hard and in \u2203R. None of the inclusions (1) are known to be\nstrict, but the first is widely believed to be [15], implying that the \u2203R-hard problems are not in\nNP. As examples of \u2203R-complete problems, we mention problems related to realization of order\u0002types [52, 51, 58], graph drawing [16, 27, 40, 43], recognition of geometric graphs [19, 20, 38,\n45], straightening of curves [30], the art gallery problem [3], minimum convex covers [2], Nash\u0002equilibria [13, 34], linkages [1, 54, 55], matrix-decompositions [26, 56, 57], polytope theory [52],\n4 / 78 M.

We further\nrestrict ourselves to the oriented, orthogonal variation,\nwhere rectangles must be placed parallel to the hori\u0002zontal and vertical axes, and the rectangles cannot be\nrotated. Further, for our test cases, all dimensions are\nintegers. Like most packing problems, 2D rectangular\nstrip packing (even with these restrictions) is NP-hard.\nIn this paper, we focus on the case of problems\nwhere it is known that there are perfect packings.\nA perfect packing is one where the input rectangles fit\nexactly into a rectangle of the appropriate width with\nno empty space.

Indeed, one of the most extensive bench\u0002mark sets for rectangular strip packing is a collection\nof instances with known perfect packings constructed\nby Hopper [9,10]. It is therefore worthwhile to deter\u0002mine how well specialized techniques can perform on\nthese problems, in order to better gauge how difficult\nproblems in this class are. Furthermore, a valuable use\nof our algorithm is to quickly determine if a given\nset of rectangles can be perfectly packed before run\u0002ning more expensive or less accurate algorithms. As\nan example, the best reported results of heuristics on\nthe Hopper benchmarks (that we solve exactly below)\nare several percent from optimal [9]. Finally, our algo\u0002rithm naturally solves a more general problem: given\na set of rectangles and a target rectangle, find a pack\u0002ing of a subset of those rectangles which gives a per\u0002fect packing of the target. We have found in our re\u0002lated work on packing problems that such a routine\ncan be useful in divide-and-conquer-based approaches\nto solving large problems. We describe this function\u0002ality more completely in [14].\nWe present an exhaustive approach using branch\u0002and-bound techniques that outperforms previous meth\u0002ods. For example, our implementation solves bench\u0002mark problems containing 25 rectangles in under two\nminutes, on average.\n1.1. Further background\nPacking problems in general are important in man\u0002ufacturing settings; for example, one might need n\nspecific rectangular pieces of glass to put together a\ncertain piece of furniture, and the goal is to cut those\npieces from the minimum height fixed-width piece of\nglass. The more general version of the problem al\u0002lows for irregular shapes, which is required for certain\nmanufacturing problems such as clothing production.\nHowever, the rectangular case has many industrial ap\u0002plications [9].\nThe 2D rectangular strip packing problem has\nbeen the subject of a great deal of research, both\nby the theory community and the operations-research\ncommunity [6,7,15]. One focus has been on heuristics\nthat lead to good solutions in practice. One line in this\narea considers simple heuristics for greedily placing\nan ordered list of rectangles, the most widely used\nand well-studied of which is the Bottom-Left heuristic.\nBecause the Bottom-Left heuristic is a foundation for\nour work, we describe it in some detail.\nThe Bottom-Left (BL) heuristic was introduced\nin [1]. To explain it, we may think of the strip being\npacked as lying in the first quadrant of the plane, with\nthe left bottom corner at (0, 0) and the right bottom\ncorner at (W, 0). Let us say a point is covered if it\nlies in the interior, left boundary, or bottom boundary\nof a rectangle that has been placed. A point (x, y) is\nfree if y \u0001 0, 0 \u0002 x<W, and it is not covered. The\nBL heuristic uses the reverse lexicographic ordering\non the space of points; that is, point A lies before point\nB if A is below B, or if A and B have the same height\nand A is to the left of B. Given a permutation of the\nrectangles, the Bottom-Left heuristic places the rec\u0002tangles one by one, with the lower left corner of each\nbeing placed at the first free point in the lexicographic\nordering where it will fit within the given strip and\ndoes not overlap with a previously placed rectangle.\nThere are natural worst-case O(n3) algorithms for the\nproblem; Chazelle devised an algorithm that requires\nO(n2) time and O(n) space in the worst case [5]. In\npractice the algorithm runs much more quickly, since a\nrectangle can usually be placed in one of the first open\nspots available. When all rectangle dimensions are in\u0002tegers, this can also be efficiently exploited. Hopper\ndiscusses efficient implementations of this heuristic in\nher thesis work [9].\nPerhaps the most natural permutation to choose for\nthe Bottom-Left heuristic is to order the rectangles\nby decreasing height. This ensures that at the end of\nthe process rectangles of small height, which therefore\naffect the upper boundary less, are being placed. It\nhas long been known that this heuristic performs very\nwell in practice [6]. It is also natural to try sorting\nby decreasing width, area, and perimeter, and take the\nbest of the four solutions; while usually decreasing\nheight is best, in some instances these other heuristics\nperform better.\nAnother line of research on heuristics focuses on\nlocal search methods that take substantially more time\nbut have the potential for better solutions: genetic al\u0002gorithms, taboo search, hill-climbing, and simulated\nannealing. The recent thesis of Hopper provides sub\u0002stantial detail of the work in this area [9,10], as does\nthe recent paper [11].\nAnother focus has been on approximation algo\u0002rithms. The Bottom-Left heuristic has been shown to\nN. Lesh et al. / Information Processing Letters 90 (2004) 7\u201314 9\nFig. 1.
