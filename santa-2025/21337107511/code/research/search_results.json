      "text": "Teknik no-fit polygon (NFP) adalah metode geometris yang digunakan dalam masalah penataan 2D, khususnya untuk mengidentifikasi area di mana satu polygon dapat ditempatkan relatif terhadap polygon lain tanpa terjadi tumpang tindih. NFP merepresentasikan semua posisi yang memungkinkan dari satu objek terhadap objek lain, sehingga memudahkan proses verifikasi tumpang tindih dan pengaturan posisi dalam proses penataan bahan atau objek secara efisien ([ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/), [ePrints Southampton](https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/56836), [MDPI](https://www.mdpi.com/2227-7390/10/16/2941)). \n\nProses pembuatan NFP biasanya melibatkan konsep Minkowski sum, di mana polygon satu digabungkan dengan refleksi dari polygon lainnya, menghasilkan sebuah bentuk yang mewakili semua posisi yang memungkinkan tanpa tumpang tindih ([ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/), [ePrints Southampton](https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/56836)). Pendekatan ini dapat disesuaikan untuk menangani berbagai kasus kompleks, termasuk polygon tidak beraturan, polygon dengan lubang, dan polygon yang saling mengunci, sehingga meningkatkan efisiensi dan keandalan dalam algoritma penataan otomatis ([Graham Kendall](https://www.graham-kendall.com/papers/bhkw2007.pdf), [MDPI](https://www.mdpi.com/2227-7390/10/16/2941)). \n\nSecara umum, NFP sangat penting dalam aplikasi industri seperti pemotongan bahan, pengemasan, dan robotika, karena memungkinkan perhitungan posisi yang cepat dan akurat, serta mengurangi kompleksitas komputasi dalam proses penataan objek yang tidak beraturan ([RePEc](https://ideas.repec.org/a/inm/oropre/v58y2010i4-part-1p948-970.html)).",

The improved algorithm can cope with complex cases and is given an implementation in detail. The proposed concept of a touching group can simplify the judging process when recognizing the potential translation vector for an orbital polygon. In addition, the generation of the no-fit polygon only involves three main steps based on the proposed concept. The proposed algorithm has a mechanism that searches other start positions to generate a complete no-fit polygon for handling complex cases. To improve the efficiency, many acceleration strategies have been proposed, such as point exclusion strategy and point inclusion test. The robust and efficient performance of the algorithm is tested by well-known benchmark instances and degenerate and complex cases, such as holes, interlocking concavities and jigsaw-type pieces. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can produce complete no-fit polygons for complex cases, and acceleration strategies can reduce the creation time of no-fit polygon on benchmark instances by more than sixteen percent on average.\nKeywords:\n[no-fit polygon](https://www.mdpi.com/search?q=no-fit+polygon);[irregular packing problem](https://www.mdpi.com/search?q=irregular+packing+problem);[sliding algorithm](https://www.mdpi.com/search?q=sliding+algorithm);[cutting](https://www.mdpi.com/search?q=cutting);[configuration space obstacle](https://www.mdpi.com/search?q=configuration+space+obstacle)\nMSC:\n90; 68; 51\n## 1. Introduction\nIn the field of cutting and packing problems, there is a kind of problem known as the two-dimensional (2D) irregular packing problem or the nesting problem. It is commonly encountered in many industries and applications, such as metal sheet cutting [1,2], leather [3], clothing [4], paper [5] and spatial arrangement [6]. Through excellent algorithms to optimize the packing, even a one percent increase in the material utilization rate will save lots of resource costs for enterprises and generate huge economic benefits for the whole society. Despite the many practical applications and benefits, the problem has received relatively little attention in the literature when compared to the regular packing problem [7,8,9]. One of the main reasons is that researchers have to deal with the geometry problem, which is the first obstacle they encounter. This means that satisfying the constraint of having all irregular pieces without overlapping is much harder than regular pieces.\nDirect trigonometry involving line intersection and point inclusion testing is the classic method to identify the positional relationship between two polygons. However, the optimization algorithms will become inefficient when it adopts this method, which results in the slightly poor performance of the algorithms. The alternative used in irregular packing problems is the no-fit polygon (NFP), which is also used in the field of engineering and robot motion planning and the aircraft parking stand allocation problem [10]. The no-fit polygon facilitates the research of irregular packing problems [11,12,13,14]. It is an increasingly popular option since it is more efficient than direct trigonometry, particularly when using an iterative search. Determining whether polygons overlap, touch, or are separated only needs to conduct a simple test to identify whether the reference point is inside the NFP. Essentially, the no-fit polygon describes the region in which two polygons intersect. The computational efficiency gained by utilizing this method is very attractive. Hence, it is important to develop an algorithm for creating NFP for the research of irregular packing problems. The algorithm can enrich the application in 2D geometrical computer software.\nHowever, there are few published works on algorithms for generating NFP. Note the fact that developing a robust geometry library is still needed, and this task is very time-consuming and difficult. Furthermore, it is difficult to develop a robust NFP generator because of the complexity of irregular piece shapes. Thus, we propose an improved sliding algorithm for the generation of NFP and give an implementation in detail of our algorithm. Such an algorithm can become good preparation for applying more strategies to solve the irregular packing problem. For instance, in the work published by Costa et al. [15], if the NFP algorithm is efficient, it can directly calculate the new merged piece instead of approximating by one already computed because of this time-consuming operation. In other words, the more efficient the algorithm is, the better.\nThe proposed algorithm only involves two simple geometric stages. The first is generating the external NFP between two polygons, which includes three main steps: finding the touching group, determining the translation vector from all touching groups and computing the translation distance. The second stage is searching on the unvisited edges to determine whether there is a feasible starting point that can be found. If the starting point is available, then return to the first stage to generate the NFP.\nThe contributions of this study are:\n* To address the problem of the efficient and robust creation of the no-fit polygon;\n* To propose an improved sliding algorithm and provide a detailed implementation;\n* To present the concept of touching group, resulting in the number of cases to consider being reduced by half when determining the feasible translation vector;\n* To develop many acceleration strategies to improve the algorithm\u2019s efficiency, such as the point exclusion strategy, the right side test, and the point inclusion test;\n* To assess the performance of the proposed alg...",

Introduction\nThe irregular two-dimensional variant of the cutting and packing problem impacts upon several important\nmanufacturing industries such as textiles, plastics, metal cutting and others. These problems usually consist of\na number of irregular pieces that are to be placed onto one or more sheets of material in the most efficient\nlayout possible, so that all pieces are assigned and do not overlap. Additionally, there are usually rotational\nconstraints enforced on the pieces due to the physical properties of the problem such as grain on the material,\npatterns on textiles and the cutting technology being employed. Sometimes rotational constraints may be used\nfor non-physical reasons such as to restrict pieces to a finite set of rotations thus simplifying layout construc\u0002tion procedures and allowing for faster solutions to be obtained.

Whitwell).\nEuropean Journal of Operational Research 179 (2007) 27\u201349\nwww.elsevier.com/locate/ejor\nhas been shown to be NP hard and is therefore intrinsically difficult to solve (Garey and Johnson, 1979). There\nhave been many different strategies for producing solutions to the irregular stock cutting problem. These\ninclude linear programming approaches, heuristic placement methods, metaheuristic guided search techniques\nand other novel approaches such as the iterative jostling of pieces (Dowsland et al., 1998). Survey papers can\nbe found in (Dowsland and Dowsland, 1992; Sweeney and Paternoster, 1992; Dyckhoff, 1990). However, the\nfeature that connects all of the approaches is that they are all required to cope with the geometry of the prob\u0002lem. This can be especially complicated when highly irregular shapes are used which may include holes or con\u0002cavities. The implementation of robust and efficient geometry routines can be laborious and can often take\nconsiderably longer than the packing strategies themselves. In particular, the geometry must handle all of\nthe interactions between shapes such as detecting whether two shapes are overlapping and calculating the\ntranslation distance required in a given direction so that the overlap is resolved. As we show in the following\nsection, although these tests can be implemented using trigonometric techniques, the no-fit polygon represents\na considerably more efficient solution.\nWhilst the generation of the no-fit polygon is academically challenging, it is a \u2018tool\u2019 and not a \u2018solution\u2019 and\nthis is perhaps one of the reasons why there are many publications in the literature which state that the no-fit\npolygon is used but which provide relatively little or no details on its implementation. In this paper we con\u0002centrate specifically on the no-fit polygon and provide an overview of the previous techniques that have been\nused for its creation. Furthermore, we describe and provide full implementation details for a new robust orbi\u0002tal approach that can cope with the traditional problem cases that many other approaches cannot handle.\nHopefully this will help in the further dissemination of the benefits of using the no-fit polygon (as opposed\nto traditional trigonometry based approaches) within both the industrial and the academic communities.\n2. The no-fit polygon \u2013 an overview\nIn this section we describe the functionality of the no-fit polygon and we compare it to the more traditional\ntrigonometric based overlap and intersection tests. We also give brief overviews of the many techniques that\nhave been used to generate no-fit polygons within the previous literature.\n2.1. The no-fit polygon\nThe first application of no-fit polygon techniques within the field of cutting and packing was presented by\nArt (1966), although the term \u2018\u2018shape envelop\u2019\u2019 was used. It was ten years later that the term \u2018\u2018no-fit polygon\u2019\u2019\nwas introduced by Adamowicz and Albano who approached the irregular stock cutting problem by using no\u0002fit polygons to pack shapes together using their minimum enclosing rectangles (Adamowicz and Albano,\n1976). The term \u2018\u2018configuration space obstacle\u2019\u2019 is often used to denote the NFP within the field of engineering\nand robot motion planning but the term has also been used with respect to cutting and packing in (Cuningh\u0002ame-Green, 1989). The \u2018\u2018hodograph\u2019\u2019 is often used to describe the no-fit polygon within the mathematics com\u0002munity (Stoyan and Ponomarenko, 1977; Scheithauer and Terno, 1993; Bennell et al., 2001). The main\nfunction of the no-fit polygon is to describe the region in which two polygons intersect. The following example\ngives an overview of the NFP construct.\nGiven two polygons, A and B, the no-fit polygon can be found by tracing one shape around the boundary\nof another. One of the polygons remains fixed in position and the other traverses around the fixed polygon\u2019s\nedges whilst ensuring that the polygons always touch but never intersect. Throughout this paper we adopt the\nconvention of the first polygon being fixed and the second being the traversing/orbiting polygon. Therefore,\nwhen polygon B traces around the fixed polygon A, the resulting no-fit polygon is denoted by NFPAB. In order\nto create the NFPAB object we must choose a reference point from B which will be traced as B moves around\nA. In our implementations we use the first vertex, within the shape vertex list, as the reference point (see\nFig. 1). The reference point can be any arbitrary point providing it follows the movements of the orbiting poly\u0002gon. It is also important to maintain the relative position of the reference point with respect to polygon B as\nthis is required when using the NFP to test for overlap.\nIn order to test whether polygon B overlaps polygon A we use NFPAB and B\u2019s reference point. If polygon B\nis positioned so that its reference point is inside the polygon NFPAB then it overlaps with polygon A. If the\n28 E.K. Burke et al. / European Journal of Operational Research 179 (2007) 27\u201349\nreference point is on the boundary of NFPAB then polygon B touches polygon A. Finally, if the reference point\nis outside of NFPAB then polygons A and B do not overlap or touch (see Fig. 2). The no-fit polygon is used\nwithin the following papers from the literature (Grinde and Cavalier, 1995; Ramkumar, 1996; Cheng and Rao,...",

The detection of intersections is a critical operation within the irregular two-dimensional stock-cutting problem (also known as \u201cnesting\u201d), which aims to place shapes onto sheets of material so that the material is utilised as efficiently as possible and the waste (or trim loss) is reduced. The problem forms an important process within many real-world manufacturing industries such as metalworking, automotive production, aerospace, clothing and conservatory manufacture, and others. If manufacturers can reduce their costs by utilising raw materials more effectively, this can directly translate into increased profit margins or greater competitiveness within the marketplace. Moreover, there are significant environmental benefits to be gained. Several methods have been proposed to calculate no-fit polygons, but most, if not all, can only operate on geometry that consists of line segments. This paper extends the orbital sliding method of calculating no-fit polygons to enable it to handle arcs and then shows the resultant no-fit polygons being utilised successfully on the two-dimensional irregular packing problem. As far as the authors are aware, this is the first time that a no-fit polygon algorithm has been able to handle arcs robustly without decomposing to their line approximations. The modification of the authors' previously published packing algorithm to utilise the proposed no-fit polygon approach yields solutions of excellent quality (including several best-known) on well-established literature benchmark problems after only a few minutes.

Previously, the no-fit polygon (NFP) has not been widely applied because of the perception that it is difficult to implement and because of the lack of generic approaches that can cope with all problem cases without specific case-by-case handling. This paper introduces a robust orbital method for the creation of no-fit polygons which does not suffer from the typical problem cases found in the other approaches from the literature. Furthermore, the algorithm only involves two simple geometric stages so it is easily understood and implemented. We demonstrate how the approach handles known degenerate cases such as holes, interlocking concavities and jigsaw type pieces and we give generation times for 32 irregular packing benchmark problems from the literature, including real world datasets, to allow further comparison with existing and future approaches.\n## Introduction\nThe irregular two-dimensional variant of the cutting and packing problem impacts upon several important manufacturing industries such as textiles, plastics, metal cutting and others. These problems usually consist of a number of irregular pieces that are to be placed onto one or more sheets of material in the most efficient layout possible, so that all pieces are assigned and do not overlap. Additionally, there are usually rotational constraints enforced on the pieces due to the physical properties of the problem such as grain on the material, patterns on textiles and the cutting technology being employed. Sometimes rotational constraints may be used for non-physical reasons such as to restrict pieces to a finite set of rotations thus simplifying layout construction procedures and allowing for faster solutions to be obtained. The two-dimensional stock cutting problem has been shown to be NP hard and is therefore intrinsically difficult to solve (Garey and Johnson, 1979). There have been many different strategies for producing solutions to the irregular stock cutting problem. These include linear programming approaches, heuristic placement methods, metaheuristic guided search techniques and other novel approaches such as the iterative jostling of pieces (Dowsland et al., 1998). Survey papers can be found in (Dowsland and Dowsland, 1992, Sweeney and Paternoster, 1992, Dyckhoff, 1990). However, the feature that connects all of the approaches is that they are all required to cope with the geometry of the problem. This can be especially complicated when highly irregular shapes are used which may include holes or concavities. The implementation of robust and efficient geometry routines can be laborious and can often take considerably longer than the packing strategies themselves. In particular, the geometry must handle all of the interactions between shapes such as detecting whether two shapes are overlapping and calculating the translation distance required in a given direction so that the overlap is resolved. As we show in the following section, although these tests can be implemented using trigonometric techniques, the no-fit polygon represents a considerably more efficient solution.\nWhilst the generation of the no-fit polygon is academically challenging, it is a \u2018tool\u2019 and not a \u2018solution\u2019 and this is perhaps one of the reasons why there are many publications in the literature which state that the no-fit polygon is used but which provide relatively little or no details on its implementation. In this paper we concentrate specifically on the no-fit polygon and provide an overview of the previous techniques that have been used for its creation. Furthermore, we describe and provide full implementation details for a new robust orbital approach that can cope with the traditional problem cases that many other approaches cannot handle. Hopefully this will help in the further dissemination of the benefits of using the no-fit polygon (as opposed to traditional trigonometry based approaches) within both the industrial and the academic communities.\n## Section snippets\n## The no-fit polygon \u2013an overview\nIn this section we describe the functionality of the no-fit polygon and we compare it to the more traditional trigonometric based overlap and intersection tests. We also give brief overviews of the many techniques that have been used to generate no-fit polygons within the previous literature.\n## The new no-fit polygon construction algorithm\nWe now describe our new approach for robust no-fit polygon generation through the use of orbital methods utilising standard trigonometrical techniques. For the intersection calculations within our presented implementation, it is important to use a robust geometry library. It is also beneficial to implement routines that are as fast and as close to optimal as possible in order to promote fast no-fit polygon generation and packing algorithms. We have implemented such a library.

The paper\npresents a new algorithmic procedure for deriving this tool.\nSubmitted: June 2005\nSubject classification: cutting stock, geometric, algorithm\nArea of review: Optimisation\n2\nAbstract\nThe nofit polygon is a powerful and effective tool for handling the geometric\nrequirements of solution approaches to irregular cutting and packing problems. Although\nthe concept was first described in 1966, it was not until the early 90s that the general\ntrend of research moved away from direct trigonometry to favour the nofit polygon. Since\nthen, the ability to calculate the nofit polygon has practically become a pre-requisite for\nresearching irregular packing problems. However, realisation of this concept in the form\nof a robust algorithm is a highly challenging task with few instructive approaches\npublished. In this paper, a procedure using the mathematical concept of Minkowski sums\nfor the calculation of the nofit polygon is presented. The described procedure is more\nrobust than other approaches using Minkowski Sum knowledge and includes details of\nthe removal of internal edges to find holes, slits and lock and key positions. The\nprocedure is tested on benchmark data sets and gives examples of complicated cases. In\naddition the paper includes a description of how the procedure is modified in order to\nrealise the inner-fit polygon.\n3\n1. INTRODUCTION\nThe paper specifically addresses the geometric calculations required for tackling\ncutting and packing problems involving irregular shapes. Such problems are common in\nmanufacturing processes and occur whenever a piece of irregular shape is to be cut from\na sheet of stock material. Examples include dye-cutting in the engineering sector, parts\nnesting for shipbuilding, marker layout in the garment industry, and leather cutting for\nshoes, furniture and other goods. Here we consider that shapes are irregular if they are;\npolygonal, i.e no arcs; simple, i.e. do not self-cross; and non-rectangular. Even when all\nthe components are rectangular the problem of finding layouts that minimize waste is\nknown to be NP-hard. Where irregular components are involved an extra dimension of\ncomplexity is generated by the geometry.\nThe precise requirements of a good layout will differ from industry to industry and\nthis has lead to a variety of algorithmic approaches. In spite of their differences, all the\nmethods have a common requirement in which they need to be able to identify whether a\nlayout is feasible or not, i.e. do any of the pieces overlap. Early research handled this\nproblem in a number of ways. Adamowicz and Albano (1976) chose to nest pieces into\nsimpler shapes where the geometry can be more easily calculated. If the shapes are used\ndirectly then the intersection of pieces can be handled by direct trigonometric approaches\nsuch as the D function (Mehadavan, 1984; Konopasek, 1981). Alternatively the stock\nsheet and the pieces can be approximated as grid squares, often referred to as the raster\nmethod. Hence, if a piece occupies, fully or partially, a grid square it is coded as occupied\n(Oliveira and Ferreira, 1993; Babu and Babu, 2001).\n4\nAlthough all these approaches have merit, it is widely recognized that the nofit\npolygon (NFP) is more efficient, provided you have a robust and efficient NFP generator,\nand has become the principle approach for handling the geometry in nesting problems.\nUnfortunately, some researchers believe that despite the value of this tool, its introduction\nmay have stifled research into this variant of packing problems. W\u00e4scher, Hau\u00dfner and\nSchumann (2005) reports that there have been only 21 publications in irregular problems\nin the last 10 years. Researchers attribute this to the fact that the realization of the NFP as\na robust algorithm is, in itself, a highly challenging task. Those considering embarking on\nresearch into irregular shaped packing may be discouraged by the significant investment\nof time required in first developing an NFP generator. Hence, it is essential that robust\nand easily realizable algorithms are available in order to facilitate new interest into this\nimportant problem.\nThe primary purpose of this paper is to introduce a new procedure for calculating the\nNFP. The method is developed from the theory of Minkowski sums and builds on the\nprinciples proposed by Ghosh (1993) and by Bennell, Dowsland and Dowsland (2001).\nFurther, the paper includes an algorithmic procedure for eliciting the true boundary of the\nNFP, including holes, slits and exact fits. The next section outlines the most commonly\ncited approaches for calculating the NFP and points out their positive features and\ndisadvantages. Section 3 reviews in more detail the Minkowski sum approach. This is\nfollowed by a description of our new procedure based on Minkowski sums. Section 5,\ndevelops our approach for removing redundant internal points and therefore identifying\nthe true boundary. In both cases the full algorithmic steps are provided. Section 6 outlines\n5\nthe modification required in order to determine the inner-fit polygon. Finally, we develop\nsome theoretical and empirical analysis of the approach to demonstrate its robustness.\n2. DOCUMENTED APPROACHES FOR GENERATING THE NOFIT\nPOLYGON\nThe nofit polygon (NFP) is a combination of the properties of two component\npolygons that, as a result, represents all the relative positions of the two polygons in\nwhich they either touch or overlap. It is well documented that the NFP can reduce the\ncomplexity of detecting overlap between two pieces from O(nm+n+m), where n and m\nare the number of edges in each polygon, obtained from direct trigonometry, to a simple\npoint inclusion test of O(k), where k is the number of edges in the NFP. Full explanations\nof the concept can be found in (Mehadevan, 1984; Ghosh, 1991; Bennell, 1998; Bennell\nDowsland and Dowsland, 2001), where the most intuitive description is found in\nCunningham-Green (1989), who describes the motion of one polygon sliding around the\nboundary of the other; often referred to as the orbiting method. Figure 1a and 1b\nillustrates the motion of polygon B, the orbiting polygon, sliding around A, the fixed\npolygon, tracing the locus of a reference point on B. He also notes that when both\npolygons are convex, the NFP is an exact replication of the edges of both polygons, with\nopposite orientation, sorted into their slope order. Figure 1c shows the edges of both\npolygons, where A has counterclockwise orientation and B has clockwise orientation,\nsorted into slope order; these can be directly mapped onto the NFP in figure 1b. Note that\nthis role and orientation of polygons A and B will be adopted for the remainder of the\npaper. Cunningham-Green\u2019s (1989) observations underpin two of the most common\n6\napproaches to generating the NFP; the orbiting method that simulates the sliding motion,\nand Minkowski sums that sort the edges according to the the slope order and edge\nprecedence, i.e the sequential order of edges around the polygons. A further approach\ncommonly employed is that of decomposition. A brief description of each is provided\nhere.\nFigure 1: The locus of the reference point on B traces the NFP as it slides around A.\nThis is equivalent to connecting the edges in slope order.\nMinkowski sum\nClearly, when both component polygons are convex the NFP is very simple to\ncalculate by sorting the edges into slope order. Further, when one of the polygons is\n(b)\n(c)\n(a)\nB\nNFPAB\nA\n= Reference point on B\n7\nconvex and the other is an arbit...",

Compared with existing algorithms, the proposed NFP algorithm has lower time-complexity and higher robustness due to the introduction of trace lines. The proposed lowest-gravity-center policy places a piece to the position which has the lowest gravity center based on NFP. Compared with the bottom-left piece placement policy, the proposed lowest-gravity-center policy results in a relatively flat boundary for the pieces. The proposed nesting algorithm can deal with pieces with arbitrary rotation and holes. It achieved competitive layout solutions both in nesting pattern height and area-utilization ratio.\n\n## References\n\n\\[1\\]\n\nE. Hopper and B. C. H. Turton.

      "text": "Robust NFP generation for Nesting problems\u2217\nPedro Rocha \u2020\nINESCTEC - Instituto de Engenharia de Sistemas e Computadores Tecnologia e\nCi\u02c6encia, ISEP - Instituto Superior de Engenharia do Porto, Porto, Portugal\nMarch 28, 2019\nAbstract\nCutting and packing problems arise in a large variety of industrial applications, where there is a\nneed to cut pieces from a large object, or placing them inside a containers, without overlap. When\nthe pieces or the containers have irregular outline, the problem is classified as a Nesting problem. The\ngeometrical challenges of the Nesting problem are addressed by focusing on the geometric aspect of the\n2D pieces and containers involved. The challenges of the geometrical component are mainly derived\nfrom the complexity of the pieces, due to high number of vertices, which is common when dealing with\nreal world scenarios. This complexity is challenging for current algorithms to process efficiently and\neffectively, leading to high computational cost and less satisfactory results, particularly when dealing\nwith overlap verification operations. Usually, when tackling Nesting problems, the overlap verification\nprocess between two objects is done through the use of a structure known as No-Fit-Polygon (NFP).\nIn this work, the generation of the NFP is achieved through a simple algorithm which produces\na simplified shape while reducing numerical precision errors and fully representing the region that\nforms the NFP including positions with perfect fits.\n1 Introduction\nMany problems that arise in several real world scenarios require the placement of pieces inside a container\n(or cutting pieces from a large object) without overlap and while aiming to minimize wasted space by\nachieving a compact configuration. If one of these problems deals with irregular pieces or containers\nit is classified as Nesting problem, which is also known as an Irregular Piece Packing problem. This\nproblem requires an adequate geometric representation of its objects with great accuracy, which usually\ngenerates a significant amount of geometric information (vertices, pixels, etc), creating difficulties for\ncurrent algorithms. One of the main challenges in the geometrical component of the Nesting problem is\nensuring the non-overlap and correct containment of the pieces, while maintaining an acceptable level of\ncomputational efficiency.\nThe overlap verification in Nesting problems is usually achieved by using a geometrical structure\nknown as No-Fit-Polygon (NFP). This structure is a set of feasible placement locations of one polygon\nrelative to another, that allows specifying the regions and placement locations where pieces do not overlap.\nIn this paper, an algorithm is presented that generates the NFP with a reduced number of geometrical\ncomponents that define it, while using a simplified process that deals with numerical precision problems.\nThis improves the quality of the NFP while also reducing the overhead cost of overlap verification.\nThis paper is organized in several sections, being this one the introduction. The remainder of this\nsection contains the motivation for this work and main contributions. The following section, the second,\npresent a literature review, making reference to some approaches used generate the NFP focusing on\nNesting requirements. The third section contains a description of our approach, while the fourth presents\nalternative applications for the proposed algorithm followed by fifth section with the conclusions and\nfuture work.\n\u2217This research was partially supported by Project TEC4Growth - RL iMAN - Intelligence for Advanced Manufacturing\nSystems (NORTE-01-0145-FEDER-000020)\n\u2020Electronic address: pedro.f.rocha@inesctec.pt; pfr@isep.ipp.pt\n1\narXiv:1903.11139v1 [cs.CG] 26 Mar 2019\n1.1 Motivation\nThe proposed approach addresses the challenges of NFP generation, dealing with numerical precision\nproblems and generating a NFP with a reduced amount of geometric components while maintaining its\nrepresentation quality. Since the NFP is extensively used in approaches addressing Nesting problems,\nimproving it leads to computational efficiency gains and possible improvements in solution quality in\ncases where a complete NFP representation was not previously used.\nImproving the efficiency of the geometrical component leads to more resources being devoted to\naddressing the combinatorial component of the Nesting problem, which can enable the use of new ap\u0002proaches, and reaching higher quality solutions.\nThe improvement of current geometric overlap verification methods has a relevant impact on many\nscientific fields where similar problems arise, considering both economic and environmental aspects.\n1.2 Contribution\nIn many real world scenarios, such as industrial applications that deal with leather, furniture, metallurgy,\nshipbuilding, sheet metal cutting, plastics, and others, arise problems that require placing a set of pieces\ninto a container, in the most efficient non-overlapping configuration that minimizes wasted space. These\nproblems require dealing with geometrical aspects derived from the structure of the pieces and their\nrelative position inside the container, which must dealt with effectiveness and efficiently, while managing\nthe trade off between solution quality and computational cost.\nThis work has a relevant impact in several industries and scientific fields, at various levels, wher\u0002ever similar problems arise, producing benefits of economic (such as cost reduction) and environmental\n(less waste, energy and raw material consumption) importance. It provides an algorithm that is simple\nto implement, and generates overlap verification structures based on No-Fit-Polygons that are very ro\u0002bust. This has a significant impact by improving current approaches and opening new research paths in\npreviously underdeveloped areas such as 3D irregular packing.\n2 Literature Review\nThe placement of irregular items in the most efficient placement positions inside a container is heavily\ndependent on the geometrical structures that are used. The items cannot overlap and must completely\nfit inside the container. In the literature one can find approaches that are based on distinct geometric\nrepresentations such as grids, circles, direct trigonometry, phi-functions and No-Fit-Polygons (NFP). In\n[Bennell and Oliveira, 2008] can be found an introduction to these different representations focusing\nspecifically on Nesting problems.\nThe NFP has been a commonly used approach due to its increased efficiency compared to direct\ntrigonometry, having the benefit of being built directly from the edges of the polygons that represent the\nreal objects ([Bennell and Oliveira, 2008]).\n2.1 The No-Fit-Polygon\nThe NFP is a collection of all feasible placement locations of a polygon relative to another. It transforms\nthe overlap verification process between two polygons into the overlap verification between a polygon\nand a vertex, which is more computationally efficient. Another benefit is that the NFP can be generated\nat a pre-processing phase, but only for a reduced set of possible piece orientations. In situations where\ncontinuous rotations are advantageous, this approach is not adequate due to its significant computational\ncost generating the NFP for every new orientation of the pieces. One drawback of this approach is also the\ndifficulty in developing a robust approach to generating the NFP from pairs of generic irregular shapes,\ndue to emergence of degenerate cases. When the NFP is generated between a piece and the container, or\nhole, it is known as the Inner-Fit-Polygon (IFP). An example of a NFP and IFP generated by a sliding\nalgorithm can be seen in Fig. 1 and an example of its degenerate cases can be seen in Fig. 2.\n2.2 No-Fit-Polygon Generation\nIn the literature, there are three main approaches dedicated to generate the NFP. They are based on\na Sliding Algorithm, Slope Diagrams or Minkowsky Sum and Polygonal Decomposition. There is also\nanother approach that specifies ...",
