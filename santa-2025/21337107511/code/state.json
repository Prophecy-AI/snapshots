The goal is to pack Christmas tree shapes (15-vertex polygons) into the smallest square bounding box for N=1 to 200 trees.\n\n**Scoring Formula:** score = \u03a3(side_n\u00b2/n) for n=1 to 200\n- Lower is better\n- N=1 contributes ~0.66 to score (HIGHEST per-tree impact!)\n- Small N values (1-20) are critical - they contribute disproportionately to the total score\n\n**Target Score:** Beat 68.888293\n\n## \u26d4 ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN (EXPERIMENT WILL BE REJECTED)\n\nThe following are PERMANENTLY FORBIDDEN after baseline:\n- bbox3 - FORBIDDEN\n- sa_fast_v2 - FORBIDDEN  \n- eazy_optimizer - FORBIDDEN\n- tree_packer - FORBIDDEN\n- shake_public - FORBIDDEN\n- subprocess.run() - FORBIDDEN\n- os.system() - FORBIDDEN\n- ANY pre-compiled binary or executable - FORBIDDEN\n- \"Optimizing\" existing CSV files with any tool - FORBIDDEN\n- Running \"more iterations\" on any optimizer - FORBIDDEN\n\nIf your experiment runs ANY binary, it will produce ~70.6.\nThe target is 68.89. BINARIES CANNOT GET THERE.\n\n## \u2705 MANDATORY FIRST TASK: SOLVE N=1-10 OPTIMALLY\n\nBEFORE any other work, implement exhaustive search for small N:\n\n**For N=1 (contributes ~0.66 to score - HIGHEST!):**\n- Test EVERY rotation angle from 0\u00b0 to 360\u00b0 in 0.01\u00b0 increments\n- Find the angle that minimizes bounding box\n- This alone can improve score by 0.05-0.1 points\n\n**For N=2-10:**\n- Implement branch-and-bound or exhaustive placement search\n- These contribute ~2.5 points total - worth optimizing!\n\n## \u2705 MANDATORY: PER-N SOLUTION TRACKING\n\nTrack best solution for EACH N value separately:\n1. Load baseline per-N scores from existing submission\n2. After your algorithm runs, compare per-N scores\n3. SAVE any N where you improved (even if total is worse)\n4. Accumulate improvements across experiments\n\n## \u2705 REQUIRED: IMPLEMENT ALGORITHM IN PYTHON\n\nWrite YOUR OWN code. Choose ONE:\n1. Bottom-left constructive heuristic (easiest)\n2. Genetic algorithm with crossover (medium)\n3. Custom local search written from scratch (medium)\n4. Branch-and-bound for exact solutions (hardest)\n\nNO BINARIES. NO SUBPROCESS. NO OS.SYSTEM.\nWRITE THE ALGORITHM YOURSELF IN PYTHON.\n\n## Existing Baseline Solutions\n\nPre-optimized solutions exist in `/home/nonroot/snapshots/santa-2025/`. There are 112 snapshot directories with submission files. Use these as starting points:\n\n```python\n# Load a baseline submission\nimport pandas as pd\nbaseline = pd.read_csv('/home/nonroot/snapshots/santa-2025/20952569566/submission/submission.csv')\n```\n\n## Tree Geometry (15 vertices)\n\n```python\n# Tree polygon vertices (center at origin, tip at top)\nTX = [0, 0.125, 0.0625, 0.2, 0.1, 0.35, 0.075, 0.075, -0.075, -0.075, -0.35, -0.1, -0.2, -0.0625, -0.125]\nTY = [0.8, 0.5, 0.5, 0.25, 0.25, 0, 0, -0.2, -0.2, 0, 0, 0.25, 0.25, 0.5, 0.5]\n\n# Tree dimensions:\n# - Height: 1.0 (from trunk bottom at -0.2 to tip at 0.8)\n# - Max width: 0.7 (at base tier)\n# - Trunk: 0.15 wide, 0.2 tall\n```\n\n## Insights from Discussions (MANDATORY)\n\n- Discussion \"Why the winning solutions will be Asymmetric\" (39 votes): Asymmetric solutions outperform symmetric lattice patterns. Don't constrain to 90\u00b0 rotations.\n- Discussion \"IMPORTANT: Santa Etiquette\" (78 votes): Competition etiquette guidelines from staff.\n- Discussion \"Expected Leaderboard Progression\" (20 votes): Staff expectations for score progression.\n- Discussion \"Where do these high-scoring CSVs originate from?\" (13 votes): Top solutions come from extensive optimization runs.\n- Discussion \"Symmetric solutions that are apparently optimal\" (43 votes): Some N values have provably optimal symmetric solutions.\n- Discussion \"What are the best approaches?\" (6 votes): Community discussion on effective techniques.\n\n## What Discussions Say DOESN'T Work\n- Simple greedy placement without optimization\n- Symmetric lattice patterns for most N (asymmetric is better)\n- Running binaries without understanding the algorithm\n- Claude Code alone: \"7,850 Rounds of Optimization, 0 Improvements\" (13 votes discussion)\n\n## Key Techniques from Research\n\n### 1. No-Fit Polygon (NFP) - CRITICAL for efficiency\nThe NFP enables O(1) overlap checking between two polygons:\n- Precompute NFP for tree shape at different rotation angles\n- If reference point is inside NFP \u2192 overlap\n- If on boundary \u2192 touching\n- If outside \u2192 no overlap\n\n### 2. Bottom-Left-Fill Heuristic\nPlace each tree at the lowest, leftmost valid position:\n1. Sort trees by some criteria (area, height, etc.)\n2. For each tree, find all valid positions\n3. Choose the position that minimizes bounding box increase\n\n### 3. Local Search Moves\n- **Translation**: Move tree by small delta (0.001 to 0.01 units)\n- **Rotation**: Rotate tree by small angle (0.1\u00b0 to 5\u00b0)\n- **Squeeze**: Scale all positions toward center\n- **Compaction**: Move each tree toward centroid\n\n### 4. Simulated Annealing Framework\n```python\ndef simulated_annealing(config, T_start=1.0, T_end=0.001, cooling=0.9999):\n    T = T_start\n    best = config.copy()\n    while T > T_end:\n        # Generate neighbor by random move\n        neighbor = apply_random_move(config)\n        if not has_overlap(neighbor):\n            delta = neighbor.score() - config.score()\n            if delta < 0 or random() < exp(-delta/T):\n                config = neighbor\n                if config.score() < best.score():\n                    best = config\n        T *= cooling\n    return best\n```\n\n### 5. Boundary Tree Focus\nTrees touching the bounding box boundary determine the score:\n- Identify boundary trees (those at min/max x or y)\n- Focus optimization on these trees\n- Moving interior trees rarely improves score\n\n### 6. Backward Propagation\nUse N+1 solution to improve N solution:\n- Start from N=200 configuration\n- Remove one tree at a time\n- If resulting N-1 config is better than stored, save it\n\n## Algorithm Implementation Strategy\n\n### Phase 1: Exact Solutions for Small N (N=1-10)\n```python\ndef solve_small_n_exactly(n):\n    if n == 1:\n        # Find optimal rotation for single tree\n        best_angle = 0\n        best_side = float('inf')\n        for angle in range(0, 36000):  # 0.01\u00b0 increments\n            tree = create_tree(0, 0, angle/100)\n            side = get_bounding_box_side(tree)\n            if side < best_side:\n                best_side = side\n                best_angle = angle/100\n        return [(0, 0, best_angle)]\n    \n    # For N=2-10, use exhaustive search with pruning\n    # ...\n```\n\n### Phase 2: Constructive Heuristic for Medium N (N=11-50)\n```python\ndef bottom_left_fill(n, existing_trees=None):\n    trees = existing_trees or []\n    while len(trees) < n:\n        best_pos = None\n        best_score = float('inf')\n        # Try many positions and rotations\n        for angle in range(0, 360, 5):\n            for pos in candidate_positions(trees, angle):\n                if not has_overlap(trees, pos, angle):\n                    score = evaluate_score(trees + [(pos, angle)])\n                    if score < best_score:\n                        best_score = score\n                        best_pos = (pos, angle)\n        trees.append(best_pos)\n    return trees\n```\n\n### Phase 3: Local Search for Large N (N=51-200)\n```python\ndef local_search(trees, max_iter=10000):\n    best = trees.copy()\n    for _ in range(max_iter):\n        # Pick random tree\n        i = random.randint(0, len(trees)-1)\n        # Try small perturbation\n        for move in generate_moves(trees[i]):\n            new_trees = apply_move(trees, i, move)\n            if not has_overlap(new_trees) and score(new_trees) < score(best):\n                best = new_trees\n                trees = new_trees\n                break\n    return best\n```\n\n## Overlap Detection (CRITICAL)\n\n```python\nfrom shapely.geometry import Polygon\nfrom shapely import affinity\n\ndef create_tree_polygon(x, y, angle):\n    TX = [0, 0.125, 0.0625, 0.2, 0.1, 0.35, 0.075, 0.075, -0.075, -0.075, -0.35, -0.1, -0.2, -0.0625, -0.125]\n    TY = [0.8, 0.5, 0.5, 0.25, 0.25, 0, 0, -0.2, -0.2, 0, 0, 0.25, 0.25, 0.5, 0.5]\n    poly = Polygon(zip(TX, TY))\n    poly = affinity.rotate(poly, angle, origin=(0, 0))\n    poly = affinity.translate(poly, x, y)\n    return poly\n\ndef has_overlap(trees):\n    polys = [create_tree_polygon(*t) for t in trees]\n    for i in range(len(polys)):\n        for j in range(i+1, len(polys)):\n            if polys[i].intersects(polys[j]) and not polys[i].touches(polys[j]):\n                return True\n    return False\n```\n\n## Score Calculation\n\n```python\ndef calculate_score(all_solutions):\n    \"\"\"Calculate total score for all N=1 to 200\"\"\"\n    total = 0\n    for n in range(1, 201):\n        trees = all_solutions[n]\n        polys = [create_tree_polygon(*t) for t in trees]\n        from shapely.ops import unary_union\n        bounds = unary_union(polys).bounds\n        side = max(bounds[2] - bounds[0], bounds[3] - bounds[1])\n        contribution = (side ** 2) / n\n        total += contribution\n    return total\n\ndef calculate_per_n_scores(all_solutions):\n    \"\"\"Calculate score contribution for each N\"\"\"\n    scores = {}\n    for n in range(1, 201):\n        trees = all_solutions[n]\n        polys = [create_tree_polygon(*t) for t in trees]\n        from shapely.ops import unary_union\n        bounds = unary_union(polys).bounds\n        side = max(bounds[2] - bounds[0], bounds[3] - bounds[1])\n        scores[n] = (side ** 2) / n\n    return scores\n```\n\n## Submission Format\n\n```python\ndef create_submission(all_solutions):\n    rows = []\n    for n in range(1, 201):\n        trees = all_solutions[n]\n        for idx, (x, y, angle) in enumerate(trees):\n            rows.append({\n                'id': f'{n:03d}_{idx}',\n                'x': f's{x:.6f}',\n                'y': f's{y:.6f}',\n                'deg': f's{angle:.6f}'\n            })\n    return pd.DataFrame(rows)\n```\n\n## Recommended Experiment Priority\n\n1. **FIRST**: Implement exact solver for N=1 (find optimal rotation)\n2. **SECOND**: Implement exact solver for N=2-5 \n3. **THIRD**: Implement bottom-left-fill for N=6-50\n4. **FOURTH**: Implement local search refinement for all N\n5. **FIFTH**: Implement backward propagation from large N to small N\n\n## Key Insights for Winning\n\n1. **Small N matters most**: N=1 alone contributes 0.66 to score. Perfect N=1-10 can save 0.5+ points.\n\n2. **Asymmetric beats symmetric**: Don't constrain rotations to 90\u00b0 increments. Use continuous angles.\n\n3. **Boundary trees are key**: Only trees touching the bounding box affect the score. Focus optimization there.\n\n4. **Per-N tracking is essential**: Track best solution for each N separately. Combine best across experiments.\n\n5. **Python can win**: The top solutions use C++ for speed, but a well-designed Python algorithm with good heuristics can achieve competitive results.\n\n6. **Use existing baselines**: Start from pre-optimized solutions in snapshots, don't build from scratch.\n\n## Validation\n\nAlways validate before submission:\n```python\ndef validate_submission(df):\n    for n in range(1, 201):\n        group = df[df['id'].str.startswith(f'{n:03d}_')]\n        trees = [(float(r['x'][1:]), float(r['y'][1:]), float(r['deg'][1:])) \n                 for _, r in group.iterrows()]\n        if has_overlap(trees):\n            print(f\"OVERLAP at N={n}!\")\n            return False\n    return True\n```\n\n## DO NOT\n\n- Do NOT use pre-compiled binaries\n- Do NOT just run more iterations of existing optimizers\n- Do NOT copy solutions without understanding them\n- Do NOT ignore small N values\n- Do NOT use symmetric-only rotations\n\n## DO\n\n- DO implement your own algorithms in Python\n- DO focus on small N first (N=1-20)\n- DO track per-N improvements\n- DO use Shapely for geometry\n- DO validate before every submission\n- DO start from existing baseline solutions in snapshots\n",

Backward Propagation\nUse N+1 solution to improve N solution:\n- Start from N=200 configuration\n- Remove one tree at a time\n- If resulting N-1 config is better than stored, save it\n\n## Algorithm Implementation Strategy\n\n### Phase 1: Exact Solutions for Small N (N=1-10)\n```python\ndef solve_small_n_exactly(n):\n    if n == 1:\n        # Find optimal rotation for single tree\n        best_angle = 0\n        best_side = float('inf')\n        for angle in range(0, 36000):  # 0.01\u00b0 increments\n            tree = create_tree(0, 0, angle/100)\n            side = get_bounding_box_side(tree)\n            if side < best_side:\n                best_side = side\n                best_angle = angle/100\n        return [(0, 0, best_angle)]\n    \n    # For N=2-10, use exhaustive search with pruning\n    # ...\n```\n\n### Phase 2: Constructive Heuristic for Medium N (N=11-50)\n```python\ndef bottom_left_fill(n, existing_trees=None):\n    trees = existing_trees or []\n    while len(trees) < n:\n        best_pos = None\n        best_score = float('inf')\n        # Try many positions and rotations\n        for angle in range(0, 360, 5):\n            for pos in candidate_positions(trees, angle):\n                if not has_overlap(trees, pos, angle):\n                    score = evaluate_score(trees + [(pos, angle)])\n                    if score < best_score:\n                        best_score = score\n                        best_pos = (pos, angle)\n        trees.append(best_pos)\n    return trees\n```\n\n### Phase 3: Local Search for Large N (N=51-200)\n```python\ndef local_search(trees, max_iter=10000):\n    best = trees.copy()\n    for _ in range(max_iter):\n        # Pick random tree\n        i = random.randint(0, len(trees)-1)\n        # Try small perturbation\n        for move in generate_moves(trees[i]):\n            new_trees = apply_move(trees, i, move)\n            if not has_overlap(new_trees) and score(new_trees) < score(best):\n                best = new_trees\n                trees = new_trees\n                break\n    return best\n```\n\n## Overlap Detection (CRITICAL)\n\n```python\nfrom shapely.geometry import Polygon\nfrom shapely import affinity\n\ndef create_tree_polygon(x, y, angle):\n    TX = [0, 0.125, 0.0625, 0.2, 0.1, 0.35, 0.075, 0.075, -0.075, -0.075, -0.35, -0.1, -0.2, -0.0625, -0.125]\n    TY = [0.8, 0.5, 0.5, 0.25, 0.25, 0, 0, -0.2, -0.2, 0, 0, 0.25, 0.25, 0.5, 0.5]\n    poly = Polygon(zip(TX, TY))\n    poly = affinity.rotate(poly, angle, origin=(0, 0))\n    poly = affinity.translate(poly, x, y)\n    return poly\n\ndef has_overlap(trees):\n    polys = [create_tree_polygon(*t) for t in trees]\n    for i in range(len(polys)):\n        for j in range(i+1, len(polys)):\n            if polys[i].intersects(polys[j]) and not polys[i].touches(polys[j]):\n                return True\n    return False\n```\n\n## Score Calculation\n\n```python\ndef calculate_score(all_solutions):\n    \"\"\"Calculate total score for all N=1 to 200\"\"\"\n    total = 0\n    for n in range(1, 201):\n        trees = all_solutions[n]\n        polys = [create_tree_polygon(*t) for t in trees]\n        from shapely.ops import unary_union\n        bounds = unary_union(polys).bounds\n        side = max(bounds[2] - bounds[0], bounds[3] - bounds[1])\n        contribution = (side ** 2) / n\n        total += contribution\n    return total\n\ndef calculate_per_n_scores(all_solutions):\n    \"\"\"Calculate score contribution for each N\"\"\"\n    scores = {}\n    for n in range(1, 201):\n        trees = all_solutions[n]\n        polys = [create_tree_polygon(*t) for t in trees]\n        from shapely.ops import unary_union\n        bounds = unary_union(polys).bounds\n        side = max(bounds[2] - bounds[0], bounds[3] - bounds[1])\n        scores[n] = (side ** 2) / n\n    return scores\n```\n\n## Submission Format\n\n```python\ndef create_submission(all_solutions):\n    rows = []\n    for n in range(1, 201):\n        trees = all_solutions[n]\n        for idx, (x, y, angle) in enumerate(trees):\n            rows.append({\n                'id': f'{n:03d}_{idx}',\n                'x': f's{x:.6f}',\n                'y': f's{y:.6f}',\n                'deg': f's{angle:.6f}'\n            })\n    return pd.DataFrame(rows)\n```\n\n## Recommended Experiment Priority\n\n1. **FIRST**: Implement exact solver for N=1 (find optimal rotation)\n2. **SECOND**: Implement exact solver for N=2-5 \n3. **THIRD**: Implement bottom-left-fill for N=6-50\n4. **FOURTH**: Implement local search refinement for all N\n5. **FIFTH**: Implement backward propagation from large N to small N\n\n## Key Insights for Winning\n\n1. **Small N matters most**: N=1 alone contributes 0.66 to score. Perfect N=1-10 can save 0.5+ points.\n\n2. **Asymmetric beats symmetric**: Don't constrain rotations to 90\u00b0 increments. Use continuous angles.\n\n3. **Boundary trees are key**: Only trees touching the bounding box affect the score. Focus optimization there.\n\n4. **Per-N tracking is essential**: Track best solution for each N separately. Combine best across experiments.\n\n5. **Python can win**: The top solutions use C++ for speed, but a well-designed Python algorithm with good heuristics can achieve competitive results.\n\n6. **Use existing baselines**: Start from pre-optimized solutions in snapshots, don't build from scratch.\n\n## Validation\n\nAlways validate before submission:\n```python\ndef validate_submission(df):\n    for n in range(1, 201):\n        group = df[df['id'].str.startswith(f'{n:03d}_')]\n        trees = [(float(r['x'][1:]), float(r['y'][1:]), float(r['deg'][1:])) \n                 for _, r in group.iterrows()]\n        if has_overlap(trees):\n            print(f\"OVERLAP at N={n}!\")\n            return False\n    return True\n```\n\n## DO NOT\n\n- Do NOT use pre-compiled binaries\n- Do NOT just run more iterations of existing optimizers\n- Do NOT copy solutions without understanding them\n- Do NOT ignore small N values\n- Do NOT use symmetric-only rotations\n\n## DO\n\n- DO implement your own algorithms in Python\n- DO focus on small N first (N=1-20)\n- DO track per-N improvements\n- DO use Shapely for geometry\n- DO validate before every submission\n- DO start from existing baseline solutions in snapshots\n",
