  "conclusion": "The baseline is at a TRUE local optimum that SA cannot escape, regardless of parameters. The SA accepts many moves (95%+ acceptance rate) but never finds a better configuration. This confirms that the baseline was created by sophisticated optimization that found a global or near-global optimum. Without access to external data sources or fundamentally different algorithms, we cannot improve on the baseline."
