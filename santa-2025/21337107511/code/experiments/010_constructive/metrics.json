    "gap": "Constructive approaches achieve ~88 vs baseline 70.6 (25% worse)",
    "reason": "Baseline uses sophisticated interlocking patterns that simple grid-based approaches cannot replicate. The baseline is the result of C++ SA with millions of iterations."
  },
  "conclusion": "Constructive approaches cannot match the baseline. The baseline uses sophisticated interlocking patterns optimized by C++ SA. Without access to similar optimization power, we cannot improve on the baseline. Submitted baseline as-is."
