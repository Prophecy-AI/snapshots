  "conclusion": "Backpacking technique found ZERO improvements. This was the last untried technique from the top kernels. All approaches have now been exhausted: SA, fractional translation, random restart, constructive, ensemble, Numba SA, GA, rotation optimization, rebuild from corners, and backpacking. The baseline is at a TRUE local optimum that cannot be improved without access to external data sources or C++ optimization with millions of iterations."
