    "conclusion": "GA cannot escape the local optimum because: 1) Random configs are much worse than baseline, 2) Crossover creates invalid solutions, 3) Mutations don't find better configurations"
  },
  "conclusion": "The baseline is at a TRUE local optimum that even GA cannot escape. All approaches (SA, fractional translation, random restart, constructive, ensemble, Numba SA, GA) have failed to find improvements. The baseline was created by sophisticated C++ optimization with millions of iterations. Without access to external data sources that found different local optima, we cannot improve on the baseline."
