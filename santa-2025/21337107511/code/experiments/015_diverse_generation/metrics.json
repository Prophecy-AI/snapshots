  "conclusion": "Generating diverse solutions from scratch using constructive heuristics (spiral, hexagonal, bottom-left) produces solutions that are 2x worse than the baseline. The baseline was created by sophisticated C++ optimization with millions of iterations. Without access to similar optimization power or external data sources that found different local optima, we cannot improve on the baseline."
