  "notes": "Discovered precision loss issue. Ensemble failed because float parsing loses precision. Submitting baseline with full precision to verify.",
  "precision_issue": "When parsing floats and re-saving, we lose decimal places (18 -> 16). This causes Kaggle overlap detection to fail.",
  "solution": "Must preserve original string coordinates when combining solutions."
