    "conclusion": "All significant improvements come from snapshot 21145966992 which has OVERLAPS and fails Kaggle validation. All VALID improvements are numerical noise (1e-9 to 1e-12). The baseline is already the best valid solution available."

    "Baseline (21337353543) passes Kaggle validation: 200/200 N values valid",
    "Snapshot 21145966992 has best scores but FAILS validation (overlaps)",
    "All other snapshots have essentially identical scores to baseline",
    "Valid improvements total only 1.76e-7 (numerical noise)",
    "The ensemble approach CANNOT improve on the baseline because all valid solutions are at the same local optimum"

  "notes": "Implemented Kaggle's exact validation using Decimal precision and 1e18 integer scaling. Validated all 109 snapshots. Found that the baseline is already optimal among valid solutions. The 0.09 improvement seen in exp_002/004/006 came from invalid solutions with overlaps."
