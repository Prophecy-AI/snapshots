      "finding": "Two\u2011dimensional irregular polygon packing is a classic combinatorial optimisation problem that appears in sheet\u2011metal cutting, textile layout, furniture design and many other manufacturing processes.  Because the exact solution space grows exponentially with the number of pieces, the most successful approaches today are hybrid methods that combine fast constructive heuristics with powerful meta\u2011heuristic or local\u2011search refinements.  Constructive schemes such as the **bottom\u2011left placement** and **shelf\u2011based packing** provide quick feasible layouts and form the backbone of many modern solvers\u202f([taylorfrancis.com](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.1201/9781351236423-33/practical-algorithms-two-dimensional-packing-general-shapes-yannan-hu-hideki-hashimoto-shinji-imahori-mutsunori-yagiura))\u202f; they are often enhanced by a **2\u2011level algorithm with a collision\u2011free region** that resolves overlaps more efficiently\u202f([academia.edu](https://www.academia.edu/104990563/IRREGULAR_PLAC",
