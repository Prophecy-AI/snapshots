      "text": "Optimal lattice packing of irregular polygons is the problem of arranging congruent copies of a non\u2011rectangular shape on a plane (or on a rectangular sheet) so that the repeating unit\u2011cell of a lattice contains the maximum possible area fraction of the polygons.  Because the polygons are not convex or regular, the geometry of the lattice vectors and the relative orientation of the pieces become decision variables, and the objective is to minimise waste or maximise density.  This formulation underlies many industrial nesting tasks where material cost is critical\u202f([sciencedirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0377221799001150);\u202f[dl.acm.org](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/336154.336214)).\n\nA variety of exact and heuristic techniques have been proposed.  Dyckhoff (2000) presented a constructive method that computes the optimal lattice parameters for a given oriented polygon by solving a nonlinear optimisation over the lattice basis vectors\u202f([sciencedirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0377221799001150)).

The feasible solution region is contained in the set of pairs of points of the _\u03a6_-function 0-level surface of the polygon. The region is partitioned into a finite number of subregions corresponding to pairs of linear segments of the _\u03a6_-function 0-level surface. The frontiers of the subregions are generated by the conditions of non-overlapping of polygons. Only four such conditions imply non-overlapping of each pair of polygons in a lattice packing. The solution can be attained only in a finite number of points on the frontiers of these subregions. Hence, it is possible to use an organized sorting of such points with discarding of subregions whose objective function upper bound is lower than the record.\n\n## Introduction\n\nIt is necessary to find such a lattice 6, 22, 10 packing of congruent similarly oriented non-overlapping non-convex bounded polygons in the plane so that the density of packing \\[22\\] of the plane with these polygons be the greatest.\n\nThe problems of lattice packing of geometric objects were considered in the works of Refs. 20, 6, 22, 23, 27, 7, 9. Packings being exact coverings and their connection with Fyodorov's crystallographic groups 10, 11 were investigated in the works of Ref. \\[12\\]. Optimization problems of regular (single-row, multirow and lattice \\[22\\]) packing of geometric objects were investigated in the works of Refs. 24, 27, 23, 7, 9. For convex polygons the optimal lattice packing problem was investigated in Ref. \\[21\\]. The lower bounds for double lattice packings of centrally symmetric convex bodies were obtained by Kuperberg and Kuperberg \\[16\\].\n\nThe concept of _\u03a6_-functions \\[28\\] made it possible to represent various cutting and packing problems in terms of mathematical programming. _\u03a6_-function is a function on the set of placement parameters of objects positive when the objects are non-overlapping and negative if their interiorities intersect. 0-level surface of the _\u03a6_-function is the hodograph of the dense placement function \\[25\\] or the frontier of the non-fit polygon \\[19\\].\n\nIn the frames of the typology of cutting and packing problems proposed by Dyckhoff \\[4\\] our problem may be classified as two-dimensional \\`Beladeproblem' with one object (infinite plane) and congruent items (polygons) (abbreviation 2/B/O/C).\n\nThe approach adopted in this work for solving the problem in consideration is based on the use of the _\u03a6_-function properties \\[28\\] as well as on the concept of decomposition of the problem proposed in Refs. 7, 9 and on the properties of lattice packings investigated in Refs. 7, 9.\n\nWe give here proofs of the results justifying the approach proposed in Refs. 7, 9, select the set of pairs of the _\u03a6_-function 0-level surface vertices on which extremum can be attained. Algorithmic realization involves treating singularity cases and estimations reducing the region of feasible solutions.\n\nMethods of construction of 0-level surface of the _\u03a6_-function proposed in Refs. 14, 17, 1, 19 were used when obtaining optimal lattice packings.\n\nIn the present paper we describe in Section 2some properties of _\u03a6_-function and its 0-level surface used for formalization of conditions of mutual non-overlapping of polygons.\n\nIn Section 3some properties of lattices used when simplifying the mathematical model of the problem are described.\n\nIn Section 4the mathematical model of the problem is formulated. The number of conditions describing the region of feasible solutions is reduced by means of applying some properties of densest lattice packings. Namely, it is shown that for finding a densest lattice packing only lattice packings in which a polygon touches two ones obtained by translations by the basis lattice vectors may be taken into account. It is also shown that when a lattice packing is dense all the conditions of mutual non-overlapping are implied by only four ones written for the combinations _a_ 1, _a_ 2, _a_ 1+ _a_ 2, \u2212 _a_ 1+ _a_ 2 of basis lattice vectors _a_ 1 and _a_ 2. Thus, the ends of basis lattice vectors _a_ 1 and _a_ 2 lie on the piecewise linear _\u03a6_-function 0-level surface and satisfy a structure \\[18\\] of linear equations.\n\nIn Section 5the feasible solution region is decomposed into subsets represented parametrically as subsets of \\[0,1\\]\u00d7\\[0,1\\] with a piecewise linear frontier. The objective function in our problem has no extrema in the interiors of such subregions. Since each segment of their frontier has a unique extremum a sorting of such extrema allows to solve the problem.\n\n## Section snippets\n\n## Formalization of conditions of mutual non-overlapping of polygons\n\nIn order to construct a mathematical model of the problem it is necessary to present the objective function and the constraints describing the region of feasible solutions in the analytical form. The conditions of mutual non-overlapping of the polygons are such constraints.\n\nWe designate the interior of _S_ as intS, the closure of _S_ as clS and the frontier of _S_ as frS.\n\nLet there be a polygon _S_ _i_. Its position in _R_ 2 is well known to be fully characterized by three parameters _x_ _i_, _y_ _i_, _\u03b8_ _i_ where ( _x_ _i_, _y_ _i_)= _v_ _i_\n\n## Lattices and lattice packing\n\nIf _a_ 1, _a_ 2\u2208 _R_ 2 are linearly independent, a set of vectors \\[22\\]r=na1+ma2,n,m\u2208Z,is called a lattice with the basis _a_ 1, _a_ 2 and is denoted by _L_ = _\u039b_( _a_ 1, _a_ 2) where Z={0,\u00b11,\u00b12,\u2026} is the set of integers, _\u039b_ is an operator mapping a set of pairs of vectors onto a set of families of the form (6)....",

A particular case of the nesting problem occurs when congruent copies of one single shape have to fill, as much as possible, a limited sheet. Traditional approaches to the nesting problem have difficulty to tackle with high number of pieces to place. Additionally, if the orientation of the given shape is not a constraint, the general nesting approaches are not particularly successful. This problem arises in practice in several industrial contexts such as footwear, metalware and furniture. A possible approach is the periodic placement of the shapes, in a lattice way. In this paper, we propose three heuristic approaches to solve this particular case of nesting problems. Experimental results are compared with published results in literature and additional results obtained from new instances are also provided.\n## Introduction\nNesting has been widely studied (Dowsland and Dowsland, 1992), as it is a common problem in several industrial production processes (textile, garment, footwear, metalware, furniture, etc.). Most of the published papers impose orientation constraints: the shape can only be rotated a predetermined number of fixed angles (the most common is 180\u00b0 and, less commonly, 90\u00b0) or it cannot be rotated at all. However, in certain particular cases, orientation constraints do not arise. Additionally, some industries frequently need to cut big quantities of each type of shape. In these two situations, the periodic packing of the shapes (lattice packing) proved to be a very competitive approach, because:\n* \u2013good cutting patterns, with very small waste, can be obtained;\n* \u2013the automatic cutting process is more efficient when a periodic placement is considered;\n* \u2013reduced computational time (when compared with general nesting approaches, where each piece has to be treated individually), which allows to tackle problems of greater dimension.\nIn this section, we start by describing the problem and refer to related works in a brief review. In Section 2, we point out the geometric considerations necessary to understand this work. Section 3 describes the underlying rules and criteria used to build the three heuristic approaches, which are proposed in the fourth section. In Section 5, the instances used to evaluate the quality of the proposed approaches are defined and the results obtained with all the three heuristics are presented and compared. Finally, in the last section, we draw conclusions and make some comments about future work.\nThe periodic placement of congruent copies of one shape can be found in literature under the keywords \u201cperiodic packing\u201d, \u201cregular packing\u201d or \u201clattice packing\u201d. The lattice packing may be defined over an infinite plane or a limited sheet. If it is the plane, the main objective is to regularly place the shapes so that the density obtained is maximised. When lattice packing on a limited stock sheet, the goal is to maximise the percentage of stock sheet utilisation, which is equivalent to maximise the number of shapes placed inside the plate. As will be shown later, these two \u201capparently\u201d similar objectives are not quite equivalent. However, the definition of a lattice is identical in the two situations. A lattice is generated by two linearly independent vectors,*v*0and*v*1, whose linear combinations will produce a grid that guarantees that pieces do not overlap. The shapes are located in each node of the grid.\nThe problem we propose to solve does not considerer orientation constraints, so, any rotation of the given shape can be allowed. However, after a specific orientation is chosen, all the shapes must follow the same orientation (*Single-Lattice*\u2013 Fig. 1a) or be alternately rotated 180\u00b0 (*Double-Lattice*\u2013 Fig. 1b). According to the typology by W\u00e4scher et al. (2007), the problem described in this paper is a 2-dimensional irregular IIPP (Identical Item Packing Problem).\nThe orientation of the shapes is not relevant when lattice packing on the plane, as maximum density remains unchanged. However, when stock sheet borders need to be taken into account, the orientation of the shapes may be extremely important as will be shown in the following sections.\nIn this work, we propose to solve the problem of Periodic Packing of Irregular Shapes (PPIS) on a limited stock sheet (a rectangle) by heuristic methods.\nThere are references in the literature to the Lattice Packing Problem since the fifties, the first results concerning only theoretical aspects of the lattice packing of a single convex polygon on the plane (Rogers, 1951). However, only a few publications during the next 30 years can be found, and some of them are just marginally related to lattice packing. O\u2019Rourke et al. (1986) have considered the problem of finding minimal enclosing triangles and Dori and Ben Bassat (1983) have dealt with the problem of finding minimal enclosing convex polygons with fewer sides. Those approaches can be seen as a pre-processing to lattice packing, as regular convex polygons can be easily packed than the original ones.\nBetween 1990 and 2000, essentially theoretical results on lattice lacking have been published, mostly considering unlimited sheets and convex shapes (Mount and Silverman, 1990, Mount, 1991, Kuperberg and Kuperberg, 1990, Stoyan and Patsuk, 2000).\nMore recently, results concerning real industrial problems, with limited sheets, irregular shapes and no orientation constraints, have been published. Prasad et al. (1995) describe a nesting problem of irregular shaped metal blanks and propose a heuristic search, considering the variation in the or...",

These problems are prominent in several areas, including, but not limited to, the textile, shipbuilding and leather industries. They consist in placing a set of items, whose geometry is often represented by simple polygons, into one or more containers such that there is no overlap between items and the utility rate of the container is maximized. In this work, the irregular strip packing problem, an irregular packing variant with a variable length container, is investigated. The placement space is reduced by adopting a rectangular grid and a full search is performed using preprocessed raster penetration maps to efficiently determine the new position of an item. Tests were performed using simple dotted board model cases and irregular strip packing benchmark instances. The comparison of our results with the state of the art solutions showed that the proposed algorithm is very competitive, achieving better or equal compaction in 9 out of 15 instances and improving the average density in 13 instances. Besides the contribution of the new best results, the proposed approach showed the advantage of adopting discrete placement, which can be potentially applied to other irregular packing problems.\n\n## Introduction\n\nCutting and packing problems are important in different areas, such as the textile, wood, glass, and shipbuilding industries and are thus regarded as an important research field. Finding efficient solutions for these problems may generate significant economic and environmental benefits. The basic outline of a packing (or cutting) problem consists in assigning items to containers and arranging the layout such that the combined utility rate of the containers is maximized.\n\nIrregular strip packing, also referred to as the irregular nesting problem, is studied herein. Proposals to solve this subgroup of cutting and packing problems must be capable of dealing with irregular shaped items, which is a complex task. The objective is to obtain the most compact configuration of items that can be placed into a rectangle container with a variable dimension. Due to the limitations of practical applications, each item can only be rotated by a finite set of angles, which may include 0\u2218, 90\u2218, 180\u2218 and 270\u2218. According to the typology proposed by W\u00e4scher, Hau\u00dfner, and Schumann (2007), the variant considered herein is the 2-dimensional irregular open dimension problem.\n\nIn a textile application, using automatic computer-generated cutting patterns that minimize the volume of wasted material frequently provides a huge improvement over manually developing a layout. However, as the problem is NP-hard\u00a0(Fowler, Paterson, & Tanimoto, 1981), it might not be possible to obtain the optimal layout in a limited time frame for large problems. Therefore, for solving a wider range of problems, a heuristic approach is adopted. To achieve a more efficient solution, the search space is reduced by adopting a grid placement for items and the layout is determined by an overlap minimization strategy. Moreover, the raster penetration map tool is proposed to reduce the online computational cost of computing the overlap value. So as to properly test the quality of the layouts, the proposed solution is executed by using dotted board cases and irregular strip packing instances from the literature. Even with the placement limitations, the results show that the algorithm is capable of achieving better solutions than the best approaches in the literature.\n\nThis text is structured as follows. Section\u00a02 contains a brief literature review on irregular strip packing, which is described in detail in Section\u00a03. Section\u00a04 describes the proposed method to evaluate the overlap efficiently with the raster penetration map. This evaluation is employed in a separation and compaction strategy, described in Section\u00a05, to solve the strip packing problem. Section\u00a06 shows the results from the proposed algorithm ROMA and a comparison with results from state-of-the-art approaches in the literature is made. Finally, the conclusions are drawn in Section\u00a07.\n\n## Section snippets\n\n## Literature review\n\nThe irregularity of shapes is a singular characteristic in irregular strip packing problems, which leads to a reduced number of publications in the field\u00a0(Bennell & Oliveira, 2008). Due to its complexity, advanced geometric tools are employed to avoid overlap between items. In the literature, the main geometric tool is the nofit polygon, which was proposed by\u00a0Art (1966). Bennell and Oliveira (2008) made a review of geometric tools for irregular packing problems.\n\nAside from the geometric\n\n## Problem description\n\nThe irregular strip packing problem is a two-dimensional packing problem in which a set of items must be placed into one rectangular container in a valid configuration. The shape of items may be irregular and is herein represented by simple polygons. The container has a fixed width and a variable length. The objective is to obtain a feasible solution which maximizes the density of the configuration, i.e., minimizes the length of the layout. Up to four orientations are allowed for each item: 0\u2218,\n\n## Overlap evaluation\n\nA common strategy is to relax the overlap restriction by penalizing the objective f...",

The present work shows how to obtain the lattice parameters associated to any direction when they are known for a given one. Obtaining these parameters is necessary for the actual graphical building of the lattice nesting. It is shown that the solution of this problem is equivalent to the solution of a linear Diophantine equation. A graphical example is then presented.\n\nRecommended articles\n\n- C.A.

We hope that this review could provide guidance for researchers in the field of 2D irregular packing.\n## 1 Introduction\nTwo-dimensional (2D) irregular packing problems are widespread in industries such as machinery manufacturing, aviation, shipbuilding, automobile manufacturing, clothing and furniture manufacturing. An efficient 2D irregular packing algorithm can effectively improve material utilization and reduce processing costs. The reduction in material consumption will also have a beneficial impact on the environment ([Ke et al., 2020](#B76)). Therefore, research of the packing problem is of great significance for technology and social interest.\nThe 2D packing problem is a type of combinatorial optimization problems to locate parts with different shapes compactly in one or more master sheet material to minimize the occupied space or maximize the utilization of the material. The 2D packing problem is currently recognized as a NP problem, which is mainly solved by heuristic algorithms. In recent years, many scholars have conducted research on 2D irregular packing problems with a verity of solutions.\nThere exists a number of review articles on packing and cutting problems. We have summarized the main review literature in the field of 2D packing and cutting as shown in[Table 1](#T1). Brown ([Brown, 1971](#B17)) introduced an optimum packing and depletion problem with optimization of space and resource usage. Harvey ([Salkin and De Kluyver, 1975](#B116)) surveyed the application of mathematical optimization models such as linear programming to the knapsack problem. Bruce ([Golden, 1976](#B50)) surveyed various approaches to the cutting stock problem. Hinxman ([Hinxman, 1980](#B65)) surveyed the trim-loss and assortment problems, this research paid more attention to cutting and packaging problems in practical applications, and did not mention much about theoretical methods. Garey and Coffman ([Garey and Johnson, 1981](#B47);[Coffman et al., 1984](#B27)) surveyed the approximation algorithms for bin packing problems. Israni ([Israni and Sanders, 1982](#B72)) reviewed the 2D cutting stock problem including almost all 2D packaging problems. The author also proposed a rectangular layout method. Sarin ([Sarin, 1983](#B118)) reviewed methodologies and literature to solve 2D stock cutting problems and introduced an interactive optimization procedure for a general 2D stock cutting problem. Dyckhoff ([Dyckhoff et al., 1985](#B38)) described a trim loss and related problems and categorized them briefly. Dudzi&#x00144;ski ([Dudzi&#x00144;ski and Walukiewicz, 1987](#B36)) summarized the exact methods for knapsack problems, such as linear programming. Matthias ([Rode and Rosenberg, 1987](#B114)) analyzed the algorithm for the trim-loss problems. Haessler ([Haessler and Sweeney, 1991](#B59)) reviewed the solution process of cutting stock problems, including placement algorithm and sequence optimization algorithm. Dowsland ([Dowsland and Dowsland, 1992](#B34)) reviewed the application of operations research methods to the packing problem and summarized some exact heuristics. Sweeney ([Sweeney and Paternoster, 1992](#B128)) categorized cutting and packing problems and made application-oriented research records. Cheng ([Cheng et al., 1994](#B22)) discussed 2D cutting stock problems and their application cases including the pallet loading problem and VLSI placement problem. With the gradual deepening of research on 2D layout problems, typology becomes a common research topic. 2D regular and irregular layout problems are clearly distinguished in practical applications and theoretical methods. Dowsland ([Dowsland and Dowsland, 1995](#B29)) gave a special review of the 2D irregular nesting problem for the first time. Mavridou ([Mavridou and Pardalos, 1997](#B98)) summarized applications of the genetic algorithm and simulated annealing algorithm in the optimization of facility layout problems. Dyckhoff ([Dyckhoff, 1990](#B37)) made a typology of the cutting and packing problems in detail, and W&#x000e4;scher ([W&#x000e4;scher et al., 2007](#B135)) improved the typology later. Hopper ([Hopper and Turton, 1999](#B67);[Hopper and Turton, 2001a](#B68);[Hopper and Turton, 2001b](#B69)) investigated the application of meta-heuristic and heuristic algorithms in 2D and 3D packing problems. Lodi ([Lodi et al., 2002a](#B90);[Lodi et al., 2002b](#B91)) reviewed algorithms proposed in the 1990s of 2D packing problems. Bennell et al. ([Bennell and Oliveira, 2008](#B10);[Bennell and Oliveira, 2009](#B9)) discussed 2D irregular packing problems and related geometric problems. Leao ([Leao et al., 2020](#B81)) introduced the mathematical models in the 2D irregular packing problem.\nTABLE 1\n[![www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/966691/fmech-08-966691-HTML/image_m/fmech-08-966691-t001.jpg)](https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/966691/fmech-08-966691-HTML/image_m/fmech-08-966691-t001.jpg)\n**TABLE 1**. Review literature in the field of cutting and packing problems.\nThe scope of these reviews is broad, mainly for all 2D packing problems including rectangular packing and other regular packing problems. These review papers are out of date with missed innovative algorithms of 2D irregular packing. Since 2010, only Leao ([Leao et al., 2020](#B81)) reviewed 2D irregular packing problems. But he only introduced the mathematical models, instead of reviewing 2D irregular packing problems comprehensively. In recent years, there is not ...",

Restricted to polygons for computational convenience, it is based on the no-fit polygon/configuration space obstacle approach. The algorithm was tested on a modest set of fourteen polygons (thirteen non-interlocking and one interlocking) and yielded a feasible solution for each. The solutions were optimal for four of the non-interlocking polygons and near optimal for the other nine. As expected though, the solution for the one interlocking polygon was sub-optimal and enhancements to the algorithm would be required for such cases.\n\n## Suggested Citation\n\nP D Watson & A M Tobias, 1999.\n\" **[An efficient algorithm for the regular W1 packing of polygons in the infinite plane](https://ideas.repec.org/a/pal/jorsoc/v50y1999i10d10.1057_palgrave.jors.2600807.html)**,\"\n[Journal of the Operational Research Society](https://ideas.repec.org/s/pal/jorsoc.html), Palgrave Macmillan;The OR Society, vol. 50(10), pages 1054-1062, October.\nHandle: _RePEc:pal:jorsoc:v:50:y:1999:i:10:d:10.1057\\_palgrave.jors.2600807_\n\nDOI: 10.1057/palgrave.jors.2600807\n\nas\n\nHTMLHTML with abstractplain textplain text with abstractBibTeXRIS (EndNote, RefMan, ProCite)ReDIFJSON\n\n## Download full text from publisher\n\n**File URL:** http://link.springer.com/10.1057/palgrave.jors.2600807\n\n**File Function:** Abstract\n\n**Download Restriction:** Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.\n\n* * *\n\n**File URL:** https://libkey.io/10.1057/palgrave.jors.2600807?utm\\_source=ideas\n\n**LibKey link**: if access is restricted and if your library uses this service, LibKey will redirect you to where you can use your library subscription to access this item\n\n---><---\n\nAs the access to this document is restricted, you may want to [search](https://ideas.repec.org/cgi-bin/htsearch2?q=%22An+efficient+algorithm+for+the+regular+W1+packing+of+polygons+in+the+infinite+plane%22) for a different version of it.\n\n## Citations\n\nCitations are extracted by the [CitEc Project](http://citec.repec.org/), subscribe to its [RSS feed](http://citec.repec.org/cgi-bin/rss.pl?h=RePEc:pal:jorsoc:v:50:y:1999:i:10:d:10.1057_palgrave.jors.2600807) for this item.\n\nas\n\nHTMLHTML with abstractplain textplain text with abstractBibTeXRIS (EndNote, RefMan, ProCite)ReDIFJSON\n\n**Cited by:**\n\n1.
