      "text": "The \u201cChristmas\u2011tree polygon\u201d that appears in the Santa\u202f2025 competition is an irregular, congruent shape that must be placed repeatedly inside the smallest possible square box.  From a geometric\u2011optimization viewpoint the problem is a classic **lattice\u2011packing** task: one seeks a discrete set of translation vectors (a lattice) that tiles the plane with copies of the polygon without overlap, maximizing the packing density.  A general method for finding the optimal lattice for any oriented polygon was given by Dyckhoff, who showed that the problem reduces to an optimization over the parameters of an inscribed parallelogram that defines the lattice cell\u202f([ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0377221799001150)).  When the polygon is not centrally\u2011symmetric, the best known constructions often use a **double\u2011lattice** packing\u2014a union of two Bravais lattices related by a point reflection\u2014which can achieve higher densities than a single lattice (e.g., 92\u202f% for regular pentagons)\u202f([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_lattice)).  Kuperberg & Kuperberg proved that the optimal double\u2011lattice for any convex polygon can be obtained by solving a linear\u2011time algorithm on its vertices, and that this packing is locally optimal among all arrangements\u202f([arXiv\u202f1509.02241](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.02241)).\n\nIn the Santa\u202f2025 \u201cChristmas Tree Packing Challenge\u201d the objective is to pack\u202f1\u2013200 copies of the tree polygon into the smallest square\u202f([Kaggle discussion\u202f01/09/2026](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/santa-2025/discussion/666880)).  While many participants have tried reinforcement\u2011learning heuristics (which have shown limited success\u202f([Medium\u202fDec\u202f2025](https://hmnshudhmn24.medium.com/kaggle-santa-2025-why-reinforcement-learning-is-failing-087f3f04fa97))), the theoretical upper bound on how tightly the trees can be arranged is given by the optimal lattice or double\u2011lattice density derived from the methods above.  Practically, one can compute the optimal lattice cell for the specific tree shape using Dyckhoff\u2019s formulation, then test the corresponding double\u2011lattice arrangement to see whether it improves the density; this provides a benchmark against which algorithmic solutions can be measured.",

We expect a fun puzzle. We get a nightmare of Combinatorial Optimization.\nThis year\u2019s edition,**\u201cSanta 2025: The Christmas Tree Packing Challenge,\u201d**is no exception. The goal? Pack $N$ irregular \u201cTree Polygons\u201d into the smallest possible square bounding box for $N=1$ to $200$.\nIf you checked the leaderboard today (Dec 21), you noticed a trend:**Reinforcement Learning (RL) is getting crushed.**\nDespite the massive hype around \u201cReasoning Models\u201d and PPO agents this year, the top 100 teams aren\u2019t using neural networks. They are using 1980s physics simulations. Here is why the \u201cOld School\u201d is winning, and how the pros are using LLMs to cheat the system.\n## The Problem: Why RL Hates \u201cPacking\u201d\nOn paper, this looks like a game.*Place a tree, check for overlap, repeat.*Perfect for a DQN agent, right?\nWrong. The geometry kills the gradient.\n1. **Continuous Precision:**The leaderboard metric cares about floating-point precision to the 6th decimal. RL agents (which output discrete actions or probability distributions) struggle to make the \u201cmicro-adjustments\u201d needed to squeeze a tree into a 0.001mm gap.\n2. **The \u201cCollision\u201d Cliff:**In packing, a move is either valid (reward = 1) or it overlaps by a pixel (reward = -100). This sparse, binary feedback loop makes it nearly impossible for an agent to \u201clearn\u201d a gradient. It doesn\u2019t know*how*to fix the overlap, just that it failed.## The Solution: Simulated Annealing (on Steroids)\nThe \u201cSecret Sauce\u201d currently dominating the leaderboard is**Simulated Annealing (SA)**combined with**Lattice Generation**.\nInstead of training a model to*predict*the position, teams are writing physics engines that*shake*the box.\n* **High Temperature:**Randomly spin and throw trees into the box (Explorer Phase).\n* **Low Temperature:**Jiggle the trees by microscopic amounts to resolve collisions (Exploiter Phase).\nThe best solutions right now use a \u201cHybrid\u201d strategy:\n* **N &lt; 58:**Use Simulated Annealing to find unstructured, chaotic packings.\n* **N &gt; 58:**Switch to \u201cCrystalline Packing\u201d (regular geometric lattices) which is mathematically superior for large numbers.## The Twist: How LLMs are Actually Helping\nIf RL is dead, where is the AI?\nTop competitors aren\u2019t using LLMs to*solve*the puzzle; they are using LLMs to**write the solver**.\nPython is too slow for 10 billion annealing steps. The meta this year is to prompt Gemini 3 or Claude to:\n\u201cRewrite this Python overlap-check function in Rust/C++ with AVX2 vectorization.\u201d\nWe are seeing \u201cHybrid\u201d workflows where the**Human**defines the heuristics, the**LLM**writes the highly optimized C++ kernels, and**Simulated Annealing**does the heavy lifting.\n## The Starter Code: A Simple Annealer\nIf you want to jump in before the January deadline, don\u2019t start with PyTorch. Start here.\nHere is a conceptual snippet for a \u201cPerturbation\u201d mover \u2014the heart of any good annealing solution.\n```\nimport numpy as np\nimport math\ndef anneal(layout, max\\_temps=10000):\n# layout: Array of [x, y, rotation] for N trees\ncurrent\\_score = calculate\\_area(layout)\ntemperature = 1.0\ncooling\\_rate = 0.9995\nfor i in range(max\\_temps):\n# 1.

The feasible solution region is contained in the set of pairs of points of the _\u03a6_-function 0-level surface of the polygon. The region is partitioned into a finite number of subregions corresponding to pairs of linear segments of the _\u03a6_-function 0-level surface. The frontiers of the subregions are generated by the conditions of non-overlapping of polygons. Only four such conditions imply non-overlapping of each pair of polygons in a lattice packing. The solution can be attained only in a finite number of points on the frontiers of these subregions. Hence, it is possible to use an organized sorting of such points with discarding of subregions whose objective function upper bound is lower than the record.\n\n## Introduction\n\nIt is necessary to find such a lattice 6, 22, 10 packing of congruent similarly oriented non-overlapping non-convex bounded polygons in the plane so that the density of packing \\[22\\] of the plane with these polygons be the greatest.\n\nThe problems of lattice packing of geometric objects were considered in the works of Refs. 20, 6, 22, 23, 27, 7, 9. Packings being exact coverings and their connection with Fyodorov's crystallographic groups 10, 11 were investigated in the works of Ref. \\[12\\]. Optimization problems of regular (single-row, multirow and lattice \\[22\\]) packing of geometric objects were investigated in the works of Refs. 24, 27, 23, 7, 9. For convex polygons the optimal lattice packing problem was investigated in Ref. \\[21\\]. The lower bounds for double lattice packings of centrally symmetric convex bodies were obtained by Kuperberg and Kuperberg \\[16\\].\n\nThe concept of _\u03a6_-functions \\[28\\] made it possible to represent various cutting and packing problems in terms of mathematical programming. _\u03a6_-function is a function on the set of placement parameters of objects positive when the objects are non-overlapping and negative if their interiorities intersect. 0-level surface of the _\u03a6_-function is the hodograph of the dense placement function \\[25\\] or the frontier of the non-fit polygon \\[19\\].\n\nIn the frames of the typology of cutting and packing problems proposed by Dyckhoff \\[4\\] our problem may be classified as two-dimensional \\`Beladeproblem' with one object (infinite plane) and congruent items (polygons) (abbreviation 2/B/O/C).\n\nThe approach adopted in this work for solving the problem in consideration is based on the use of the _\u03a6_-function properties \\[28\\] as well as on the concept of decomposition of the problem proposed in Refs. 7, 9 and on the properties of lattice packings investigated in Refs. 7, 9.\n\nWe give here proofs of the results justifying the approach proposed in Refs. 7, 9, select the set of pairs of the _\u03a6_-function 0-level surface vertices on which extremum can be attained. Algorithmic realization involves treating singularity cases and estimations reducing the region of feasible solutions.\n\nMethods of construction of 0-level surface of the _\u03a6_-function proposed in Refs. 14, 17, 1, 19 were used when obtaining optimal lattice packings.\n\nIn the present paper we describe in Section 2some properties of _\u03a6_-function and its 0-level surface used for formalization of conditions of mutual non-overlapping of polygons.\n\nIn Section 3some properties of lattices used when simplifying the mathematical model of the problem are described.\n\nIn Section 4the mathematical model of the problem is formulated. The number of conditions describing the region of feasible solutions is reduced by means of applying some properties of densest lattice packings. Namely, it is shown that for finding a densest lattice packing only lattice packings in which a polygon touches two ones obtained by translations by the basis lattice vectors may be taken into account. It is also shown that when a lattice packing is dense all the conditions of mutual non-overlapping are implied by only four ones written for the combinations _a_ 1, _a_ 2, _a_ 1+ _a_ 2, \u2212 _a_ 1+ _a_ 2 of basis lattice vectors _a_ 1 and _a_ 2. Thus, the ends of basis lattice vectors _a_ 1 and _a_ 2 lie on the piecewise linear _\u03a6_-function 0-level surface and satisfy a structure \\[18\\] of linear equations.\n\nIn Section 5the feasible solution region is decomposed into subsets represented parametrically as subsets of \\[0,1\\]\u00d7\\[0,1\\] with a piecewise linear frontier. The objective function in our problem has no extrema in the interiors of such subregions. Since each segment of their frontier has a unique extremum a sorting of such extrema allows to solve the problem.\n\n## Section snippets\n\n## Formalization of conditions of mutual non-overlapping of polygons\n\nIn order to construct a mathematical model of the problem it is necessary to present the objective function and the constraints describing the region of feasible solutions in the analytical form. The conditions of mutual non-overlapping of the polygons are such constraints.\n\nWe designate the interior of _S_ as intS, the closure of _S_ as clS and the frontier of _S_ as frS.\n\nLet there be a polygon _S_ _i_. Its position in _R_ 2 is well known to be fully characterized by three parameters _x_ _i_, _y_ _i_, _\u03b8_ _i_ where ( _x_ _i_, _y_ _i_)= _v_ _i_\n\n## Lattices and lattice packing\n\nIf _a_ 1, _a_ 2\u2208 _R_ 2 are linearly independent, a set of vectors \\[22\\]r=na1+ma2,n,m\u2208Z,is called a lattice with the basis _a_ 1, _a_ 2 and is denoted by _L_ = _\u039b_( _a_ 1, _a_ 2) where Z={0,\u00b11,\u00b12,\u2026} is the set of integers, _\u039b_ is an operator mapping a set of pairs of vectors onto a set of families of the form (6)....",

The [orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_(group_theory)) of any point under the action of a double lattice is a union of two [Bravais lattices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bravais_lattice), related to each other by a point reflection. A double lattice in two dimensions is a [p2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallpaper_group#Group_p2) [wallpaper group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallpaper_group). In three dimensions, a double lattice is a [space group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_group) of the type 1, as denoted by [international notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann%E2%80%93Mauguin_notation).\n\n## Double lattice packing\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Double_lattice&action=edit&section=1)\\]\n\n[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c6/2-d_pentagon_packing_dual.svg/440px-2-d_pentagon_packing_dual.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:2-d_pentagon_packing_dual.svg) The best known packing of equal-sized regular pentagons on a plane is a double lattice structure which covers 92.131% of the plane.\n\nA packing that can be described as the orbit of a body under the action of a double lattice is called a double lattice packing. In many cases the highest known [packing density](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packing_density) for a body is achieved by a double lattice. Examples include the regular [pentagon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentagon), [heptagon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heptagon), and [nonagon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonagon)[\\[1\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_lattice#cite_note-degraaf2011-1) and the equilateral [triangular bipyramid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_bipyramid).[\\[2\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_lattice#cite_note-Haj2011-2) [W\u0142odzimierz Kuperberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W%C5%82odzimierz_Kuperberg) and [Greg Kuperberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Kuperberg) showed that all convex planar bodies can pack at a density of at least \u221a3/2 by using a double lattice.[\\[3\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_lattice#cite_note-Kup1990-3)\n\nIn a preprint released in 2016, [Thomas Hales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Callister_Hales) and W\u00f6den Kusner announced a proof that the double lattice packing of the regular pentagon has the optimal density among all packings of regular pentagons in the plane.[\\[4\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_lattice#cite_note-4) This packing has been used as a decorative pattern in China since at least 1900, and in this context has been called the \"pentagonal ice-ray\".[\\[5\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_lattice#cite_note-5) As of 2021[\\[update\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Double_lattice&action=edit), the proof of its optimality has not yet been refereed and published.\n\nIt has been conjectured that, among all convex shapes, the regular [heptagon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heptagon) has the lowest packing density for its optimal double lattice packing, but this remains unproven.[\\[6\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_lattice#cite_note-6)\n\n## References\\[ [edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Double_lattice&action=edit&section=2)\\]\n\n1. **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_lattice#cite_ref-degraaf2011_1-0)**de Graaf, Joost; van Roij, Ren\u00e9; [Dijkstra, Marjolein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjolein_Dijkstra) (2011), \"Dense regular packings of irregular nonconvex particles\", _Physical Review Letters_, **107** (15): 155501, [arXiv](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ArXiv_(identifier)):[1107.0603](https://arxiv.org/abs/1107.0603), [Bibcode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bibcode_(identifier)): [2011PhRvL.107o5501D](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011PhRvL.107o5501D), [doi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doi_(identifier)): [10.1103/PhysRevLett.107.155501](https://doi.org/10.1103%2FPhysRevLett.107.155501), [PMID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PMID_(identifier)) [22107298](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22107298)\n2. **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_lattice#cite_ref-Haj2011_2-0)**Haji-Akbari, Amir; Engel, Michael; [Glotzer, Sharon C.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharon_Glotzer) (2011), \"Degenerate quasicrystal of hard triangular bipyramids\", _Phys.

      "text": "The local optimality of the double lattice packing\nYoav Kallus\u2217 and W\u00a8oden Kusner\u2020\nSeptember 19, 2018\nAbstract\nThis paper introduces a technique for proving the local optimality of packing con\u0002figurations. Applying this technique to a general convex polygon, we prove that the\nconstruction of the optimal double lattice packing by Kuperberg and Kuperberg is also\nlocally optimal in the full space of packings.\n1 Introduction\nThis paper began as an investigation of the optimality of the double lattice packing\nfor pentagons and heptagons. In [KK90], Kuperberg and Kuperberg describe a recipe\nfor finding the double lattice packing of congruent planar convex bodies with maxi\u0002mal density by solving an optimization problem over inscribed parallelograms. This\noptimization problem is usually tractable, and in the case of convex polygons can be\nsolved by an algorithm with running time linear in the number of vertices [Mou91].\nAs examples, Kuperberg and Kuperberg construct the densest double lattice packing\nfor both regular pentagons and regular heptagons and show that these packings have\ndensities of (5\u2212\n\u221a\n5)/3 = 0.92131 . . . and 0.8926 . . . respectively. These are the current\nrecords and possibly the best general packings of the plane by regular pentagons and\nby regular heptagons.\nStarting around the turn of the century, a significant push, both theoretical and\ncomputational, arose to answer some of the most basic yet frustrating questions in\nthe theory of packing problems (for background on packing problems, see [BMP05],\n[CGSS99], [Gro63]). Along with the proof and formal verification of the Kepler con\u0002jecture [HAB+15], a number of other results on sphere packing in higher dimensions\nhave proved illuminating [CE03, Van11, Ven13]. For packings by congruent anisotropic\nbodies, sharp results are limited mostly to the plane, where the best packings of all\ncentrally-symmetric bodies are achieved by lattices [FT50], and a series of sparse results\nin higher dimensions [BK13].\n\u2217Santa Fe Institute, 1399 Hyde Park Road, Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA\n\u2020Graz University of Technology, Institute for Analysis and Computational Number Theory, Steyrergasse\n30/II, 8010 Graz, Austria\n1\narXiv:1509.02241v1 [math.MG] 8 Sep 2015\nAmong general convex bodies, the problem of finding the best packing of regular\npentagons serves as a toy model for harder problems, like finding the best packing of\nregular tetrahedra. However, the pentagon problem is still not a tractable one. Explicit\nupper bounds for the packing density of regular tetrahedra and octahedra are better\nthan the trivial unity upper bound by minuscule margins [GEK11]. A semidefinite\nprogramming (SDP) approach has been suggested by Oliveira and Vallentin to calculate\nimproved upper bounds [dOV13]. Though the SDP method has not yet yielded a\nnontrivial upper bound for packing of tetrahedra, it has been used to obtain an upper\nbound of 0.98103 on the density of regular pentagon packings. There remains a sizable\ngap between the highest density achieved for pentagon packings and this upper bound.\nA long-open problem, still wide open even in the plane, asks for the pessimal convex\nbody for packing, that is, the shape that has the lowest maximum packing density\n[BMP05, BK13, Kal14]. In the class of centrally-symmetric bodies in the plane, it is\nReinhardt [Rei33] who conjectured that a smoothed octagon is the minimizer. In the\nclass of general convex bodies in the plane, it is conjectured to be the regular heptagon\n[Kal15]. However, even though the maximum-density double lattice is conjectured to\nachieve the maximum packing density for the regular heptagon, no sharp upper bound\nhas been proved.\nThe regular pentagon and heptagon are cases of special interest, and we initially\nsought out to investigate whether their optimal double-lattice packing can be shown\nto be also optimal among a broader class of packings. We were able to show that\nthese packings are optimal at least in some neighborhood in the space of all packings.\nFurthermore, we discovered that our method can be generalized to all convex polygons.\nWe demonstrate that, while double lattices are in general not globally optimal, they\nare always at least locally optimal.\nTheorem. If a double lattice packing is an isolated local maximum for density among\ndouble lattices and is not one of a two exceptional cases, then it is a local maximum\nfor density among all packings.\nThe precise meanings of the terms used will be elucidated in the rest of the paper.\n2 Theoretical Preparations\n2.1 Local Optimality\nWe will look at packings of congruent copies of a body K. That is, every element of\nthe packing is given by \u03be(K), where \u03be \u2208 E(n) is an isometry of Euclidean space. It\nwill be convenient to assume that the reference body K is situated so that its interior\ncontains the origin. The isometry group E(n) of R\nn can be considered as a subgroup\nof SLn+1(R) that preserves the plane (x1, . . . , xn, 1) \u2208 R\nn+1. This identification gives\nus the Frobenius norm N(\u03be) = k\u03be \u2212 Idk for \u03be \u2208 E(n). Some useful inequalities for this\n2\nnorm that we will use are\nN(\u03be\n\u22121\n) \u2264 k\u03be\n\u22121\nkN(\u03be)\nN(\u03be\u03be0) \u2264 N(\u03be) + N(\u03be\n0\n) + N(\u03be)N(\u03be\n0\n)\nN(\u03c8\u03be\u03c8\u22121) \u2264 k\u03c8kk\u03c8\n\u22121\nkN(\u03be)\nk\u03be(0)k \u2264 N(\u03be) \u2264 k\u03be(0)k + 2n\n1/2\n.\n(1)\nDefinition 2.1. Let \u039e be a set of isometries. The limit\nd(\u039e) = limt\u2192\u221e\nvol B(0, t)\n|{\u03be \u2208 \u039e : \u03be(0) \u2208 B(0, t)}|, (2)\nif it exists, is its mean volume. The limits superior and inferior are its upper and\nlower mean volumes, denoted d(\u039e) and d(\u039e). We say \u039e is a (r, R)-set if the point set\n{\u03be(0) : \u03be \u2208 \u039e} has a packing radius at least r and a covering radius at most R.\nDefinition 2.2. Let K be a compact set with interior. We say that \u039e is admissible\nfor K if the interiors of \u03be(K) and \u03be\n0\n(K) are disjoint for any two distinct isometries\n\u03be, \u03be0 \u2208 \u039e. We say furthermore that \u039e is saturated if there is no \u03be \u2208 E(n) \\ \u039e such that\n\u039e \u222a {\u03be} is again admissible.\nThere are r(K) and R(K) such that when \u039e is admissible and saturated, then \u039e is\na (r(K), R(K))-set. As a consequence, such sets are countable.\nDefinition 2.3. Given two (r\n0\n, R0)-sets \u039e and \u039e\n0 of isometries, we define the premetric\n\u03b4R(\u039e, \u039e\n0\n) = inf\nbij.\nsup{N(\u03be\n\u22121\u03c8(\u03c80\n)\n\u22121\n\u03be\n0\n) :\n\u03be, \u03c8 \u2208 \u039e such that k\u03be(0) \u2212 \u03c8(0)k \u2264 2R or k\u03be\n0\n(0) \u2212 \u03c8\n0\n(0)k \u2264 2R}.\n(3)\nThe infimum is over all bijections (\u00b7)\n0\n: \u039e \u2192 \u039e\n0\n.\nWhen R \u2265 R0, \u03b4R(\u039e, \u039e\n0\n) = 0 if and only if \u03be = \u03c8\u03be0for some \u03c8 \u2208 E(n) and some\nbijection. Consider a body K. When R \u2265 R(K), \u03b4R(\u039e, \u039e\n0\n) induces a metric on the\nspace of admissible (r, R)-sets up to overall isometry, which includes the saturated sets\nas a subset.\nDefinition 2.4. We say an admissible and saturated set \u039e is strongly extreme for\nK if there is R > 0 and \u000f > 0, such that whenever \u03b4R(\u039e, \u039e\n0\n) < \u000f, then either \u039e\n0\nis\ninadmissible or d(\u039e0\n) \u2265 d(\u039e).\nWe stop to discuss why we define the topology in the space of packing arrangements\nin the way that we do. A naive choice of topology is the one given by the metric\n\u03b4H(\u039e, \u039e\n0\n) = inf\nbij.,\u03c8\u2208E(n)\nsup\n\u03be\u2208\u039e\nN(\u03be\n\u22121\u03c8\u03be0\n), (4)\nwhich we call the Hausdorff metric. However, under the Hausdorff topology the mean\nvolume is locally constant, and any packing is trivially locally optimal. For the topology\nto allow the mean volume to vary locally, it must allow elements that are increasingly far\n3\nFigure 1: Sample of the packing arrangement of cylinders with screws and screw holes\ndescribed in the text. The arrangement can be condensed, but in a way that is not\ncontinuous in the topology given by \u03b4R.\napart to move by the action of increasingly different isometries. One metric satisfying\nthis criterion, similar to the one used in Ref. [Kup00], is\ninf\nbij.,\u03c8\u2208E(n)\nsup\n\u03be\u2208\u039e\nmin(N(\u03be\n\u22121\u03c8\u03be0\n), 1/ min(k\u03be(0)k, k\u03be\n0\n(0)k)). (5)\nWhile suited for the discussions of recurrence there, here this metric will yield the\nresult that any packing that is not as dense as the densest packing of K is not even\nlocally optimal, since the density can be improved by a finite amount at arbitrarily\nsmall distance by completely changing the packing outside a ball of arbitrarily large\nradi...",

If the grid is big enough to hold that many 3\u00d73 blocks I know a solution exists.\n```\n3\\*floor(W/3) \u00d73\\*floor(H/3) &gt;&gt;= 9 \u00d7(n0+n1+n2+n3+n4+n5)\n```\nOn my input**every single region**satisfied exactly one of these two conditions \u2014there were no borderline cases that needed a real packing algorithm.\n## The almost-one-liner solution (Cypher 25)\n```\nCYPHER 25\n// Minimal area occupied by each shape (count of #)\nLET hash\\_per\\_shape = [\nshape IN split($data, &#x27;&#x27;\\\\n\\\\n&#x27;&#x27;)[..-1] |\nsize([c IN split(shape,&#x27;&#x27;) WHERE c = &#x27;#&#x27;])\n]\n// For each region check the two obvious bounds\nWITH [\nline IN split(split($data, &#x27;&#x27;\\\\n\\\\n&#x27;&#x27;)[-1], &#x27;&#x27;\\\\n&#x27;&#x27;) |\ntoInteger(split(line, &#x27;&#x27;x&#x27;&#x27;)[0]) \\* toInteger(split(split(line, &#x27;&#x27;:&#x27;&#x27;)[0],&#x27;&#x27;x&#x27;&#x27;)[1])\n&lt; reduce(acc=0,\nn IN [ix IN range(0, size(split(line, &#x27; &#x27;)[1..])-1) |\ntoInteger(split(line, &#x27;&#x27; &#x27;&#x27;)[1..][ix]) \\* hash\\_per\\_shape[ix]\n] | acc + n\n)\n] AS nok\\_t, // true = definitely too small\n[\nline IN split(split($data, &#x27;&#x27;\\\\n\\\\n&#x27;&#x27;)[-1], &#x27;&#x27;\\\\n&#x27;&#x27;) |\n3\\*(toInteger(split(line, &#x27;&#x27;x&#x27;&#x27;)[0])/3) \\*\n3\\*(toInteger(split(split(line, &#x27;&#x27;:&#x27;&#x27;)[0],&#x27;&#x27;x&#x27;&#x27;)[1])/3)\n&gt;&gt;= 9 \\* reduce(acc=0, n IN split(line, &#x27;&#x27; &#x27;&#x27;)[1..] | acc + toInteger(n))\n] AS ok\\_t // true = definitely fits (3\u00d73 packing)\nRETURN\nsize([b IN ok\\_t WHERE b]) AS part1, // regions that obviously fit\nsize([b IN nok\\_t WHERE b]) AS obviously\\_too\\_small,\nany(ix IN range(0,size(ok\\_t)-1) WHERE NOT (ok\\_t[ix] OR nok\\_t[ix])) AS edge\\_cases\\_needed\n```\nSo the answer is known, we didn\u2019t have to solve a single real packing instance. One star \u2b50.\ufe0f\ufe0f\ufe0f\n## Wrap-up\nSometimes the hardest-looking puzzles have the simplest solutions when you look at the numbers the right way. Today was a perfect reminder that before reaching for a full-blown exact cover / dancing-links solver, it\u2019s worth checking whether the problem is already decided by a couple of inequalities.\nMerry Christmas, second star for free \u2b50\u2b50and happy new year \u2014see you next Advent of Code! \ud83c\udf84[\nCypher\n](https://medium.com/tag/cypher?source=post_page-----5c942c4aad54---------------------------------------)\n[\nCypher 25\n](https://medium.com/tag/cypher-25?source=post_page-----5c942c4aad54---------------------------------------)\n[\nNeo4j\n](https://medium.com/tag/neo4j?source=post_page-----5c942c4aad54---------------------------------------)\n[\nAdvent Of Code\n](https://medium.com/tag/advent-of-code?source=post_page-----5c942c4aad54---------------------------------------)\n[\n![Pierre Halftermeyer](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/0*i0bg5sdP_zFfvt_7)\n](https://medium.com/@pierre.halftermeyer?source=post_page---post_author_info--5c942c4aad54---------------------------------------)\n[\n![Pierre Halftermeyer](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/0*i0bg5sdP_zFfvt_7)\n](https://medium.com/@pierre.halftermeyer?source=post_page---post_author_info--5c942c4aad54---------------------------------------)\n[## Written byPierre Halftermeyer\n](https://medium.com/@pierre.halftermeyer?source=post_page---post_author_info--5c942c4aad54---------------------------------------)\n[50 followers](https://medium.com/@pierre.halftermeyer...",
