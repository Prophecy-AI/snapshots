      "finding": "Optimal lattice packing of irregular polygons is the problem of arranging congruent copies of a non\u2011rectangular shape on a plane (or on a rectangular sheet) so that the repeating unit\u2011cell of a lattice contains the maximum possible area fraction of the polygons.  Because the polygons are not convex or regular, the geometry of the lattice vectors and the relative orientation of the pieces become decision variables, and the objective is to minimise waste or maximise density.  This formulation underlies many industrial nesting tasks where material cost is critical\u202f([sciencedirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0377221799001150);\u202f[dl.acm.org](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/336154.336214)).\n\nA variety of exact and heuristic techniques have been proposed.  Dyckhoff (2000) presented a constructive method that computes the optimal lattice parameters for a given oriented polygon by solving a nonlinear optimisation over the lattice basis vectors\u202f([sciencedirect](https://",
