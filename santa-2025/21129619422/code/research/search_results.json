      "text": "Packing identical irregular polygons into the smallest possible square is a classic two\u2011dimensional bin\u2011packing problem that is NP\u2011hard, so exact solutions are only feasible for very small instances.  In practice the most successful approaches combine a geometric preprocessing step (e.g., computing the **no\u2011fit polygon** to test overlaps) with either a provable approximation algorithm or a powerful mixed\u2011integer programming (MIP) model.  For convex polygons that are not allowed to rotate, recent work provides polynomial\u2011time **area\u2011minimisation** algorithms that sort the pieces by height and apply a refined shelf\u2011packing scheme, yielding the best known constant\u2011factor guarantees for translational packing\u202f([arXiv\u202f2023](https://export.arxiv.org/pdf/2308.08523v1.pdf)).

One particular category of these packing problems is\ntwo-dimensional packing, which is encountered in everyday scenarios like arranging items\non a shelf and in industrial applications such as cutting cookies from rolled-out dough\nor manufacturing sets of tiles from standard-sized panels made of wood, glass, or metal.\nAnother intriguing example involves cutting fabric pieces for clothing production. In this\ncase, the pieces often cannot be rotated freely, as they must adhere to a desired pattern\nin the final product, which is tailored of multiple elements. The widespread applicability\nof two-dimensional packing problems has led to a surge of interest in designing efficient\nalgorithms to address them. In this paper, we follow the line of research and study the\nproblem of packing convex polygons without rotations in various settings depending on the\ntype of containers used.\nPast research focusing on theoretical considerations of two-dimensional packings mainly\nconcentrates on the scenario when all objects are axis-parallel rectangles. In this paper, we\nwill discuss packing without rotations, in which only translations are permitted. There are\ntwo main classes of the problem depending on whether the size of the container is fixed and\nwe want to minimize the number of containers used or whether we want to minimize the\ncontainer\u2019s size with respect to some objective function.\nA seminal example of the first class is the Geometric Bin Packing problem in which\na number of unit size squared bins to pack is to be minimized. The problem is arguably\nthe most natural generalization of the regular (1D) Bin Packing to two dimensions, and\nits absolute approximability has been fully understood. Unless P = N P, the best possible\nefficient constant factor approximation is 2 [15], and such an algorithm is known [10].\nIn the second class, there are several variants to be considered. An example is the\nStrip Packing Problem which is concerned with packing objects into a strip of width\n1 and infinite height in such a way that the maximum of all the heights of the placed\nobjects is minimized. Like Geometric Bin Packing, Strip Packing generalizes (1D)\nBin Packing. The best known efficient constant factor approximation for Strip Packing\nhas approximation factor (5/3 + \u03f5) [9]. It is known that there can not exist a polynomial\ntime algorithm with an approximation ratio of (3/2 \u2212 \u03f5) for any \u03f5 > 0 unless P = N P, which\nfollows directly from the approximation hardness of (1D) Bin Packing. Both classes of\nproblems have been also considered in the asymptotic setting, see e.g. [11, 5, 12].\nIn younger time, there was also an increase of interest in cases where the objects in\nquestion are general convex polygons. Alt, de Berg and Knauer [2, 3] considered the problem\nof packing an instance consisting of a number of convex polygons of the form p \u2282 [0, 1]2into\na minimum area axis-parallel rectangular container. We refer to this problem as Polygon\nArea Minimization throughout this paper. In the special case where the instance consists\nof rectangles only, the problem is known to admit a PTAS [4]. They proved the existence of\nthe following efficient algorithm:\nA 23.78-approximation for Polygon Area Minimization.\nRecently, Aamand, Abrahamsen, Beretta and Kleist [1] showed that the algorithm of Alt,\nde Berg and Knauer can be leveraged to obtain also efficient approximation algorithms of\nfurther problems:\nA 7-approximation for Polygon Perimeter Minimization.\nA 51-approximation for Polygon Strip Packing.\nAn 11-approximation for Polygon Bin Packing for polygons with diameter at most 1\n10 .\nA. Kurpisz and S. Suter 3\n1.1 Our results\nThe results of Alt, de Berg and Knauer [2, 3] and Aamand et al. [1] are heavily based on\nso-called shelf packing algorithms. In shelf packing algorithms, the objects are first placed\non the shelves, possibly ordered by height, which are later stacked on one another to build\na final solution. Compared to axis-parallel rectangles, the main challenge in designing an\napproximation algorithm for polygon packing problems is that objects cannot be sorted by\nheight and orientation simultaneously. As a result, the algorithm and its analysis in [2, 3]\nhave such a large approximation guarantee. In this paper, we provide new insight into how\nshelf packing algorithms should be applied to polygon packing problems. We introduce a\nsequence of transformations of the objects that allow us first to sort them by height and later\nby orientation to build a solution of a much better approximation guarantee. More precisely,\nwe design polynomial-time algorithms with the following factors:\nA 9.45-approximation for Polygon Area Minimization.\nUsing this algorithm as a subroutine, we build upon the methods from Aamand et al. [1] to\nobtain the following efficient approximation algorithms:\nA (3.75 + \u03f5)-approximation for Polygon Perimeter Minimization.\nA 21.89-approximation for Polygon Strip Packing.\nA 5.09-approximation for Polygon Bin Packing for polygons which have their diameter\nbounded by 1\n10 .\nThe results are proved in Sections 4, 5, 6, and 7 respectively. Furthermore, in Section 8\nwe show the following results, which make progress towards solving an open question of a\nO(1)-approximation algorithm for Polygon Bin Packing for arbitrary polygons.\nThere is an efficient O(\n1\n\u03b4\n)-approximation algorithm for Polygon Bin Packing for\ninstances where each polygon has width or height at most 1 \u2212 \u03b4.\nThere is an efficient O(1)-approximation algorithm for Polygon Bin Packing for\ninstances with the property that all polygons share a spine (up to translation) with height\nat least 3\n4\n.\n2 Preliminaries\nWe start out considerations by recalling a classical and well-known problem in theoretical\ncomputer science, the Bin Packing problem: Given a list of numbers s1, . . . , sn \u2208 (0, 1] \u2229 Q,\nrepresenting the sizes of n objects, the goal is to find the minimum number of bins of size 1,\nso that we can pac...",

In this paper we make a systematic study of the problem and develop an exact Branch &amp; Bound Algorithm. The initial existing mixed integer formulations are reviewed, tested and used as a starting point to develop a new and more efficient formulation. We also study several branching strategies, lower bounds and procedures for fixing variables, reducing the size of the problem to be solved at each node. An extensive computational study allows us first to determine the best strategies to be used in the Branch &amp; Bound Algorithm and then to explore its performance and limits. The results show that the algorithm is able to solve instances of up to 16 pieces to[optimality](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/optimality).\n## Introduction\nNesting problems are two-dimensional cutting and packing problems involving irregular shapes. These problems arise in a wide variety of industries like garment manufacturing, sheet metal cutting, furniture making and shoe manufacturing. The wide range of applications implies many different variants of the problem. The placement areas into which the pieces have to be packed or cut can be rectangular, as in the case of materials provided in rolls, or can have irregular shapes, as in the case of leather hides for making shoes. This placement area can have a uniform quality or different qualities depending on the region, including sometimes defective parts that cannot be used for pieces. The pieces to be cut can be described as polygons, convex or not, or can include curved edges. Depending on the real application, the pieces can be rotated freely, at specific angles only (90\u00b0, 180\u00b0, \u2026), or not rotated at all. There may also be different objectives, usually involving the minimization of the area required for cutting the pieces or the maximization of the value of the pieces cut. Using the typology proposed by W\u00e4scher et al. (2007), nesting problems, in general, are open-dimension problems with irregular pieces.\nIn this paper we consider a nesting problem in which we have to arrange a set of two-dimensional irregular shapes without overlapping in a rectangular stock sheet of a fixed width, where the objective is to minimize the required length. We will consider the pieces to be described as polygons, not necessarily convex, which cannot be rotated.\nThe main difficulty of nesting problems is to ensure that the pieces have a non-overlapping configuration. This question has been studied extensively in recent years and there are several approaches which determine when two polygons overlap. Bennell and Oliveira (2008) give a tutorial on the different approaches which study the geometry of nesting problems. The problem is NP-complete and as a result solution methodologies predominantly utilize heuristics.\n*Pixel/Raster*methods transform the continuous stock sheet into a discrete grid represented by a matrix, and the position of each piece adds a given coded value to each matrix element. Identifying possible overlapping comes down to checking the matrix values. There are three known codification schemes the first one proposed by Segenreich and Braga (1986), the second one by Oliveira and Ferreira (1993), and the last one by Babu and Babu (2001).\nWhen pieces are represented (or approximated) using polygons, there are tests for edge intersection and for point inclusion that can be used for identifying overlapping (Konopasek, 1981, Ferreira et al., 1998). The most widely used tool for checking whether two polygons overlap is the No-Fit Polygon (NFP). It can be used, along with the vector difference of the position of the two polygons, to determine whether these polygons overlap, touch or are separated, by conducting a simple test to identify whether the resulting vector is inside the NFP. There are three approaches to generating the NFP the orbiting algorithm by Mahadevan (1984), improved by Burke et al. (2007); the Minkowski sums used by Milenkovic et al. (1991) and Bennell and Dowsland (2001); and the decomposition into star-shaped polygons (Daniels et al., 1994) or convex polygons (Watson and Tobias, 1999, Agarwal et al., 2002).\nA more general tool that generalizes the NFP is the*Phi-function*. Its purpose is to represent all the mutual positions of two polygons. The*Phi-functions*for cutting and packing were conceived of and applied by Stoyan et al., 2001, Stoyan et al., 2004, Scheithauer et al. (2005). Bennell et al. (2010) provide a good explanation of how the*Phi-functions*can be built, as well as some applications for them.\nMany different heuristic and metaheuristic approaches have been proposed for solving nesting problems. Simple heuristic rules are used for building a solution step by step, placing one piece at a time, using different placement procedures and different piece sequences. Metaheuristic procedures are used for working with complete solutions and modifying them iterat...",

It differs from other 2-D C&P problems in the irregular shape of the pieces. This paper proposes a new mixed-integer model in which binary decision variables are associated with each discrete point of the board (a dot) and with each piece type. It is much more flexible than previously proposed formulations and solves to [optimality](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/optimality) larger instances of the nesting problem, at the cost of having its precision dependent on board [discretization](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/discretization). To date no results have been published concerning optimal solutions for nesting problems with more than 7 pieces. We ran computational experiments on 45 problem instances with the new model, solving to [optimality](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/optimality) 34 instances with a total number of pieces ranging from 16 to 56, depending on the number of piece types, grid resolution and the size of the board. A strong advantage of the model is its insensitivity to piece and board geometry, making it easy to extend to more complex problems such as non-convex boards, possibly with defects. Additionally, the number of binary variables does not depend on the total number of pieces but on the number of piece types, making the model particularly suitable for problems with few piece types. The discrete nature of the model requires a trade-off between grid resolution and problem size, as the number of binary variables grows with the square of the selected grid resolution and with board size.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe nesting problem, also known as irregular packing problem, belongs to the more generic class of cutting and packing (C&P) problems. As in all C&P problems, one or more big objects have to be divided into smaller items or pieces so that (1) unused regions of the big object, usually designated as waste, are minimized \u2014 input minimization problems, according to W\u00e4scher typology, or (2) the value of the pieces cut from the big object is maximized \u2014 output maximization problem, according to the same typology (W\u00e4scher et al., 2007). The problem addressed in this paper is a two-dimensional (2D) C&P problem, i.e. only two of the dimensions of the objects are relevant, as the third dimension is equal for all objects and pieces. Moreover, the goal is to minimize the used length of a big rectangular object (the board), of unbound length, making it a 2D Open Dimension Problem. It is often called irregular strip packing.\n\nThe nesting problem differs from other 2D C&P problems in the irregular shape of the pieces. Irregular shapes are those that involve non-trivial handling of the geometry (Bennell and Oliveira, 2008). This leaves out of our scope rectangles and circles, in which the evaluation of the distance between two pieces can be performed by simple coordinate comparison. The most common representation, in the literature, for the irregular shape of a piece is the polygon, and although geometric operations with polygons are not trivial, we will also assume that all pieces are represented by polygons. No additional constraints are imposed on the polygon characteristics, so we deal with the harder to tackle class of non-convex polygons.\n\nNesting problems are not only a scientific challenge, as they add the geometry handling complexity to the combinatorial optimization nature of C&P problems, but they are also most relevant in real-world applications. Indeed they arise in a wide variety of industrial production processes, including textile, garment, metalware, furniture and shoe industries. In all cases saving raw-materials represents an important contribution to the economic and environmental performance of companies.\n\nNesting problems have been addressed by many authors. However, given the problem complexity, to the best of the authors' knowledge there is no published exact mathematical programming based method to solve it, reaching guaranteed optimal solutions for the problem. Although a thorough tutorial on the nesting problem resolution is available (Bennell and Oliveira, 2009), the approaches that more closely relate to the work reported in this paper will be briefly highlighted.\n\nNot surprisingly, heuristic and metaheuristic algorithms are the basis of the overwhelming majority of the published approaches. Among these, the most recent approaches with best performance are from Gomes and Oliveira (2006), Egeblad et al. (2007), Imamichi et al. (2009), Bennell and Song (2010), and Leung et al. (2012). A pioneering work on the exact resolution of non-convex nesting problems (Carravilla et al., 2003) used constraint logic programming as resolution method and has solved to optimality problems with up to 7 pieces. All the other approaches deal with approximations or simpler forms of the nesting problem.\n\nThe first approximation is geometric and consists in considering only rectangular shapes. The first exact solution procedure for the constrained (i.e. with an upper bound on the number of pieces of each type to cut or pack) 2D non-guillotine rectangular problem was proposed by Beasley (1985) and was based on a binary integer programming formulation. The author assumes that all rectangle's lengths and widths are integers, leading to a discrete model, as pieces can only be placed on a set of discrete points of the board. More recent work on exact approaches to the rectangular strip packing p...",

A particular case of the nesting problem occurs when congruent copies of one single shape have to fill, as much as possible, a limited sheet. Traditional approaches to the nesting problem have difficulty to tackle with high number of pieces to place. Additionally, if the orientation of the given shape is not a constraint, the general nesting approaches are not particularly successful. This problem arises in practice in several industrial contexts such as footwear, metalware and furniture. A possible approach is the periodic placement of the shapes, in a lattice way. In this paper, we propose three heuristic approaches to solve this particular case of nesting problems. Experimental results are compared with published results in literature and additional results obtained from new instances are also provided.\n## Introduction\nNesting has been widely studied (Dowsland and Dowsland, 1992), as it is a common problem in several industrial production processes (textile, garment, footwear, metalware, furniture, etc.). Most of the published papers impose orientation constraints: the shape can only be rotated a predetermined number of fixed angles (the most common is 180\u00b0 and, less commonly, 90\u00b0) or it cannot be rotated at all. However, in certain particular cases, orientation constraints do not arise. Additionally, some industries frequently need to cut big quantities of each type of shape. In these two situations, the periodic packing of the shapes (lattice packing) proved to be a very competitive approach, because:\n* \u2013good cutting patterns, with very small waste, can be obtained;\n* \u2013the automatic cutting process is more efficient when a periodic placement is considered;\n* \u2013reduced computational time (when compared with general nesting approaches, where each piece has to be treated individually), which allows to tackle problems of greater dimension.\nIn this section, we start by describing the problem and refer to related works in a brief review. In Section 2, we point out the geometric considerations necessary to understand this work. Section 3 describes the underlying rules and criteria used to build the three heuristic approaches, which are proposed in the fourth section. In Section 5, the instances used to evaluate the quality of the proposed approaches are defined and the results obtained with all the three heuristics are presented and compared. Finally, in the last section, we draw conclusions and make some comments about future work.\nThe periodic placement of congruent copies of one shape can be found in literature under the keywords \u201cperiodic packing\u201d, \u201cregular packing\u201d or \u201clattice packing\u201d. The lattice packing may be defined over an infinite plane or a limited sheet. If it is the plane, the main objective is to regularly place the shapes so that the density obtained is maximised. When lattice packing on a limited stock sheet, the goal is to maximise the percentage of stock sheet utilisation, which is equivalent to maximise the number of shapes placed inside the plate. As will be shown later, these two \u201capparently\u201d similar objectives are not quite equivalent. However, the definition of a lattice is identical in the two situations. A lattice is generated by two linearly independent vectors,*v*0and*v*1, whose linear combinations will produce a grid that guarantees that pieces do not overlap. The shapes are located in each node of the grid.\nThe problem we propose to solve does not considerer orientation constraints, so, any rotation of the given shape can be allowed. However, after a specific orientation is chosen, all the shapes must follow the same orientation (*Single-Lattice*\u2013 Fig. 1a) or be alternately rotated 180\u00b0 (*Double-Lattice*\u2013 Fig. 1b). According to the typology by W\u00e4scher et al. (2007), the problem described in this paper is a 2-dimensional irregular IIPP (Identical Item Packing Problem).\nThe orientation of the shapes is not relevant when lattice packing on the plane, as maximum density remains unchanged. However, when stock sheet borders need to be taken into account, the orientation of the shapes may be extremely important as will be shown in the following sections.\nIn this work, we propose to solve the problem of Periodic Packing of Irregular Shapes (PPIS) on a limited stock sheet (a rectangle) by heuristic methods.\nThere are references in the literature to the Lattice Packing Problem since the fifties, the first results concerning only theoretical aspects of the lattice packing of a single convex polygon on the plane (Rogers, 1951). However, only a few publications during the next 30 years can be found, and some of them are just marginally related to lattice packing. O\u2019Rourke et al. (1986) have considered the problem of finding minimal enclosing triangles and Dori and Ben Bassat (1983) have dealt with the problem of finding minimal enclosing convex polygons with fewer sides. Those approaches can be seen as a pre-processing to lattice packing, as regular convex polygons can be easily packed than the original ones.\nBetween 1990 and 2000, essentially theoretical results on lattice lacking have been published, mostly considering unlimited sheets and convex shapes (Mount and Silverman, 1990, Mount, 1991, Kuperberg and Kuperberg, 1990, Stoyan and Patsuk, 2000).\nMore recently, results concerning real industrial problems, with limited sheets, irregular shapes and no orientation constraints, have been published. Prasad et al. (1995) describe a nesting problem of irregular shaped metal blanks and propose a heuristic search, considering the variation in the or...",

This cutting process is found in many industrial applications such as sheet metal processes, home-textile, garment, wood, leather and paper industries. An approach is proposed to solve this problem, which depends on the concept of the difference between the area of a collection of polygons and the area of their convex hull. The polygon assignment inside the stock is subjected to feasibility tests to avoid overlapping, namely, angle test, bound test, point inclusion and polygon intersection test. An iterative scheme is used to generate different polygon placements while optimizing the objective function. Computer software is developed to solve and optimize the problem under consideration. Few examples are conducted for different combinations of convex, non-convex items and stocks. Well-known benchmark problems from the literature are tested and compared with our approach. The results of our algorithm have an interesting computational time and can compete with the results of previous work in some particular problems. The computational performance of the developed software indicates the efficiency of the algorithm for solving 2-D irregular cutting of non-convex polygons out of non-convex stock.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe process of packing a given set of 2-dimensional planner items into a bin of minimal area is an intricate nesting problem that has been known in many applications. These applications arise in many industries such as clothing and textile, steel construction, wood, glass, leather and paper industries. In fact, a great deal of literature is found on such a problem \\[1\\], \\[2\\], \\[3\\].\n\nNesting problems are considered NP-hard due to their difficulty where no exact methods have been reported in the literature, instead, only heuristic procedures have been developed \\[4\\], \\[5\\], \\[22\\], \\[28\\], \\[29\\]. The heuristic methods presented in the literature deal mostly with class of problems in which the objective is to minimize the length of the master surface used. Such approaches do not always suite problems where limited master surface is used such as hides or sheet metals. Packing usually suites the division of problems in which stock material comes in rolls. However, for the case when limited length or bounded stocks are used, bin packing will result in degradation in the utilization of material. Instead, the idea of knapsack problem can be put into practice to serve such purpose. The interested reader can come across appealing and precise surveys about nesting \\[6\\], \\[12\\].\n\nBin packing problem can be seen as a special case of the cutting stock problem. In fact, when the number of bins is restricted to one and each item is characterized by both area and value, the problem of maximizing the value of items that can fit in the bin is known as the knapsack problem which characterizes our work in this paper.\n\nGenerally in most nesting problems, two directions are followed; the first deals with nesting strategies and their evaluation criteria, such as minimizing area, minimizing length, minimizing overlap and the evaluation criteria, i.e., waste, overlap, and distance \\[8\\], \\[9\\]. The second research direction addresses the search methods, that is, the order of item packing. For instance, Gomes and Oliveira \\[10\\] presented a search technique based on a 2-exchange neighborhood generation mechanism, simulated annealing \\[11\\], hill climbing \\[9\\], nesting with defects \\[5\\], etc.\n\nQuite a few studies were presented to address the problem of nesting irregular shapes \\[7\\], \\[13\\], \\[14\\]. Most of this research implemented the idea of No Fit Polygon (NFP) to detect potential overlap between polygons \\[15\\]. As a matter of fact, the computational time required to detect overlap has been significantly reduced with the implementation of NFP algorithms which contribute most to the packing computational time. The introduction of NFPs has motivated most of the recent work in nesting problems.\n\nRemarkable breakthroughs in algorithms for nesting problems have been achieved in recent years. Compared to previous studies, these solutions have noticeably enhanced the effect and speed of nesting results. Remarkable methods were presented by Crispin et al. \\[16\\], Burke et al. \\[9\\], Gomes and Oliveira \\[11\\], Egeblad et al. \\[17\\], Lee et al. \\[18\\], Imamichi et al. \\[19\\], Sato et al. \\[20\\] and Alves et al. \\[21\\]. In particular, Crispin et al. \\[16\\] described two genetic algorithms to solve the LNP arising in the shoe manufacturing industry based on different coding methodologies. The problem tackled by Crispin took directionality constraints into account where imposing specific directions for the pieces in given regions of the hides reduces the solution space.\n\nThe heuristic developed by Egeblad et al. \\[17\\] is based on a simple local search plan in which the neighborhood is simply any vertical or horizontal translation of a given polygon from its present location. A guided local search is applied to escape local minima. Lee et al. \\[18\\] describes a heuristic for placing irregular shapes on multiple sheets. They use a simple nesting rule to place the shapes one after another. Such placement is improved later by movement and rotation operations. In \\[18\\], only one single experiment with one instance is presented for nesting irregular shapes.

Although the concept was first described in 1966, it was not until the early 90s that the general trend of research moved away from direct trigonometry to favour the nofit polygon. Since then, the ability to calculate the nofit polygon has practically become a pre-requisite for researching irregular packing problems. However, realization of this concept in the form of a robust algorithm is a highly challenging task with few instructive approaches published. In this paper, a procedure using the [mathematical concept](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/mathematical-concept) of Minkowski sums for the calculation of the nofit polygon is presented. The described procedure is more robust than other approaches using Minkowski sum knowledge and includes details of the removal of internal edges to find holes, slits and lock and key positions. The procedure is tested on benchmark data sets and gives examples of complicated cases.\n\n### Scope and purpose\n\nCutting and packing problems involving irregular shapes feature in a wide variety of manufacturing processes. Automated solution techniques that can generate packing arrangements more efficiently than current technology that employs user intervention, must be able to handle the complex geometry that arises from these problems. The nofit polygon has been demonstrated to be an effective tool in providing efficient handling of the geometric characteristics of these problems. The paper presents a new algorithmic procedure for deriving this tool.\n\n## Introduction\n\nCutting and packing problems involving irregular shapes are common in a variety of manufacturing processes. They occur whenever a piece of irregular shape is to be cut from a sheet of stock material. Examples include dye-cutting in the engineering sector, parts nesting for shipbuilding, marker layout in the garment industry, and leather cutting for shoes, furniture and other goods. The paper specifically addresses the geometric calculations required for tackling these problems. Here we consider that shapes are irregular if they are; polygonal, i.e no arcs; simple, i.e. non-self-intersecting; and non-rectangular. Even when all the components are rectangular the problem of finding layouts that minimize waste is known to be NP-hard. Where irregular components are involved an extra dimension of complexity is generated by the geometry.\n\nThe precise requirements of a good layout will differ from industry to industry and this has led to a variety of algorithmic approaches. In spite of their differences, all the methods have a common requirement in which they need to be able to identify whether a layout is feasible or not, i.e. do any of the pieces overlap. Early research handled this problem in a number of ways. Adamowicz and Albano \\[1\\] chose to nest pieces into simpler shapes where the geometry can be more easily calculated. If the shapes are used directly then the intersection of pieces can be handled by direct trigonometric approaches such as the D function \\[2\\], \\[3\\]. Alternatively the stock sheet and the pieces can be approximated as grid squares, often referred to as the raster method. Hence, if a piece occupies, fully or partially, a grid square it is coded as occupied \\[4\\], \\[5\\].\n\nAlthough all these approaches have merit, it is widely recognized that the nofit polygon (NFP) is more efficient, provided you have a robust and efficient NFP generator, and has become the principle approach for handling the geometry in nesting problems. Unfortunately, some researchers believe that despite the value of this tool, its introduction may have stifled research into this variant of packing problems. W\u00e4scher et al. \\[6\\] report that there have been only 21 publications in irregular problems in the last 10 years. Researchers attribute this to the fact that the realization of the NFP as a robust algorithm is, in itself, a highly challenging task. Those considering embarking on research into irregular shaped packing may be discouraged by the significant investment of time required in first developing an NFP generator. Hence, it is essential that robust and easily realizable algorithms are available in order to facilitate new interest into this important problem.\n\nThe primary purpose of this paper is to introduce a new procedure for calculating the NFP. The method is developed from the theory of Minkowski sums \\[7\\] and builds on the principles proposed by Ghosh \\[8\\], \\[9\\] and by Bennell et al. \\[10\\]. Further, the paper includes an algorithmic procedure for eliciting the true boundary of the NFP, including holes, slits and exact fits. It should be noted that the polygons considered in this paper are two-dimensional and restricted to translational motion i.e. rotations are not considered. The next section outlines the most commonly cited approaches for calculating the NFP and points out their positive features and disadvantages. Section 3 reviews in more detail the Minkowski sum approach. This is followed by a description of our new procedure based on Minkowski sums. Section 5, develops our approach for removing redundant internal points and therefore identifying the true boundary. In both cases the full algorithmic steps are provided. Finally, we develop some theoretical and empirical analysis of the approach to demonstrate its robustness with respect to being capable of handling all combinations of simple polygons.\n\n## Section snippets\n\n## Documented approaches for generating the nofit polygon\n\nThe NFP is a combination of the properties of two component polygons that, as a result, represents all the relative positions of the two polygons in which they either touch or overlap. It is well documented that the NFP can reduce the complexity of detecting overlap between two pieces from O(nm+n+m), where n and m are the number of edges in each polygon, obtained from direct trigonometry, to a simple point inclusion test of O(k), where k is the number of edges in the NFP.
