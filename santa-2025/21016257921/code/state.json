      "finding": "Simulated\u2011annealing (SA) works best for 2\u2011D polygon packing when the temperature schedule and the neighbourhood moves are tuned to the geometry of the pieces.  In the most successful studies the algorithm starts with a **high initial temperature** that yields an acceptance probability of about\u202f80\u202f% for random translation\u2011or\u2011rotation moves; this temperature is estimated by sampling a few hundred random displacements and choosing the value that gives the desired acceptance rate\u202f([Computers\u202f&\u202fMathematics\u202fwith\u202fApplications](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0898122194900779)).  A **geometric (exponential) cooling schedule** is then applied, typically\u202f\\(T_{k+1}=\u03b1T_k\\) with\u202f\\(\u03b1\u2208[0.80,0.95]\\).  The inner loop is run for a number of iterations proportional to the number of polygons (e.g.,\u202f10\u202f\u00d7\u202fN\u202fmoves per temperature) and the process stops when the temperature falls below a preset threshold or no improvement is observed for several successive temperatures\u202f([IFAC\u202fProceedings\u202f200",
