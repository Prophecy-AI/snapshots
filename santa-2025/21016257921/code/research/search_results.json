      "text": "Minimizing the bounding\u2011box of a set of 2\u2011D polygons is usually tackled by first reducing each polygon to a tight oriented rectangle and then arranging those rectangles with algorithms that exploit geometric ordering and space\u2011saving heuristics.  The tightest oriented rectangle for a single polygon can be obtained in linear time after computing its convex hull: the hull is fed to the **Rotating Calipers** method, which evaluates all edge directions of the hull and selects the orientation that yields the smallest area (the so\u2011called oriented minimum bounding box, OMBB)\u202f([geidav.wordpress.com](https://geidav.wordpress.com/2014/01/23/computing-oriented-minimum-bounding-boxes-in-2d)).

A link will be provided\nin a future version of this document.\narXiv:2308.08523v1 [cs.CG] 16 Aug 2023\n2 Improved Approximations for Translational Packing of Convex Polygons\n1 Introduction\nMany real-life situations require us to make decisions about optimally packing a collection\nof objects into a specific container. One particular category of these packing problems is\ntwo-dimensional packing, which is encountered in everyday scenarios like arranging items\non a shelf and in industrial applications such as cutting cookies from rolled-out dough\nor manufacturing sets of tiles from standard-sized panels made of wood, glass, or metal.\nAnother intriguing example involves cutting fabric pieces for clothing production. In this\ncase, the pieces often cannot be rotated freely, as they must adhere to a desired pattern\nin the final product, which is tailored of multiple elements. The widespread applicability\nof two-dimensional packing problems has led to a surge of interest in designing efficient\nalgorithms to address them. In this paper, we follow the line of research and study the\nproblem of packing convex polygons without rotations in various settings depending on the\ntype of containers used.\nPast research focusing on theoretical considerations of two-dimensional packings mainly\nconcentrates on the scenario when all objects are axis-parallel rectangles. In this paper, we\nwill discuss packing without rotations, in which only translations are permitted. There are\ntwo main classes of the problem depending on whether the size of the container is fixed and\nwe want to minimize the number of containers used or whether we want to minimize the\ncontainer\u2019s size with respect to some objective function.\nA seminal example of the first class is the Geometric Bin Packing problem in which\na number of unit size squared bins to pack is to be minimized. The problem is arguably\nthe most natural generalization of the regular (1D) Bin Packing to two dimensions, and\nits absolute approximability has been fully understood. Unless P = N P, the best possible\nefficient constant factor approximation is 2 [15], and such an algorithm is known [10].\nIn the second class, there are several variants to be considered. An example is the\nStrip Packing Problem which is concerned with packing objects into a strip of width\n1 and infinite height in such a way that the maximum of all the heights of the placed\nobjects is minimized. Like Geometric Bin Packing, Strip Packing generalizes (1D)\nBin Packing. The best known efficient constant factor approximation for Strip Packing\nhas approximation factor (5/3 + \u03f5) [9]. It is known that there can not exist a polynomial\ntime algorithm with an approximation ratio of (3/2 \u2212 \u03f5) for any \u03f5 > 0 unless P = N P, which\nfollows directly from the approximation hardness of (1D) Bin Packing. Both classes of\nproblems have been also considered in the asymptotic setting, see e.g. [11, 5, 12].\nIn younger time, there was also an increase of interest in cases where the objects in\nquestion are general convex polygons. Alt, de Berg and Knauer [2, 3] considered the problem\nof packing an instance consisting of a number of convex polygons of the form p \u2282 [0, 1]2into\na minimum area axis-parallel rectangular container. We refer to this problem as Polygon\nArea Minimization throughout this paper. In the special case where the instance consists\nof rectangles only, the problem is known to admit a PTAS [4]. They proved the existence of\nthe following efficient algorithm:\nA 23.78-approximation for Polygon Area Minimization.\nRecently, Aamand, Abrahamsen, Beretta and Kleist [1] showed that the algorithm of Alt,\nde Berg and Knauer can be leveraged to obtain also efficient approximation algorithms of\nfurther problems:\nA 7-approximation for Polygon Perimeter Minimization.\nA 51-approximation for Polygon Strip Packing.\nAn 11-approximation for Polygon Bin Packing for polygons with diameter at most 1\n10 .\nA. Kurpisz and S. Suter 3\n1.1 Our results\nThe results of Alt, de Berg and Knauer [2, 3] and Aamand et al. [1] are heavily based on\nso-called shelf packing algorithms. In shelf packing algorithms, the objects are first placed\non the shelves, possibly ordered by height, which are later stacked on one another to build\na final solution. Compared to axis-parallel rectangles, the main challenge in designing an\napproximation algorithm for polygon packing problems is that objects cannot be sorted by\nheight and orientation simultaneously. As a result, the algorithm and its analysis in [2, 3]\nhave such a large approximation guarantee. In this paper, we provide new insight into how\nshelf packing algorithms should be applied to polygon packing problems. We introduce a\nsequence of transformations of the objects that allow us first to sort them by height and later\nby orientation to build a solution of a much better approximation guarantee. More precisely,\nwe design polynomial-time algorithms with the following factors:\nA 9.45-approximation for Polygon Area Minimization.\nUsing this algorithm as a subroutine, we build upon the methods from Aamand et al. [1] to\nobtain the following efficient approximation algorithms:\nA (3.75 + \u03f5)-approximation for Polygon Perimeter Minimization.\nA 21.89-approximation for Polygon Strip Packing.\nA 5.09-approximation for Polygon Bin Packing for polygons which have their diameter\nbounded by 1\n10 .\nThe results are proved in Sections 4, 5, 6, and 7 respectively. Furthermore, in Section 8\nwe show the following results, which make progress towards solving an open question of a\nO(1)-approximation algorithm for Polygon Bin Packing for arbitrary polygons.\nThere is an efficient O(\n1\n\u03b4\n)-approximation algorithm for Polygon Bin Packing for\ninstances where each polygon has width or height at most 1 \u2212 \u03b4.\nThere is an efficient O(1)-approximation algorithm for Polygon Bin Packing for\ninstances with the property that all polygons share a spine (up to translation) with height\nat least 3\n4\n.\n2 Preliminaries\nWe start out considerations by recalling a classical and well-known problem in theoretical\ncomputer science, the Bin Packing problem: Given a list of numbers s1, . . . , sn \u2208 (0, 1] \u2229 Q,\nrepresenting the sizes of n objects, the goal is to find the minimum number of bins of size 1,\nso that we can pac...",

      "title": "Computing oriented minimum bounding boxes in 2D",
      "text": "# Introduction\n\n_Oriented bounding boxes_ are an important tool for visibility testing and collision detection in computer graphics. In this post I want to talk about how to compute the oriented _minimum_ bounding box (OMBB) of an arbitrary polygon in two dimensions. As a polygon just enforces an ordering on a set of points (vertices), everything described in the following equally applies to simple point sets. _Minimum_ in this context refers to the area of the bounding box. A minimum oriented bounding box is also known as _smallest-area enclosing rectangle_. However, I will stick to the former term throughout this article as it is more frequently used in the computer graphics world.\n\nThe easiest way of computing a bounding box for a polygon is to determine the minimum and maximum ![x](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&bg=ffffff&fg=777777&s=0&c=20201002&zoom=4.5)\u2013 and ![y](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&bg=ffffff&fg=777777&s=0&c=20201002&zoom=4.5)\u2013 coordinates of its vertices. Such an _axis aligned bounding box_ (AABB) can be computed trivially but it\u2019s in most cases significantly bigger than the polygon\u2019s OMBB. Finding the OMBB requires some more work as the bounding box\u2019 area must be minimized, constrained by the location of the polygon\u2019s vertices. Look at the following figure for an illustration (AABB in blue, OMBB in red).\n\n![AABB vs OMBB](https://geidav.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/aabb_vs_ombb.png?w=820)\n\nThe technique for computing OMBBs presented in the following consists of two detached steps. In the first step the _convex hull_ of the input polygon is computed. If the polygon is convex this step can be omitted because a convex polygon is equal to its convex hull. In the second step the _Rotating Calipers_ method is employed on the convex hull to compute the resulting OMBB. I will focus on the Rotating Calipers method because it\u2019s not very widely known in comparison to the numerous ways of computing convex hulls.\n\n# Convex hulls\n\nIn less mathematical but more illustrative terms the _convex hull_ of a set of ![n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=777777&s=0&c=20201002&zoom=4.5) points can be described as the closed polygonal chain of all outer points of the set, which entirely encloses all set elements. You can picture it as the shape of a rubber band stretched around all set elements. The convex hull of a set of two-dimensional points can be efficiently computed in ![O(n\\log n)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%28n%5Clog+n%29&bg=ffffff&fg=777777&s=0&c=20201002&zoom=4.5). In the figure below the convex hull of the vertices of a concave polygon is depicted.\n\n![Convex hull of vertices of concave polygon](https://geidav.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/convex_hull2.png?w=820)\n\nThere are numerous algorithms for computing convex hulls: _Quick Hull_, _Gift Wrapping_ (also known as _Jarvis March_), _Graham\u2019s Algorithm_ and some more. I\u2019ve chosen the Gift Wrapping algorithm for my implementation because it\u2019s easy to implement and provides good performance in case ![n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=777777&s=0&c=20201002&zoom=4.5) is small or the polygon\u2019s convex hull contains only a few vertices. The runtime complexity is ![O(nh)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%28nh%29&bg=ffffff&fg=777777&s=0&c=20201002&zoom=4.5), where ![h](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=h&bg=ffffff&fg=777777&s=0&c=20201002&zoom=4.5) is the number of vertices in the convex hull. In the general case Gift Wrapping is outperformed by other algorithms. Especially, when all points are part of the convex hull. In that case the complexity degrades to ![O(n^2)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%28n%5E2%29&bg=ffffff&fg=777777&s=0&c=20201002&zoom=4.5).\n\nAs there are many good articles on the Gift Wrapping algorithm available online, I won\u2019t describe it another time here. Instead I want to focus on the lesser-known Rotating Calipers method for computing OMBBs. However, take care that your convex hull algorithm correctly handles collinear points. If multiple points lie on a convex hull edge, only the spanning points should end up in the convex hull.\n\n# Rotating Calipers\n\n_Rotating Calipers_ is a versatile method for solving a number of problems from the field of computational geometry. It resembles the idea of rotating a dynamically adjustable caliper around the outside of a polygon\u2019s convex hull. Originally, this method was invented to compute the diameter of convex polygons. Beyond that, it can be used to compute OMBBs, the minimum and maximum distance between two convex polygons, the intersection of convex polygons and many things more.\n\nThe idea of using the Rotating Calipers method for computing OMBBs is based on the following theorem, establishing a connection between the input polygon\u2019s convex hull and the orientation of the resulting OMBB. The theorem was proven in 1975 by Freeman and Shapira[1](https://geidav.wordpress.com/2014/01/23/computing-oriented-minimum-bounding-boxes-in-2d/#fn-1057-FreemanShapira1975):\n\n> The smallest-area enclosing rectangle of a polygon has a side collinear with one of the edges of its convex hull.\n\nThanks to this theorem the number of OMBB candidates is dramatically reduced to the number of convex hull edges. Thus, the complexity of the Rotating Calipers method is _linear_ if the convex hull is already available. If it isn\u2019t available the overall complexity is bound by the cost of computing the convex hull. An example of a set of OMBB candidates (red) for a convex hull (green) is depicted in the figure below. Note, that there are as many OMBB candidates as convex hull edges and each OMBB candidate has one side flush with one edge of the convex hull.\n\n![OMBB candidates](https://geidav.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/ombb_candidates.png?w=820)\n\nTo determine the OMBB of a polygon, first, two orthogonally aligned pairs of parallel _supporting lines_ through the convex hull\u2019s _extreme points_ are created. The intersection of the four lines forms a rectangle. Next, the lines are simultaneously rotated about their supporting points until one line coincides with an edge of the convex hull. Each time an edge coincides, the four lines form another rectangle / OMBB candidate. This process is repeated until each convex hull edge once coincided with one of the four caliper lines. The resulting OMBB is the OMBB candidate with the smallest area. The entire algorithm is outlined step by step below.\n\n1. Compute the convex hull of the input polygon.\n2.

Some rely on multiple heuristic policies to detect suitable packing positions. Others resort to searching for a sound packing sequence from a great number of variations. This paper describes a heuristic algorithm with only a single policy: maximize the residual space during packing, which ensures that rectangles to be packed will fit into the space with maximum likelihood. An efficient implementation is proposed to realize the policy. Experimental results based on openly available datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is comparable to most state-of-the-art algorithms in space efficiency while is significantly faster in data processing. In the case of large-scale problems tested, it is the best by both evaluation metrics.\n\n## Introduction\n\nCutting and Packing (C&P) is a class of optimization problems with a wide range of applications in resource management (Dyckhoff, 1990). Over years of research, several subdivisions of C&P problems have been studied scholarly and their solutions have been implemented in the industry. Although C&P is known to be NP-hard (Non-deterministic Polynomial-time hard) in general (Garey & Johnson, 1979), existing methods can find near-optimal solutions to various problems; nevertheless, new approaches and algorithms are still emerging in the research field. Some offer even better solutions in broader scenarios, while others reduce the time and space overhead in implementation.\n\nThis paper pertains to two-dimensional (2D) rectangle packing, focusing on bin packing \u2013 single bin size bin packing problem (SBSBPP) and strip packing \u2013 open dimension problem (ODP) in the typology of C&P (W\u00e4scher, Hau\u00dfner, & Schumann, 2007). The objective of the former is to minimize the number of fixed-size bins and that of the latter is to minimize the overall height of a fixed-width, infinitely long bin. Specifically, the problems under investigation belong to the RF (Rotated, Free cutting) subtype as classified by Lodi, Martello, and Vigo (1999), where input rectangles can be rotated and packing is not constrained by guillotine cutting.\n\nA 2D rectangle-packing algorithm is developed based on a single policy: the residual space (RS), i.e. the unused region, should be maximized during each step of packing. It will be shown that an efficient implementation exist for such a residual-space-maximized packing (RSMP) policy. RSMP can produce comparable results to existing algorithms but runs considerably faster. The related work to this study is reviewed in Section 2. The principle of RSMP is described in Section 3. Comparisons with existing algorithms based on benchmark datasets are presented in Section 4. Conclusion and future work of the proposed approach are presented in Section 5.\n\n## Section snippets\n\n## Related work\n\nOne of the early approaches to 2D packing is the so-called exact method based on integer programming formulation (Beasley, 1985, Martello and Vigo, 1998). It attempts to find the packing positions of rectangles by solving a set of linear equations, constructed to optimize certain criteria. The number of equations to solve is related to the number of rectangles to pack; thereby the computational cost is relatively high.\n\nA different approach, known as the heuristic approach, produces solutions\n\n## Principle\n\nThe heuristic policy of the proposed residual-space-maximized packing (RSMP) algorithm is motivated by an observation: the most problematic issue of packing is where to put big rectangles. If not properly handled, they may occupy a great number of bins (in bin packing) or reach considerable piled height (in strip packing) with many small spaces unused. Hence, it is reasonable to hypothesize that the best packing position of a rectangle is the one that maximizes the residual space (RS). In this\n\n## Results and discussions\n\nThe proposed RSMP algorithm has been tested on various randomly generated and widely used benchmark datasets. The randomly generated datasets contribute to the understanding of the relative performance of RSMP with respect to the three input sequences (Section 4.1). The benchmark datasets are used to compare RSMP with existing algorithms in terms of bin packing (Section 4.2), strip packing (Section 4.3), and large-scale problems (Section 4.4). Results of the existing algorithms are obtained\n\n## Conclusions\n\nA 2D rectangle-packing algorithm is proposed based on a single heuristic policy: the residual space after packing each rectangle should be maximized. To realize the policy, a rectangle is tested for packing in four corners at two orientations of several candidate residual spaces (RSs). The best configuration based on the RSMP policy is chosen as the packing position. The algorithm involves the generation of a series of RSs based on a difference process (DP) and the comparison of the RSs based\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nThis work was supported by the International Design Center of Singapore University of Technology and Design (Grant ID: IDD31200102 and SREP11013).\n\nRecommended articles\n\n- J.A.

      "text": "New Improvements in Optimal Rectangle Packing\nEric Huang and Richard E. Korf\nComputer Science Department\nUniversity of California, Los Angeles\nLos Angeles, CA 90095\nehuang@cs.ucla.edu, korf@cs.ucla.edu\nAbstract\nThe rectangle packing problem consists of find\u0002ing an enclosing rectangle of smallest area that can\ncontain a given set of rectangles without overlap.\nOur algorithm picks the x-coordinates of all the\nrectangles before picking any of the y-coordinates.\nFor the x-coordinates, we present a dynamic vari\u0002able ordering heuristic and an adaptation of a prun\u0002ing algorithm used in previous solvers. We then\ntransform the rectangle packing problem into a per\u0002fect packing problem that has no empty space, and\npresent inference rules to reduce the instance size.\nFor the y-coordinates we search a space that models\nempty positions as variables and rectangles as val\u0002ues. Our solver is over 19 times faster than the pre\u0002vious state-of-the-art on the largest problem solved\nto date, allowing us to extend the known solutions\nfor a consecutive-square packing benchmark from\nN=27 to N=32.\n1 Introduction\nGiven a set of rectangles, our problem is to find all enclosing\nrectangles of minimum area that will contain them without\noverlap. We refer to an enclosing rectangle as a bounding\nbox. The optimization problem is NP-hard, while the prob\u0002lem of deciding whether a set of rectangles can be packed in\na given bounding box is NP-complete, via a reduction from\nbin-packing [Korf, 2003]. The consecutive-square packing\nbenchmark is a simple set of increasingly difficult bench\u0002marks for this problem, where the task is to find the bounding\nboxes of minimum area that contain a set of squares of sizes\n1x1, 2x2, ..., up to NxN [Korf, 2003]. For example, Figure 1\nis an optimal solution for N=32. We use this benchmark here\nbut none of the techniques introduced in this paper are spe\u0002cific to packing squares as opposed to rectangles.\nRectangle packing has many practical applications. It ap\u0002pears when loading a set of rectangular objects on a pallet\nwithout stacking them, and also in VLSI design where rect\u0002angular circuit components must be packed onto a rectangu\u0002lar chip. Various other cutting stock and layout problems also\nhave rectangle packing at their core.\nFigure 1: An optimal solution for N=32 with a bounding box\nof 85x135.\n511\n(a) Compulsory part of a 5x2 at\nx=[0,2]\n(b) Assigning a 4x2 to [0,2].\nFigure 2: Examples of compulsory parts and intervals.\n2 Previous Work\nKorf [2003] divided the rectangle packing problem into two\nsubproblems: the minimal bounding box problem and the\ncontainment problem. The former finds a bounding box of\nleast area that can contain a given set of rectangles, while the\nlatter tries to pack the given rectangles in a given bounding\nbox. The algorithm that solves the minimal bounding box\nproblem calls the algorithm that solves the containment prob\u0002lem as a subroutine.\n2.1 Minimal Bounding Box Problem\nA simple way to solve the minimal bounding box problem\nis to find the minimum and maximum areas that describe\nthe set of feasible and potentially optimal bounding boxes.\nBounding boxes of all dimensions can be generated with ar\u0002eas within this range, and then tested in non-decreasing order\nof area until all feasible solutions of smallest area are found.\nThe minimum area is the sum of the areas of the given rectan\u0002gles. The maximum area is determined by the bounding box\nof a greedy solution found by setting the bounding box height\nto that of the tallest rectangle, and then placing the rectangles\nin the first available position when scanning from left to right,\nand for each column scanning from bottom to top.\n2.2 Containment Problem\nKorf\u2019s [2003] absolute placement approach modeled rectan\u0002gles as variables and empty locations in the bounding box\nas values. Moffitt and Pollack\u2019s [2006] relative placement ap\u0002proach used a variable for every pair of rectangles to represent\nthe relations above, below, left, and right. Absolute place\u0002ment was faster than relative placement [Korf et al., 2009],\nwhich in turn was faster than the methods of Clautiaux et al.\n[2007] and Beldiceanu et al. [2008].\nSimonis and O\u2019Sullivan [2008] used Clautiaux et al.\u2019s\n[2007] variable order with additional constraints from\nBeldiceanu et al. [2008] to greatly outperform Korf et al.\u2019s\nsolver [2009]. They used Prolog\u2019s backtracking engine to\nsolve a set of constraints which they specified prior to the\nsearch effort. They first assigned the x-coordinates of all\nthe rectangles before any of the y-coordinates. Since we use\nsome of these ideas, we review them here.\nSimonis and O\u2019Sullivan [2008] used two sets of redundant\nvariables for the x-coordinates. The first set of N variables\ncorrespond to \u201cintervals\u201d where a rectangle is assigned an\ninterval of x-coordinates. Interval sizes are hand-picked for\neach rectangle prior to search, and they induce a smaller rect\u0002angle representing the common intersecting area of placing\nthe rectangle in any location in the interval [Beldiceanu et\nal., 2008]. Larger intervals result in weaker constraint prop\u0002agation (less pruning) but a smaller branching factor, while\nsmaller intervals result in stronger constraint propagation but\na larger branching factor.\nAs shown in Figure 2b, a 4x2 rectangle assigned an x\u0002interval of [0,2] consumes 2 units of area at each x-coordinate\nin [2,3], represented by the doubly-hatched area. This \u201ccom\u0002pulsory profile\u201d [Beldiceanu et al., 2008] is a constraint com\u0002mon to all positions x \u2208 [0, 2] of the original 4x2 rectan\u0002gle. If there were no feasible set of interval assignments, then\nthe constraint would save us from having to try individual x\u0002values. However, if we do find a set of interval assignments,\nthen we must search for a set of single x-coordinate val\u0002ues. Simonis and O\u2019Sullivan [2008] used a total of 4N vari\u0002ables, assigning (in order) x-intervals, single x-coordinates,\ny-intervals, and finally single y-coordinates.\n3 Overall Search Strategy\nWe separate the containment problem from the minimal\nbounding box problem, and use Korf et al.\u2019s [2009] al\u0002gorithm to solve the latter problem. Like Simonis and\nO\u2019Sullivan [2008], we assign all x-coordinates prior to any y\u0002coordinates, and use interval variables for the x-coordinates.\nWe set a rectangle\u2019s interval size to 0.35 times its width,\nwhich gave us the best performance. Finally, we do not use\ninterval variables for the y-coordinates. All of the remaining\nideas presented in this paper are our contributions.\nAlthough we use some ideas used by Simonis and\nO\u2019Sullivan [2008], we do not take a constraint programming\napproach in which all constraints are specified to a general\npurpose solver like Prolog, prior to the search effort. Instead,\nwe have implemented our program from scratch in C++, al\u0002lowing us to easily choose which constraints and inferences to\nuse at what time, and giving us more flexibility during search.\nFor example, as we will explain later, we make different in\u0002ferences depending on the partial solution.\nWe implemented a chronological backtracking algorithm\nwith dynamic variable ordering and forward checking. Our\nalgorithm works in three stages as it goes from the root of the\nsearch tree down to the leaves:\n1. It first works on the x-coordinates in a model where\nvariables are rectangles and values are x-coordinate lo\u0002cations, using dynamic variable ordering by area and a\nconstraint that detects infeasible subtrees.\n2. For each x-coordinate solution found, it conducts a per\u0002fect packing transformation, applies inference rules to\nreduce the transformed problem size, and derives conti\u0002guity constraints between rectangles.\n3. It then searches for a set of y-coordinates in a model\nwhere variables are empty corners and values are rect\u0002angles.\n4 Assigning X-Coordinates\nFor the x-coordinates, we propose a dynamic variable order\nand a constraint adapted from Korf\u2019s [2003] wasted-space\npruning heuristic. For a bounding box of size WxH we use\n512\nan array of size W representing the...",

      "text": "Optimal Rectangle Packing: Initial Results\nRichard E. Korf\nComputer Science Department\nUniversity of California, Los Angeles\nLos Angeles, CA 90095\nkorf@cs.ucla.edu\nAbstract\nGiven a set of rectangles with fixed orientations, we want to\nfind an enclosing rectangle of minimum area that contains\nthem all with no overlap. Many simple scheduling tasks can\nbe modelled by this NP-complete problem. We use an any\u0002time branch-and-bound algorithm to solve the problem op\u0002timally. Our main contributions are a lower-bound on the\namount of wasted space in a partial solution, based on a re\u0002laxation of the problem to one-dimensional bin packing, and\na dominance condition that allows us to ignore many par\u0002tial solutions. For our experiments, we choose a class of in\u0002creasingly difficult square-packing problems as a simple and\neasily-specified benchmark. The square-packing problem of\nsize N is to find the smallest rectangle that contains the 1x1,\n2x2, etc. up to NxN square. We find optimal solutions to\nthese problems up to size N=22. For comparison, we also\nfind the best slicing solutions, a popular approximation al\u0002gorithm. Our approach is rather general, and many of our\ntechniques can be applied to packing non-rectangular shapes\nin non-rectangular enclosing regions, and higher-dimensional\npacking problems as well.\nIntroduction and Overview\nConsider the following very simple scheduling problem: We\nhave a set of independent jobs, each of which requires a cer\u0002tain number of workers for a certain amount of time. We as\u0002sume that the jobs are indivisible, meaning they can\u2019t be bro\u0002ken down into smaller subtasks. If they can be decomposed,\nwe break them down into their indivisible components, and\nthen consider the components as jobs. All workers work the\nsame hours, and are paid for their whole shift, whether they\nare busy or idle. We can adjust the number of workers, and\nthe total amount of time. We\u2019d like to minimize the total\nlabor cost to complete all the jobs, which is proportional to\nthe number of workers times the number of hours they are\nat work. Alternatively, we may want to complete all jobs as\nquickly as possible, using as many workers as necessary. As\nanother alternative, we may want to minimize the number of\nworkers, and complete all the jobs as soon as possible given\nthat number of workers. A closely related problem is how to\nschedule a set of tasks that require a certain resource level,\nsuch as electric power on a spacecraft, for a given amount\nCopyright \u0001c 2003, American Association for Artificial Intelli\u0002gence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved.\nof time, so that all tasks are completed as soon as possible\nwithout exceeding a maximum resource capacity.\nWe can model these problems as rectangle-packing prob\u0002lems. Each job is represented by a rectangle, where one\ndimension is the number of workers needed, and the other\nis the amount of time required. The total number of work\u0002ers is the height of an enclosing rectangle, and the length\nof time is the width. All the job rectangles must be packed\ninto the enclosing rectangle, with no overlap. Minimizing\nthe total labor cost amounts to finding the enclosing rect\u0002angle of minimum area that contains all the job rectangles.\nTo minimize the number of workers, we want an enclosing\nrectangle of minimum width, whose height is the maximum\nnumber of workers needed for any job. Similarly, to mini\u0002mize the amount of time, we want an enclosing rectangle of\nminimum height, whose width is the amount of time needed\nfor the longest job.\nOf course, in reality there will be other constraints on the\njobs, such as precedence constraints between jobs. Such\nconstraints can be easily added to our solution algorithm, re\u0002sulting in the pruning of partial solutions that don\u2019t satisify\nthe constraints. This pruning will make it easier to deter\u0002mine that a particular enclosing rectangle can\u2019t contain all\nthe job rectangles, but potentially more difficult to find a\nfeasible solution within a particular enclosing rectangle. For\nsimplicity, we consider the unconstrained case here, which\nis a subproblem of the more general case.\nRectangle packing has other applications as well. In the\ndesign of VLSI chips, circuit blocks such as processors,\nmemory, and I/O drivers must be assigned to physical re\u0002gions of the chip. Another application is cutting a set of\nrectangles out of a single piece of stock material. A re\u0002lated problem is loading a set of rectangular objects onto a\ncargo pallet. An important difference between the schedul\u0002ing problem described above and these other applications\nis that in the scheduling problem the orientation of the job\nrectangles is fixed, since workers and time are often not in\u0002terchangeable. In VLSI design or cutting-stock problems,\nhowever, we can rotate our rectangles by ninety degrees. In\nthis paper, we consider the fixed-orientation problem, and\nonly briefly discuss the extension to unoriented rectangles.\nWe focus here on optimal solutions, but develop an any\u0002time algorithm. In other words, our algorithm finds an ap\u0002proximate solution immediately, and as it continues to run it\nICAPS 2003 287 \nFrom: ICAPS-03 Proceedings. Copyright \u00a9 2003, AAAI (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved. \nfinds better solutions, until it eventually finds and verifies an\noptimal solution. This eliminates solution quality as a vari\u0002able in comparisons with other work. Furthermore, finding\noptimal solutions allows us to characterize the quality of ap\u0002proximate solutions. For example, we evaluate the quality\nof slicing solutions in our experiments.\nWe first show that rectangle-packing problem is NP\u0002complete, and then briefly consider related work. We then\nconsider how to pack a set of rectangles into an enclosing\nrectangle of fixed dimensions, using a branch-and-bound al\u0002gorithm. In particular, we introduce a lower-bound on the\namount of wasted space in a partial solution, based on a\nrelaxation of the problem to one-dimensional bin packing.\nWe also introduce a dominance condition that allows us to\nprune parts of the search space. We then show how to ef\u0002ficiently search the two-dimensional space of different en\u0002closing rectangles to find one with the smallest area that will\ncontain all the given rectangles. To test our algorithm, we we\nfind the enclosing rectangle of smallest area that will con\u0002tain a 1x1, 2x2, 3x3, etc., up to n \u00d7 n square. We choose\nthe special case of square packing because we can specify\na set of increasingly difficult problem instances with just a\nsingle parameter n, making it easier for other researchers to\ncompare their results to ours. Our algorithms, however, do\nnot take advantage of the fact that our rectangles are squares,\nwith one minor exception. We present optimal solutions for\nall problems up to size n = 22, and also the best of a class\nof approximate solutions. Finally, we conclude with further\nideas to improve the performance of our algorithms and gen\u0002eralize our techniques.\nRectangle Packing is NP-Complete\nThe specific decision problem we consider in this section is\ngiven a set of rectangles with fixed orientation, and a specific\nenclosing rectangle, can all the given rectangles fit within the\nboundaries of the enclosing rectangle without any overlap?\nWe show that this problem is NP-complete, by showing that\nthe problem is in NP, and that it is NP-hard.\nIt is clear that this problem can be solved in non\u0002deterministic polynomial time. Given an assignment of the\nrectangles to positions within the enclosing rectangle, it is\neasy to check in polynomial time that no rectangle extends\nbeyond the boundary of the enclosing rectangle, and that no\ntwo rectangles overlap.\nTo show that rectangle packing is NP-hard, we demon\u0002strate that bin packing can be reduced in polynomial time to\nrectangle packing. In other words, if rectangle packing can\nbe solved in polynomial time, then so can bin packing. An\ninstance of the bin-packing decision problem consists of a\nset of numbers, along with a fixed set of bins, each with the\nsame fi...",

      "text": "Optimal Rectangle Packing: A Meta-CSP Approach\nMichael D. Moffitt and Martha E. Pollack\nDepartment of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science\nUniversity of Michigan\nAnn Arbor, MI 48109, USA\n{mmoffitt, pollackm}@eecs.umich.edu\nAbstract\nWe present a new approach to optimal rectangle packing, an\nNP-complete problem that can be used to model many sim\u0002ple scheduling tasks. Recent attempts at incorporating artifi\u0002cial intelligence search techniques to the problem of rectangle\npacking have focused on a CSP formulation, in which partial\nassignments are defined to be the fixed placement of a sub\u0002set of rectangles. Our technique takes a significant departure\nfrom this search space, as we instead view partial assignments\nas subsets of relative pairwise relationships between rectan\u0002gles. This approach recalls the meta-CSP commonly con\u0002structed in constraint-based temporal reasoning, and is thus a\ncandidate for several pruning techniques that have been de\u0002veloped in that field. We apply these to the domain of rect\u0002angle packing, and develop a suite of new techniques that ex\u0002ploit both the symmetry and geometry present in this partic\u0002ular domain. We then provide experimental results demon\u0002strating that our approach performs competitively compared\nto the previous state-of-the-art on a series of benchmarks,\nmatching or surpassing it in speed on nearly all instances.\nFinally, we conjecture that our technique is particularly ap\u0002propriate for problems containing large rectangles, which are\ndifficult for the fixed-placement formulation to handle effi\u0002ciently.\nIntroduction\nThe problem of rectangle packing is one that has drawn at\u0002tention from several diverse fields of computer science. For\ninstance, in the context of scheduling, it can be used to rep\u0002resent scenarios where jobs require a fixed amount of time\nand resources, which compose the two dimensions of a sin\u0002gle rectangle. The task of packing many such rectangles into\nan enclosing space, so as to minimize the width, height, or\narea of this space, allows for the minimization of makespan,\nresources needed, or total wasted resource. In VLSI design,\nrectangles represent actual physical modules that need to be\nplaced in a spatial arrangement such that no two modules\noverlap.\nOne of the more recent approaches (Korf 2003) has cast\noptimal rectangle packing as a constraint satisfaction prob\u0002lem (CSP). In this formulation, a variable is created for each\nrectangle, whose legal values are the positions that rectan\u0002gle could occupy without exceeding the boundaries of the\nenclosing space. In addition, there is a binary constraint\nbetween each pair of rectangles, requiring that they do not\nCopyright \u0001c 2006, American Association for Artificial Intelli\u0002gence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved.\noverlap. To solve this CSP, Korf developed a backtracking\nalgorithm, where each partial assignment is defined to be\nthe fixed placement of a subset of rectangles. By obtaining\nlower bounds on the amount of wasted space at each node in\nthe search, an efficient algorithm is constructed, which was\nlater refined (Korf 2004) into the fastest known algorithm\nfor optimal rectangle packing.\nIn this paper, we present a new approach to rectangle\npacking. Specifically, we cast the problem of optimally\npacking a set of rectangles with fixed orientations as a meta\u0002CSP. In this formulation, we create a meta-variable for each\npair of rectangles, whose values are the four pairwise re\u0002lationships (i.e., above, below, left of, right of) that pre\u0002vent that pair from overlapping. As such, commitment to\nthe exact placement of any rectangle is not established un\u0002til a consistent solution has been generated. In this regard,\nour approach resembles graph-based methods for optimal\nrectangle packing (Onodera, Taniguchi, & Tamaru 1991),\nwhich have previously been unable to cope with more than a\nsmall handful of rectangles. The key difference in our meta\u0002CSP formulation is the introduction of modern artificial\u0002intelligence search techniques that greatly increase the effi\u0002ciency of exploring this alternative space. Some of these are\ndrawn from literature on constraint-based temporal reason\u0002ing (Dechter, Meiri, & Pearl 1991; Stergiou & Koubarakis\n1998; Tsamardinos & Pollack 2003), while others are en\u0002tirely new techniques that exploit the symmetry and geom\u0002etry present in this particular domain. We combine these\nmethods to create the BLUEBLOCKER solver, and provide ex\u0002perimental results demonstrating that our approach performs\ncompetitively compared to the previous state-of-the-art on a\nseries of benchmarks. Finally, we conjecture that our tech\u0002nique is particularly appropriate for problems containing\nlarge rectangles, which are difficult for the fixed-placement\nformulation to handle efficiently.\nBackground\nRectangle Packing\nConsider the following problem: we are given a set of N\njobs, where each job j requires a specific number of workers\n(or machines) mj and a specific amount of uninterrupted\nprocessing time pj . Assuming that all workers are paid the\nsame salary and work the same hours, one may wish to find\na schedule that minimizes the total cost of labor (which is\nproportional to the product of number of workers and the\ntotal hours worked).\n93\nThis problem can be approximated as a rectangle pack\u0002ing problem.1 Specifically, each job can be represented by a\nrectangle, with width wj being equal to the time required pj ,\nand height hj being equal to the required number of work\u0002ers mj . Minimizing the total labor cost is then equivalent to\nfinding an enclosing rectangle of dimensions W \u00d7 H whose\ntotal area is minimal. We refer to this as the Minimal Bound\u0002ing Box Problem. The decision variant of this, where the di\u0002mensions of the enclosing space are specified, we refer to as\nthe Containment Problem.\nPrevious work on rectangle packing has primarily focused\non generating approximate or suboptimal solutions, using\ntechniques such as genetic algorithms and simulated anneal\u0002ing. To facilitate these approaches, a number of data struc\u0002tures have been developed to represent a layout of rectangles\nincluding sequence pairs (Murata et al. 1995), BSG struc\u0002tures (Nakatake et al. 1996), and O-Trees (Guo, Cheng, &\nYoshimura 1999). We omit the details of such structures, as\nthey are largely unrelated to our formulation.\nThe first line of research to consider optimal two\u0002dimensional compactions of rectangles (Onodera,\nTaniguchi, & Tamaru 1991) applied a branch-and-bound\napproach, using a graph algorithm to maintain consistency\nat each step of the backtracking search. Extensions of\nthis method have been largely avoided, as it was shown to\nhandle no more than six rectangles tractably. More recently,\nan algorithm using the O-Tree representation was able\nto surpass this record by efficiently handling up to nine\nrectangles (Chan & Markov 2004).\nRectangle Packing as a CSP\nOne of the more distinctive approaches to rectangle packing\n(Korf 2003) applied artificial intelligence search techniques\nwith great success. In this work, rectangle packing is mod\u0002eled as a binary constraint satisfaction problem. There is a\nvariable for each rectangle, whose legal values are the po\u0002sitions it could occupy without exceeding the boundaries of\nthe enclosing space. In addition, there is a binary constraint\nbetween each pair of rectangles that they cannot overlap.\nTo solve this CSP, a backtracking algorithm is used. At\neach node in the search, a rectangle is given a fixed posi\u0002tion within the enclosing space. This is accomplished by\n\u201cdrawing\u201d the rectangle (or an outline of the rectangle) onto\na bitmap representing the entire area. For example, one such\npartial assignment is depicted in Figure 1. Here, two rect\u0002angles (in fact, squares) have been given assignments. The\nupper-left corner of the 6\u00d76 square has been placed at (0, 0),\nand the upper-left corner of the 5\u00d75 square has been placed\nat (6, 0). Suppose we have four more squares remaining,\nwith dimensions 4\u00d74, 3\u00d73, 2\u00d72, and 1\u00d71; by visual in\u0002spection...",

The relevant special cases where the items have to be packed into rows forming levels are also discussed in detail.\n## Introduction\nIn several industrial applications one is required to allocate a set of rectangular items to larger rectangular standardized stock units by minimizing the waste. In wood or glass industries, rectangular components have to be cut from large sheets of material. In warehousing contexts, goods have to be placed on shelves. In newspapers paging, articles and advertisements have to be arranged in pages. In these applications, the standardized stock units are rectangles, and a common objective function is to pack all the requested items into the minimum number of units: the resulting optimization problems are known in the literature as two-dimensional bin packing problems. In other contexts, such as paper or cloth industries, we have instead a single standardized unit (a roll of material), and the objective is to obtain the items by using the minimum roll length: the problems are then referred to as two-dimensional strip packing problems. As we will see in the following, the two problems have a strict relation in almost all algorithmic approaches to their solution.\nMost of the contributions in the literature are devoted to the case where the items to be packed have a fixed orientation with respect to the stock unit(s), i.e., one is not allowed to rotate them. This case, which is the object of the present article, reflects a number of practical contexts, such as the cutting of corrugated or decorated material (wood, glass, cloth industries), or the newspapers paging. For variants allowing rotations (usually by 90\u00b0) and/or constraints on the items placement (such as the \u201cguillotine cuts\u201d), the reader is referred to Lodi et al. [41], [42], where a three-field classification of the area is also introduced. General surveys on cutting and packing problems can be found in Dyckhoff and Finke [17], Dowsland and Dowsland [16] and Dyckhoff et al. [18]. Results on the probabilistic analysis of packing algorithms can be found in Coffman and Shor [12] and Coffman and Lueker [11].\nLet us introduce the problems in a more formal way. We are given a set of*n*rectangular*items**j*\u2208*J*={1,\u2026,*n*}, each defined by a*width*,*w**j*, and a*height*,*h**j*:\n* (i)\nin the*Two-Dimensional Bin Packing Problem*(2BP), we are further given an unlimited number of identical rectangular*bins*of width*W*and height*H*, and the objective is to allocate all the items to the minimum number of bins;\n* (ii)\nin the*Two-Dimensional Strip Packing Problem*(2SP), we are further given a bin of width*W*and infinite height (hereafter called*strip*), and the objective is to allocate all the items to the strip by minimizing the height to which the strip is used.\nIn both cases, the items have to be packed with their*w*-edges parallel to the*W*-edge of the bins (or strip). We will assume, with no loss of generality, that all input data are positive integers, and that*w**j*\u2a7d*W*and*h**j*\u2a7d*H*(*j*=1,\u2026,*n*).\nBoth problems are strongly NP-hard, as is easily seen by transformation from the strongly NP-hard (one-dimensional)*Bin Packing Problem*(1BP), in which*n*items, each having an associated size*h**j*, have to be partitioned into the minimum number of subsets so that the sum of the sizes in each subset does not exceed a given capacity*H*.\nA third relevant case of rectangle packing is the following. Each item*j*has an associated profit*p**j*&gt;0, and the problem is to select a subset of items, to be packed in a single finite bin, which maximizes the total selected profit. This problem is usually denoted as (*Two-Dimensional*)*Cutting Stock*, although it had been introduced by Gilmore and Gomory [29] as (*Two-Dimensional*)*Cutting Knapsack*.\nIn this survey we concentrate on two-dimensional problems in which all items have to be packed, i.e., on 2SP and 2BP. The reader is referred to Dyckhoff et al. [18, Section 5] for an annotated bibliography on two-dimensional cutting stock problems. For both 2SP and 2BP, we also consider the special case where the items have to be packed into rows forming levels.\nIn Section 2 we discuss mathematical models for the various problems introduced above. In Section 3 we survey classical approximation algorithms as well as more recent heuristic and metaheuristic methods. In Section 4 we introduce lower bounding techniques, while in Section 5 we describe exact enumerative approaches.\n## Section snippets\n## Modeling two-dimensional problems\nThe first attempt to model two-dimensional packing problems was made by Gilmore and Gomory [29], through an extension of their approach to 1BP (see [27], [28]). They proposed a column generation approach (see [53] for a recent survey) based on the enumeration of all subsets of items (*patterns*) that can be packed into a single bin. Let*A**j*be a binary column vector of*n*elements*a**ij*(*i*=1,\u2026,*n*) taking the value 1 if item*i*belongs to the*j*th pattern, and the value 0 otherwise.

Romanova2\nDecember 12, 2009\nAbstract\nThe article is devoted to mathematical models and practical algo\u0002rithms for solving the cutting and packing (C&P) problem. We re\u0002view and further enhance the main tool of our studies \u2013 phi-functions.\nThose are constructed here for 2D and 3D objects (unlike other stan\u0002dard tools, such as no-fit polygons, which are restricted to the 2D\ngeometry). We also demonstrate that in many realistic cases the phi\u0002functions can be described by quite simple formulas without radicals\nand other complications. Lastly, a general solution strategy using the\nphi-functions is outlined and illustrated by several 2D and 3D exam\u0002ples.\nKeywords: Mathematical modeling; Cutting and packing; Optimization; Phi\u0002function; No-fit polygon\n1 Introduction\nThe cutting and packing (C&P) problem is a part of computational geometry\nthat has rich applications in garment industry, sheet metal cutting, furniture\nmaking, shoe manufacturing, etc. The common task in these areas is to cut a\ncertain set of figures of specified shapes and sizes from a given sheet (strip) of\n1Department of Mathematics, University of Alabama at Birmingham, AL 35294;\n2Department of Mathematical Modeling, Institute for Mechanical Engineering Prob\u0002lems of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, Kharkov, Ukraine;\nEmail: chernov@math.uab.edu; sherom@kharkov.ua\n1\nmaterial (textile, wood, metal, etc.), see a tutorial [5] and references therein.\nTo minimize waste one wants to cut figures as close to each other as possible;\nin other words one needs to design as close to an optimal layout as possible\nbefore the actual cutting.\nThis is a mathematical problem which can be formalized as follows: given\na strip of fixed width W and infinite length, say S = {x \u2265 0, 0 \u2264 y \u2264 W},\ncut out n given figures from the rectangle {0 \u2264 x \u2264 L, 0 \u2264 y \u2264 W} \u2282 S\nwithout overlaps, so that L takes its minimum value, see Figure 1.\nFigure 1: An example of a cutting problem.\nIn other applications, one needs to arrange a given set of objects within a\ncertain area (say, shipment on a deck of a freight car or electronic components\non a panel), and again one wants to minimize the use of space or maximize\nthe number of objects.\nClearly these two types of problems \u2013 cutting and packing \u2013 are math\u0002ematically equivalent; they are known as the cutting and packing (C&P)\nproblem (it is also called nesting problem, marker making, stock cutting,\ncontainment problem, etc). In some cases it involves additional restrictions\non the minimal or maximal distance between certain objects or from the ob\u0002jects to the border of the container. The recent tutorial [5] summarizes the\nprevious studies of the C&P problem and its history.\nMany other applications involve 3D geometry: packing pills into a bot\u0002tle, placing crates and barrels into a cargo compartment, 3D laser cutting,\nmodeling of granular media and liquids, and radiosurgery treatment planning\n(just to name a few). Thus the C&P problem naturally extends to three di\u0002mensions, though relatively little is done in the 3D case. Figure 2 illustrates\na 3D packing problem \u2013 objects of various shape and size are packed into a\nrectangular container in order to minimize its dimensions. Another example\nis shown in Fig. 8.\nThe problem is NP-complete, and as a result solution methodologies pre\u00022\nFigure 2: An example of a 3D packing problem.\ndominantly utilize heuristics [5]; most existing methods of cutting and pack\u0002ing are restricted to objects of certain shapes and type and impose various\nlimitations on their layout. For example, nearly all practical algorithms deal\nwith polygons only; other shapes are simply approximated by polygons (a\nnotable exception being [9] which allows circular shapes). Objects usually\nhave a fixed orientation, i.e. they cannot be freely rotated. The most popular\nand most frequently cited tool in the modern literature on the C&P problem\nis the so called No-Fit Polygon (see our Section 3), it is designed to work\nonly for polygonal objects that can be translated without rotation.\nWe note however that not all advances are published in academic journals\nbecause many commercial companies closely guard their products [20].\nThe goal of this paper is to present the results of our research group that\nfor decades has been studying the cutting and packing problem in a formal\nmathematical manner. In these studies we deal with objects of very general\nshape (called phi-objects) and we characterize their layouts by means of\nspecial functions (called phi-functions) whose construction involves a certain\ndegree of flexibility. The concepts of the phi-object and the phi-function\nhave their roots in topology; but the phi-functions turn out to be highly\nconvenient for practical solution of the C&P problem. In particular, since\nthe construction of the phi-functions is flexible, we take advantage of this\nfact to develop more efficient algorithms.\nWhile the phi-functions have been employed by our group since the 1980s,\nsee e.g. [24], they remain little known to the broader community [5]. Our\nprincipal goal is to present here the theory of phi-objects and phi-functions\nin full and demonstrate practical benefits of these tools.\nOur paper is primarily a survey, but it includes substantial novelties. We\npresent new, improved formulas for phi-functions in several cases. More im\u0002portantly, we introduce a new principle that phi-functions can be computed,\nin all practical cases, via linear and quadratic formulas without radicals. Pre\u0002cise statements are given in Sections 2 and 3, and proofs are sketched in the\n3\nAppendix (complete proofs are beyond the scope of this article; they will be\npublished separately). Also, we do not restrict our survey to the traditional\n2D geometry \u2013 we include a general 3D theory and examples not published\nelsewhere.\nThis paper is organized as follows: in Section 2 we introduce phi-objects,\nin Section 3 we define phi-functions and overview their properties, in Sec\u0002tion 4 we use the phi-functions to reduce the C&P problem to a constrained\nminimization problem, and in Section 5 we describe various approaches to\nits solution. Illustrative examples are presented in Section 6.\n2 Phi-objects\nOur first goal is to describe a general mathematical model for the cutting\nand packing (C&P) problem that should adequately represent virtually all\nexisting applications.\nThe basic task is to place a set of certain geometric objects (later on,\nsimply objects) Ti, i \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , n} = In, into a container T0 so that certain\nrestrictions on the location of the objects are met and a certain objective\nfunction (measuring the \u2018quality\u2019 of the placement) will reach its extreme\nvalue. We will specify these requirements below.\nWe can also rephrase our basic task differently: given a (large) object T0,\nwe need to cut a set of smaller objects {T1, . . . , Tn} from it. Our objects are\n2D or 3D geometric figures, i.e. subsets of R\n2 or R3\n. Generalization to any\ndimension is straightforward, but we do not pursue it here.\nThe multiplicity of shapes of Ti and T0, as well as the variety of restrictions\nand forms of the objective function generate a wide specter of realizations of\nthis basic problem. We develop a unified approach to all such applications\nwith the ultimate goal of designing efficient algorithms for solving the C&P\nproblem.\n2.1 Phi-objects. First we define a class of admissible objects for our model\nfollowing [24, 29, 30]; they will be called \u03d5-objects or phi-objects. They\nmust have interior (\u201cmain part\u201d) and boundary (frontier). Accordingly, we\nrequire each phi-object be the closure of its interior. (In mathematical topol\u0002ogy, closed sets that are closures of their interior are said to be canonically\nclosed; this is what our phi-objects are.) This requirement rules out such\nelements as isolated points, one-dimensional curves, etc., \u2013 they do not occur\nin realistic applications. Figu...",
