# Santa 2025 - Christmas Tree Packing Optimization

## Problem Overview
Pack Christmas tree toys (15-vertex polygons) into the smallest square bounding box for N=1 to N=200 trees. 
Score = Σ(side_length² / N) for all N. Lower is better.

## Current Status
- **Best Score**: 70.676102 (from pre-optimized santa-2025.csv)
- **Target Score**: 68.894234
- **Gap**: 1.78 points (2.6%)
- **Key Insight**: The pre-optimized submission is at a very tight local optimum - standard short optimization runs cannot escape it.

## Key Optimization Approaches from Kernels

### 1. bbox3.cpp (jazivxt/why-not)
C++ optimizer with advanced techniques:
- Complex Number Vector Coordination
- Fluid Dynamics simulation
- Hinge Pivot moves
- Density Gradient Flow
- Global Boundary Tension
- Aggressive overlap repair
- Parameters: `-n <iterations>` `-r <rounds>`
- Uses OpenMP for parallelization

### 2. tree_packer_v21.cpp (smartmanoj/santa-claude)
C++ optimizer with:
- Swap move operator (exchange positions of two trees)
- Multi-angle restarts
- Higher temperature Simulated Annealing
- Squeeze, compaction, localSearch phases
- Backward propagation (bp.cpp) - removes trees from larger N configs to improve smaller N
- Parameters: `-n <iterations>` `-r <rounds>`

### 3. Ensemble Approach (jonathanchan)
- Collect best configuration for each N from multiple sources
- Sources: bucket-of-chump, SmartManoj GitHub, santa-2025-try3, santa25-public, telegram
- For N=1: optimal angle is 45 degrees (minimizes bounding box)
- Fractional translation: find translations shorter than box length

### 4. fix_direction (chistyakov)
Post-processing to optimize rotation angles to minimize bounding box.

## Scoring Function
```python
def get_score(trees, n):
    xys = np.concatenate([np.asarray(t.polygon.exterior.xy).T for t in trees])
    side = max(xys.max(axis=0) - xys.min(axis=0))
    return side**2 / n
```

## Submission Format
```csv
id,x,y,deg
001_0,s0.0,s0.0,s45.0
002_0,s0.0,s0.0,s90.0
002_1,s0.202736,s-0.511271,s90.0
...
```
- id: `{n:03d}_{tree_index}` (e.g., 001_0, 002_0, 002_1)
- x, y, deg: prefixed with 's' to preserve precision
- Total rows: 20100 (1+2+3+...+200)
- Coordinates must be within [-100, 100]

## Overlap Detection
```python
from shapely.strtree import STRtree

def has_overlap(trees):
    polygons = [t.polygon for t in trees]
    tree_index = STRtree(polygons)
    for i, poly in enumerate(polygons):
        indices = tree_index.query(poly)
        for idx in indices:
            if idx != i and poly.intersects(polygons[idx]) and not poly.touches(polygons[idx]):
                return True
    return False
```

## Critical Insights from Previous Experiments

### What DOESN'T Work:
1. **Short optimization runs** - The local optimum is too tight
2. **Simple ensemble** - santa-2025.csv already dominates all N values
3. **Backward propagation alone** - Only helps if larger N configs have better sub-configurations
4. **Micro-optimization** - Running same optimizers on same starting point won't close the 1.78 point gap

### What MIGHT Work (Unexplored):

1. **Much Longer Optimization Runs (CRITICAL)**
   - Top solutions run for HOURS, not minutes
   - jonathanchan kernel: `-n 15000` iterations, `-r 80` rounds
   - Multiple generations with perturbation to escape local optima

2. **Lattice/Grid-Based Approach for Large N (N >= 58)**
   - Start with 2 base trees in specific configuration
   - Translate them in x and y directions to create grid pattern
   - Optimize base configuration and translation vectors
   - Can achieve tighter bounds than random optimization for large N

3. **Focus on Small N Values (1-10)**
   - N=1 contributes 0.66 to score (highest single contribution)
   - Small N values have lowest efficiency (1.5-2.6 trees/unit area)
   - Try exhaustive search for optimal rotation angles
   - For N=1: optimal angle is 45 degrees

4. **Asymmetric Solutions**
   - Discussion "Why the winning solutions will be Asymmetric" suggests asymmetric layouts outperform symmetric for large N
   - Try breaking symmetry in optimized configurations

5. **Perturbation to Escape Local Optima**
   - Randomly perturb best solution to escape local optima
   - sa_v1_parallel includes: `perturb(pop[0].second, 0.1 + 0.05 * (r % 3), seed)`

## Recommended Experiment Strategy

### Phase 1: Establish Baseline
1. Copy best pre-optimized submission (santa-2025.csv)
2. Verify score matches 70.676102
3. Submit to confirm LB score

### Phase 2: Extended Optimization
1. Run bbox3 with much longer parameters: `-n 50000 -r 256`
2. Run tree_packer_v21 with: `-n 20000 -r 128`
3. Apply backward propagation after each run
4. Run for hours, not minutes

### Phase 3: Alternative Approaches
1. Implement lattice-based approach for N >= 58
2. Focus optimization on worst-performing N values
3. Try asymmetric perturbations

### Phase 4: Ensemble
1. Collect results from all optimization runs
2. For each N, keep configuration with smallest bounding box
3. Validate for overlaps before submission

## Validation Checklist
1. No overlapping trees (use has_overlap function)
2. All coordinates within [-100, 100]
3. All 200 configurations present (20100 rows)
4. Values prefixed with 's' in submission

## Time Budget
- Kaggle notebooks: ~12 hour limit
- bbox3 with `-n 10000 -r 64`: ~1-2 hours
- Plan for multiple optimization passes
- Submit best result before time runs out
