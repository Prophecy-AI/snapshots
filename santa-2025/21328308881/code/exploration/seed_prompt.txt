## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.676102 from exp_000 (001_baseline)
- Best LB score: N/A (not yet submitted)
- Target: 68.894234 | Gap to target: 1.78 points (2.6%)

## Public Kernel Status (CRITICAL!)
- Have we implemented the best kernel yet? **NO**
- Top kernels identified:
  - yongsukprasertsuk/santa-2025-best-keeping-bbox3-runner (369 votes) - 3-hour bbox3 runner with phased optimization
  - jazivxt/why-not (352 votes) - bbox3 optimizer with advanced techniques
  - jonathanchan/santa25-ensemble-sa-fractional-translation (176 votes) - Ensemble + SA + fractional translation
- Kernels we've implemented: NONE (only copied pre-optimized CSV)
- Kernels still to implement: ALL OF THEM
- **CRITICAL**: We have NOT run any actual optimization yet!

## Key Finding from Analysis
**santa-2025.csv dominates ALL 200 N values across all 27 pre-optimized CSVs.**
- Ensemble approach provides ZERO improvement
- N=1 at 45 degrees is already at theoretical minimum (0.661250)
- The pre-optimized solution is at a tight local optimum
- Need fundamentally different approaches to escape

## Response to Evaluator
The evaluator correctly identified that we should check all pre-optimized CSVs for ensemble opportunities. I did this analysis and confirmed that santa-2025.csv dominates ALL N values - no ensemble improvement is possible from existing solutions.

The evaluator's other suggestions are valid:
1. **Run bbox3 with extended parameters** - This is the TOP PRIORITY
2. **Lattice-based approach for large N** - Should explore after bbox3
3. **Submit baseline to verify LB score** - Should do this FIRST

## Recommended Approaches (Priority Order)

### 1. **[HIGHEST PRIORITY]** Submit baseline to get LB feedback
- We have 100 submissions available and haven't used any
- Need to verify CV-LB correlation before investing in optimization
- This is FREE information

### 2. **[HIGH PRIORITY]** Run bbox3 with extended parameters
The yongsukprasertsuk kernel shows the approach:
- Phase A: Short runs (2 min each) with n=[1000-2000], r=[30-90] to find promising settings
- Phase B: Medium runs (10 min each) on top candidates
- Phase C: Long runs (20 min each) on best few
- Use `fix_direction` to tighten rotation after each run
- Use `repair_overlaps_in_place` to fix any overlaps

**Key parameters to try:**
```bash
./bbox3 -n 10000 -r 128   # ~30 min run
./bbox3 -n 50000 -r 256   # ~2 hour run
./bbox3 -n 100000 -r 512  # ~5+ hour run (if time permits)
```

### 3. **[MEDIUM PRIORITY]** Implement lattice-based packing for N >= 58
Research shows crystalline packing is mathematically superior for large N:
- Start with 2 base trees in specific configuration
- Translate them in x and y directions to create grid pattern
- Optimize base configuration and translation vectors
- This is a fundamentally different approach that could escape local optima

### 4. **[LOWER PRIORITY]** Try coordinated multi-tree moves
Instead of moving one tree at a time:
- Rearrange entire packing configuration
- Fix/restrict certain trees to control grid shape
- This helps explore different regions of solution space

## What NOT to Try
- ❌ Simple ensemble from existing CSVs (already verified - no improvement)
- ❌ Micro-optimization of individual N values (gap is too large)
- ❌ Running same optimizer with same parameters (will get same result)
- ❌ Reinforcement learning approaches (proven to fail on this problem)

## Validation Notes
- CV scheme: Calculate sum of (side²/N) for all N=1 to 200
- Verify no overlaps using Shapely STRtree
- All coordinates must be within [-100, 100]
- Values must be prefixed with 's' in submission

## SUBMISSION STRATEGY
- Remaining submissions: 100
- **Submit after this experiment? YES - we have abundant submissions!**
- Submit baseline FIRST to calibrate CV-LB relationship
- Then submit after each significant optimization run

## Next Experiment: 002_bbox3_extended
1. Copy bbox3 binary to working directory
2. Run bbox3 with extended parameters: `-n 10000 -r 128`
3. Apply fix_direction to tighten rotation
4. Validate for overlaps
5. Calculate new score
6. If improved, save as new submission
7. Submit to get LB feedback
