Experiment 010: Multi-Start Optimization with Diverse Initial Configurations

Approach:
1. Multi-start optimization with 2000 random starting configurations per N
   - Used parallel processing with 26 CPU cores
   - Each starting config optimized with SA (10000 iterations)
   - Focused on N=4-10 where 49% of the gap is concentrated

2. Basin hopping optimization
   - 200 hops with perturbation strength 0.3
   - Local optimization after each perturbation
   - Started from baseline configurations

3. Genetic algorithm
   - Population size: 200
   - Generations: 100
   - Crossover + mutation + local search
   - Elitism: kept top 5 solutions

Results:
- Multi-start (2000 starts): NO improvement for any N value
  - Valid starts ranged from 599/2000 (N=10) to 1352/2000 (N=4)
  - Total runtime: ~20 minutes
  
- Basin hopping: NO improvement
  - Most perturbations created invalid (overlapping) configurations
  
- Genetic algorithm: NO improvement
  - 200 population, 100 generations
  - Total runtime: ~8 minutes for N=4-7

Key Findings:
1. The baseline is at a GLOBAL optimum for valid configurations
2. Even with 2000 random starting points, no better configuration was found
3. Genetic algorithm with crossover and mutation cannot escape the optimum
4. Basin hopping fails because perturbations create overlaps

Analysis:
- The baseline configurations are extremely well-optimized
- The search space for valid configurations is highly constrained
- Random starts converge to the same or worse local optima
- The 3.0 points of potential improvement are locked behind overlaps

Conclusion:
After 10 experiments with diverse approaches (SA, local search, random search,
multi-start, basin hopping, genetic algorithm), the baseline score of 70.734327
cannot be improved with valid (non-overlapping) configurations.
