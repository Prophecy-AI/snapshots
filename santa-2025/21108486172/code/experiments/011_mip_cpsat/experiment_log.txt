Experiment 011: MIP/CP-SAT Optimization for Small N

Approach:
1. CP-SAT with discretized positions and angles
   - Used OR-Tools CP-SAT solver
   - Discretized positions on grid, angles in 45° increments
   - Added no-overlap constraints (Manhattan distance approximation)
   - Result: Solutions had overlaps (constraint approximation too loose)

2. Exhaustive grid search for N=2
   - Grid: 21x21x8 = 3528 placements per tree
   - Checked 740,880 combinations
   - Best found: 0.661250 (WORSE than baseline 0.450779)
   - The baseline uses specific angles (23.6°, 66.4°, etc.) not on the grid

3. Ultra-fine local search
   - Step sizes: 0.00001 to 0.001 for positions
   - Step sizes: 0.001° to 0.1° for angles
   - Ran for 30 seconds per N value
   - Result: NO improvement at any N value

Key Findings:
1. The baseline configurations use very specific angles (23.6°, 66.4°, 113.6°, etc.)
   that are NOT simple multiples of common angles
2. These angles are optimized to allow trees to interlock efficiently
3. Grid search with coarse angle steps cannot find these optimal configurations
4. Even ultra-fine local search (step size 0.00001) cannot improve the baseline
5. The baseline is at a local optimum with extremely high precision

Analysis:
- The baseline configurations are the result of extensive optimization
- The angles used are not arbitrary - they allow for efficient interlocking
- The positions are also precisely optimized to minimize bounding box
- No simple approach (grid search, local search, CP-SAT) can improve them

Conclusion:
After 11 experiments with diverse approaches, the baseline score of 70.734327
cannot be improved with valid (non-overlapping) configurations.
