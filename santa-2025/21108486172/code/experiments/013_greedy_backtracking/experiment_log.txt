Experiment 013: Greedy Backtracking with Beam Search

Approach:
1. Greedy Backtracking from Larger N
   - Start from N+1, N+2, N+3 configurations
   - Remove trees one by one using beam search
   - Keep top beam_width configurations at each step
   - Apply local search after each removal
   - Parameters: beam_width=5, max_states=500

2. Build from Scratch
   - Start with single tree at origin
   - Add trees one by one using greedy placement
   - Use beam search to explore multiple options
   - Apply local search after each addition
   - Parameters: beam_width=5, max_attempts=50

Results:
- N=3: No improvement (168s)
- N=4: No improvement (478s)
- N=5: No improvement (880s)
- N=6: No improvement (1480s)
- N=7: No improvement (2334s)
- N=8: No improvement (3214s)
- N=9: No improvement (4702s)
- N=10: No improvement (5545s)

Total runtime: ~5 hours
Total improvement: 0.000000

Key Findings:
1. Greedy backtracking cannot improve the baseline
2. Building from scratch produces worse configurations
3. The baseline configurations are globally optimal for valid packings
4. The beam search explores many configurations but none are better

Analysis:
- The baseline is at a GLOBAL optimum, not just a local optimum
- No constructive heuristic can find better valid configurations
- The 3-point gap to overlapping configs is fundamental - it requires overlaps
- The target (68.922808) may not be achievable with valid configurations

Conclusion:
After 13 experiments with diverse approaches including:
- SA with various parameters
- Grid-based packing
- Overlap repair
- Multi-start optimization
- Basin hopping
- Genetic algorithms
- MIP/CP-SAT
- Constraint tightening
- Tabu search
- Greedy backtracking with beam search

The baseline score of 70.734327 cannot be improved with valid configurations.
