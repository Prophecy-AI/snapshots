INTRODUCTION\nCutting and packing are classic problems of finding the\nmost efficient layout for a set of input items out of a\ngiven container with the objective of minimizing the waste\nmaterial. The applications of cutting and packing, e.g.\nclothing, shipbuilding, and furniture industry are numer\u0002ous. W\u00a8ascher et al. (2007) have developed a typology that\nclassifies the nesting problems according to dimension,\nobjective, assortment of item type, as well as the number\nand nature of the container where the items are to be\nallocated. In this paper, we consider the irregular shape\npacking problem, classified as a two-dimensional irregular\nopen dimension problem (ODP).\nThe problem is NP-complete (Fowler et al., 1981) and\nas a result solution methodologies predominantly utilize\nheuristics. Although there are many different solution\napproaches presented in the literature, there appears to\nbe two key strategies for representing and searching the\nsolution space. The first approach represents the solution\nas an ordered list of items and applies a placement rule\nto construct the solution (Babu and Babu, 2001; Gomes\nand Oliveira, 2002; Burke et al., 2007, 2006). The second\napproach represents the solution as a physical layout on\nthe container and moves items within the layout (Bennell\n1 e-mail: andre.kubagawa@gmail.com.

This author was partially supported by\nCNPq (grant 304258/2007-5) and FAPESP (grant 2009/07173-2).\nand Dowsland, 1999; Gomes and Oliveira, 2006; Egeblad\net al., 2007). The former strategy is dependent on two\ncritical characteristics of the algorithm; the placement rule\nand the placement order of the items.\nWhen irregular shaped items are involved an extra di\u0002mension of complexity is generated by the geometry. The\nno-fit polygon is the principal approach for handling the\ngeometry in cutting and packing problems with irregular\nshaped items (Burke et al., 2007; Bennell and Song, 2008;\nCosta et al., 2009). The no-fit polygon is used to ensure\nfeasible layouts; i.e. layouts where the items do not overlap\nand fit inside the container.\nIn this paper, the solution is represented as an ordered\nlist of items and a constructive heuristic is applied se\u0002quentially. A simulated annealing algorithm controls how\nthe items are ordered in the list and where the items are\nconstructively placed. The proposed algorithm has two\nhierarchical levels. The inner level solves the placement\nproblem where the container has fixed dimensions. The\nexternal level reduces or increases the container dimen\u0002sion that must be minimized. Experiments show that the\nproposed method is very efficient compared with other\npublished methods.\n2. PREVIOUS WORKS\nThe no-fit polygon alone has limited utility in cutting\nand packing problems. Some recent works are using the\ncollision free region to determine feasible layouts in con\u0002tainers with fixed dimensions. Martins and Tsuzuki (2006)\nproposed a constructive heuristic where the collision free\nPreprints of the 18th IFAC World Congress\nMilano (Italy) August 28 - September 2, 2011\nCopyright by the\nInternational Federation of Automatic Control (IFAC)\n3968\nFig. 1. Cost function behavior when the container has fixed\ndimensions. The cost function assumes only discrete\nvalues, while the rotating angle \u03b8 is continuous.\nregion represents feasible placements for a moveable item\nconsidering the already placed items and the container.\nThe cost function is the non occupied area inside the\ncontainer with fixed dimensions. As the non occupied\narea can change only by adding or removing areas of\nitems, the cost function can assume only a finite set of\nvalues, becoming discontinuous (see Fig. 1). A simulated\nannealing algorithm with adaptive neighborhood (Martins\nand Tsuzuki, 2008, 2009a) controls the sequence of items\nand the placement on the collision free region boundary.\nThe collision free region was calculated using regularized\nBoolean operations implemented with limited precision\n(Hobby, 1999).\nMartins and Tsuzuki (2007) combined the simulated an\u0002nealing with deterministic heuristics (larger first and bot\u0002tom left). They showed that it is possible to create problem\ninstances where deterministic heuristics cannot reach the\nlayout associated with the global optimum.\nSato et al. (2010) implemented a robust algorithm to\ndetermine the collision free region with two dimension\nnon manifold Boolean operations. They created a problem\ninstance where the the global optimum can not be reached\nby placing the moveable item exclusively on collision free\nregion vertices. Such situation rarely occurs considering\nstudied and practical problems. They showed several re\u0002sults where the area of the container was exactly equal\nto the total area of the items. The layout associated with\nglobal optimum was reached in averagely 15 times fewer\niterations when compared to previously published results\n(Martins and Tsuzuki, 2009b, 2010) where the area of the\ncontainer was larger than the total area of the items. The\ncorrect calculation of the collision free region showed to be\nan effective tool to obtain such results.\n3. NO-FIT POLYGONS AND COLLISION FREE\nREGION\nNo-fit polygons represent set of translations of an item\nand are mathematically represented by a set of vectors.\nFor a better understanding of the properties of the no-fit\npolygons, the set of translations of an item is represented\nby polygons in the plane. Every item has a reference point\nthat can be internal or external to it. The no-fit polygon\nrepresents a set of forbidden translations, as shown in\nFig. 2. For an item P, let i(P) be its interior, \u2202P be its\nboundary and c(P) be its complement.\nFig. 2. Set of translations of a shape represented as a region\ncontaining all possible translations from its reference\npoint.\nDefinition 3.1. The no-fit polygon induced by item Pi to\nitem Pj , denoted by \u03a5(Pi, Pj ), is the set of translation\nvectors applied to Pj that leads it to a collision with Pi.\nThus,\n\u03a5(Pi, Pj ) = i(Pi) \t i(Pj ) (1)\n= {v | \u2203 a \u2208 i(Pj ), a + v \u2208 i(Pi)}\nThe no-fit polygon can be obtained by the Minkowski\nsum algorithm (Agarwal et al., 2002), that can be calcu\u0002lated very efficiently for convex polygons.

The objective is usually to minimize the use area and consumption of the \nmotherboards after nesting and to optimize the material utilization or the nesting scheme.\nTwo-dimensional irregular nesting is widely used in cutting and nesting of garment, leather, glass, \nwood, metal plate, and so on. With the development of economic globalization and the increasing \ndemand for resources, the manual nesting can no longer meet the needs of enterprises. Computer\u0002aided technology can improve the material utilization of materials and the nesting efficiency. This has \nComputer-Aided Design & Applications, 18(2), 2021, 242-257\n\u00a9 2021 CAD Solutions, LLC, http://www.cad-journal.net\n243\nimportant practical significance for reducing enterprise costs and improving the competitiveness of \nenterprises. From the perspective of computational complexity theory, the two-dimensional nesting \nproblem is NP-complete, no effective polynomial algorithm has been found. So far, no effective \npolynomial algorithm has been found for the problem.\nThe leather product is widely applied in life, such as leather garments, shoes, hats, bags, as well \nas the car seats, the luxury cruise seats and so on. The characteristics of leather materials are high \ncost, irregular boundary, and uneven surface quality distribution.\nDue to the above characteristics, 2D nesting in leather garment manufacturing is more complex \nthan the traditional 2D nesting problem. Both shapes of the sample piece (leather garment pieces)\nand motherboard (master leathers) are irregular. In leather garment manufacturing, a leather \ngarment has many sample pieces which need multiple motherboards. When making multiple leather\ngarments, it necessary to layout all sample pieces on many motherboards, and the shapes of the\nmotherboards are not the same. This paper aims at the challenging problem of nesting techniques \nin leather garment manufacturing proposes a new algorithm to layout all sample pieces into many \narbitrary shaped motherboards.\n2 RELATED WORKS\nThe existing two-dimensional irregular nesting algorithms can be roughly divided into heuristic \nalgorithms and intelligence algorithms.\n(1) Two-dimensional irregular nesting based on the heuristic algorithm. The heuristic algorithm \nmainly aims at the problem of nesting small sample pieces in one single motherboard and does not \nconsider the quality of the motherboard such as flaws and holes. In the garment industry, a \nmotherboard is big rolls of fabric plate with a total length up to several hundred meters. The goal of \nthe nesting algorithm is usually to use the length of the motherboard as minimal as possible so that \nthe heuristic algorithm has serious limitations in practical application. To reduce the computational \ncomplexity, some literature of the heuristic algorithm combined the sample pieces, and then layout \nthem as a complete sample shape. The most common method of heuristic algorithm is solving the \nminimum external rectangle of the combined sample shape[1]. An approximate method is combining \nsample pieces into a regular polygon[2][3], such as triangle, quadrangle, pentagon, hexagon to \nreplace minimum external rectangle for layout. In 2002, Gomes and Oliveira [4] used a heuristic \nalgorithm based on the BL (Bottom-Left) strategy to arrange sample pieces in a given order, and \neach iteration process passed through two adjacent sample pieces exchange strategy to change \norder. At the same time, the BL strategy is used to achieve optimal nesting of leather products. In\n2003, Yong Chen [24] present a heuristic approach to deal with the irregular nesting problem without \norientation limitation using Genetic Simulated Annealing Algorithm. In 2006\uff0cBurke et al. [5]\nproposed a new heuristic algorithm combined hill climbing and tabu local search methods and used \nthe BLF (Bottom-Left-Fill) strategy to optimize the nesting problem. The algorithm is also suitable \nfor curved contour with circular arcs and holes. In 2007\uff0cBurke et al. [6] proposed a robust NFP \n(no-fit polygon) generation algorithm based on the track line, the algorithm can be used to the case \nthat the motherboard contains holes. In 2008, Lee WC [7] proposed a QLM (quick location and \nmovement) algorithm to solve the multiple irregular motherboards arrangement of irregular sample \npieces. The algorithm approximates the irregular sample pieces to polygons and utilizes the \nminimum embedding circle center and the gravity center of the irregular sample piece as a reference \npoint to layout the irregular sample pieces on the motherboards. In 2010, Burke [8] proposed a \nmethod using NFP for collision detection. In 2014, Baldacci et al. [9] proposed a hybrid heuristic \nalgorithm, which was used to solve the optimization problem of the 2D irregular sample pieces on \nmultiple irregular motherboards, and also considering the motherboard with holes. The sample \npieces and the motherboards were converted to raster representation. In 2015, MirHassani [10]\nproposed the GRASP (Greedy randomized adaptive search procedure) meta-heuristic algorithm to \nsolve the nesting problem with high quality data proper time. This algorithm does not depend on the \nshape of the sample piece. In 2018 Mundim [22] proposed H4NP for all 2D nesting problems with \nComputer-Aided Design & Applications, 18(2), 2021, 242-257\n\u00a9 2021 CAD Solutions, LLC, http://www.cad-journal.net\n244\nlimited-size containers, and test it on 1100 instances, H4NP obtained equal or better solutions for \n73% of the instances. In 2019 Andr\u00e9 Kubagawa Sato [23] use the dotted board model to reduce the \noverlap evaluation to matrix operations, and then it can be accelerated by massive parallelization \nusing the GPU. In 2020, Santiago V. Ravelo [25] shows that multi-objective criteria to classifying \nsolutions may make the results more accurate and they also give a heuristic algorithm and two \nmeta-heuristic approaches to the problem.\n(2) Two-dimensional nesting problem based on an intelligent algorithm.

Tsuzuki\nAdditional information is available at the end of the chapter\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5772/50302\n1. Introduction\nSimulated annealing has been applied to a wide range of problems: combinatorial and\ncontinuous optimizations. This work approaches a new class of problems in which the\nobjective function is discrete but the parameters are continuous. This type of problem arises in\nrotational irregular packing problems. It is necessary to place multiple items inside a container\nsuch that there is no collision between the items, while minimizing the items occupied area.\nA feedback is proposed to control the next candidate probability distribution, in order to\nincrease the number of accepted solutions. The probability distribution is controlled by\nthe so called crystallization factor. The proposed algorithm modifies only one parameter\nat a time. If the new configuration is accepted then a positive feedback is executed to\nresult in larger modifications. Different types of positive feedbacks are studied herein. If\nthe new configuration is rejected, then a negative feedback is executed to result in smaller\nmodifications. For each non-placed item, a limited depth binary search is performed to find a\nscale factor that, when applied to the item, allows it to be fitted in the layout. The proposed\nalgorithm was used to solve two different rotational puzzles. A geometrical cooling schedule\nis used. Consequently, the proposed algorithm can be classified as simulated quenching.\nThis work is structured as follows. Section 2 presents some simulated annealing and\nsimulated quenching key concepts. In section 3 the objective function with discrete values and\ncontinuous parameters is explained. Section 4 explains the proposed adaptive neighborhood\nbased on the crystallization factor. Section 5 explains the computational experiments and\nsection 6 presents the results. Finally, section 7 rounds up the work with the conclusions.\n2. Background\nSimulated annealing is a probabilistic meta-heuristic with a capacity of escape from local\nminima. It came from the Metropolis algorithm and it was originally proposed in the area\nof combinatorial optimization [9], that is, when the objective function is defined in a discrete\n\u00a92012 Tsuzuki et al., licensee InTech.

The simulated annealing was modified in order to apply to the optimization of\nmultimodal functions defined on continuous domain [4]. The choices of the cooling schedule\nand of the next candidate distribution are the most important decisions in the definition of a\nsimulated annealing algorithm [13]. The next candidate distribution for continuous variables\nis discussed herein.\nIn the discrete domain, such as the traveling salesman and computer circuit design problems,\nthe parameters must have discrete values; the next point candidate xk+1 corresponds to a\npermutation in the list of cities to be visited, interchanges of circuit elements, or other discrete\noperation. In the continuous application of simulated annealing a new choice of the next point\ncandidate must be executed. Bohachevsky et al. [1] proposed that the next candidate xk+1 can\nbe obtained by first generating a random direction vector u, with |u| = 1, then multiplying it\nby a fixed step size \u0394r, and summing the resulting vector to the current candidate point xk.\nBrooks & Verdini [2] showed that the selection of \u0394r is a critical choice. They observed that an\nappropriate choice of this parameter is strictly dependent on the objective function F(x), and\nthe appropriate value can be determined by presampling the objective function.\nThe directions in [1] are randomly sampled from the uniform distribution and the step size is\nthe same in each direction. In this way, the feasible region is explored in an isotropic way and\nthe objective function is assumed to behave in the same way in each direction. But this is not\noften the case. The step size to define the next candidate point xk+1 should not be equal for all\nthe directions, but different directions should have different step sizes; i.e. the space should\nbe searched in an anisotropic way. Corana et al. [4] explored the concept of anisotropic search;\nthey proposed a self-tuning simulated annealing algorithm in which the step size is configured\nin order to maintain a number of accepted solutions. At each iteration k, a single variable of\nxk is modified in order to obtain a new candidate point xk+1, and iterations are subdivided\ninto cycles of n iterations during which each variable is modified. The new candidate point is\nobtained from xk in the following form xk+1 = xk + v \u00b7 \u0394ri \u00b7 ei. Where v is a uniform random\nnumber in [\u22121, 1], and \u0394ri is the step size along direction ei of the i-th axis. The anisotropy is\nobtained by choosing different values of \u0394ri for all the directions. The step size is kept fixed\nfor a certain number of cycles of variables, and the fraction of accepted moves in direction ei\nis calculated. If the fraction of accepted moves generated in the same direction is below 0.4,\nthen the step size \u0394ri along ei is decreased. It is assumed that the algorithm is using too large\nsteps along ei thus causing many moves to be rejected. If the fraction is between 0.4 and 0.6\nthe step size is left unchanged. If the fraction is above 0.6 then \u0394ri is increased. It is assumed\nthat the step size is too small thus causing many moves to be accepted.\nThis procedure may not be the best possible to process the different behavior of the objective\nfunction along different axes. Ingber [7] proposed that the random variable should follow a\nCauchy distribution with different sensitivities at different temperatures. The maximum step\nsize is kept constant during the algorithm and it allows escaping from local minima even at\nlow temperatures. The parameter space can have completely different sensitivities for each\ndimension, therefore the use of different temperatures for each dimension is suggested. This\nmethod is often referred to as very fast simulated re-annealing (VFSR) or adaptive simulated\nannealing (ASA). The sensitivity of each parameter is given by the partial derivative of the\nfunction with relation to the i-th dimension [3].\n4 Simulated Annealing \u2013 Advances, Applications and Hybridizations\nAdaptive Neighborhood Heuristics for Simulated Annealing over Continuous Variables 3\n3. Integer objective function with float parameters\nIrregular packing problems arise in the industry whenever one must place multiple items\ninside a container such that there is no collision between the items, while minimizing the\narea occupied by the items. It can be shown that even restricted versions of this problem (for\ninstance, limiting the polygon shape to rectangles only) are NP complete, which means that\nall algorithms currently known for optimal solutions require a number of computational steps\nthat grow exponentially with the problem size rather than according to a polynomial function\n[5]. Usually probabilistic heuristics relax the original constraints of the problem, allowing the\nsearch to go through points outside the space of valid solutions and applying penalization to\ntheir cost. This technique is known as external penalization. The most adopted penalization\nheuristic for external solutions of packing problems is to apply a penalization based on\nthe overlapping area of colliding items. While this heuristic leads to very computationally\nefficient iterations of the optimization process, the layout with objective function in minimum\nvalue may have overlapped items [6].\nFig. 1 shows an example in which the c...",

Brown (Brown, 1971) introduced an\noptimum packing and depletion problem with\noptimization of space and resource usage. Harvey (Salkin\nand De Kluyver, 1975) surveyed the application of\nmathematical optimization models such as linear\nprogramming to the knapsack problem. Bruce (Golden,\n1976) surveyed various approaches to the cutting stock\nproblem. Hinxman (Hinxman, 1980) surveyed the trim\u0002loss and assortment problems, this research paid more\nattention to cutting and packaging problems in practical\napplications, and did not mention much about theoretical\nmethods. Garey and Coffman (Garey and Johnson, 1981;\nCoffman et al., 1984) surveyed the approximation algorithms\nfor bin packing problems. Israni (Israni and Sanders, 1982)\nreviewed the 2D cutting stock problem including almost all\n2D packaging problems. The author also proposed a\nrectangular layout method. Sarin (Sarin, 1983) reviewed\nmethodologies and literature to solve 2D stock cutting\nproblems and introduced an interactive optimization\nprocedure for a general 2D stock cutting problem.\nDyckhoff (Dyckhoff et al., 1985) described a trim loss and\nrelated problems and categorized them briefly. Dudzi\u0144ski\n(Dudzi\u0144ski and Walukiewicz, 1987) summarized the exact\nmethods for knapsack problems, such as linear\nprogramming. Matthias (Rode and Rosenberg, 1987)\nanalyzed the algorithm for the trim-loss problems.\nHaessler (Haessler and Sweeney, 1991) reviewed the\nsolution process of cutting stock problems, including\nplacement algorithm and sequence optimization algorithm.\nDowsland (Dowsland and Dowsland, 1992) reviewed the\napplication of operations research methods to the packing\nproblem and summarized some exact heuristics. Sweeney\n(Sweeney and Paternoster, 1992) categorized cutting and\npacking problems and made application-oriented research\nrecords. Cheng (Cheng et al., 1994) discussed 2D cutting\nstock problems and their application cases including the\nTABLE 1 Review literature in the field of cutting and packing problems.\nAuthor Title Journal Year\nBrown Optimum packing and depletion Book 1971\nSalkin The knapsack problem: A survey Naval Research Logistics Quarterly 1975\nGolden Approaches to the Cutting Stock Problem A I E Transactions 1976\nHinxman The trim-loss and assortment problems: A survey European Journal of Operational Research 1980\nGarey Approximation Algorithms for Bin Packing Problems: A Survey Book 1981\nIsrani Two-dimensional cutting stock problem research: A review and a new rectangular layout algorithm Journal of Manufacturing Systems 1982\nSarin Two-Dimensional Stock Cutting Problems and Solution Methodologies Journal of Engineering for Industry 1983\nCoffman Approximation Algorithms for Bin-Packing \u2014 An Updated Survey Book 1984\nDyckhoff Trim loss and related problems Omega 1985\nDudzi\u0144ski Exact methods for the knapsack problem and its generalizations European Journal of Operational Research 1987\nRode An analysis of heuristic trim-loss algorithms Engineering Costs and Production Economics 1987\nDyckhoff A typology of cutting and packing problems European Journal of Operational Research 1990\nHaessler Cutting stock problems and solution procedures European Journal of Operational Research 1991\nDowsland Packing problems European Journal of Operational Research 1992\nSweeney Cutting and Packing Problems: A Categorized, Application-Orientated Research Bibliography Journal of the Operational Research Society 1992\nCheng The cutting stock problem \u2014 a survey International Journal of Production Economics 1994\nDowsland Solution approaches to irregular nesting problems European Journal of Operational Research 1995\nMavridou Simulated Annealing and Genetic Algorithms for the Facility Layout Problem: A Survey Computational Optimization and Applications 1997\nHopper Application of Genetic Algorithms to Packing Problems \u2014 A Review Conference paper 1998\nHopper A genetic algorithm for a 2D industrial packing problem Computers and Indu...",

This problem is approached with an heuristic based on Simulated Annealing (SA) with adaptive neighborhood. Traditional \u201cexternal penalization\u201d techniques are avoided through the application of the no\u2013fit polygon, that determinates the collision-free area for each polygon before its placement. The SA controls continuous and discrete parameters. The rotation applied and the translation of the polygon are continuous parameters, and the sequence of placement is represented as a set of discrete parameters. For each non\u2013placed item, a limited depth binary search is performed to find a scale factor that when applied to the item, would allow it to be fitted in the container.\n\n- [Previous article in issue](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1474667015355488)\n- [Next article in issue](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1474667015355506)\n\n## Keywords\n\nSimulated Annealing\n\nPlacement Problems\n\nOptimization\n\nProbabilistic Heuristics\n\n[View PDF](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S147466701535549X/pdf?md5=7bca88c33d2daef044751913b4156e2b&pid=1-s2.0-S147466701535549X-main.pdf)\n\nSpecial issue articlesRecommended articles\n\n## References\n\n01.

The hybrid simulated annealing algorithm uses the modified penalty algorithm to generate an initial solution and then improves it using simulated annealing. It is tested on single-row layout problems with facilities of unequal area and multi-row layout problems with facilities of equal area. The algorithm produced solutions better than those previously reported in the literature for two of the larger single-row problems and five multi-row layout problems. For all the other single-row problems and eight of ten multi-row layout test problems, it produced the best known solutions. The hybrid simulated annealing algorithm appears to produce better quality solutions than the simulated annealing and tabu navigation algorithms, but requires more computation time than simulated annealing.\n\nSpecial issue articlesRecommended articles\n\n- R.E.

Many heuristic algorithms can apply the 2-opt local search to find better solutions. In complete 2-opt local search, every valid neighboring solutions of swapping mechanism will be compared, which is very time consuming especially when a sequential algorithm is adopted. Nowadays, graphic processing units (GPUs) have evolved into powerful and flexible parallel computation platforms that have been widely used to accelerate the solving of NP-hard problems. Therefore, in this study, we focus on how to use GPUs to solve the single-row facility layout problem (SRFLP) with the 2-opt-based simulated annealing (SA) heuristic algorithm. As far as we know, this study is the first to solve SRFLP by using a GPU. After analyzing the fitness function and the move gains calculation between parent and child solutions, we propose a prefix-sum formula table to eliminate a large amount of replicated computation. To calculate move gains for the 2-opt local search during each iteration, many GPU threads are created and they construct and lookup the table in parallel. According to experimental results, if the prefix-sum formula table is not adopted, the GPU version outperforms the sequential CPU counterpart with the best speedup of 123. However, if the table is used in the GPU version, the best speedup can reach up to 3208. Because the proposed parallelization approach with the prefix-sum formula table is based on the features of the 2-opt local search and the SRFLP fitness function, it can be applied to any 2-opt-based heuristic algorithm for solving SRFLP even though the SA algorithm is used in this study.\n\n- ### [A GRASP algorithm for solving large-scale single row facility layout problems](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305054819300486)\n\n\n\n2019, Computers and Operations Research\n\n\n\nShow abstract\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe single-row facility layout problem (SRFLP) is an NP-hard problem, which consists of arranging facilities along a straight line in order to minimize the weighted sum of distances between all pairs of facilities. In this paper, an implementation of the Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP) meta-heuristic is presented to solve large-scale instances of the problem. The novelty of the proposed implementation is that it is endowed with a diversification phase based on frequency memory. The algorithm was tested on 93 instances with sizes up to one thousand facilities. To date, in the literature, there is only one work, which has considered instances of such magnitude. Computational experiments demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm, which improved the best-known values for 29 out of 93 instances.\n\n- ### [Mathematical modeling and multi-start search simulated annealing for unequal-area facility layout problem](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417417305274)\n\n\n\n2018, Expert Systems with Applications\n\n\n\nShow abstract\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this paper, a mixed integer nonlinear programming model (MINLP) is ...",

Engineers usually mathematically model a problem and create a function that must be minimized, like cost, required time, wasted material, etc. Eventually, the function must be maximized. This function has different names in the literature: objective function, cost function, etc. We will refer to it in the chapter as objective function. There is a wide range of possibilities for the problems and they can be classified in different ways. At first, the values of the parameters can be continuous, discrete (integers), cyclic (angles), intervals, and combinatorial. The result of the objective function can be continuous, discrete (integers) or intervals. One very difficult class of problems have continuous parameters and discrete objective function, this type of objective function has very weak sensibility. This chapter shows the versatility of the simulated annealing showing that it can have different possibilities of parameters and objective functions.\n\n### Keywords\n\n- Simulated Annealing\n- Optimization Problems\n- Cutting Packing\n- Electrical Impedance Tomography\n- Topological Optimization\n- Curve Interpolation\n\n## Author Information\n\nShow +\n\n- #### Tiago G.

Introduction\n\nOptimization problems are common in engineering, and the problem must be optimized regarding one function (usually called as cost function). The cost function has several parameters used to model the optimization problem. Several methods have been proposed in the literature to optimize functions, and the method is selected according the cost function and parameters characteristics.\n\nDeterministic methods usually have an initial point, called as seed. Using the gradient of the cost function, the optimization method starts on the initial point and converges to the optimal parameter value. The parameters are usually continuous \\[ [1](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/77426#B1)\\]. However, engineering problems have problems which cannot be solved by this approach.\n\nSome cost functions have several minimum, and the convergence strongly depends on the seed (or initial point). To overcome this issue, several meta-heuristics were proposed, like Genetic Algorithms (GA) \\[ [2](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/77426#B2), [3](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/77426#B3)\\], Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) \\[ [4](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/77426#B4)\\], Simulated Annealing (SA) \\[ [5](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/77426#B5)\\], and others. Optimization methods based on meta-heuristics do not need the gradient information. For some problems, it is very hard to determine the gradient. This is particularly true for problems with discrete cost function. The existing meta-heuristics, usually, are focused on some specific type of parameters. For example, PSO can be applied to engineering problems with continuous parameters. GA can be applied to engineering problems with integer or fixed precision parameters.\n\nSA was first proposed to solve combinatorial problems \\[ [5](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/77426#B5)\\]. Later on, Corana et al. \\[ [6](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/77426#B6)\\] extended the SA to incorporate continuous parameters. It was shown that the proposal made by Corana et al. \\[ [6](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/77426#B6)\\] only converged to the global optimum in specific problems. Ingber \\[ [7](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/77426#B7)\\] improved the SA to overcome this issue, however he used the cost function gradient for some calculations. Martins and Tsuzuki \\[ [8](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/77426#B8)\\] proposed the SA with crystallization heuristic which does not use any gradient information.\n\nThis chapter shows the versatility of the SA with crystallization heuristic. Initially, the SA with crystallization heuristic is explained in Section 2. It was used to solve different problems related to Cutting and Packing, particularly the case with discrete cost function and cyclic continuous parameters \\[ [8](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/77426#B8), [9](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/77426#B9), [10](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/77426#B10)\\] will be explained in Section 3. A third application is Topological Optimization (TO), it has a large number of parameters, like the EIT problem. This applic...",
