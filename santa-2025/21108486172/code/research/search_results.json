      "title": "ANSWER",
      "text": "Two\u2011tree unit lattice packings are a simple yet effective pattern used in the Santa\u202f2025 \u201cChristmas\u2011tree\u201d packing challenge. In this approach the solution space is tiled with a repeating **lattice of two trees**, where each lattice cell contains a pair of trees placed side\u2011by\u2011side. Crucially the pair is oriented **alternately \u201cup\u201d and \u201cdown\u201d** (i.e., one tree points upward while the other is inverted), so the whole packing consists of a regular grid of these up\u2011down pairs\u202f([kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/santa-2025/discussion/665669)).\n\nThe alternating up\u2011down orientation improves efficiency because the inverted tree fills the voids left by the upright tree, allowing the two shapes to interlock more tightly. This reduces the amount of unused space between neighboring trees and raises the overall packing density, which in practice translates into higher competition scores (e.g., a score just above\u202f74 was achieved by using this pattern)\u202f([kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/santa-2025/discussion/665669)).",

      "text": "[iframe](about:blank)\n\nTable of Contents\n\nExpand\n\nTable of Contents\n\n- [The Christmas Tree Options Strategy](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/christmastree.asp#toc-what-is-a-christmas-tree-options-strategy)\n\n- [How Christmas Trees Work](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/christmastree.asp#toc-how-christmas-trees-work)\n\n- [Examples](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/christmastree.asp#toc-examples)\n\n\nClose\n\n## What Is a Christmas Tree Options Strategy?\n\nA Christmas tree is an [options trading](https://www.investopedia.com/options-basics-tutorial-4583012) spread strategy achieved by buying and selling six call (or six put) options with different strikes but the same expiration dates for a neutral to bullish forecast. When using calls, the strategy is termed a long call Christmas tree. It is a put Christmas tree when the trader uses put options.\n\nThe strategy is available long (bullish) or short (bearish).\n\nThis spread is essentially the combination of a long vertical spread and two short vertical spreads.\n\n### Key Takeaways\n\n- A Christmas tree is an options spread strategy that involves 6 call (or put) options: buying one ATM call (put) selling 3x calls (puts) two strikes out of the money and then buy 2x more call (put) three strikes out of the money.\n- This strategy pays off with a neutral to slightly bullish outcome in the underlying security.\n- Christmas trees can be constructed with either all calls or all puts and may be structured as either long or short.\n\n## How Christmas Trees Work\n\nThe Christmas tree name comes from the strategy's very loose resemblance to a tree when viewed on an options chain display. The connection is tenuous at best.\n\nChristmas trees are similar to [butterfly spreads](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/butterflyspread.asp) in that they use multiple [vertical spreads](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/verticalspread.asp) to box in a desired potential return. The difference is that one of the strike prices is skipped, which introduces a directional bias.\n\nFor instance, if a condor spread involved the 50-55-60-65 strikes, the corresponding Christmas tree would involve just the 50-55-65 strikes (skipping the 60 strike).\n\nThe regular, or long Christmas tree with calls (sometimes referred to simply as a \"call tree\"), involves buying one call option with an [at-the-money](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/atthemoney.asp) strike, skipping the next strike, and then selling three options with the following strike. Finally, buy two more calls with the next higher strike. The 1-3-2 structure supposedly appears as a tree.\n\nThe strategy profits from a small increase in the price of the underlying asset and maxes when the underlying closes at the middle option strike price at options expiration.\n\n- Maximum profit equals middle [strike](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/strikeprice.asp) minus lower strike minus the premium.\n- Maximum loss is the net debit paid for the strategy.\n- Breakeven occurs at the lowest strike plus the premium paid or the highest strike minus half the premium.\n\nTime decay is on the holder's side as the holder wants all options except the lowest to expire worthless.\n\n## Examples\n\n### Long Christmas Tree With Calls\n\nFor example, with the underlying asset at $50.00:\n\n- Buy 1 call strike price 50.00\n- Sell 3 calls strike price 54.00\n- Buy 2 calls strike price 56.00\n\n### Long Christmas Tree With Puts\n\nWith this strategy, the holder is neutral to bearish. Sometimes referred to simply as a \"put tree.\"\n\n- Buy 1 put strike price 50.00\n- Sell 3 puts strike price 46.00\n- Buy 2 puts strike price 44.00\n\nMaximum profit is at an underlying asset price of 48.00 at expiration.\n\n- Maximum profit equals middle strike minus higher strike minus the premium.\n- Maximum loss is the net debit paid for the strategy.\n- Breakeven occurs at the lower strike plus half the premium paid or the highest strike minus the premium.\n\nMaximum loss is the premium paid to initiate the strategy.\n\n### Short Christmas Tree With Calls\n\nShort strategies should result in a net credit to the account when initiated. This strategy profits when the underlying asset moves by a minimum direction in either direction but it is capped. The bias is bearish because it does not take much of a move lower in the underlying asset to make the strategy profitable. However, a larger move higher may also result in a profit.\n\n- Sell 1 call strike price 50.00\n- Buy 3 calls strike price 54.00\n- Sell 2 calls strike price 56.00\n\nThe maximum profit is the net credit received.\n\n### Short Christmas Tree With Puts\n\nThis strategy results in a net credit to the account and profits when the underlying moves by a minimum in either direction. Profits come quicker with a smaller upside move although a larger downside move would also be profitable. Therefore, this strategy leans bullish.\n\n- Sell 1 put strike price 50.00\n- Buy 3 puts strike price 46.00\n- Sell 2 puts strike price 44.00\n\nThe maximum profit is the net credit received.\n\nTake the Next Step to Invest\n\nAdvertiser Disclosure\n\n\u00d7\n\nThe offers that appear in this table are from partnerships from which Investopedia receives compensation.

No Python, no JavaScript, no external code \u2014the database does everything.\n## *The puzzle : Can we fit all these weirdly-shaped presents under the tree?*\nToday\u2019s puzzle is the grand finale: a 2D bin-packing problem with polyomino presents that can be rotated and flipped, placed on rectangular grids of different sizes. The goal is to count how many of the given regions can accommodate**all**the required presents without overlap.\nClassic exact bin-packing is NP-hard and with real-world input sizes it would take forever\u2026 but this is Advent of Code, so there\u2019s always a trick. On my personal input the trick turned out to be extremely generous:**every region is either obviously impossible or obviously possible**just by looking at the total area and a very loose upper bound on how tightly the shapes can be packed.\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\n![]()\n## The insight\nEach present is made of # cells. If I count the number of # in each of the six standard shapes I get the minimal area that shape occupies:\ncypher\n```\nLET hash\\_per\\_shape = [\nshape IN split($data, &#x27;&#x27;\\\\n\\\\n&#x27;&#x27;)[..-1] |\nsize([c IN split(shape,&#x27;&#x27;) WHERE c = &#x27;#&#x27;])\n]\n```\nFor the example shapes that gives [7,7,7,7,7,7] (all the 3\u00d73-ish shapes need 7 cells).\nNow for each region line (WxH: n0 n1 n2 n3 n4 n5) I can compute two quick checks:\n1. **Obviously impossible**\u2014 the total number of required cells exceeds the grid area W \u00d7H &lt;&lt; \u03a3(ni \u00d7hash\\_per\\_shape[i])\n2. **Obviously possible**\u2014 even if I pack the presents as wastefully as possible (each present surrounded by a 3\u00d73 bounding box), there is still room The loosest regular packing I can guarantee is a 3\u00d73 block per present \u2192at most 9 \u00d7total\\_presents cells are needed. If the grid is big enough to hold that many 3\u00d73 blocks I know a solution exists.\n```\n3\\*floor(W/3) \u00d73\\*floor(H/3) &gt;&gt;= 9 \u00d7(n0+n1+n2+n3+n4+n5)\n```\nOn my input**every single region**satisfied exactly one of these two conditions \u2014there were no borderline cases that needed a real packing algorithm.\n## The almost-one-liner solution (Cypher 25)\n```\nCYPHER 25\n// Minimal area occupied by each shape (count of #)\nLET hash\\_per\\_shape = [\nshape IN split($data, &#x27;&#x27;\\\\n\\\\n&#x27;&#x27;)[..-1] |\nsize([c IN split(shape,&#x27;&#x27;) WHERE c = &#x27;#&#x27;])\n]\n// For each region check the two obvious bounds\nWITH [\nline IN split(split($data, &#x27;&#x27;\\\\n\\\\n&#x27;&#x27;)[-1], &#x27;&#x27;\\\\n&#x27;&#x27;) |\ntoInteger(split(line, &#x27;&#x27;x&#x27;&#x27;)[0]) \\* toInteger(split(split(line, &#x27;&#x27;:&#x27;&#x27;)[0],&#x27;&#x27;x&#x27;&#x27;)[1])\n&lt; reduce(acc=0,\nn IN [ix IN range(0, size(split(line, &#x27; &#x27;)[1..])-1) |\ntoInteger(split(line, &#x27;&#x27; &#x27;&#x27;)[1..][ix]) \\* hash\\_per\\_shape[ix]\n] | acc + n\n)\n] AS nok\\_t, // true = definitely too small\n[\nline IN split(split($data, &#x27;&#x27;\\\\n\\\\n&#x27;&#x27;)[-1], &#x27;&#x27;\\\\n&#x27;&#x27;) |\n3\\*(toInteger(split(line, &#x27;&#x27;x&#x27;&#x27;)[0])/3) \\*\n3\\*(toInteger(split(split(line, &#x27;&#x27;:&#x27;&#x27;)[0],&#x27;&#x27;x&#x27;&#x27;)[1])/3)\n&gt;&gt;= 9 \\* reduce(acc=0, n IN split(line, &#x27;&#x27; &#x27;&#x27;)[1..] | acc + toInteger(n))\n] AS ok\\_t // true = definitely fits (3\u00d73 packing)\nRETURN\nsize([b IN ok\\_t WHERE b]) AS part1, // regions that obviously fit\nsize([b IN nok\\_t WHERE b]) AS obviously\\_too\\_small,\nany(ix IN range(0,size(ok\\_t)-1) WHERE NOT (ok\\_t[ix] OR nok\\_t[ix])) AS edge\\_cases\\_needed\n```\nSo the answer is known, we didn\u2019t have to solve a single real packing instance.

Although tree-representations of this problem have been presented in the open literature extensively, the binary tree representation is shown in this work to be capable of capturing any configuration of such rectangular shapes in two-dimensional space, such as rotations through right angles and translations, and to be advantageous and more general over other approaches when local search [optimization procedures](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/optimisation-procedure) are to be utilized. The construction is such that these boxes must be bound together in pairs having a common edge, and can be extended to contain constrains regarding vertical or horizontal space between the actual objects as well as special types of cuts, e.g. guillotine cuts used in the glass cutting industry. Finally, a simple continuous sheet application is shown as a demonstration of the capabilities of the algorithm in connection with a local search method, specifically threshold accepting.\n\n## Section snippets\n\n## Introduction and literature survey\n\nThis paper presents a methodology suitable for local search methods when these are applied to two-dimensional space partitioning problems. Such problems include the trim loss minimization problem, which finds many applications, as for example in the cutting of two-dimensional shapes from wood, marble, glass, fabric, etc. In these applications the loss of material due to the placement and cutting constraints is the issue of concern and its minimization is the goal of related optimization\n\n## Local search methods: an overview\n\nAlthough the above sited literature is not an exhaustive attempt to account for the enormous bulk of work appearing on the theme topic of this paper, nonetheless it is considered as a representative cross section of advances and ideas in the field as it currently stands. Motivated by the work sited, and from continuous bibliographical search, we observe that interestingly there is still a missing ingredient in terms of an adequate representation of the two-dimensional rectangle packing (or\n\n## The binary tree data structure for rectangle placement and cutting\n\nThe placement of rectangles within a larger piece of cutting stock material (slabs) is considered in this section. Effectively, what will follow is an algorithmic description and elaboration as to how this is achieved using a binary tree, and how various operational constraints can be encapsulated into the moves associated with local search algorithms, such as SA and TA outlined in the previous section.\n\n## Computational demonstration\n\nThe binary tree data structure was implemented within a threshold accepting standard algorithm in C++. The runs were conducted on a Pentium III 750\u00a0MHz computer, using _Bloodshed DevCpp_, a C++ integrated development environment, interfacing _GNU_ C++ on a Windows NT operating system. CPU times are reported in the text within a range, since to obtain a good solution stochastic search methods have to be run from different starting points.\n\nTwo main case studies are presented, focusing on a finite\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis paper has presented a general purpose binary tree data structure for the representation of rectangle layout problems. This representation has been demonstrated to be able to encapsulate both requirements for cost (area) minimization and compaction, and also to be able to capture other operational constraints, such as traverses of objects placed on stock material slabs.\n\nComputational results have been also presented, not so much as to fine-tune a specific optimization procedure, but to\n\n## Acknowledgement\n\nThe author would like to thank Mr. Jose Ignacio Marin Alberdi for the many useful discussions during the development of this work.\n\nSpecial issue articlesRecommended articles\n\n- Beasley, J.

CSP arises when customers require smaller size products and firms need to cut large stock materials efficiently to meet the customer demand; hence, the cutting process becomes an essential transformation technique in production processes immersed in different industries.\n\n\n\n\n\nShow abstract\n\nThe Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is characterized by digitalization, networking, and smartness, which opens a world of the interconnection of all things and makes mass personalization possible. As a result, traditional industrial firms are forced to change their operation mode from the manufacture-oriented one to the manufacture-and-service-oriented type. In particular, furniture production is a typical domain featured by mass personalization from networking, where order selection (service aspect) and board cutting (manufacture aspect) are mainly concerned. We formulate customized furniture production as a multi-objective optimization problem and propose two algorithms to solve it, i.e., an integrated algorithm and a tw...",

The rotation of items is not allowed. In this paper we present a new algorithm for solving OPP-2, based on the characterization of solutions using interval graphs proposed by Fekete and Schepers. The algorithm uses _MPQ_-trees - combinatorial structures introduced by Korte and M\u00f6hring.\n\nSpecial issue articlesRecommended articles\n\n- R.
