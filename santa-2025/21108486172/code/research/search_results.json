We expect a fun puzzle. We get a nightmare of Combinatorial Optimization.\nThis year\u2019s edition,**\u201cSanta 2025: The Christmas Tree Packing Challenge,\u201d**is no exception. The goal? Pack $N$ irregular \u201cTree Polygons\u201d into the smallest possible square bounding box for $N=1$ to $200$.\nIf you checked the leaderboard today (Dec 21), you noticed a trend:**Reinforcement Learning (RL) is getting crushed.**\nDespite the massive hype around \u201cReasoning Models\u201d and PPO agents this year, the top 100 teams aren\u2019t using neural networks. They are using 1980s physics simulations. Here is why the \u201cOld School\u201d is winning, and how the pros are using LLMs to cheat the system.\n## The Problem: Why RL Hates \u201cPacking\u201d\nOn paper, this looks like a game.*Place a tree, check for overlap, repeat.*Perfect for a DQN agent, right?\nWrong. The geometry kills the gradient.\n1. **Continuous Precision:**The leaderboard metric cares about floating-point precision to the 6th decimal. RL agents (which output discrete actions or probability distributions) struggle to make the \u201cmicro-adjustments\u201d needed to squeeze a tree into a 0.001mm gap.\n2. **The \u201cCollision\u201d Cliff:**In packing, a move is either valid (reward = 1) or it overlaps by a pixel (reward = -100). This sparse, binary feedback loop makes it nearly impossible for an agent to \u201clearn\u201d a gradient. It doesn\u2019t know*how*to fix the overlap, just that it failed.## The Solution: Simulated Annealing (on Steroids)\nThe \u201cSecret Sauce\u201d currently dominating the leaderboard is**Simulated Annealing (SA)**combined with**Lattice Generation**.\nInstead of training a model to*predict*the position, teams are writing physics engines that*shake*the box.\n* **High Temperature:**Randomly spin and throw trees into the box (Explorer Phase).\n* **Low Temperature:**Jiggle the trees by microscopic amounts to resolve collisions (Exploiter Phase).\nThe best solutions right now use a \u201cHybrid\u201d strategy:\n* **N &lt; 58:**Use Simulated Annealing to find unstructured, chaotic packings.\n* **N &gt; 58:**Switch to \u201cCrystalline Packing\u201d (regular geometric lattices) which is mathematically superior for large numbers.## The Twist: How LLMs are Actually Helping\nIf RL is dead, where is the AI?\nTop competitors aren\u2019t using LLMs to*solve*the puzzle; they are using LLMs to**write the solver**.\nPython is too slow for 10 billion annealing steps. The meta this year is to prompt Gemini 3 or Claude to:\n\u201cRewrite this Python overlap-check function in Rust/C++ with AVX2 vectorization.\u201d\nWe are seeing \u201cHybrid\u201d workflows where the**Human**defines the heuristics, the**LLM**writes the highly optimized C++ kernels, and**Simulated Annealing**does the heavy lifting.\n## The Starter Code: A Simple Annealer\nIf you want to jump in before the January deadline, don\u2019t start with PyTorch. Start here.\nHere is a conceptual snippet for a \u201cPerturbation\u201d mover \u2014the heart of any good annealing solution.\n```\nimport numpy as np\nimport math\ndef anneal(layout, max\\_temps=10000):\n# layout: Array of [x, y, rotation] for N trees\ncurrent\\_score = calculate\\_area(layout)\ntemperature = 1.0\ncooling\\_rate = 0.9995\nfor i in range(max\\_temps):\n# 1.

You have 40 days. Put down the Neural Network and pick up a physics textbook.\n*(****Discussion:****Are you using a Lattice approach or pure Annealing for N=200?

Grenoble Alpes, CNRS, Grenoble INP*, G-SCOP, 38000 Grenoble, France, luc.libralesso@grenoble-inp.fr\nIn this article, we introduce PackingSolver, a new solver for two-dimensional two- and three-staged guil\u0002lotine Packing Problems. It relies on a simple yet powerful anytime tree search algorithm called Memory\nBounded A* (MBA*). This algorithm was first introduced in Libralesso and Fontan (2020) for the 2018\nROADEF/EURO challenge glass cutting problem\u2020, for which it had been ranked first during the final phase.\nIn this article, we generalize it for a large variety of Cutting and Packing problems. The resulting program\ncan tackle two-dimensional Bin Packing, Multiple Knapsack, and Strip Packing Problems, with two- or\nthree-staged exact or non-exact guillotine cuts, the orientation of the first cut being imposed or not, and\nwith or without item rotation. Despite its simplicity and genericity, computational experiments show that\nthis approach is competitive compared to the other dedicated algorithms from the literature. It even returns\nstate-of-the-art solutions on several variants. The combination of efficiency, ability to provide good solutions\nfast, simplicity and versatility makes it particularly suited for industrial applications, which require quickly\ndeveloping algorithms implementing several business-specific constraints.\nKey words : two-dimensional guillotine packing, bin packing, knapsack, strip packing, anytime algorithm,\ntree search algorithm\n\u2217\nInstitute of Engineering Univ.

Hence the need to develop generic tools that require limited adaptations\nto integrate business-specific constraints. To this extent, Mixed Integer (Non-)Linear Programming\nsolvers, Constraint Programming solvers or other optimization solvers are now of great help for the\nOR practitioner (Byrd et al. 2006, Bixby and Rothberg 2007, Benoist et al. 2011). However, due to\ntheir geometrical constraints, Cutting and Packing Problems remain difficult to solve and quickly\ndeveloping efficient algorithms for these problems is still challenging. We aim at filling this gap. In\nthis article, we introduce a new solver dedicated to Cutting and Packing Problems. So far, it focuses\non two-dimensional two- and three-staged guillotine variants (other Cutting and Packing variants\nshould be added in future releases), and it already returns high-quality solutions on more than 15\nvariants studied in the literature. Moreover, it provides an implementation for many other variants\nthat have not been studied yet.\n1. Introduction\nWe consider two-dimensional guillotine Packing Problems: one has to pack rectangles of various\nsizes into larger bins while only edge-to-edge cuts are allowed. In a solution, guillotine cuts can be\npartitioned into stages, i.e. series of parallel cuts, and it is common to limit the number of allowed\nstages. Here, we restrict to two- or three-staged guillotine patterns. In both cases, we consider both\nexact and non-exact variants. In the non-exact variant, an additional cut is allowed to separate\nitems from waste. Figure 1 illustrates the different pattern types.\nWe consider the three main objectives studied in the literature: Bin Packing, Knapsack and Strip\nPacking. In Bin Packing and Strip Packing Problems, all items need to be produced. In Bin Packing\nProblems, the number of used bins is minimized, while in Strip Packing Problems, there is only\none container with one infinite dimension and the objective is to minimize the length used in this\ndimension. In Knapsack Problems, the number of containers is limited, every item has a profit and\nthe total profit of the packed items is maximized.\nFinally, for each variant, we consider the oriented case where item rotation is not allowed and\nnon-oriented case where it is.\nFontan and Libralesso: PackingSolver: a solver for Packing Problems\n3\nJ1\nJ2\nJ3\nJ4\n(a) Non-guillotine pattern\nJ1\nJ2\nJ3\nJ4\nJ5\n(b) Two-staged exact guillotine pattern, first\nstage vertical\nJ1\nJ2\nJ3\nJ4\nJ5\n(c) Two-staged non-exact guillotine pattern, first\nstage vertical\nJ1\nJ2\nJ3 J4\nJ5 J6\nJ7\n(d) Three-staged exact guillotine pattern, first\nstage vertical\nFigure 1 Pattern type examples\nThroughout the article, the different variants are named following our notations illustrated with\nthe following examples:\n\u2022 BPP-O: (non-guillotine) Bin Packing Problem, Oriented\n\u2022 G-BPP-R: Guillotine cuts, Bin Packing Problem, Rotation\n\u2022 2G-KP-O: 2-staged exact guillotine cuts, first cut horizontal or vertical, Knapsack Problem,\nOriented\n\u2022 3NEGH-SPP-O: 3-staged non-exact guillotine cuts, first cut horizontal, Strip Packing Problem,\nOriented\nWe also use the following vocabulary: a k-cut is a cut performed in the k-th stage.

Each day a new puzzle is unlocked and programmers in all the world try to solve them, with various goals in mind: to learn a new language, to improve their skills, to have fun, to help Santa\u2026 This year there were 12 days of puzzles.\n## The Problem\nThe Day 12 2025 problem was on placing presents in a limited space under the Christmas tree. You get presented with 1000 scenarios and you have to figure out for each of them whether it is solvable, meaning that the presents fit into the designated area.\nFor each scenario, the area is rectangular, but its size varies. The presents come in a handful of shapes, but their number varies again. Here is an example of how the 6 pieces can be placed in the given area (here 12x5):\n![A screenshot of a game](https://developer.ansys.com/sites/default/files/inline-images/Picture1.png)\n(The visualization is done via Ansys SpaceClaim scripting by creating the present geometries.)\nNote that the presents can be flipped and rotated in the plane (by multiples of 90\u00b0).\nNow for the actual problems, the number of presents, but also the areas are a lot larger:\n![A screenshot of a computer game](https://developer.ansys.com/sites/default/files/inline-images/Picture2.png)\nBin packing is a hard problem (NP-hard), so in general, this means that often you need to run through all the possibilities to check whether there is any solution (bruteforcing). Of course, you can do so in more and less clever ways, for instance by taking symmetries into account and stopping early if a branch becomes infeasible. My solution implements a backtracking algorithm and stops at the first solution (i.e. it doesn\u2019t try to find a tighter packing).\nIt is able to solve also packing-wise more challenging problems like this:\n![A screenshot of a puzzle](https://developer.ansys.com/sites/default/files/inline-images/Picture3.png)\nHowever, the complexity grows exponentially with the size of the problem and solving it becomes very quickly intractable.\nThere is one caveat, this problem happens to be a \u201ctroll\u201d problem, tricking people into writing much more complicated code than needed (I\u2019m guilty as charged). The scenarios fall in two categories: a) the presents all fit into a 3x3 subregion and there are more than enough 3x3-subregions in the domain (i.e. trivially solvable); b) the total area of all presents is larger than the area of the domain (i.e. trivially non-solvable). There are no problems of the intermediate category (like the last example here) which would need a proper packaging algorithm. It was nonetheless a fun exercise.\n### The Code\nYou can check out Andreas' code here:[https://gist.github.com/andreas-hilti/81d419a90bd6067b16751f9b3cf0677c](https://gist.github.com/andreas-hilti/81d419a90bd6067b16751f9b3cf0677c). However, please bear in mind that this code was written for fun, as part of Advent of Code and does not conform to Ansys' usual standards of code quality. It is also subject to change as further developments are made.\n[![Logo](https://developer.ansys.com/themes/custom/ansys/frontend/src/images/about_us_block.svg \"Logo\")](https://developer.ansys.com/)\n## Connect with Ansys\n[](https://www.youtube.com/user/ansysinc)[](https://twitter.com/AnsysDev)[](https://www.linkedin.com/company/ansys-inc/)[](https://github.com/Ansys)",

Participants are tasked with determining the optimal way to pack Christmas tree toys into the smallest possible square box, allowing Santa Claus to mail them efficiently around the globe. The challenge is to find the dimensions of the smallest square box that can fit between 1 to 200 trees.\nThe competition is designed to encourage innovation and problem-solving skills, with a focus on packing efficiency. Participants are encouraged to submit their solutions, which will be evaluated based on the normalized area of the square bounding box for each puzzle configuration.\n### Description\nThe challenge is inspired by Santa&#x27;s need for the smallest box to fit all the tiny trees for his Christmas deliveries. Participants are required to find the best packing solution to help Santa Claus and win the competition&#x27;s prize.\n### Evaluation\nSubmissions are evaluated on the sum of the normalized area of the square bounding box for each puzzle. The formula for the score is:\n```\n`score = \u2211(sn^2/n)`\n```\nwhere`sn`is the side of the square box bounding the trees and`n`is the total number of trees in the configuration.\n### Submission File\nEach submission must include the tree position (`x`,`y`) and rotation (`deg`) for each`id`in the submission. The values must be converted to a string and prepended with an`s`before submission. Submissions with overlapping trees will result in an error. Location values must be constrained to -100 \u2264x, y \u2264100.\nThe file should have the following format:\n```\n`id,x,y,deg\n001\\_0,s0.0,s0.0,s20.411299\n002\\_0,s0.0,s0.0,s20.411299\n002\\_1,s-0.541068,s0.259317,s51.66348\netc.`\n```\n### Timeline\n* **November 17, 2025**: Start Date\n* **January 23, 2026**: Entry Deadline\n* **January 23, 2026**: Team Merger Deadline\n* **January 30, 2026**: Final Submission Deadline\nAll deadlines are at 11:59 PM UTC unless otherwise noted.\n### Prizes\n* **First Prize**: $12,000\n* **Second Prize**: $10,000\n* **Third Prize**: $10,000\n* **Fourth Prize**: $8,000\nAdditionally, a**Rudolph Prize**of $10,000 is awarded to the team holding 1st place on the leaderboard for the longest period of time between November 17, 2025, and January 30, 2026.\n### Citation\nWalter Reade and Ashley Oldacre.

This blog post contains a problem description and the different steps we took to achieve this optimal solution.\n\n**DISCLAIMER:** Bram and I are, by no means, experts in optimization. Nevertheless, we had a lot of fun and learned a lot.\n\n# Problem definition\n\nEach year, Santa organizes a Christmas workshop spanning 100 days, allowing 5000 families to attend it. Each of the families (consisting of a certain number of family members) can provide a list of their top 10 preferences of days that they would like to attend. As the workshop venue has only a limited capacity (there must be between 125 and 300 attendants each day), it is impossible to grant everyone their first choice. Therefore, compensations are provided to families that do not get their first pick. A family of size N, not getting their first pick would get:\n\n- $50 gift card if they get their second choice\n- $50 gift card and 25% discount (valued at $9) on Santa\u2019s buffet per family member if they get their third choice\n- $100 gift card and 25% discount (valued at $9) on Santa\u2019s buffet per family member for the fourth choice\n- $200 gift card and 25% discount (valued at $9) on Santa\u2019s buffet per family member if they get their fifth choice\n- $200 gift card and 50% discount (valued at $18) on Santa\u2019s buffet per family member corresponding to the sixth choice\n- $300 gift card and free Santa\u2019s buffet (valued at $36) per family member for the seventh choice\n- $400 gift card and free Santa\u2019s buffet (valued at $36) per family member for the eighth choice\n- $500 gift card, free Santa\u2019s buffet (valued at $36) per family member, and 50% off a North Pole Helicopter Ride (value of $199) per family member if they receive their ninth choice\n- $500 gift card, free Santa\u2019s buffet (valued at $36) per family member, and a free North Pole Helicopter Ride (value of $398) per family member otherwise\n\nOh boy, I wouldn\u2019t mind not getting a pick from my top 10 list. I can already imagine myself sitting next to Santa for a helicopter ride over the North Pole. Also, $500 and a free dinner is not too shabby.\n\nUncolored image of Stevens family getting assigned its 10th choice.\n\nBut that\u2019s not all\u2026 There\u2019s also an accounting penalty if we do not uniformly distribute the number of attendants over the 100 days:\n\nThe accounting penalty for not uniformly distributing the number of attendants. N\\_d is the number of attendants for day d and N\\_(d+1) the number of attendants on day d + 1\n\n**The ultimate goal is to create an assignment of these 5000 families to one of the 100 days that minimizes the sum of the preference and accounting costs.**\n\n# Inspecting the data & costs\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at the provided data of the 5000 families. First, let\u2019s check the family sizes:\n\nThe sizes of the 5000 families follow a somewhat normal distribution\n\nSo it seems that the family sizes are somewhat normally distributed with a size of 4 being the mode. Now let\u2019s look at the days provided as first choice:\n\nThe number of families that provided a certain day as first choice.\n\nClearly, day 1 is a very popular one. Actually, the days count backwards, day d means d days before Christmas. As such, day 1 is the day right before Christmas, which explains why it is so popular. Moreover, we see periodical peaks corresponding to weekends. Let\u2019s create a heatmap of the (logarithm of the) preference costs in function of the family size and assigned choice:\n\nA heatmap of the preference costs in function of the family\u2019s assigned choice and its size\n\nFinally, let\u2019s take a look at a heatmap for the log of the accounting costs:\n\nThe accounting cost is always zero when the number of attendants is equal to 125 for that day and is maximal when the number of attendants on the current day is 300 and 125 the next day.\n\n# First approaches: greedy, Hungarian method, genetic algorithms and simulated annealing\n\n## Greedy algorithm\n\nOur first attempt was a very naive one. As the number of attendants each day had to be at least 125, we kept a list of days that did not yet have 125 attendants. We then iterated over each of the families and assigned it to one of its choices that is still in the list. If none of the family\u2019s choices is within that list, we just assigned it to the best choice, ensuring the attendants on that day would not exceed 300.\n\n## Hungarian method\n\nShortly after the launch of the competition, a [blog post](https://opensourc.es/blog/kaggle-santa-2019) was published by opensourc.es which achieved a much better score than what we currently were achieving. His strategy was to ignore the accounting cost, and minimize the preference cost by using the Hungarian method. The vanilla implementation tries to uniformly assign the families (50 per day). We quickly extended that approach by assigning more families to more popular days. We actually tried to solve the following optimization problem for a while: find a 100-dimensional vector **V** of which the elements sum to 5000 (number of famil...",
