I didn\u2019t write a single line of feature engineering. I didn\u2019t tune a single hyperparameter. Instead, I spent my time doing something fundamentally different: I built a system that knows*how*to approach machine learning problems, then pointed it at the competition and watched.\nWhen something broke - and things always break - I didn\u2019t fix the bug. I asked a different question:*What was missing from the system\u2019s understanding?*Then I added that understanding. Not a patch. Not a hotfix. A new piece of institutional knowledge that would prevent entire categories of future failures.\nThis is meta-coding: coding systems that code solutions. And I think it\u2019s where all knowledge work is heading.\n[\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!uetq!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fea8cfe88-c5f0-48eb-80c4-0fd453b381ad_2560x1440.jpeg)\n](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!uetq!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ea8cfe88-c5f0-48eb-80c4-0fd453b381ad_2560x1440.jpeg)\n## **From Solving Problems to Solving Problem-Solving**\nHere\u2019s the traditional workflow for a data scientist entering a Kaggle competition: load the data, explore and clean it, engineer features, try models, tune hyperparameters, iterate until the deadline. Each competition is a fresh start. Sure, you bring experience. But the work is still manual, still problem-specific, still ground-level.\nNow here\u2019s what I actually do: describe the competition to my ML agent, watch it read the problem, set up validation, and run experiments. When it gets stuck, I don\u2019t fix its code - I improve its understanding. That understanding persists. The next competition starts smarter.\nI\u2019ve moved up a level in the stack.\n## **The Architecture of Meta-Coding**\nLet me show you what this looks like concretely. I built a system called ML Planner - an AI agent with specialized knowledge for machine learning workflows. Here\u2019s a simplified view:\n```\n`Agent \u2192Knowledge Layer \u2192Execution Sandbox \u2192Persistent Memory\n(Gemini) \u2022Feature eng. (Python env) (TRAINING\\_LOG.md)\n(Claude) \u2022Validation\n(OpenAI) \u2022GPU management\n\u2022Cost control`\n```\nEach piece of the knowledge layer is mainly text - not code - that teaches the agent how to approach a class of problems. I don\u2019t have a hardcoded feature engineering pipeline. I have*knowledge about*feature engineering: when to use target encoding, how to prevent leakage with[GroupKFold](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.GroupKFold.html), proven hyperparameters for[LightGBM](https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/).\nI don\u2019t have explicit instructions to SSH into GPU instances. The knowledge layer teaches the agent*how to think about*GPU infrastructure: launch instances, monitor jobs, auto-terminate to prevent runaway costs.\n**This is the key insight: knowledge documents are meta-code.**They\u2019re instructions for writing instructions.\n## **This Isn\u2019t Theoretical**\nIf meta-coding sounds abstract, consider[CaseText](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/casetext). Jake Heller founded the company in 2013, got early access to GPT-4 in summer 2022, rebuilt their entire product around it, and sold to Thomson Reuters for $650 million two years later.\nWhat did they build? Not a legal search engine. They encoded*how expert lawyers think*.\nHeller describes their process: \u201cAsk yourself this question - how would the best person in that field do this if they had unlimited time and unlimited resources like a thousand AIs that can all work in, you know, simultaneously to accomplish this task, right? How would the best person do this and work backwards from there, right?\u201d ([\\~11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0h3nAW13ao&amp;t=673s))\nFor legal research, that meant decomposing the task into its reasoning steps: understand the query, ask clarifying questions, make a research plan, execute dozens of searches, read every result carefully, filter for relevance, take notes on*why*something matters, synthesize into an essay, then verify citations. ([\\~11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0h3nAW13ao&amp;t=705))\nEach step became a prompt or piece of deterministic code. The knowledge of how lawyers*actually think*was the product.\nHere\u2019s what struck me most: when their system failed, they didn\u2019t debug code. They debugged understanding. Heller describes building hundreds of test cases, then spending*weeks*refining a single prompt until it passed 97%+ of them. When accuracy plateaued at 60%, most people gave up. CaseText kept grinding on the knowledge layer. ([\\~17:00](https://youtu.be/l0h3nAW13ao?t=1035))\nSubscribe\n## **The New Development Loop**\nIn traditional development, when something breaks, you debug the code: find the cause, fix it, resume. In meta-coding, when something breaks, you debug the thinking: identify missing knowledge, enhance the system\u2019s understanding, resume.\nReal example: My agent was running training jobs on[Lambda Labs](https://lambda.ai/)GPU instances. The jobs would complete, but the instance would keep running - burning $1.50/hour for nothing.\nI could have added a terminate\\_instance() call to the training script. That\u2019s the traditional fix. Instead, I asked:*Why didn\u2019t the agent think to do this?*\nThe answer: the agent didn\u2019t understand the cost model of GPU infrastructure. It was optimizing for correctness, not cost.\nSo I updated the knowledge layer with some knowledge:\n```\n`## Safety and Cost Management\nThe system MUST emphasize cost control for GPU instances:\n- Auto-termination on boot failure, SSH failure, or job completion\n- Instance existence checks before launching new instances\n- Never leave instances running after job completion\n- Boot timeout: auto-terminate if SSH fails within 5 minutes`\n```\nNow the agent*thinks about costs*on every GPU task. Not because I added a termination call to one script, but because I taught it that cost matters. The fix propagates to every future interaction.\n## **What This Looks Like in Practice**\n**Competition 1:[Playground Series S5E11 - Predicting Loan Payback](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s5e11/overview)***Score: 0.92601 AUC | Rank: 729 of 3,726 (top \\~20%)*\nThis is a tabular classification problem: predict whether a borrower will repay their loan. The dataset has a 4:1 class imbalance - 80% of borrowers pay back, 20% default.\nThis is exactly the kind of problem ML Planner was built for. The agent loaded the data, identified the imbalance, set up stratified GroupKFold validation, and ran experiments with LightGBM and XGBoost. When early runs showed inflated CV scores that didn\u2019t transfer to the leaderboard - a classic sign of data leakage - I didn\u2019t debug the pipeline. Instead, I added knowledge about*how to detect and prevent leakage*in temporal financial data. The agent re-ran experiments with that understanding and converged on a clean solution.\n**Competition 2:[Santa 2025 - Christmas Tree Packing Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/competitio...",

The final solution is evaluated by an ensemble score that combines all cases.\n**Notebook Link**:[Santa 2025 - Christmas Tree Packing Challenge V1](https://www.kaggle.com/code/adityapawar327/santa-2025-christmas-tree-packing-challenge-v1)\n**Public Score**: 85.92\n## Table of Contents\n[](#table-of-contents)\n* Library Imports and Environment Setup\n* Global Configuration and Precision Settings\n* ChristmasTree Class Definition\n* Utility Functions (Scoring/Collision)\n* Simulated Annealing Algorithm (N &lt; 20)\n* Grid Search Algorithm (N &gt;= 20)\n* Hybrid &amp; Ensemble Solvers\n* Main Computation Loop (N = 1 to 200)\n* Submission Formatting and Export\n## Methodology\n[](#methodology)\n* **Small N (&lt; 20):**Uses Simulated Annealing for efficient search in small configuration spaces.\n* **Large N (&gt;= 20):**Uses a tailored Grid Search for tractable solution space exploration.\n* **Hybrid/Ensemble:**Runs multiple seeds and chooses the best solution for each N.\n* **Collision Detection:**Employs Shapely geometry operations to prevent tree overlap.\n* **Performance:**Code leverages parallelization (`ProcessPoolExecutor`) and high-precision (Decimal) arithmetic.\n## Usage\n[](#usage)\n1. Install dependencies:\n* `shapely`,`numpy`,`pandas`,`matplotlib`,`tqdm`\n* Run the notebook or script sequentially to output results and save a`submission.csv`.\n* Check the score on important N cases (e.g., 1, 10, 25, 50, 100, 150, 200).\n## Output\n[](#output)\n* The notebook prints key logs during computation.\n* A`submission.csv`is generated with columns:`id`,`x`,`y`,`deg`(example row:`001\\_0, s-9.146226, s-0.12832, s-224.999647`).\n## License\n[](#license)\nThis project is released under the[Apache 2.0 License](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).\n## Author\n[](#author)\nAditya Pawar ([Kaggle Profile](https://www.kaggle.com/adityapawar327))\nFor questions or collaboration, feel free to reach out via Kaggle discussions or connect on[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adityapawar327).\n## About\nIn this re-defined optimization problem, help Santa fit Christmas tree toys into the smallest (2-dimension) parcel size possible so that ...",
