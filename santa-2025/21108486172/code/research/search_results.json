We also want to thank Dominik Krupke for providing a\nhelpful official validator for solutions.\n1 Introduction\nThe recent CG:SHOP 2024 Challenge introduced a variant of irregular packing problems\nknown as the Maximum Polygon Packing (MPP) problem. The MPP problem involves a\nconvex polygonal container C and a polygon set P = {p1, p2, ..., pN }, where polygon piis\nassociated with a value vi. It seeks for a non-overlapping packing with the maximum total\nvalue. The challenge presents a total of 180 instances whose number of polygons ranges from\n28 to 50,000. The official document [4] gives a detailed description of the challenge.\nOur proposed algorithm employs a general process to solve these instances indiscriminately,\nand the overall framework is presented in Figure 1. We first partition a large-scale problem\ninto multiple small-scale subproblems (Section 2) and then solve each subproblem using\nupper-level polygon ordering (Section 3.1) and lower-level packing optimization techniques\n(Section 3.2). Section 4 presents our experimental results, followed by conclusions.\n1 Corresponding author: Zhouxing Su\n\u00a9 Canhui Luo, Zhouxing Su, and Zhipeng L\u00fc;\nlicensed under Creative Commons License CC-BY 4.0\n40th International Symposium on Computational Geometry (SoCG 2024).\nEditors: Wolfgang Mulzer and Jeff M.

It involves two components: partitioning the container C into\nmultiple regions and assigning polygons to each region.\n2.1 Container Partitioning\nThe container partitioning process consists of two steps, as shown in Figure 2. Initially, we\narrange two-dimensional square grids starting from the bottom-left corner of the bounding\nbox until the entire container is covered. The subregions formed by the intersection of the\ncontainer with all the grids constitute its partition C = C1 \u222a C2 \u222a ... \u222a Cm. Subsequently,\nwe merge the small subregions with adjacent grids, which are difficult to be used effectively.\nThe grid is dimensioned to keep the scale of each subproblem at approximately 300 polygons,\nmaking a trade-off between effectiveness and efficiency of lower-level packing optimization.\n2.2 Polygon Assignment\nWe adopt a simple approach of randomly assigning polygons to each subregion. Specifically, for\neach subregion Ci, we randomly select a polygon pj from P until\nP\nj\narea(pj )\narea(Ci) \u2265\nPN\ni=0\narea(pi)\narea(C)\n.\nThe advantage of random assignment lies in ensuring that the overall characteristics of each\nsubproblem align with the original problem.\nC.

We repeatedly select one remaining polygon with the\nhighest priority (ties are broken by value) and try to insert it into the current solution. If the\ninsertion with lower-level packing optimization fails, we skip the current polygon and turn to\nthe next one. For the majority of instances, the priority is defined as the value-to-area ratio\nof a polygon (we also call it unit value). Polygons with higher unit values are prioritized\nfor putting in the container, which is called the Unit Value First (UVF) strategy. For\nsmall-scale instances (N < 100), we employ the \u03b1\u03b2-random strategy. It randomly selects\n\u03b1% and \u03b2% of the polygons and reassigns their UVF-based priority to the highest and the\nlowest, respectively. These instances are run for multiple times to ensure comprehensive\noptimization, with \u03b1 and \u03b2 set to 10 in our implementation.\n3.2 Lower-Level Packing Optimization\nThe position of a polygon can be represented by the coordinates l = (x, y) of a reference point,\nsuch as the bottom-left corner of the boundary. Then, the translation of a polygon can be\nrepresented by a vector pointing from its original position to its new position. Given a feasible\npacking S and a polygon p to be placed, it is impossible to find a non-overlapping position\nfor p without moving other polygons in most cases. This section introduces the algorithm for\neliminating overlaps for an invalid packing, which involves solving an unconstrained nonlinear\nproblem and heuristic polygon movement.\nS o C G 2 0 2 4\n86:4 A General Heuristic Approach for Maximum Polygon Packing\n3.2.1 Overlap Minimization\nTo determine the appropriate translation for the polygons, we utilized the no-fit polygon\n(NFP) and inner-fit polygon (IFP), which are fundamental in algorithmic approaches to\ngeometric design and optimization challenges. For a fixed polygon pi and a movable polygon\npj , NFP(pi, pj ) describes their non-overlapping positions with boundaries in contact precisely,\nwhich can be utilized to determine the minimum translation for pj to avoid overlap. Similarly,\nIFP(pi, pj ) is employed to determine the minimum translation to place pj inside pi. Figure 3\nillustrates the polygon translations determined using NFP (left) and IFP (right). The readers\nmay refer to Burke et al. [2] for a more detailed description.\nFor a packing S, based on NFP and IFP, we define the overlap between polygons pi\nand pj as fij (S), representing the minimum translation to separate them, and f0i(S) as the\nminimum translation for moving pi to fit into the container. Subsequently, we employ the\nseparation algorithm proposed by Imamichi et al. [7] to minimize the overlap, which involves\nsolving an unconstrained nonlinear programming problem as follows:\nmin\nS\nF(S) = X\n0\u2264i<j\u2264N\nf\n2\nij (S) (1)\nThe model relaxes the non-overlapping constraint but introduces repulsion forces between\nany two overlapped polygons. We use the classic L-BFGS (limited memory BFGS) method\nto solve this problem. It makes the packing S converge to a local optimum but strongly\ndepends on the initial layout. ...",

The algorithm allows pieces to be nested within the partial layout produced by previously placed pieces, and produces an optimal BL layout in the sense that the positions considered are guaranteed to contain the bottom-left position of the infinite set of possibilities. Full details of the way in which these positions are calculated are given. Computational experiments comparing the results of different orderings on a variety of datasets from the literature are reported, and these illustrate that problems having in excess of 100 pieces of several piece types can be solved within one minute on a modern desktop PC. The procedure can easily be incorporated into algorithms that apply more sophisticated piece selection procedures.\n## Introduction\nThe problem of packing a given set of pieces into a sheet of fixed width in such a way as to minimise the length required occurs in a range of practical situations, including sheet-metal cutting and marker layout problems in the garment industry. A popular approach to solving such problems is to order the pieces and then place them in turn, choosing the leftmost feasible position, and breaking ties by selecting the lowest. This is known as a bottom-left (BL) placement policy. Early implementations usually involved one or more orderings based on the dimensions of the pieces, or a random sample of orderings from which the best solution was chosen. The advantages of this type of approach are its speed and simplicity, when compared with more sophisticated methods that may be able to produce solutions of higher quality. As a result there are still many commercial environments where such single pass placement policies are appropriate. Moreover interest in recent years has been boosted by implementations of modern heuristics, such as tabu search or genetic algorithms, that use a bottom-left placement policy as the basis of cost/fitness evaluation.\nAlthough there are a variety of slightly different interpretations of the bottom-left policy, these can be broadly partitioned into two classes. These are illustrated in Fig. 1, in which we assume that pieces 1\u20134 have already been placed and piece 5 is about to be placed using the relevant bottom-left definition. In the first class (Fig. 1(a)), pieces can only be placed to the right of the current packing front, in this case in-front of pieces 1, 3 or 4. The position shown is obviously the leftmost possibility within this region. Although this has the advantage of simplifying the calculations required, it will not allow smaller pieces later in the ordering to fill in gaps behind pieces already placed. The second class (Fig. 1(b)) remedies this by using a true leftmost placement policy, and allowing placements behind the packing front, a process sometimes referred to as hole-filling. When the pieces are rectangular the geometry in both cases is relatively simple. However, when irregular pieces are involved the calculation of the leftmost position for the next piece involves a complex geometric calculation, particularly if positions behind the packing front are to be considered. Although there are a number of published papers describing bottom-left algorithms for irregular pieces, many fail to provide details of the geometric calculations. Of those that do describe the geometry, most do not include hole-filling, or reduce the feasible positions to a finite set of points (often based on a grid). Others are restricted to very small problem instances or suggest prohibitive amounts of computational time for instances of moderate size. In this paper we present a bottom-left algorithm, complete with geometric details, that has proved to be both fast and effective on datasets of up to several hundred irregular pieces.\nThe next section provides an overview of the problem and cites some of the published bottom-left algorithms for its solution. This is followed by an outline of the underlying geometric concept of our algorithm, the no-fit polygon. We describe the algorithmic framework, filling in the details in the following section, before going on to outline a series of modifications designed to reduce the computational effort required. Finally computational experiments, comparing different ordering rules on a range of different datasets, are presented.\n## Section snippets\n## The problem\nThe problem can be stated as follows.\n*Given*: A stock sheet of infinite length and fixed width W, and a set of irregular pieces,*i*=1,\u2026,*n*, represented as simple polygons (i.e. polygons without holes).\n*Objective*: To pack all of the pieces onto the sheet without overlap, so as to minimise the length required.\nWe assume that rotation of the pieces is not allowed and that the*n*pieces constitute*m*piece types or shapes,*k*=1,\u2026,*m*, where there are*b**k*copies of type*k*, and \u2211*k*=1*m**b**k*=*n*.

It adopts two neighborhoods, swapping two given polygons in a placement and placing one polygon into a new position. The local search algorithm is used to minimize the overlap on the basis of the neighborhoods mentioned above and the unconstrained[nonlinear programming](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/nonlinear-programming)model is adopted to further minimize the overlap during the search process. Moreover, the[tabu](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/tabu)search algorithm is used to avoid[local minima](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/local-minimum), and a compact algorithm is presented to improve the result. The results of standard test instances indicate that when compared with other existing algorithms, the presented algorithm does not only show some signs of competitive power but also updates several best known results.\n## Introduction\nThe irregular strip packing problem, also known as the nesting problem, has a wide area of applications. Given a set of irregular shapes and a rectangular strip with a fixed width and an arbitrary length, the target of the two-dimensional irregular strip packing problem is to place all shapes within the strip such that the length of the strip is minimized and the irregular shapes do not overlap. A classic example application is clothing industry. Several pieces of clothes will be cut from a roll of fabric and the objective is to minimize the waste of fabric. The fabric has a fixed width and its length can be generally assumed infinite; so the problem is to minimize the length required for producing the specified number of irregular shapes.\nThe irregular strip packing problem is a NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem [1]. Numerous papers on nesting problem have been published since the first paper by Art [2]. Meta-heuristics are often used to solve this problem. Hopper and Turton [3] reviewed these methods, and a summary of geometric methods was published by Bennell and Oliveira [4]. As research progressed, further breakthroughs in algorithms for this problem have achieved in recent years. When compared with the previous years, these solutions have markedly improved the effect and speed of nesting results. The typical methods include Burke et al. [5], Gomes and Oliveira [6], Egeblad et al. [7], Imamichi et al. [8], etc.\nAlbano and Sapuppo [9] proposed an algorithm that places each shape at the bottom-left position, and the sequence of places is obtained by tree search. Jakobs [10] proposed a two-stage solution which first generates the rectangular enclosure of each irregular shape, and then finds the placement for these enclosures through a genetic algorithm. Secondly, a shrinking algorithm moves the shapes to another one as close as possible using the idea of the bottom-left heuristic. Gomes and Oliveira [11] based on bottom-left heuristic and find a good placement by exchanging two shapes in the layout. Dowsland et al. [12] developed a compact algorithm to improve the bottom-left heuristic algorithm. The algorithm first gets the initial placement by the bottom-left heuristic, and then uses a shaking process to compact the placement. Burke et al. [5] presented a new bottom-left heuristic algorithm based on discretization, and combination with hill climbing or tabu search to get a high quality solution. This algorithm can also pack the shapes with circular arcs and holes. Egeblad et al. [7] proposed an efficient fast local search method whose neighborhood is any horizontal or vertical translation of a given shape. They also formulated a polynomial time algorithm to find a translation with minimum overlap area between the given polygon and the other polygons in the current placement. Gomes and Oliveira [6] presented a separation algorithm to locally optimize the placement based on linear programming models, and used simulated annealing to guide the search. A new separation algorithm based on unconstrained nonlinear programming is proposed by Imamichi et al. [8]. They also designed an algorithm that swaps two polygons in a placement, and then the algorithms are combined as a component into an iterated local search algorithm for the overlap minimization problem. This method yielded several best known results on the standard test instances. Our algorithm is based on a separation algorithm presented by Imamichi et al. [8], and local search is adopted to guide the search. Moreover, a tabu search algorithm is used to avoid local minima and a compacted algorithm is used to improve the packing results.\n## Section snippets\n## Formulation\nIn this section, some fundamental elements of geometry are first defined, before formulation of the irregular strip packing problem algorithm is given.\n**Definition 1 (point)**\nA point*p*in two-dimensional space is represented by a pair:p=(px,py)\u2208R2.\n**Definition 2 (line segment)**\nA line segment*s*is a point set defined by two endpoints*p**a*and*p**b*:s={p\u2208R2,t\u2208[0,1]|p=pa+t(pb\u2212pa)}.\n**Definition 3 (polygon)**\nA polygon is a plane figure bounded by a closed path composes of a finite sequence of line segments denoted by*S*.

We also discuss the effect of different groups of stock sheet sizes.\n\nText\n\n**ICCL17\\_paper\\_43**\n**\\- Accepted Manuscript**\n\n[Download](https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/415314/1/ICCL17_paper_43.pdf) (729kB)\n\n## More information\n\ne-pub ahead of print date: October 2017\n\nPublished date: October 2017\n\nKeywords:\nIrregular shapes, Multiple bin size bin packing, Jostle Algorithm\n\n## Identifiers\n\nLocal EPrints ID: 415314\n\nURI: http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/id/eprint/415314\n\nDOI: [doi:10.1007/978-3-319-68496](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-68496)\n\nPURE UUID: e654d0b7-af4b-43c1-86e1-635828997331\n\nORCID for Antonio Martinez Sykora: [orcid.org/0000-0002-2435-3113](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2435-3113)\n\n## Catalogue record\n\nDate deposited: 07 Nov 2017 17:30\n\nLast modified: 16 Mar 2024 05:53\n\n## Export record\n\nASCII CitationAtomBibTeXData Cite XMLDublin CoreDublin CoreEP3 XMLEndNoteHTML CitationHTML CitationHTML ListJSONMETSMODSMPEG-21 DIDLOpenURL ContextObjectOpenURL ContextObject in SpanRDF+N-TriplesRDF+N3RDF+XMLRIOXX2 XMLReferReference ManagerSimple Metadata\n\n## Altmetrics\n\n## Share this record\n\n[Share this on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/415314/) [Share this on Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Efficient%20local%20search%20heuristics%20for%20packing%20irregular%20shapes%20in%20two%2Ddimensional%20heterogeneous%20bins+https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/415314/) [Share this on Weibo](http://service.weibo.com/share/share.php?url=Efficient%20local%20search%20heuristics%20for%20packing%20irregular%20shapes%20in%20two%2Ddimensional%20heterogeneous%20bins+https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/415314/)\n\n## Contributors\n\nAuthor:Ranga, Prasad Abeysooriya\n\nAuthor:Julia Bennell\n\nAuthor: [Antonio Martinez Sykora](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/business-school/about/staff/am1u10.page)\n\nEditor:Tolga Bektas\n\nEditor:Stefano Coniglio\n\nEditor:Antonio Martinez-Sykora\n\nEditor:Stefan Boss\n\n## Download statistics\n\nDownloads from ePrints over the past year.

I am given a single polygon as a boundary (convex or concave may also contain holes) and a single \"fill\" polygon (may also be convex or concave, does not contain holes) and I need to fill the boundary polygon with a specified number of fill polygons. (I'm working in 2D).\n\nMany of the polygon packing heuristics I've found assume that the boundary and/or filling polygons will be rectangular and also that the filling polygons will be of different sizes. In my case, the filling polygons may be non-rectangular, but all will be exactly the same.\n\nMaybe this is a particular type of packing problem? If somebody has a definition for this type of polygon packing I'll gladly google away, but so far I've not found anything which is similar enough to be of great use.\n\nThanks.\n\n- [algorithm](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/algorithm)\n- [polygon](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/polygon)\n- [heuristics](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/heuristics)\n- [packing](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/packing)\n\n[Share](https://stackoverflow.com/q/6864382)\n\n[Improve this question](https://stackoverflow.com/posts/6864382/edit)\n\nFollow\n\nasked Jul 28, 2011 at 19:12\n\n[![Craig's user avatar](https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/015502b5e2de5fa52ffa72f5b2bbbd75?s=64&d=identicon&r=PG)](https://stackoverflow.com/users/863506/craig)\n\n[Craig](https://stackoverflow.com/users/863506/craig) Craig\n\n56411 gold badge55 silver badges2020 bronze badges\n\n4\n\n- No, this doesn't look like some well-known special case of the packing problem. Anything that works with distinct shapes should trivially work with identical shapes too. If you have an algorithm that works well for a rectangular boundary, you can try to adapt it for an arbitrary boundary. Modify it so that you can at a flip opre-fill your boundary with some shapes that cannot be moved or deleted (e.g. there's only one way to place them). Solve for a rectangular boundary, pre-filled with some shapes that just leave your original boundary unfilled. Not all algorithms can be adapted like this.\n\n\u2013\u00a0[n. m. could be an AI](https://stackoverflow.com/users/775806/n-m-could-be-an-ai)\n\nCommentedJul 28, 2011 at 20:22\n\n- The case with only one kind of filling polygon is definitely a special case of the general situation with different filling polys. I believe most heuristics for solving this kind of cutting/packing problem uses the no-fit polygon, so googling \"no-fit irregular packing\"' or something like that could be a good start.\n\n\u2013\u00a0[Anders Forsgren](https://stackoverflow.com/users/678410/anders-forsgren)\n\nCommentedJul 28, 2011 at 23:05\n\n- I think you should as this in the theoretical cs version of SO.\n\n\u2013\u00a0[Ira Baxter](https://stackoverflow.com/users/120163/ira-baxter)\n\nCommentedAug 31, 2011 at 5:25\n\n- for the algorithm: this is commonly called \"nesting\", which means to pack irregular, potentially non-convex, 2D/3D shapes into some piece of \"stock\" that is then cut. things need not be nested literally, but they could be.\n\n\u2013\u00a0[Christoph Rackwitz](https://stackoverflow.com/users/2602877/christoph-rackwitz)\n\nCommentedJun 26, 2023 at 19:18\n\n\n[Add a comment](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6864382/packing-arbitrary-polygons-within-an-arbitrary-boundary)\u00a0\\|\n\n## 4 Answers 4\n\nSorted by:\n[Reset to default](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6864382/packing-arbitrary-polygons-within-an-arbitrary-boundary?answertab=scoredesc#tab-top)\n\nHighest score (default)Trending (recent votes count more)Date modified (newest first)Date created (oldest first)\n\n4\n\nThe question you ask is very hard. To put this in perspective, the (much) simpler case where you're packing the interior of your bounded polygon with non-overlapping disks is already hard, and disks are the simplest possible \"packing shape\" (with any other shape you have to consider orientation as well as size and center location).\n\nIn fact, I think it's an open problem in [computational geometry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_geometry) to determine for an arbitrary integer N and arbitrary bounded polygonal region (in the Euclidean plane), what is the \"optimal\" (in the sense of covering the greatest percentage of the polygon interior) packing of N inscribed non-overlapping disks, where you are free to choose the radius and center location of each disk. I'm sure the \"best\" answer _is_ known for certain special polygonal shapes (like rectangles, circles, and triangles), but for arbitrary shapes your best \"heuristic\" is probably:\n\n1. Start your shape counter at N.\n2. Add the largest \"packing shape\" you can fit completely inside the polygonal boundary without overlapping any other packing shapes.\n3. Decrement your shape counter.\n4. If your shape counter is > 0, go to step 2.\n\nI say \"probably\" because \"largest first\" isn't always the best way to pack things into a confined space. You can dig into that particular flavor of craziness by reading about the [bin packing problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bin_packing_problem) and [knapsack problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem).\n\n**EDIT:** Step 2 by itself is hard. A reasonable strategy would be to pick an arbitrary point on the interior of the polygon as the center and \"inflate\" the disk until it touches either the boundary or another disk (or both), and then \"slide\" the disk while continuing to inflate it so that it remains inside the boundary without overlapping any other disks until it is \"trapped\" - with at least 2 points of contact with the boundary and/or other disks. But it isn't easy to formalize this \"sliding process\". And even if you get the sliding process right, this strategy doesn't guarantee that you'll find the biggest \"inscribable disk\" - your \"locally maximal\" disk could be trapped in a \"lobe\" of the interior which is connected by a narrow \"neck\" of free space to a larger \"lobe\" where a larger disk would fit.\n\n[Share](https://stackoverflow.com/a/7342898)\n\n[Improve this answer](https://stackoverflow.com/posts/7342898/edit)\n\nFollow\n\n[edited Feb 27, 2013 at 20:29](https://stackoverflow.com/posts/7342898/revisions)\n\nanswered Sep 8, 2011 at 3:46\n\n[![Peter's user avatar](https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f031e9e9b7476fc5d3674fe4a9c59ef2?s=64&d=identicon&r=PG)](https://stackoverflow.com/users/227491/peter)\n\n[Peter](https://stackoverflow.com/users/227491/peter) Peter\n\n2,53611 gold badge2323 silver badges3232 bronze badges\n\n[Add a comment](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6864382/packing-arbitrary-polygons-within-an-arbitrary-boundary)\u00a0\\|\n\n3\n\nThanks for the replies, my requirements were such that I was able to further simplify the problem by not having to deal with orientation and I then even further simplified by only really wor...",
