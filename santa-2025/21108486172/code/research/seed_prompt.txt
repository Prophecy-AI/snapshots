## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.734327 from exp_001 (baseline)
- Best LB score: 70.734327 (submitted)
- Target: 68.925546 | Gap to target: 1.81 points (2.6%)

## Public Kernel Status (CRITICAL!)
- Have we implemented the best kernel yet? **PARTIALLY** - We have the baseline from santa-2025.csv
- Top kernels identified:
  1. jonathanchan/santa25-ensemble-sa-fractional-translation (174 votes) - Ensemble + SA + Fractional Translation
  2. seshurajup/71-78-jit-parallel-sa-c-tpu-96-cores (115 votes) - JIT & Parallel SA C++ with 96 TPU cores
  3. jazivxt/why-not (288 votes) - Uses bbox3 optimizer with bucket-of-chump dataset
  4. saspav/santa-submission (398 votes) - Frankenstein of multiple approaches
- Kernels we've implemented: Basic SA, C++ optimizer (tree_packer_v21), multi-start optimization
- Kernels still to implement: **MBA* tree search**, **Exact MIP for small N**, **Backtracking with symmetry pruning**
- **CRITICAL INSIGHT**: Top teams (67-68 scores) use fundamentally different algorithms than SA!

## Key Discovery This Loop
1. **Our baseline has an overlap at N=9** - Fixed by replacing with bucket-of-chump N=9
2. **Ensemble from 298 CSV files produces NO improvement** - All valid configs converge to same score
3. **Top teams use MBA* tree search, not SA** - This is a fundamentally different approach

## CV-LB Relationship Analysis
- Only 1 submission made so far (70.734327)
- Need more submissions to establish CV-LB relationship
- This is a deterministic optimization problem, so CV = LB exactly

## Response to Evaluator
The evaluator correctly identified that:
1. The conclusion "baseline is at global optimum" is PREMATURE - the target IS achievable
2. Multi-generation optimization hasn't been properly implemented
3. The ensemble approach hasn't been fully exploited

However, my analysis shows that:
1. **All 298 CSV files in snapshots converge to the same valid score (70.734327)**
2. **The 3-point improvement is locked behind overlapping configurations**
3. **SA-based approaches have been exhausted** - 10 experiments with no improvement

The evaluator's recommendation to implement "true multi-generation optimization" is unlikely to help because:
- We've already run 100,000+ iterations with multiple restarts
- The baseline is at a local optimum that SA cannot escape
- The gap is in small N values (N=4-10) where the search space is small enough that SA should find the optimum

**THE REAL PIVOT NEEDED**: According to web research, top teams achieving 67-68 scores use:
1. **Memory-Bounded A* (MBA*) tree search** - NOT simulated annealing
2. **Exact MIP for small N (≤10)** - Provably optimal placements
3. **Backtracking with symmetry pruning** - Different from random search

## Recommended Approaches (Priority Order)

### 1. **[HIGHEST PRIORITY]** Implement Exact MIP for Small N (N=1-10)
The web research indicates that top teams use exact MIP solvers for small N values with short timeouts (2-5 min). This can find provably optimal placements that SA cannot.

**Implementation:**
- Use PuLP or OR-Tools for MIP formulation
- Model tree positions as continuous variables
- Add non-overlap constraints using big-M formulation
- Minimize bounding box side length
- Focus on N=4-10 where 49% of the gap is concentrated

### 2. **[HIGH PRIORITY]** Implement Memory-Bounded A* (MBA*) Tree Search
According to the HAL paper, MBA* is the most effective solver for 2D packing problems:
- Expand best-first search tree with fixed-size node pool (2-5k nodes)
- Use area-based lower-bound heuristic to prune branches
- Anytime algorithm - can return good solutions fast

**Implementation:**
- Define state as partial placement of trees
- Use area-based heuristic: remaining_area / remaining_trees
- Expand nodes in best-first order
- Keep only top-k nodes in memory

### 3. **[MEDIUM PRIORITY]** Backtracking with Symmetry Pruning
For medium-size instances, use depth-first backtracking:
- Prune symmetric placements (rotations/flips)
- Early infeasibility checks
- Stop at first feasible layout

### 4. **[LOW PRIORITY]** Try Different Packing Strategies
- Hexagonal packing for large N
- Crystalline/periodic structures for N≥58
- Bottom-left-fill heuristic

## What NOT to Try
- ❌ More SA iterations - 10 experiments have shown no improvement
- ❌ More random restarts - 2000+ restarts found no better configuration
- ❌ Genetic algorithms - Already tried with 200 population, 100 generations
- ❌ Basin hopping - Perturbations create invalid configurations
- ❌ Ensemble from existing CSVs - All valid configs converge to same score

## SUBMISSION STRATEGY
- Remaining submissions: 95
- Submit after this experiment? **YES** - We have abundant submissions and need LB feedback
- Even if score doesn't improve, LB feedback is valuable for calibration

## Validation Notes
- This is a deterministic optimization problem
- CV = LB exactly (no randomness in scoring)
- Overlap detection must be exact (use high-precision arithmetic)

## Technical Notes
- The tree polygon has 15 vertices
- Overlap detection uses point-in-polygon + segment intersection
- Score = sum(side^2 / n) for n=1 to 200
- Target 68.925546 is on the leaderboard, so it IS achievable

## Critical Path Forward
1. **Implement exact MIP for N=1-10** - This is the most promising approach
2. **If MIP improves any N value, submit immediately**
3. **Then implement MBA* tree search for medium N**
4. **Focus computational effort on N=4-10 where 49% of gap is**

The key insight is that **SA-based approaches have hit their ceiling**. We need fundamentally different algorithms (MIP, tree search) to break through.
