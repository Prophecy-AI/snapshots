  "seed_prompt": "# Santa 2025 Christmas Tree Packing - Seed Prompt\n\n## Problem Overview\nThis is a 2D polygon packing optimization problem. The goal is to fit N Christmas tree toys (N=1 to 200) into the smallest possible square bounding box for each N. \n\n**Scoring:** score = \u03a3(side_n\u00b2 / n) for n=1 to 200. Lower is better.\n**Target:** Beat 68.931058\n\n## Tree Geometry\nEach tree is a 15-vertex polygon with:\n- Tip at (0, 0.8)\n- Three tiers of branches (widths: 0.25, 0.4, 0.7)\n- Trunk: width 0.15, height 0.2\n- Total height: 1.0 (from trunk bottom at -0.2 to tip at 0.8)\n\nTrees can be positioned (x, y) and rotated (deg). The reference point is the center of the top of the trunk.\n\n## Top Approaches from Public Kernels\n\n### 1. bbox3 Binary Optimizer (Most Important)\n**Source:** `../research/kernels/saspav_santa-submission/santa-submission.ipynb`\n\nThe bbox3 binary is the key optimization tool used by top solutions:\n```bash\n./bbox3 -n <iterations> -r <restarts>\n```\n- `-n`: Number of iterations (try 1000-10000+)\n- `-r`: Number of restarts (try 30-256)\n- Higher values = better results but longer runtime\n\n**Usage pattern:**\n1. Start with a baseline submission.csv\n2. Run bbox3 to optimize\n3. Apply fix_direction post-processing\n4. Validate for overlaps and repair if needed\n\n### 2. fix_direction Post-Processing (Critical)\n**Source:** `../research/kernels/saspav_santa-submission/santa-submission.ipynb`\n\nAfter bbox3 optimization, rotate the entire configuration to minimize bounding box:\n- Uses scipy.optimize.minimize_scalar\n- Searches rotation angles 0-90 degrees\n- Can reduce score significantly\n- Apply multiple passes for better results\n\n### 3. C++ Tree Packer with OpenMP\n**Source:** `../research/kernels/smartmanoj_santa-claude/santa-claude.ipynb`\n\nFeatures:\n- Parallel processing with OpenMP\n- Simulated annealing with temperature scheduling\n- Local search with 8-directional moves\n- Squeeze operation (scale towards center)\n- Compaction (move trees towards center)\n- Swap moves between trees\n- Multi-angle restarts\n\nCompile: `g++ -O3 -march=native -std=c++17 -fopenmp -o tree_packer tree_packer.cpp`\n\n### 4. Backward Propagation\n**Source:** `../research/kernels/smartmanoj_santa-claude/santa-claude.ipynb`\n\nImprove smaller N configurations by removing trees from larger N configs:\n- Start from N=200, go down to N=2\n- For each N, try removing boundary-touching trees\n- If resulting (N-1) config is better than stored, save it\n- This propagates good packing patterns downward\n\n### 5. Overlap Repair Strategy\n**Source:** `../research/kernels/jazivxt_why-not/why-not.ipynb`\n\nWhen optimization creates overlaps:\n1. Validate submission for overlaps\n2. For each N with overlap, replace with known-good baseline\n3. This ensures valid submission while keeping improvements\n\n## Simulated Annealing Best Practices (from research)\n\n### Temperature Schedule\n- **Initial temperature:** Set to achieve 80-90% acceptance rate for random moves\n- **Cooling schedule:** Geometric (exponential) with \u03b1 = 0.95-0.99\n- **Inner iterations:** c \u00d7 N where N = number of polygons, c \u2248 100-200\n- **Stopping:** When temperature falls below threshold or no improvement for several temperatures\n\n### Adaptive Neighborhood\n- **Crystallization factor feedback:** Increase step size after accepted moves, decrease after rejections\n- **Anisotropic search:** Different step sizes for different directions\n- **Step sizes:** Start large (0.01-0.02), decrease to fine (0.0001-0.001)\n\n### Move Types\n1. **Translation:** Move tree in 8 directions (cardinal + diagonal)\n2. **Rotation:** Rotate individual tree by small angles (\u00b10.1\u00b0 to \u00b15\u00b0)\n3. **Swap:** Exchange positions of two trees\n4. **Compaction:** Move towards center of mass\n\n## Recommended Experiment Strategy\n\n### Phase 1: Reproduce Best Kernel (First 1-2 experiments)\n1. Download bbox3 binary and baseline submission from Kaggle datasets\n2. Run bbox3 with moderate parameters: `-n 2000 -r 96`\n3. Apply fix_direction with 1-2 passes\n4. Validate and repair overlaps\n5. Target: Match ~69-70 score\n\n### Phase 2: Extended Optimization (Experiments 3-5)\n1. Run bbox3 with higher parameters: `-n 5000 -r 128` or higher\n2. Apply fix_direction with 3+ passes\n3. Try backward propagation\n4. Ensemble: Keep best N configs from multiple runs\n\n### Phase 3: Advanced Techniques (Experiments 6+)\n1. **Per-N optimization:** Focus on N values with worst efficiency (highest s\u00b2/n)\n2. **Multi-start:** Run from different initial configurations\n3. **Hybrid approach:** Combine bbox3 + tree_packer results\n4. **Fine-grained rotation:** Optimize individual tree rotations\n5. **Genetic crossover:** Breed configurations from different runs\n\n## Key Implementation Details\n\n### Submission Format\n```csv\nid,x,y,deg\n001_0,s0.0,s0.0,s90.0\n002_0,s0.0,s0.0,s90.0\n002_1,s-0.541068,s0.259317,s51.66348\n```\n- Values prefixed with 's' to preserve precision\n- id format: `{n:03d}_{tree_index}`\n- Coordinates constrained to -100 \u2264 x, y \u2264 100\n\n### Collision Detection\nUse Shapely library:\n- STRtree for efficient spatial queries\n- `polygon.intersects()` and `polygon.touches()` for overlap check\n- Two polygons overlap if they intersect but don't just touch\n\n### Scoring Function\n```python\ndef get_score(trees, n):\n    # Get bounding box of all tree polygons\n    bounds = unary_union([t.polygon for t in trees]).bounds\n    side = max(bounds[2]-bounds[0], bounds[3]-bounds[1])\n    return side**2 / n\n```\n\n## External Resources Needed\n1. bbox3 binary - available from Kaggle datasets (e.g., \"santa-2025-csv\", \"bucket-of-chump\")\n2. Baseline submission.csv - from same datasets\n3. These contain pre-optimized solutions to build upon\n\n## Validation Checklist\nBefore submitting:\n1. Check all N=1 to 200 configurations present\n2. Validate no overlaps (intersects but not touches)\n3. Verify coordinates within bounds (-100 to 100)\n4. Calculate expected score locally\n\n## Novel Techniques to Try (Beyond Public Kernels)\n\n### From Research Literature\n1. **No-fit polygon (NFP):** Precompute collision-free regions for faster placement\n2. **Hierarchical SA:** Outer loop adjusts container size, inner loop optimizes placement\n3. **Genetic-LP hybrid:** Use linear programming to solve relaxed placement subproblem\n4. **Differential evolution:** Population-based optimization with crossover/mutation\n\n### Competition-Specific Ideas\n1. **Lattice-based initialization:** Trees often pack in alternating orientations (observed in kernels)\n2. **Per-tree rotation optimization:** After global fix_direction, fine-tune individual rotations\n3. **Beam search for tree removal:** Try multiple removal sequences in backward propagation\n4. **Score-weighted optimization:** Spend more time on N values with highest s\u00b2/n contribution\n5. **Configuration breeding:** Take best trees from multiple runs for each N\n\n## Critical Success Factors\n1. **Use bbox3 binary** - This is the core optimizer used by top solutions\n2. **Apply fix_direction** - Post-processing rotation optimization is essential\n3. **Validate overlaps** - Invalid submissions are rejected\n4. **Iterate and ensemble** - Multiple runs with different parameters improve results\n5. **Focus on high-N values** - N=100-200 contribute most to score\n\n## Reference Kernels\n- `../research/kernels/saspav_santa-submission/` - bbox3 + fix_direction workflow\n- `../research/kernels/smartmanoj_santa-claude/` - C++ tree_packer with backward propagation\n- `../research/kernels/jazivxt_why-not/` - Overlap repair strategy\n- `../research/kernels/yongsukprasertsuk_santa-2025-best-keeping-bbox3-runner/` - Multi-phase optimization\n- `../research/kernels/inversion_santa-2025-getting-started/` - Basic greedy baseline\n",
