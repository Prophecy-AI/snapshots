YES - baseline uses santa-2025.csv from Kaggle datasets\n- Top kernels identified: saspav/santa-submission (bbox3), smartmanoj/santa-claude (C++ tree_packer), jonathanchan/santa25-ensemble-sa-fractional-translation (ensemble)\n- Kernels we've implemented: baseline with bbox3 (GLIBC issue), C++ tree_packer (compiled but no improvement)\n- **Key finding**: bbox3 binary has GLIBC 2.34 compatibility issue (system has 2.31)\n\n## Ensemble Strategy\n- Ensemble approach found score 67.77 but has OVERLAPS - invalid submission\n- Valid ensemble (no overlaps) scores 70.734327 - same as baseline\n- The better configurations come from C++ parallel SA but have overlap issues\n- Need to either: (1) fix overlaps in better configs, or (2) run more optimization\n\n## Response to Evaluator\nThe evaluator correctly identified that:\n1. No actual optimization was performed - just downloaded pre-existing solution\n2. GLIBC incompatibility blocked bbox3 - we tried C++ tree_packer instead\n3. C++ tree_packer compiled and ran but didn't improve the baseline (already well-optimized)\n4. fix_direction had no effect (baseline already has optimal rotation)\n\nThe evaluator's suggestion to compile and run C++ tree_packer was implemented but yielded no improvement. The baseline is already well-optimized at 70.734327.\n\n## Key Analysis Findings\n1. **Score breakdown**: Top 20 N values contribute 11.4% of total score. N=1 (0.66), N=2 (0.45), N=3 (0.43) are highest contributors.\n2. **Ensemble potential**: Found 67.77 score by combining best configs from 158 submission files, but 30 N values have overlaps.\n3. **Overlap sources**: Better configs (N=3-10) come from /home/nonroot/snapshots/santa-2025/21090949260/code/experiments/009_cpp_parallel_sa/ but have overlaps.\n4. **Valid ensemble = baseline**: When filtering for non-overlapping configs, ensemble score equals baseline (70.734327).\n\n## Recommended Approaches (Priority Order)\n\n1. **[HIGHEST PRIORITY] Run extended C++ optimization with higher parameters**\n   - Current run: `-n 2000 -r 8` (54 seconds, no improvement)\n   - Try: `-n 10000 -r 32` or higher for longer optimization\n   - The baseline may need more iterations to escape local optima\n\n2. **[HIGH PRIORITY] Implement fractional translation from jonathanchan kernel**\n   - The kernel shows `fractional_translation()` function with very fine step sizes (0.001, 0.0005, 0.0002, 0.0001, 0.00005, 0.00002, 0.00001)\n   - This can squeeze out small improvements after SA\n\n3. **[HIGH PRIORITY] Focus on small N values (1-20)**\n   - These contribute most to score per-N\n   - N=1 alone contributes 0.66 (0.93% of total)\n   - Targeted optimization on small N may yield quick wins\n\n4. **[MEDIUM PRIORITY] Try backward propagation**\n   - Improve smaller N configs by removing trees from larger N configs\n   - Available in smartmanoj kernel\n\n5. **[MEDIUM PRIORITY] Implement SA with translations from egortrushin kernel**\n   - Different SA approach that may find different local optima\n\n## What NOT to Try\n- bbox3 binary (GLIBC 2.34 incompatibility)\n- Simple ensemble without overlap validation (produces invalid submissions)\n- fix_direction on already-optimized baseline (no improvement)\n\n## Validation Notes\n- Always validate for overlaps before submission\n- Use Shapely STRtree for efficient overlap detection\n- Configurations with overlaps are INVALID and will be rejected\n\n**SUBMISSION STRATEGY:**\n- Remaining submissions: 96\n- Submit after this experiment? YES - we have abundant submissions and need LB feedback\n- Even if score doesn't improve, LB feedback helps calibrate CV-LB relationship\n\n## Key Files and Paths\n- Baseline submission: /home/nonroot/snapshots/santa-2025/21105319338/code/datasets/santa-2025-csv/santa-2025.csv\n- C++ tree_packer source: /home/code/experiments/002_cpp_optimizer/tree_packer_full.cpp\n- C++ tree_packer binary: /home/code/experiments/002_cpp_optimizer/tree_packer_v21\n- Current submission: /home/submission/submission.csv (score: 70.734327, no overlaps)\n\n## Next Experiment: 002_extended_optimization\n1. Run C++ tree_packer with higher parameters: `-n 10000 -r 32`\n2. Apply fractional translation post-processing\n3. Validate for overlaps\n4. If improved, save as new candidate",
  "evaluator_feedback": "## What I Understood\n\nThe junior researcher completed experiment 002_extended_optimization, attempting to improve on the baseline score of 70.734327. They ran the C++ tree_packer_v21 with 15000 iterations and 16 restarts, applied fractional translation post-processing to small N values (1-20), and searched 235 CSV files in snapshots for better per-N configurations. The result: no improvement over the baseline. The target is 68.931058, leaving a gap of ~1.8 points (2.6%).\n\n## Technical Execution Assessment\n\n**Validation**: The score of 70.734327 is correctly calculated. The exploration notebook (`evolver_loop1_analysis.ipynb`) shows proper scoring methodology using numba-accelerated functions.\n\n**Leakage Risk**: None - this is a pure optimization problem with no train/test split.\n\n**Score Integrity**: VERIFIED in the exploration notebook. The scoring function correctly computes bounding box side\u00b2 / N for each configuration.\n\n**Code Quality**: \n- The C++ tree_packer was successfully compiled and run (found in `/home/code/experiments/002_cpp_optimizer/`)\n- The exploration notebook is well-documented with clear analysis\n- However, the code directory `/home/code/code/` is still empty - no reusable notebooks for future experiments\n\nVerdict: **TRUSTWORTHY** - The results are valid, but the approach hasn't found improvements.\n\n## Strategic Assessment\n\n**CRITICAL INSIGHT FROM EXPLORATION NOTEBOOK:**\nThe exploration notebook reveals something crucial that the experiment notes don't emphasize:\n\n```\nEnsemble total score: 67.772662 (BELOW TARGET!)\nImprovement over baseline: 2.961665\n```\n\nBUT:\n```\nOverlaps in snapshot ensemble: [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22]...\n```\n\n**THE TARGET IS ACHIEVABLE.** The ensemble of best configurations from snapshots scores 67.77 - well below the target of 68.93. The problem is that these configurations have overlaps. When overlaps are removed (by falling back to baseline), the score returns to 70.73.\n\n**Approach Fit**: The current approach of running more optimization iterations is NOT addressing the real problem. The real problem is:\n1. Better configurations EXIST (from cpp_parallel_sa in snapshots)\n2. These configurations have OVERLAPS\n3. We need to FIX THE OVERLAPS, not run more optimization\n\n**Effort Allocation**: **MISALLOCATED** - Time was spent running tree_packer_v21 and searching for better configs, when the better configs already exist but have overlaps. The effort should be on OVERLAP REPAIR.\n\n**Assumptions Being Made**:\n1. \u274c \"The baseline is already well-optimized\" - FALSE. Better configs exist, they just have overlaps.\n2. \u274c \"Running more optimization will help\" - FALSE. The bottleneck is overlap repair, not optimization.\n\n**Blind Spots**:\n1. **Overlap repair is the key** - The exploration notebook shows configs from `/home/nonroot/snapshots/santa-2025/21090949260/code/experiments/009_cpp_parallel_sa/` have better scores but overlaps. These need to be repaired, not discarded.\n2. **Local search to fix overlaps** - Instead of discarding overlapping configs, apply local search to nudge trees apart while preserving the good packing structure.\n3. **The jazivxt kernel has overlap repair code** - The `why-not` kernel shows how to repair overlaps by replacing with baseline, but a better approach is to FIX the overlaps in place.\n\n**Trajectory**: The current trajectory is stuck because it's optimizing the wrong thing. The breakthrough will come from fixing overlaps in the better configurations, not from running more optimization on the baseline.\n\n## What's Working\n\n1. **Excellent exploration analysis** - The `evolver_loop1_analysis.ipynb` correctly identified that ensemble score 67.77 is achievable\n2. **C++ optimizer compiled and runs** - The tree_packer_v21 infrastructure is in place\n3. **Correct scoring and overlap detection** - The validation code is solid\n4. **Found the source of better configs** - Identified that cpp_parallel_sa submissions have better per-N scores\n\n## Key Concerns\n\n1. **Observation**: The experiment concluded \"baseline is already well-optimized\" when better configs exist\n   **Why it matters**: This conclusion is WRONG. The ensemble of best configs scores 67.77 (below target!). The issue is overlaps, not optimization quality.\n   **Suggestion**: Shift focus from \"run more optimization\" to \"fix overlaps in existing better configs\"\n\n2. **Observation**: Overlapping configs are being discarded instead of repaired\n   **Why it matters**: The best configs (from cpp_parallel_sa) have overlaps but score 67.77. Discarding them loses the improvement.\n   **Suggestion**: Implement overlap repair:\n   - For each N with overlap, apply local search to nudge overlapping trees apart\n   - Use small translations (0.001-0.01) in 8 directions\n   - Rotate trees slightly to resolve overlaps\n   - Only fall back to baseline if repair fails after many attempts\n\n3. **Observation**: No code artifacts in /home/code/code/\n   **Why it matters**: Cannot iterate efficiently without reusable code\n   **Suggestion**: Create a notebook with:\n   - Ensemble loading from snapshots\n   - Overlap detection per N\n   - Overlap repair via local search\n   - Score calculation and validation\n\n4. **Observation**: The cpp_parallel_sa configs have overlaps in N=3-200 (198 out of 200 N values!)\n   **Why it matters**: This suggests the SA algorithm is not properly enforcing collision constraints\n   **Suggestion**: The overlap repair needs to be systematic - perhaps run a constrained local search that only accepts moves that don't create new overlaps\n\n## Top Priority for Next Experiment\n\n**IMPLEMENT OVERLAP REPAIR FOR THE BETTER CONFIGURATIONS**\n\nThe path to beating the target is clear:\n1. Load the ensemble of best configs from snapshots (scores 67.77 with overlaps)\n2. For each N with overlaps, apply overlap repair:\n   - Identify which trees overlap\n   - Apply small translations/rotations to separate them\n   - Use local search that only accepts moves reducing overlap\n   - If repair succeeds, keep the improved config\n   - If repair fails after many attempts, fall back to baseline\n3. The repaired ensemble should score between 67.77 (if all repairs succeed) and 70.73 (if all fall back to baseline)\n\n**Specific implementation approach:**\n```python\ndef repair_overlaps(trees, max_iter=1000):\n    \"\"\"Repair overlaps via local search\"\"\"\n    for _ in range(max_iter):\n        overlapping_pairs = find_overlapping_pairs(trees)\n        if not overlapping_pairs:\n            return trees, True  # Success!\n        \n        # Pick a random overlapping pair\n        i, j = random.choice(overlapping_pairs)\n        \n        # Try small moves to separate them\n        for tree_idx in [i, j]:\n            for dx, dy in [(0.001, 0), (-0.001, 0), (0, 0.001), (0, -0.001), ...]:\n                # Try move\n                old_x, old_y = trees[tree_idx].x, trees[tree_idx].y\n                trees[tree_idx].x += dx\n                trees[tree_idx].y += dy\n                \n                # Check if overlap resolved and no new overlaps created\n                if not has_overlap_with_any(trees, tree_idx):\n                    break  # Keep the move\n                else:\n                    # Revert\n                    trees[tree_idx].x, trees[tree_idx].y = old_x, old_y\n    \n    return trees, False  # Failed to repair\n```\n\nThe target of 68.931058 IS ACHIEVABLE. The ensemble already scores 67.77 - we just need to fix the overlaps. This is a tractable problem that should be the focus of the next experiment.\n",

The goal is to fit N Christmas tree toys (N=1 to 200) into the smallest possible square bounding box for each N. \n\n**Scoring:** score = \u03a3(side_n\u00b2 / n) for n=1 to 200. Lower is better.\n**Target:** Beat 68.931058\n\n## Tree Geometry\nEach tree is a 15-vertex polygon with:\n- Tip at (0, 0.8)\n- Three tiers of branches (widths: 0.25, 0.4, 0.7)\n- Trunk: width 0.15, height 0.2\n- Total height: 1.0 (from trunk bottom at -0.2 to tip at 0.8)\n\nTrees can be positioned (x, y) and rotated (deg). The reference point is the center of the top of the trunk.\n\n## Top Approaches from Public Kernels\n\n### 1. bbox3 Binary Optimizer (Most Important)\n**Source:** `../research/kernels/saspav_santa-submission/santa-submission.ipynb`\n\nThe bbox3 binary is the key optimization tool used by top solutions:\n```bash\n./bbox3 -n <iterations> -r <restarts>\n```\n- `-n`: Number of iterations (try 1000-10000+)\n- `-r`: Number of restarts (try 30-256)\n- Higher values = better results but longer runtime\n\n**Usage pattern:**\n1. Start with a baseline submission.csv\n2. Run bbox3 to optimize\n3. Apply fix_direction post-processing\n4. Validate for overlaps and repair if needed\n\n### 2. fix_direction Post-Processing (Critical)\n**Source:** `../research/kernels/saspav_santa-submission/santa-submission.ipynb`\n\nAfter bbox3 optimization, rotate the entire configuration to minimize bounding box:\n- Uses scipy.optimize.minimize_scalar\n- Searches rotation angles 0-90 degrees\n- Can reduce score significantly\n- Apply multiple passes for better results\n\n### 3. C++ Tree Packer with OpenMP\n**Source:** `../research/kernels/smartmanoj_santa-claude/santa-claude.ipynb`\n\nFeatures:\n- Parallel processing with OpenMP\n- Simulated annealing with temperature scheduling\n- Local search with 8-directional moves\n- Squeeze operation (scale towards center)\n- Compaction (move trees towards center)\n- Swap moves between trees\n- Multi-angle restarts\n\nCompile: `g++ -O3 -march=native -std=c++17 -fopenmp -o tree_packer tree_packer.cpp`\n\n### 4. Backward Propagation\n**Source:** `../research/kernels/smartmanoj_santa-claude/santa-claude.ipynb`\n\nImprove smaller N configurations by removing trees from larger N configs:\n- Start from N=200, go down to N=2\n- For each N, try removing boundary-touching trees\n- If resulting (N-1) config is better than stored, save it\n- This propagates good packing patterns downward\n\n### 5. Overlap Repair Strategy\n**Source:** `../research/kernels/jazivxt_why-not/why-not.ipynb`\n\nWhen optimization creates overlaps:\n1. Validate submission for overlaps\n2. For each N with overlap, replace with known-good baseline\n3. This ensures valid submission while keeping improvements\n\n## Simulated Annealing Best Practices (from research)\n\n### Temperature Schedule\n- **Initial temperature:** Set to achieve 80-90% acceptance rate for random moves\n- **Cooling schedule:** Geometric (exponential) with \u03b1 = 0.95-0.99\n- **Inner iterations:** c \u00d7 N where N = number of polygons, c \u2248 100-200\n- **Stopping:** When temperature falls below threshold or no improvement for several temperatures\n\n### Adaptive Neighborhood\n- **Crystallization factor feedback:** Increase step size after accepted moves, decrease after rejections\n- **Anisotropic search:** Different step sizes for different directions\n- **Step sizes:** Start large (0.01-0.02), decrease to fine (0.0001-0.001)\n\n### Move Types\n1. **Translation:** Move tree in 8 directions (cardinal + diagonal)\n2. **Rotation:** Rotate individual tree by small angles (\u00b10.1\u00b0 to \u00b15\u00b0)\n3. **Swap:** Exchange positions of two trees\n4. **Compaction:** Move towards center of mass\n\n## Recommended Experiment Strategy\n\n### Phase 1: Reproduce Best Kernel (First 1-2 experiments)\n1. Download bbox3 binary and baseline submission from Kaggle datasets\n2. Run bbox3 with moderate parameters: `-n 2000 -r 96`\n3. Apply fix_direction with 1-2 passes\n4. Validate and repair overlaps\n5. Target: Match ~69-70 score\n\n### Phase 2: Extended Optimization (Experiments 3-5)\n1. Run bbox3 with higher parameters: `-n 5000 -r 128` or higher\n2. Apply fix_direction with 3+ passes\n3. Try backward propagation\n4. Ensemble: Keep best N configs from multiple runs\n\n### Phase 3: Advanced Techniques (Experiments 6+)\n1. **Per-N optimization:** Focus on N values with worst efficiency (highest s\u00b2/n)\n2. **Multi-start:** Run from different initial configurations\n3. **Hybrid approach:** Combine bbox3 + tree_packer results\n4. **Fine-grained rotation:** Optimize individual tree rotations\n5. **Genetic crossover:** Breed configurations from different runs\n\n## Key Implementation Details\n\n### Submission Format\n```csv\nid,x,y,deg\n001_0,s0.0,s0.0,s90.0\n002_0,s0.0,s0.0,s90.0\n002_1,s-0.541068,s0.259317,s51.66348\n```\n- Values prefixed with 's' to preserve precision\n- id format: `{n:03d}_{tree_index}`\n- Coordinates constrained to -100 \u2264 x, y \u2264 100\n\n### Collision Detection\nUse Shapely library:\n- STRtree for efficient spatial queries\n- `polygon.intersects()` and `polygon.touches()` for overlap check\n- Two polygons overlap if they intersect but don't just touch\n\n### Scoring Function\n```python\ndef get_score(trees, n):\n    # Get bounding box of all tree polygons\n    bounds = unary_union([t.polygon for t in trees]).bounds\n    side = max(bounds[2]-bounds[0], bounds[3]-bounds[1])\n    return side**2 / n\n```\n\n## External Resources Needed\n1. bbox3 binary - available from Kaggle datasets (e.g., \"santa-2025-csv\", \"bucket-of-chump\")\n2. Baseline submission.csv - from same datasets\n3. These contain pre-optimized solutions to build upon\n\n## Validation Checklist\nBefore submitting:\n1. Check all N=1 to 200 configurations present\n2. Validate no overlaps (intersects but not touches)\n3. Verify coordinates within bounds (-100 to 100)\n4. Calculate expected score locally\n\n## Novel Techniques to Try (Beyond Public Kernels)\n\n### From Research Literature\n1. **No-fit polygon (NFP):** Precompute collision-free regions for faster placement\n2. **Hierarchical SA:** Outer loop adjusts container size, inner loop optimizes placement\n3. **Genetic-LP hybrid:** Use linear programming to solve relaxed placement subproblem\n4. **Differential evolution:** Population-based optimization with crossover/mutation\n\n### Competition-Specific Ideas\n1. **Lattice-based initialization:** Trees often pack in alternating orientations (observed in kernels)\n2. **Per-tree rotation optimization:** After global fix_direction, fine-tune individual rotations\n3. **Beam search for tree removal:** Try multiple removal sequences in backward propagation\n4. **Score-weighted optimization:** Spend more time on N values with highest s\u00b2/n contribution\n5. **Configuration breeding:** Take best trees from multiple runs for each N\n\n## Critical Success Factors\n1. **Use bbox3 binary** - This is the core optimizer used by top solutions\n2. **Apply fix_direction** - Post-processing rotation optimization is essential\n3. **Validate overlaps** - Invalid submissions are rejected\n4. **Iterate and ensemble** - Multiple runs with different parameters improve results\n5. **Focus on high-N values** - N=100-200 contribute most to score\n\n## Reference Kernels\n- `../research/kernels/saspav_santa-submission/` - bbox3 + fix_direction workflow\n- `../research/kernels/smartmanoj_santa-claude/` - C++ tree_packer with backward propagation\n- `../research/kernels/jazivxt_why-not/` - Overlap repair strategy\n- `../research/kernels/yongsukprasertsuk_santa-2025-best-keeping-bbox3-runner/` - Multi-phase optimization\n- `../research/kernels/inversion_santa-2025-getting-started/` - Basic greedy baseline\n\n\nStart with a simple baseline following this strategy.

Lower is better.\\n**Target:** Beat 68.931058\\n\\n## Tree Geometry\\nEach tree is a 15-vertex polygon with:\\n- Tip at (0, 0.8)\\n- Three tiers of branches (widths: 0.25, 0.4, 0.7)\\n- Trunk: width 0.15, height 0.2\\n- Total height: 1.0 (from trunk bottom at -0.2 to tip at 0.8)\\n\\nTrees can be positioned (x, y) and rotated (deg). The reference point is the center of the top of the trunk.\\n\\n## Top Approaches from Public Kernels\\n\\n### 1. bbox3 Binary Optimizer (Most Important)\\n**Source:** `../research/kernels/saspav_santa-submission/santa-submission.ipynb`\\n\\nThe bbox3 binary is the key optimization tool used by top solutions:\\n```bash\\n./bbox3 -n <iterations> -r <restarts>\\n```\\n- `-n`: Number of iterations (try 1000-10000+)\\n- `-r`: Number of restarts (try 30-256)\\n- Higher values = better results but longer runtime\\n\\n**Usage pattern:**\\n1. Start with a baseline submission.csv\\n2. Run bbox3 to optimize\\n3. Apply fix_direction post-processing\\n4. Validate for overlaps and repair if needed\\n\\n### 2. fix_direction Post-Processing (Critical)\\n**Source:** `../research/kernels/saspav_santa-submission/santa-submission.ipynb`\\n\\nAfter bbox3 optimization, rotate the entire configuration to minimize bounding box:\\n- Uses scipy.optimize.minimize_scalar\\n- Searches rotation angles 0-90 degrees\\n- Can reduce score significantly\\n- Apply multiple passes for better results\\n\\n### 3. C++ Tree Packer with OpenMP\\n**Source:** `../research/kernels/smartmanoj_santa-claude/santa-claude.ipynb`\\n\\nFeatures:\\n- Parallel processing with OpenMP\\n- Simulated annealing with temperature scheduling\\n- Local search with 8-directional moves\\n- Squeeze operation (scale towards center)\\n- Compaction (move trees towards center)\\n- Swap moves between trees\\n- Multi-angle restarts\\n\\nCompile: `g++ -O3 -march=native -std=c++17 -fopenmp -o tree_packer tree_packer.cpp`\\n\\n### 4. Backward Propagation\\n**Source:** `../research/kernels/smartmanoj_santa-claude/santa-claude.ipynb`\\n\\nImprove smaller N configurations by removing trees from larger N configs:\\n- Start from N=200, go down to N=2\\n- For each N, try removing boundary-touching trees\\n- If resulting (N-1) config is better than stored, save it\\n- This propagates good packing patterns downward\\n\\n### 5. Overlap Repair Strategy\\n**Source:** `../research/kernels/jazivxt_why-not/why-not.ipynb`\\n\\nWhen optimization creates overlaps:\\n1. Validate submission for overlaps\\n2. For each N with overlap, replace with known-good baseline\\n3. This ensures valid submission while keeping improvements\\n\\n## Simulated Annealing Best Practices (from research)\\n\\n### Temperature Schedule\\n- **Initial temperature:** Set to achieve 80-90% acceptance rate for random moves\\n- **Cooling schedule:** Geometric (exponential) with \\u03b1 = 0.95-0.99\\n- **Inner iterations:** c \\u00d7 N where N = number of polygons, c \\u2248 100-200\\n- **Stopping:** When temperature falls below threshold or no improvement for several temperatures\\n\\n### Adaptive Neighborhood\\n- **Crystallization factor feedback:** Increase step size after accepted moves, decrease after rejections\\n- **Anisotropic search:** Different step sizes for different directions\\n- **Step sizes:** Start large (0.01-0.02), decrease to fine (0.0001-0.001)\\n\\n### Move Types\\n1. **Translation:** Move tree in 8 directions (cardinal + diagonal)\\n2. **Rotation:** Rotate individual tree by small angles (\\u00b10.1\\u00b0 to \\u00b15\\u00b0)\\n3. **Swap:** Exchange positions of two trees\\n4. **Compaction:** Move towards center of mass\\n\\n## Recommended Experiment Strategy\\n\\n### Phase 1: Reproduce Best Kernel (First 1-2 experiments)\\n1. Download bbox3 binary and baseline submission from Kaggle datasets\\n2. Run bbox3 with moderate parameters: `-n 2000 -r 96`\\n3. Apply fix_direction with 1-2 passes\\n4. Validate and repair overlaps\\n5. Target: Match ~69-70 score\\n\\n### Phase 2: Extended Optimization (Experiments 3-5)\\n1. Run bbox3 with higher parameters: `-n 5000 -r 128` or higher\\n2. Apply fix_direction with 3+ passes\\n3. Try backward propagation\\n4. Ensemble: Keep best N configs from multiple runs\\n\\n### Phase 3: Advanced Techniques (Experiments 6+)\\n1. **Per-N optimization:** Focus on N values with worst efficiency (highest s\\u00b2/n)\\n2. **Multi-start:** Run from different initial configurations\\n3. **Hybrid approach:** Combine bbox3 + tree_packer results\\n4. **Fine-grained rotation:** Optimize individual tree rotations\\n5. **Genetic crossover:** Breed configurations from different runs\\n\\n## Key Implementation Details\\n\\n### Submission Format\\n```csv\\nid,x,y,deg\\n001_0,s0.0,s0.0,s90.0\\n002_0,s0.0,s0.0,s90.0\\n002_1,s-0.541068,s0.259317,s51.66348\\n```\\n- Values prefixed with 's' to preserve precision\\n- id format: `{n:03d}_{tree_index}`\\n- Coordinates constrained to -100 \\u2264 x, y \\u2264 100\\n\\n### Collision Detection\\nUse Shapely library:\\n- STRtree for efficient spatial queries\\n- `polygon.intersects()` and `polygon.touches()` for overlap check\\n- Two polygons overlap if they intersect but don't just touch\\n\\n### Scoring Function\\n```python\\ndef get_score(trees, n):\\n    # Get bounding box of all tree polygons\\n    bounds = unary_union([t.polygon for t in trees]).bounds\\n    side = max(bounds[2]-bounds[0], bounds[3]-bounds[1])\\n    return side**2 / n\\n```\\n\\n## External Resources Needed\\n1. bbox3 binary - available from Kaggle datasets (e.g., \\\"santa-2025-csv\\\", \\\"bucket-of-chump\\\")\\n2. Baseline submission.csv - from same datasets\\n3. These contain pre-optimized solutions to build upon\\n\\n## Validation Checklist\\nBefore submitting:\\n1. Check all N=1 to 200 configurations present\\n2. Validate no overlaps (intersects but not touches)\\n3. Verify coordinates within bounds (-100 to 100)\\n4. Calculate expected score locally\\n\\n## Novel Techniques to Try (Beyond Public Kernels)\\n\\n### From Research Literature\\n1. **No-fit polygon (NFP):** Precompute collision-free regions for faster placement\\n2. **Hierarchical SA:** Outer loop adjusts container size, inner loop optimizes placement\\n3. **Genetic-LP hybrid:** Use linear programming to solve relaxed placement subproblem\\n4. **Differential evolution:** Population-based optimization with crossover/mutation\\n\\n### Competition-Specific Ideas\\n1. **Lattice-based initialization:** Trees often pack in alternating orientations (observed in kernels)\\n2. **Per-tree rotation optimization:** After global fix_direction, fine-tune individual rotations\\n3. **Beam search for tree removal:** Try multiple removal sequences in backward propagation\\n4. **Score-weighted optimization:** Spend more time on N values with highest s\\u00b2/n contribution\\n5. **Configuration breeding:** Take best trees from multiple runs for each N\\n\\n## Critical Success Factors\\n1. **Use bbox3 binary** - This is the core optimizer used by top solutions\\n2. **Apply fix_direction** - Post-processing rotation optimization is essential\\n3. **Validate overlaps** - Invalid submissions are rejected\\n4. **Iterate and ensemble** - Multiple runs with different parameters improve results\\n5. **Focus on high-N values** - N=100-200 contribute most to score\\n\\n## Reference Kernels\\n- `../research/kernels/saspav_santa-submission/` - bbox3 + fix_direction workflow\\n- `../research/kernels/smartmanoj_santa-claude/` - C++ tree_packer with backward propagation\\n- `../research/kernels/jazivxt_why-not/` - Overlap repair strategy\\n- `../research/kernels/yongsukprasertsuk_santa-2025-best-keeping-bbox3-runner/` - Multi-phase optimization\\n- `../research/kernels/inversion_santa-2025-getting-started/` - Basic greedy baseline\\n\",\n      \"agent\": \"explorer\",\n      \"timestamp\": \"2026-01-18T08:14:42.289300\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"feedback_history\": [],\n  \"data_findings\": [\n    {\n      \"finding\": \"This is a 2D packing optimization problem: fit N Christmas tree toys (N=1-200) into smallest square bounding box.

They downloaded a pre-optimized submission (santa-2025.csv) from Kaggle datasets and the bbox3 binary optimizer. However, they discovered that bbox3 requires GLIBC 2.34 while the system only has GLIBC 2.31, preventing them from running the optimizer. They applied fix_direction post-processing but reported no improvement (the baseline was already well-optimized). The baseline score is 70.734327, and the target is 68.931058 (need to improve by ~1.8 points).\n\n## Technical Execution Assessment\n\n**Validation**: The score of 70.734327 appears to be correctly calculated based on the submission format. The submission file has the correct structure with 's' prefixed values.\n\n**Leakage Risk**: None - this is an optimization problem, not a predictive modeling task. There's no train/test split to leak.\n\n**Score Integrity**: The score is reported but I cannot verify if fix_direction was actually applied or if it truly made no improvement. The notes claim \"no improvement was achieved\" but there's no code or logs to verify this.\n\n**Code Quality**: **CONCERN** - The code directory is empty. There's no notebook or script documenting what was actually done. This makes it impossible to verify the experiment or reproduce it.\n\nVerdict: **CONCERNS** - No code artifacts to verify the experiment. The GLIBC issue is a real blocker for bbox3, but alternative approaches exist.\n\n## Strategic Assessment\n\n**Approach Fit**: The approach of using bbox3 + fix_direction is correct based on top kernels. However, the GLIBC incompatibility is a significant blocker that needs to be addressed.\n\n**Effort Allocation**: **CRITICAL ISSUE** - The experiment essentially just downloaded a pre-existing solution without performing any actual optimization. The GLIBC issue blocked progress, but there are alternative approaches that weren't explored:\n\n1. **C++ tree_packer from smartmanoj kernel** - Can be compiled locally with g++ (which is available: g++ 9.4.0)\n2. **Pure Python optimization** - fix_direction, backward propagation, local search can all be implemented in Python\n3. **Hybrid approach** - Combine multiple techniques\n\n**Assumptions**: The assumption that bbox3 is the only path forward is incorrect. The smartmanoj kernel provides a complete C++ optimizer that can be compiled locally.\n\n**Blind Spots**: \n1. **The C++ tree_packer is compilable locally** - The smartmanoj kernel has complete C++ code that uses OpenMP for parallelization. This can be compiled with: `g++ -O3 -march=native -std=c++17 -fopenmp -o tree_packer tree_packer.cpp`\n2. **Backward propagation** - This technique (improving smaller N configs from larger N configs) is available in the smartmanoj kernel and can significantly improve scores\n3. **Multiple passes of fix_direction** - The yongsukprasertsuk kernel shows that multiple passes (2-3) of fix_direction can yield additional improvements\n4. **Per-N optimization** - Focus on N values with worst efficiency (highest s\u00b2/n contribution)\n\n**Trajectory**: This is the first experiment, so trajectory assessment is premature. However, the approach of just downloading a baseline without active optimization is not a productive path forward.\n\n## What's Working\n\n1. **Good problem understanding** - The seed prompt and research notes show solid understanding of the problem and available techniques\n2. **Correct baseline established** - Having a valid baseline (70.734327) is a good starting point\n3. **Identified key tools** - bbox3, fix_direction, backward propagation are correctly identified as important techniques\n4. **Overlap validation** - The notes mention validating for overlaps, which is critical for valid submissions\n\n## Key Concerns\n\n1. **Observation**: No actual optimization was performed - just downloaded a pre-existing solution\n   **Why it matters**: The baseline is 1.8 points away from target. Without active optimization, no progress will be made.\n   **Suggestion**: Compile and run the C++ tree_packer from smartmanoj kernel, or implement Python-based optimization\n\n2. **Observation**: GLIBC incompatibility blocked bbox3, but alternative approaches weren't explored\n   **Why it matters**: Time was wasted on a blocked path when alternatives exist\n   **Suggestion**: The C++ tree_packer can be compiled locally: `g++ -O3 -march=native -std=c++17 -fopenmp -o tree_packer a.cpp`\n\n3. **Observation**: No code artifacts in the code directory\n   **Why it matters**: Cannot verify what was done, cannot reproduce, cannot iterate\n   **Suggestion**: Create a notebook documenting the optimization pipeline with all steps\n\n4. **Observation**: fix_direction was claimed to have no effect, but this seems unlikely\n   **Why it matters**: fix_direction typically provides measurable improvements. If it truly had no effect, the baseline may already have optimal rotation.\n   **Suggestion**: Verify by implementing fix_direction in a notebook and checking the before/after scores for individual N values\n\n## Top Priority for Next Experiment\n\n**COMPILE AND RUN THE C++ TREE_PACKER FROM SMARTMANOJ KERNEL**\n\nThe smartmanoj kernel (`/home/code/research/kernels/smartmanoj_santa-claude/santa-claude.ipynb`) contains complete C++ code for a tree packer optimizer that:\n- Uses OpenMP for parallel processing\n- Implements simulated annealing with temperature scheduling\n- Has local search with 8-directional moves\n- Includes squeeze/compaction operations\n- Supports swap moves between trees\n- Can be compiled with the available g++ 9.4.0\n\nSteps:\n1. Extract the C++ code from the notebook (it's in `%%writefile a.cpp` cells)\n2. Compile: `g++ -O3 -march=native -std=c++17 -fopenmp -o tree_packer a.cpp`\n3. Run on the baseline submission with moderate parameters (e.g., `-n 5000 -r 16`)\n4. Apply fix_direction post-processing (multiple passes)\n5. Run backward propagation to improve smaller N configs\n6. Validate for overlaps and repair if needed\n\nThis approach bypasses the GLIBC issue entirely and provides a complete optimization pipeline that can be run locally. The target of 68.931058 is achievable with proper optimization - the current baseline of 70.734327 is from a public dataset that hasn't been heavily optimized.\n\n\n## Updated Strategy\n## Current Status\n- Best CV score: 70.734327 from exp_000 (001_baseline)\n- Best LB score: N/A (no submissions yet)\n- Target: 68.931058 | Gap to target: 1.803269 (2.62%)\n\n## Public Kernel Status (CRITICAL!)\n- Have we implemented the best kernel yet? YES - baseline uses santa-2025.csv from Kaggle datasets\n- Top kernels identified: saspav/santa-submission (bbox3), smartmanoj/santa-claude (C++ tree_packer), jonathanchan/santa25-ensemble-sa-fractional-translation (ensemble)\n- Kernels we've implemented: baseline with bbox3 (GLIBC issue), C++ tree_packer (compiled but no improvement)\n- **Key finding**: bbox3 binary has GLIBC 2.34 compatibility issue (system has 2.31)\n\n## Ensemble Strategy\n- Ensemble approach found score 67.77 but has OVERLAPS - invalid submission\n- Valid ensemble (no overlaps) scores 70.734327 - same as baseline\n- The better configurations come from C++ parallel SA but have overlap issues\n- Need to either: (1) fix overlaps in better configs, or (2) run more optimization\n\n## Response to Evaluator\nThe evaluator correctly identified that:\n1. No actual optimization was performed - just downloaded pre-existing solution\n2. GLIBC incompatibility blocked bbox3 - we tried C++ tree_packer instead\n3. C++ tree_packer compiled and ran but didn't improve the baseline (already well-optimized)\n4. fix_direction had no effect (baseline already has optimal rotation)\n\nThe evaluator's suggestion to compile and run C++ tree_packer was implemented but yielded no improvement. The baseline is already well-optimized at 70.734327.\n\n## Key Analysis Findings\n1. **Score breakdown**: Top 20 N values contribute 11.4% of total score. N=1 (0.66), N=2 (0.45), N=3 (0.43) are highest contributors.\n2. **Ensemble potential**: Found 67.77 score by combining best configs from 158 submission files, but 30 N values have overlaps.\n3. **Overlap sources**: Better configs (N=3-10) come from /home/nonroot/snapshots/santa-2025/21090949260/code/experiments/009_cpp_parallel_sa/ but have overlaps.\n4. **Valid ensemble = baseline**: When filtering for non-overlapping configs, ensemble score equals baseline (70.734327).\n\n## Recommended Approaches (Priority Order)\n\n1. **[HIGHEST PRIORITY] Run extended C++ optimization with higher parameters**\n   - Current run: `-n 2000 -r 8` (54 seconds, no improvement)\n   - Try: `-n 10000 -r 32` or higher for longer optimization\n   - The baseline may need more iterations to escape local optima\n\n2. **[HIGH PRIORITY] Implement fractional translation from jonathanchan kernel**\n   - The kernel shows `fractional_translation()` function with very fine step sizes (0.001, 0.0005, 0.0002, 0.0001, 0.00005, 0.00002, 0.00001)\n   - This can squeeze out small improvements after SA\n\n3. **[HIGH PRIORITY] Focus on small N values (1-20)**\n   - These contribute most to score per-N\n   - N=1 alone contributes 0.66 (0.93% of total)\n   - Targeted optimization on small N may yield quick wins\n\n4. **[MEDIUM PRIORITY] Try backward propagation**\n   - Improve smaller N configs by removing trees from larger N configs\n   - Available in smartmanoj kernel\n\n5. **[MEDIUM PRIORITY] Implement SA with translations from egortrushin kernel**\n   - Different SA approach that may find different local optima\n\n## What NOT to Try\n- bbox3 binary (GLIBC 2.34 incompatibility)\n- Simple ensemble without overlap validation (produces invalid submissions)\n- fix_direction on already-optimized baseline (no improvement)\n\n## Validation Notes\n- Always validate for overlaps before submission\n- Use Shapely STRtree for efficient overlap detection\n- Configurations with overlaps are INVALID and will be rejected\n\n**SUBMISSION STRATEGY:**\n- Remaining submissions: 96\n- Submit after this experiment? YES - we have abundant submissions and need LB feedback\n- Even if score doesn't improve, LB feedback helps calibrate CV-LB relationship\n\n## Key Files and Paths\n- Baseline submission: /home/nonroot/snapshots/santa-2025/21105319338/code/datasets/santa-2025-csv/santa-2025.csv\n- C++ tree_packer source: /home/code/experiments/002_cpp_optimizer/tree_packer_full.cpp\n- C++ tree_packer binary: /home/code/experiments/002_cpp_optimizer/tree_packer_v21\n- Current submission: /home/submission/submission.csv (score: 70.734327, no overlaps)\n\n## Next Experiment: 002_extended_optimization\n1. Run C++ tree_packer with higher parameters: `-n 10000 -r 32`\n2. Apply fractional translation post-processing\n3. Validate for overlaps\n4. If improved, save as new candidate\n\nContinue experimenting based on the updated guidance above."

      "strategy": "# Santa 2025 Christmas Tree Packing - Seed Prompt\n\n## Problem Overview\nThis is a 2D polygon packing optimization problem. The goal is to fit N Christmas tree toys (N=1 to 200) into the smallest possible square bounding box for each N. \n\n**Scoring:** score = \u03a3(side_n\u00b2 / n) for n=1 to 200. Lower is better.\n**Target:** Beat 68.931058\n\n## Tree Geometry\nEach tree is a 15-vertex polygon with:\n- Tip at (0, 0.8)\n- Three tiers of branches (widths: 0.25, 0.4, 0.7)\n- Trunk: width 0.15, height 0.2\n- Total height: 1.0 (from trunk bottom at -0.2 to tip at 0.8)\n\nTrees can be positioned (x, y) and rotated (deg). The reference point is the center of the top of the trunk.\n\n## Top Approaches from Public Kernels\n\n### 1. bbox3 Binary Optimizer (Most Important)\n**Source:** `../research/kernels/saspav_santa-submission/santa-submission.ipynb`\n\nThe bbox3 binary is the key optimization tool used by top solutions:\n```bash\n./bbox3 -n <iterations> -r <restarts>\n```\n- `-n`: Number of iterations (try 1000-10000+)\n- `-r`: Number of restarts (try 30-256)\n- Higher values = better results but longer runtime\n\n**Usage pattern:**\n1. Start with a baseline submission.csv\n2. Run bbox3 to optimize\n3. Apply fix_direction post-processing\n4. Validate for overlaps and repair if needed\n\n### 2. fix_direction Post-Processing (Critical)\n**Source:** `../research/kernels/saspav_santa-submission/santa-submission.ipynb`\n\nAfter bbox3 optimization, rotate the entire configuration to minimize bounding box:\n- Uses scipy.optimize.minimize_scalar\n- Searches rotation angles 0-90 degrees\n- Can reduce score significantly\n- Apply multiple passes for better results\n\n### 3. C++ Tree Packer with OpenMP\n**Source:** `../research/kernels/smartmanoj_santa-claude/santa-claude.ipynb`\n\nFeatures:\n- Parallel processing with OpenMP\n- Simulated annealing with temperature scheduling\n- Local search with 8-directional moves\n- Squeeze operation (scale towards center)\n- Compaction (move trees towards center)\n- Swap moves between trees\n- Multi-angle restarts\n\nCompile: `g++ -O3 -march=native -std=c++17 -fopenmp -o tree_packer tree_packer.cpp`\n\n### 4. Backward Propagation\n**Source:** `../research/kernels/smartmanoj_santa-claude/santa-claude.ipynb`\n\nImprove smaller N configurations by removing trees from larger N configs:\n- Start from N=200, go down to N=2\n- For each N, try removing boundary-touching trees\n- If resulting (N-1) config is better than stored, save it\n- This propagates good packing patterns downward\n\n### 5. Overlap Repair Strategy\n**Source:** `../research/kernels/jazivxt_why-not/why-not.ipynb`\n\nWhen optimization creates overlaps:\n1. Validate submission for overlaps\n2. For each N with overlap, replace with known-good baseline\n3. This ensures valid submission while keeping improvements\n\n## Simulated Annealing Best Practices (from research)\n\n### Temperature Schedule\n- **Initial temperature:** Set to achieve 80-90% acceptance rate for random moves\n- **Cooling schedule:** Geometric (exponential) with \u03b1 = 0.95-0.99\n- **Inner iterations:** c \u00d7 N where N = number of polygons, c \u2248 100-200\n- **Stopping:** When temperature falls below threshold or no improvement for several temperatures\n\n### Adaptive Neighborhood\n- **Crystallization factor feedback:** Increase step size after accepted moves, decrease after rejections\n- **Anisotropic search:** Different step sizes for different directions\n- **Step sizes:** Start large (0.01-0.02), decrease to fine (0.0001-0.001)\n\n### Move Types\n1. **Translation:** Move tree in 8 directions (cardinal + diagonal)\n2. **Rotation:** Rotate individual tree by small angles (\u00b10.1\u00b0 to \u00b15\u00b0)\n3. **Swap:** Exchange positions of two trees\n4. **Compaction:** Move towards center of mass\n\n## Recommended Experiment Strategy\n\n### Phase 1: Reproduce Best Kernel (First 1-2 experiments)\n1. Download bbox3 binary and baseline submission from Kaggle datasets\n2. Run bbox3 with moderate parameters: `-n 2000 -r 96`\n3. Apply fix_direction with 1-2 passes\n4. Validate and repair overlaps\n5. Target: Match ~69-70 score\n\n### Phase 2: Extended Optimization (Experiments 3-5)\n1. Run bbox3 with higher parameters: `-n 5000 -r 128` or higher\n2. Apply fix_direction with 3+ passes\n3. Try backward propagation\n4. Ensemble: Keep best N configs from multiple runs\n\n### Phase 3: Advanced Techniques (Experiments 6+)\n1. **Per-N optimization:** Focus on N values with worst efficiency (highest s\u00b2/n)\n2. **Multi-start:** Run from different initial configurations\n3. **Hybrid approach:** Combine bbox3 + tree_packer results\n4. **Fine-grained rotation:** Optimize individual tree rotations\n5. **Genetic crossover:** Breed configurations from different runs\n\n## Key Implementation Details\n\n### Submission Format\n```csv\nid,x,y,deg\n001_0,s0.0,s0.0,s90.0\n002_0,s0.0,s0.0,s90.0\n002_1,s-0.541068,s0.259317,s51.66348\n```\n- Values prefixed with 's' to preserve precision\n- id format: `{n:03d}_{tree_index}`\n- Coordinates constrained to -100 \u2264 x, y \u2264 100\n\n### Collision Detection\nUse Shapely library:\n- STRtree for efficient spatial queries\n- `polygon.intersects()` and `polygon.touches()` for overlap check\n- Two polygons overlap if they intersect but don't just touch\n\n### Scoring Function\n```python\ndef get_score(trees, n):\n    # Get bounding box of all tree polygons\n    bounds = unary_union([t.polygon for t in trees]).bounds\n    side = max(bounds[2]-bounds[0], bounds[3]-bounds[1])\n    return side**2 / n\n```\n\n## External Resources Needed\n1. bbox3 binary - available from Kaggle datasets (e.g., \"santa-2025-csv\", \"bucket-of-chump\")\n2. Baseline submission.csv - from same datasets\n3. These contain pre-optimized solutions to build upon\n\n## Validation Checklist\nBefore submitting:\n1. Check all N=1 to 200 configurations present\n2. Validate no overlaps (intersects but not touches)\n3. Verify coordinates within bounds (-100 to 100)\n4. Calculate expected score locally\n\n## Novel Techniques to Try (Beyond Public Kernels)\n\n### From Research Literature\n1. **No-fit polygon (NFP):** Precompute collision-free regions for faster placement\n2. **Hierarchical SA:** Outer loop adjusts container size, inner loop optimizes placement\n3. **Genetic-LP hybrid:** Use linear programming to solve relaxed placement subproblem\n4. **Differential evolution:** Population-based optimization with crossover/mutation\n\n### Competition-Specific Ideas\n1. **Lattice-based initialization:** Trees often pack in alternating orientations (observed in kernels)\n2. **Per-tree rotation optimization:** After global fix_direction, fine-tune individual rotations\n3. **Beam search for tree removal:** Try multiple removal sequences in backward propagation\n4. **Score-weighted optimization:** Spend more time on N values with highest s\u00b2/n contribution\n5. **Configuration breeding:** Take best trees from multiple runs for each N\n\n## Critical Success Factors\n1. **Use bbox3 binary** - This is the core optimizer used by top solutions\n2. **Apply fix_direction** - Post-processing rotation optimization is essential\n3. **Validate overlaps** - Invalid submissions are rejected\n4. **Iterate and ensemble** - Multiple runs with different parameters improve results\n5. **Focus on high-N values** - N=100-200 contribute most to score\n\n## Reference Kernels\n- `../research/kernels/saspav_santa-submission/` - bbox3 + fix_direction workflow\n- `../research/kernels/smartmanoj_santa-claude/` - C++ tree_packer with backward propagation\n- `../research/kernels/jazivxt_why-not/` - Overlap repair strategy\n- `../research/kernels/yongsukprasertsuk_santa-2025-best-keeping-bbox3-runner/` - Multi-phase optimization\n- `../research/kernels/inversion_santa-2025-getting-started/` - Basic greedy baseline\n",

YES - baseline uses santa-2025.csv from Kaggle datasets\n- Top kernels identified: saspav/santa-submission (bbox3), smartmanoj/santa-claude (C++ tree_packer), jonathanchan/santa25-ensemble-sa-fractional-translation (ensemble)\n- Kernels we've implemented: baseline with bbox3 (GLIBC issue), C++ tree_packer (compiled but no improvement)\n- **Key finding**: bbox3 binary has GLIBC 2.34 compatibility issue (system has 2.31)\n\n## Ensemble Strategy\n- Ensemble approach found score 67.77 but has OVERLAPS - invalid submission\n- Valid ensemble (no overlaps) scores 70.734327 - same as baseline\n- The better configurations come from C++ parallel SA but have overlap issues\n- Need to either: (1) fix overlaps in better configs, or (2) run more optimization\n\n## Response to Evaluator\nThe evaluator correctly identified that:\n1. No actual optimization was performed - just downloaded pre-existing solution\n2. GLIBC incompatibility blocked bbox3 - we tried C++ tree_packer instead\n3. C++ tree_packer compiled and ran but didn't improve the baseline (already well-optimized)\n4. fix_direction had no effect (baseline already has optimal rotation)\n\nThe evaluator's suggestion to compile and run C++ tree_packer was implemented but yielded no improvement. The baseline is already well-optimized at 70.734327.\n\n## Key Analysis Findings\n1. **Score breakdown**: Top 20 N values contribute 11.4% of total score. N=1 (0.66), N=2 (0.45), N=3 (0.43) are highest contributors.\n2. **Ensemble potential**: Found 67.77 score by combining best configs from 158 submission files, but 30 N values have overlaps.\n3. **Overlap sources**: Better configs (N=3-10) come from /home/nonroot/snapshots/santa-2025/21090949260/code/experiments/009_cpp_parallel_sa/ but have overlaps.\n4. **Valid ensemble = baseline**: When filtering for non-overlapping configs, ensemble score equals baseline (70.734327).\n\n## Recommended Approaches (Priority Order)\n\n1. **[HIGHEST PRIORITY] Run extended C++ optimization with higher parameters**\n   - Current run: `-n 2000 -r 8` (54 seconds, no improvement)\n   - Try: `-n 10000 -r 32` or higher for longer optimization\n   - The baseline may need more iterations to escape local optima\n\n2. **[HIGH PRIORITY] Implement fractional translation from jonathanchan kernel**\n   - The kernel shows `fractional_translation()` function with very fine step sizes (0.001, 0.0005, 0.0002, 0.0001, 0.00005, 0.00002, 0.00001)\n   - This can squeeze out small improvements after SA\n\n3. **[HIGH PRIORITY] Focus on small N values (1-20)**\n   - These contribute most to score per-N\n   - N=1 alone contributes 0.66 (0.93% of total)\n   - Targeted optimization on small N may yield quick wins\n\n4. **[MEDIUM PRIORITY] Try backward propagation**\n   - Improve smaller N configs by removing trees from larger N configs\n   - Available in smartmanoj kernel\n\n5. **[MEDIUM PRIORITY] Implement SA with translations from egortrushin kernel**\n   - Different SA approach that may find different local optima\n\n## What NOT to Try\n- bbox3 binary (GLIBC 2.34 incompatibility)\n- Simple ensemble without overlap validation (produces invalid submissions)\n- fix_direction on already-optimized baseline (no improvement)\n\n## Validation Notes\n- Always validate for overlaps before submission\n- Use Shapely STRtree for efficient overlap detection\n- Configurations with overlaps are INVALID and will be rejected\n\n**SUBMISSION STRATEGY:**\n- Remaining submissions: 96\n- Submit after this experiment? YES - we have abundant submissions and need LB feedback\n- Even if score doesn't improve, LB feedback helps calibrate CV-LB relationship\n\n## Key Files and Paths\n- Baseline submission: /home/nonroot/snapshots/santa-2025/21105319338/code/datasets/santa-2025-csv/santa-2025.csv\n- C++ tree_packer source: /home/code/experiments/002_cpp_optimizer/tree_packer_full.cpp\n- C++ tree_packer binary: /home/code/experiments/002_cpp_optimizer/tree_packer_v21\n- Current submission: /home/submission/submission.csv (score: 70.734327, no overlaps)\n\n## Next Experiment: 002_extended_optimization\n1.

      "feedback": "## What I Understood\n\nThe junior researcher completed a baseline experiment for the Santa 2025 Christmas Tree Packing challenge. They downloaded a pre-optimized submission (santa-2025.csv) from Kaggle datasets and the bbox3 binary optimizer. However, they discovered that bbox3 requires GLIBC 2.34 while the system only has GLIBC 2.31, preventing them from running the optimizer. They applied fix_direction post-processing but reported no improvement (the baseline was already well-optimized). The baseline score is 70.734327, and the target is 68.931058 (need to improve by ~1.8 points).\n\n## Technical Execution Assessment\n\n**Validation**: The score of 70.734327 appears to be correctly calculated based on the submission format. The submission file has the correct structure with 's' prefixed values.\n\n**Leakage Risk**: None - this is an optimization problem, not a predictive modeling task. There's no train/test split to leak.\n\n**Score Integrity**: The score is reported but I cannot verify if fix_direction was actually applied or if it truly made no improvement. The notes claim \"no improvement was achieved\" but there's no code or logs to verify this.\n\n**Code Quality**: **CONCERN** - The code directory is empty. There's no notebook or script documenting what was actually done. This makes it impossible to verify the experiment or reproduce it.\n\nVerdict: **CONCERNS** - No code artifacts to verify the experiment. The GLIBC issue is a real blocker for bbox3, but alternative approaches exist.\n\n## Strategic Assessment\n\n**Approach Fit**: The approach of using bbox3 + fix_direction is correct based on top kernels. However, the GLIBC incompatibility is a significant blocker that needs to be addressed.\n\n**Effort Allocation**: **CRITICAL ISSUE** - The experiment essentially just downloaded a pre-existing solution without performing any actual optimization. The GLIBC issue blocked progress, but there are alternative approaches that weren't explored:\n\n1. **C++ tree_packer from smartmanoj kernel** - Can be compiled locally with g++ (which is available: g++ 9.4.0)\n2. **Pure Python optimization** - fix_direction, backward propagation, local search can all be implemented in Python\n3. **Hybrid approach** - Combine multiple techniques\n\n**Assumptions**: The assumption that bbox3 is the only path forward is incorrect. The smartmanoj kernel provides a complete C++ optimizer that can be compiled locally.\n\n**Blind Spots**: \n1. **The C++ tree_packer is compilable locally** - The smartmanoj kernel has complete C++ code that uses OpenMP for parallelization. This can be compiled with: `g++ -O3 -march=native -std=c++17 -fopenmp -o tree_packer tree_packer.cpp`\n2. **Backward propagation** - This technique (improving smaller N configs from larger N configs) is available in the smartmanoj kernel and can significantly improve scores\n3. **Multiple passes of fix_direction** - The yongsukprasertsuk kernel shows that multiple passes (2-3) of fix_direction can yield additional improvements\n4. **Per-N optimization** - Focus on N values with worst efficiency (highest s\u00b2/n contribution)\n\n**Trajectory**: This is the first experiment, so trajectory assessment is premature. However, the approach of just downloading a baseline without active optimization is not a productive path forward.\n\n## What's Working\n\n1. **Good problem understanding** - The seed prompt and research notes show solid understanding of the problem and available techniques\n2. **Correct baseline established** - Having a valid baseline (70.734327) is a good starting point\n3. **Identified key tools** - bbox3, fix_direction, backward propagation are correctly identified as important techniques\n4. **Overlap validation** - The notes mention validating for overlaps, which is critical for valid submissions\n\n## Key Concerns\n\n1. **Observation**: No actual optimization was performed - just downloaded a pre-existing solution\n   **Why it matters**: The baseline is 1.8 points away from target. Without active optimization, no progress will be made.\n   **Suggestion**: Compile and run the C++ tree_packer from smartmanoj kernel, or implement Python-based optimization\n\n2. **Observation**: GLIBC incompatibility blocked bbox3, but alternative approaches weren't explored\n   **Why it matters**: Time was wasted on a blocked path when alternatives exist\n   **Suggestion**: The C++ tree_packer can be compiled locally: `g++ -O3 -march=native -std=c++17 -fopenmp -o tree_packer a.cpp`\n\n3. **Observation**: No code artifacts in the code directory\n   **Why it matters**: Cannot verify what was done, cannot reproduce, cannot iterate\n   **Suggestion**: Create a notebook documenting the optimization pipeline with all steps\n\n4. **Observation**: fix_direction was claimed to have no effect, but this seems unlikely\n   **Why it matters**: fix_direction typically provides measurable improvements. If it truly had no effect, the baseline may already have optimal rotation.\n   **Suggestion**: Verify by implementing fix_direction in a notebook and checking the before/after scores for individual N values\n\n## Top Priority for Next Experiment\n\n**COMPILE AND RUN THE C++ TREE_PACKER FROM SMARTMANOJ KERNEL**\n\nThe smartmanoj kernel (`/home/code/research/kernels/smartmanoj_santa-claude/santa-claude.ipynb`) contains complete C++ code for a tree packer optimizer that:\n- Uses OpenMP for parallel processing\n- Implements simulated annealing with temperature scheduling\n- Has local search with 8-directional moves\n- Includes squeeze/compaction operations\n- Supports swap moves between trees\n- Can be compiled with the available g++ 9.4.0\n\nSteps:\n1. Extract the C++ code from the notebook (it's in `%%writefile a.cpp` cells)\n2. Compile: `g++ -O3 -march=native -std=c++17 -fopenmp -o tree_packer a.cpp`\n3. Run on the baseline submission with moderate parameters (e.g., `-n 5000 -r 16`)\n4. Apply fix_direction post-processing (multiple passes)\n5. Run backward propagation to improve smaller N configs\n6. Validate for overlaps and repair if needed\n\nThis approach bypasses the GLIBC issue entirely and provides a complete optimization pipeline that can be run locally. The target of 68.931058 is achievable with proper optimization - the current baseline of 70.734327 is from a public dataset that hasn't been heavily optimized.\n",

      "feedback": "## What I Understood\n\nThe junior researcher completed experiment 002_extended_optimization, attempting to improve on the baseline score of 70.734327. They ran the C++ tree_packer_v21 with 15000 iterations and 16 restarts, applied fractional translation post-processing to small N values (1-20), and searched 235 CSV files in snapshots for better per-N configurations. The result: no improvement over the baseline. The target is 68.931058, leaving a gap of ~1.8 points (2.6%).\n\n## Technical Execution Assessment\n\n**Validation**: The score of 70.734327 is correctly calculated. The exploration notebook (`evolver_loop1_analysis.ipynb`) shows proper scoring methodology using numba-accelerated functions.\n\n**Leakage Risk**: None - this is a pure optimization problem with no train/test split.\n\n**Score Integrity**: VERIFIED in the exploration notebook. The scoring function correctly computes bounding box side\u00b2 / N for each configuration.\n\n**Code Quality**: \n- The C++ tree_packer was successfully compiled and run (found in `/home/code/experiments/002_cpp_optimizer/`)\n- The exploration notebook is well-documented with clear analysis\n- However, the code directory `/home/code/code/` is still empty - no reusable notebooks for future experiments\n\nVerdict: **TRUSTWORTHY** - The results are valid, but the approach hasn't found improvements.\n\n## Strategic Assessment\n\n**CRITICAL INSIGHT FROM EXPLORATION NOTEBOOK:**\nThe exploration notebook reveals something crucial that the experiment notes don't emphasize:\n\n```\nEnsemble total score: 67.772662 (BELOW TARGET!)\nImprovement over baseline: 2.961665\n```\n\nBUT:\n```\nOverlaps in snapshot ensemble: [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22]...\n```\n\n**THE TARGET IS ACHIEVABLE.** The ensemble of best configurations from snapshots scores 67.77 - well below the target of 68.93. The problem is that these configurations have overlaps. When overlaps are removed (by falling back to baseline), the score returns to 70.73.\n\n**Approach Fit**: The current approach of running more optimization iterations is NOT addressing the real problem. The real problem is:\n1. Better configurations EXIST (from cpp_parallel_sa in snapshots)\n2. These configurations have OVERLAPS\n3. We need to FIX THE OVERLAPS, not run more optimization\n\n**Effort Allocation**: **MISALLOCATED** - Time was spent running tree_packer_v21 and searching for better configs, when the better configs already exist but have overlaps. The effort should be on OVERLAP REPAIR.\n\n**Assumptions Being Made**:\n1. \u274c \"The baseline is already well-optimized\" - FALSE. Better configs exist, they just have overlaps.\n2. \u274c \"Running more optimization will help\" - FALSE. The bottleneck is overlap repair, not optimization.\n\n**Blind Spots**:\n1. **Overlap repair is the key** - The exploration notebook shows configs from `/home/nonroot/snapshots/santa-2025/21090949260/code/experiments/009_cpp_parallel_sa/` have better scores but overlaps. These need to be repaired, not discarded.\n2. **Local search to fix overlaps** - Instead of discarding overlapping configs, apply local search to nudge trees apart while preserving the good packing structure.\n3. **The jazivxt kernel has overlap repair code** - The `why-not` kernel shows how to repair overlaps by replacing with baseline, but a better approach is to FIX the overlaps in place.\n\n**Trajectory**: The current trajectory is stuck because it's optimizing the wrong thing. The breakthrough will come from fixing overlaps in the better configurations, not from running more optimization on the baseline.\n\n## What's Working\n\n1. **Excellent exploration analysis** - The `evolver_loop1_analysis.ipynb` correctly identified that ensemble score 67.77 is achievable\n2. **C++ optimizer compiled and runs** - The tree_packer_v21 infrastructure is in place\n3. **Correct scoring and overlap detection** - The validation code is solid\n4. **Found the source of better configs** - Identified that cpp_parallel_sa submissions have better per-N scores\n\n## Key Concerns\n\n1. **Observation**: The experiment concluded \"baseline is already well-optimized\" when better configs exist\n   **Why it matters**: This conclusion is WRONG. The ensemble of best configs scores 67.77 (below target!). The issue is overlaps, not optimization quality.\n   **Suggestion**: Shift focus from \"run more optimization\" to \"fix overlaps in existing better configs\"\n\n2. **Observation**: Overlapping configs are being discarded instead of repaired\n   **Why it matters**: The best configs (from cpp_parallel_sa) have overlaps but score 67.77. Discarding them loses the improvement.\n   **Suggestion**: Implement overlap repair:\n   - For each N with overlap, apply local search to nudge overlapping trees apart\n   - Use small translations (0.001-0.01) in 8 directions\n   - Rotate trees slightly to resolve overlaps\n   - Only fall back to baseline if repair fails after many attempts\n\n3. **Observation**: No code artifacts in /home/code/code/\n   **Why it matters**: Cannot iterate efficiently without reusable code\n   **Suggestion**: Create a notebook with:\n   - Ensemble loading from snapshots\n   - Overlap detection per N\n   - Overlap repair via local search\n   - Score calculation and validation\n\n4. **Observation**: The cpp_parallel_sa configs have overlaps in N=3-200 (198 out of 200 N values!)\n   **Why it matters**: This suggests the SA algorithm is not properly enforcing collision constraints\n   **Suggestion**: The overlap repair needs to be systematic - perhaps run a constrained local search that only accepts moves that don't create new overlaps\n\n## Top Priority for Next Experiment\n\n**IMPLEMENT OVERLAP REPAIR FOR THE BETTER CONFIGURATIONS**\n\nThe path to beating the target is clear:\n1. Load the ensemble of best configs from snapshots (scores 67.77 with overlaps)\n2. For each N with overlaps, apply overlap repair:\n   - Identify which trees overlap\n   - Apply small translations/rotations to separate them\n   - Use local search that only accepts moves reducing overlap\n   - If repair succeeds, keep the improved config\n   - If repair fails after many attempts, fall back to baseline\n3. The repaired ensemble should score between 67.77 (if all repairs succeed) and 70.73 (if all fall back to baseline)\n\n**Specific implementation approach:**\n```python\ndef repair_overlaps(trees, max_iter=1000):\n    \"\"\"Repair overlaps via local search\"\"\"\n    for _ in range(max_iter):\n        overlapping_pairs = find_overlapping_pairs(trees)\n        if not overlapping_pairs:\n            return trees, True  # Success!\n        \n        # Pick a random overlapping pair\n        i, j = random.choice(overlapping_pairs)\n        \n        # Try small moves to separate them\n        for tree_idx in [i, j]:\n            for dx, dy in [(0.001, 0), (-0.001, 0), (0, 0.001), (0, -0.001), ...]:\n                # Try move\n                old_x, old_y = trees[tree_idx].x, trees[tree_idx].y\n                trees[tree_idx].x += dx\n                trees[tree_idx].y += dy\n                \n                # Check if overlap resolved and no new overlaps created\n                if not has_overlap_with_any(trees, tree_idx):\n                    break  # Keep the move\n                else:\n                    # Revert\n                    trees[tree_idx].x, trees[tree_idx].y = old_x, old_y\n    \n    return trees, False  # Failed to repair\n```\n\nThe target of 68.931058 IS ACHIEVABLE. The ensemble already scores 67.77 - we just need to fix the overlaps. This is a tractable problem that should be the focus of the next experiment.\n",

      "finding": "2\u2011D polygon packing \u2013 the task of arranging a set of possibly irregular polygons inside the smallest possible axis\u2011aligned rectangle (the bounding box) without overlap \u2013 is a classic NP\u2011hard combinatorial optimisation problem that appears in sheet\u2011metal cutting, textile layout, texture\u2011atlas generation and many other manufacturing and graphics pipelines.  Because an exact solution is computationally prohibitive for realistic instance sizes, research has produced a spectrum of approaches ranging from exact integer\u2011programming formulations to fast approximation and learning\u2011based heuristics.\n\nThe most widely used exact and geometric methods are the **envelope\u2011polygon**, **pixel**, **no\u2011fit\u2011polygon (NFP)** and **mixed\u2011integer programming (MIP)** techniques, which model the spatial relationships of the pieces and allow a solver to explore feasible placements ([frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/mechanical-engineering/articles/10.3389/fmech.2022.966691/full)).

      "finding": "Simulated\u2011annealing (SA) works best for 2\u2011D polygon\u2011packing when the temperature schedule and the neighbourhood moves are allowed to adapt to the geometry of the pieces.  A common recipe is to start with a **high initial temperature** that yields an acceptance probability of about\u202f0.8\u20130.9 for random moves, then apply a **geometric (exponential) cooling schedule**\u202f\\(T_{k+1}=\u03b1T_{k}\\) with a cooling factor\u202f\\(\u03b1\\) in the range\u202f0.95\u20130.99.  The algorithm should perform a **fixed number of inner iterations** at each temperature, often set to \u202f\\(c\u00b7N\\)\u202fwhere\u202f\\(N\\)\u202fis the number of polygons and\u202f\\(c\\)\u202f\u2248\u202f100\u2013200, and stop when the temperature falls below a small threshold or no improvement is observed for several successive temperatures\u202f([Adaptive Neighborhood Heuristics for Simulated Annealing over Continuous Variables](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/6509/3a9d2d6b9b38ac2c9a2da79c3905b76ef008.pdf)).  \n\nBecause the packing problem involves continuous rotation and translation, **adaptive neighbourh",
