Because an exact solution is computationally prohibitive for realistic instance sizes, research has produced a spectrum of approaches ranging from exact integer\u2011programming formulations to fast approximation and learning\u2011based heuristics.\n\nThe most widely used exact and geometric methods are the **envelope\u2011polygon**, **pixel**, **no\u2011fit\u2011polygon (NFP)** and **mixed\u2011integer programming (MIP)** techniques, which model the spatial relationships of the pieces and allow a solver to explore feasible placements ([frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/mechanical-engineering/articles/10.3389/fmech.2022.966691/full)).
