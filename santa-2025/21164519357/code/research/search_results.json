      "text": "Two\u2011dimensional polygon packing asks how to place a set of (often irregular) polygons inside a container \u2013 a rectangle, strip, or set of bins \u2013 while respecting non\u2011overlap and possibly allowing rotations, with the goal of minimizing the used area, height, or number of containers.  The problem is NP\u2011hard and appears in many industries (cutting\u2011stock, shipbuilding, textile, additive manufacturing) where material utilization is critical\u202f([Frontiers review](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmech.2022.966691/full)).  A broad taxonomy distinguishes **strip\u2011packing**, **bin\u2011packing**, and **nesting** (irregular\u2011shape) variants, each of which can be tackled with exact, approximation, or heuristic methods\u202f([Survey 2002](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0377221702001236);\u202f[Survey 2006](https://www.csc.liv.ac.uk/~epa/surveyhtml.html)).\n\n**Exact and mathematically rigorous approaches** model the placement as integer or constraint\u2011programming problems.  A meta\u2011CSP formulation treats pairwise geometric relations as variables, enabling powerful symmetry\u2011breaking and pruning techniques that compete with state\u2011of\u2011the\u2011art branch\u2011and\u2011bound solvers\u202f([Moffitt & Pollack, 2006](https://cse.unl.edu/~choueiry/Documents/Moffitt-ICAPS06.pdf)).  For irregular polygons, the **No\u2011Fit Polygon (NFP)** \u2013 the locus of positions where two polygons touch without overlapping \u2013 is a cornerstone of exact nesting algorithms and of many heuristic schemes\u202f([Bennell & Oliveira, 2008](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0377221706012379)).  When rotations are prohibited, recent polynomial\u2011time **approximation algorithms** achieve improved guarantees for convex\u2011polygon bin, strip, and area\u2011minimization problems by sorting items (e.g., by height) and applying shelf\u2011packing ideas\u202f([Kurpisz & Suter, 2023](https://export.arxiv.org/pdf/2308.08523v1.pdf)).\n\n**Heuristic and meta\u2011heuristic techniques** dominate practical large\u2011scale applications.  Simple level\u2011oriented rules such as **Decreasing Height (DH)** or **Bottom\u2011Left (BL)** place items row\u2011by\u2011row and are fast, though sub\u2011optimal\u202f([Survey 2006, \u00a71\u20113](https://www.csc.liv.ac.uk/~epa/surveyhtml.html)).  The stochastic extension **BLD\\*** randomizes the ordering of items (height, width, area, perimeter) and repeatedly applies BL, often yielding markedly better packings within a minute of computation\u202f([Lesh et\u202fal., 2005](https://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~michaelm/postscripts/jea2005.pdf)).  Evolutionary algorithms, simulated annealing, and tabu search are also common, typically built on the NFP to test feasibility quickly.  For highly irregular shapes, hybrid systems combine human\u2011guided interactive adjustments with automated search, exploiting the fact that people can intuit good placements\u202f([Lesh et\u202fal., 2005](https://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~michaelm/postscripts/jea2005.pdf)).\n\nIn practice, the \u201cbest\u201d technique depends on problem size and constraints:  \n* **Small to medium instances** where optimality is required \u2192 meta\u2011CSP or integer\u2011programming with NFP\u2011based pruning.  \n* **Large industrial nesting** with many irregular parts \u2192 NFP\u2011driven heuristics (DH, BL, BLD\\*) possibly enhanced by stochastic or evolutionary meta\u2011heuristics.  \n* **Convex\u2011only, rotation\u2011free cases** \u2192 the latest approximation algorithms that give provable bounds while remaining fast.  \n\nThese families of methods together form the current state\u2011of\u2011the\u2011art toolkit for 2D polygon packing optimization.",

In*two-dimensional bin packing problems*these units are finite rectangles, and the objective is to pack all the items into the minimum number of units, while in*two-dimensional strip packing problems*there is a single standardized unit of given width, and the objective is to pack all the items within the minimum height. We discuss mathematical models, and survey lower bounds, classical approximation algorithms, recent heuristic and metaheuristic methods and exact enumerative approaches. The relevant special cases where the items have to be packed into rows forming levels are also discussed in detail.\n## Introduction\nIn several industrial applications one is required to allocate a set of rectangular items to larger rectangular standardized stock units by minimizing the waste. In wood or glass industries, rectangular components have to be cut from large sheets of material. In warehousing contexts, goods have to be placed on shelves. In newspapers paging, articles and advertisements have to be arranged in pages. In these applications, the standardized stock units are rectangles, and a common objective function is to pack all the requested items into the minimum number of units: the resulting optimization problems are known in the literature as two-dimensional bin packing problems. In other contexts, such as paper or cloth industries, we have instead a single standardized unit (a roll of material), and the objective is to obtain the items by using the minimum roll length: the problems are then referred to as two-dimensional strip packing problems. As we will see in the following, the two problems have a strict relation in almost all algorithmic approaches to their solution.\nMost of the contributions in the literature are devoted to the case where the items to be packed have a fixed orientation with respect to the stock unit(s), i.e., one is not allowed to rotate them. This case, which is the object of the present article, reflects a number of practical contexts, such as the cutting of corrugated or decorated material (wood, glass, cloth industries), or the newspapers paging. For variants allowing rotations (usually by 90\u00b0) and/or constraints on the items placement (such as the \u201cguillotine cuts\u201d), the reader is referred to Lodi et al. [41], [42], where a three-field classification of the area is also introduced. General surveys on cutting and packing problems can be found in Dyckhoff and Finke [17], Dowsland and Dowsland [16] and Dyckhoff et al. [18]. Results on the probabilistic analysis of packing algorithms can be found in Coffman and Shor [12] and Coffman and Lueker [11].\nLet us introduce the problems in a more formal way. We are given a set of*n*rectangular*items**j*\u2208*J*={1,\u2026,*n*}, each defined by a*width*,*w**j*, and a*height*,*h**j*:\n* (i)\nin the*Two-Dimensional Bin Packing Problem*(2BP), we are further given an unlimited number of identical rectangular*bins*of width*W*and height*H*, and the objective is to allocate all the items to the minimum number of bins;\n* (ii)\nin the*Two-Dimensional Strip Packing Problem*(2SP), we are further given a bin of width*W*and infinite height (hereafter called*strip*), and the objective is to allocate all the items to the strip by minimizing the height to which the strip is used.\nIn both cases, the items have to be packed with their*w*-edges parallel to the*W*-edge of the bins (or strip). We will assume, with no loss of generality, that all input data are positive integers, and that*w**j*\u2a7d*W*and*h**j*\u2a7d*H*(*j*=1,\u2026,*n*).\nBoth problems are strongly NP-hard, as is easily seen by transformation from the strongly NP-hard (one-dimensional)*Bin Packing Problem*(1BP), in which*n*items, each having an associated size*h**j*, have to be partitioned into the minimum number of subsets so that the sum of the sizes in each subset does not exceed a given capacity*H*.\nA third relevant case of rectangle packing is the following. Each item*j*has an associated profit*p**j*&gt;0, and the problem is to select a subset of items, to be packed in a single finite bin, which maximizes the total selected profit. This problem is usually denoted as (*Two-Dimensional*)*Cutting Stock*, although it had been introduced by Gilmore and Gomory [29] as (*Two-Dimensional*)*Cutting Knapsack*.\nIn this survey we concentrate on two-dimensional problems in which all items have to be packed, i.e., on 2SP and 2BP. The reader is referred to Dyckhoff et al. [18, Section 5] for an annotated bibliography on two-dimensional cutting stock problems. For both 2SP and 2BP, we also consider the special case where the items have to be packed into rows forming levels.\nIn Section 2 we discuss mathematical models for the various problems introduced above. In Section 3 we survey classical approximation algorithms as well as more recent heuristic and metaheuristic methods. In Section 4 we introduce lower bounding techniques, while in Section 5 we describe exact enumerative approaches.\n## Section snippets\n## Modeling two-dimensional problems\nThe first attempt to model two-dimensional packing problems was made by Gilmore and Gomory [29], through an extension of their approach to 1BP (see [27], [28]). They proposed a column generation approach (see [53] for a recent survey) based on the enumeration of all subsets of items (*patterns*) that can be packed into a single bin. Let*A**j*be a binary column vector of*n*elements*a**ij*(*i*=1,\u2026,*n*) taking the value 1 if item*i*belongs to the*j*th pattern, and the value 0 otherwise.

Despite its relevance to industry, research publications are relatively low when compared to other cutting and packing problems. One explanation offered is the perceived difficulty and substantial time investment of developing a geometric tool box to assess computer generated solutions. In this paper we set out to provide a tutorial covering the core geometric methodologies currently employed by researchers in cutting and packing of irregular shapes. The paper is not designed to be an exhaustive survey of the literature but instead will draw on the literature to illustrate the theory and implementation of the approaches. We aim to provide a sufficiently instructive description to equip new and current researchers in the area to select the most appropriate methodology for their needs.\n## Introduction\nCutting and packing problems involving irregular shapes arise in a wide variety of industries including; garment manufacturing, sheet metal cutting, furniture making and shoe manufacturing. An example of a layout from the garment manufacturing industry is provided in Fig. 1. As a result the range of problem variants involving irregular shapes, referred to here as nesting problems, is a core area of research in the field of cutting and packing. The problem is NP-complete and as a result solution methodologies predominantly utilise heuristics. A further defining characteristic of nesting problems is the requirement to develop powerful geometric tools to handle the wide variety and complexity of shapes that need to be packed. In this paper we propose to provide detailed explanations of the most popular techniques for handling the geometry when solving nesting problems and provide guidance on their implementation, strengths and weaknesses.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized in six sections. In the next section the nesting problem is defined more precisely and the key differences between nesting problems and other cutting and packing problems are highlighted. In particular, the importance of the geometry is explained. In Section 3 geometric approaches based on pixel or raster representations are introduced. In Section 4 the concept of the*D*function is presented including algorithms to handle geometric tasks that use this function. In the following section, the nofit polygon is introduced and two different algorithms for its generation are described, one based on the sliding analogy and another using Minkowski sums. Polygon decomposition is also discussed in this section. In Section 6 the concept of Phi function is presented with illustrative examples.\n## Section snippets\n## Problem definition\nNesting problems are one of many terms used to identify the group of problems that will be discussed. A discussion of nomenclature is beyond the scope of this paper, however, it is helpful to identify the other names under which these problems are referenced. Some commonly used terms are irregular shape stock cutting, irregular packing, polygon placement, marker making, non-convex cutting stock, 2-D packing problems or some combination of any of these terms. The term*nesting problems*is adopted\n## Pixel/raster method\nRaster methods are approaches that divide the continuous stock sheet into discrete areas, hence reducing the geometric information to coding the data by a grid represented by a matrix. However, different authors have used different codification schemes, which are largely driven by the placement algorithm that will use this geometric information.\nOliveira and Ferreira (1993) propose the simplest coding scheme that uses the value of 1 to code the existence of piece and the value of 0 to denote the\n## Direct trigonometry and the*D*function\nGiven that the raster representation cannot accurately represent the irregular shape of the pieces, the alternative is to use the polygons directly. When representing the pieces as polygons the amount of information is proportional to the number of vertices and does not depend on the absolute size of the pieces or of the layout. However unlike the raster method, the feasibility or quality of a placement is not implied by the geometry and as a result another evaluation method must be employed.\n## The nofit polygon\nThe nofit polygon has become an increasingly popular option for dealing with the geometry since it is more efficient than direct trigonometry, particularly when using an iterative search, yet shares the benefit of accuracy by using the original edges of the polygon. In addition, the concept opens up new options for placement strategies. In essence the NFP is a polygon derived from aggregating the two component polygons. It can be used, along with the vector difference of the position of the two\n## Phi function\nThe phi-function is the most recent innovation in dealing with the geometric issues for nesting problems. Its purpose is to represent all mutual positions of two objects (in this context polygons), and therefore it is often associated with the NFP. However, this association is misleading as the NFP is only a special case of the broader theory. The Phi-function for cutting and packing were conceived and applied by Stoyan et al., 2001, Stoyan et al., 2004 and this research group continue to be\n## Conclusion\nThe paper has given a detailed description of the operations of a number of different approaches for dealing with the geometry required in the solution of nesting problems, these are; the raster method, direct trigonometry, the Nofit polygon and phi-functions. Each has its advantages and limitations and a common theme is that the more computationally efficient the approach the more complex it is to realise. There is no doubt that there is a sign...",

A link will be provided\nin a future version of this document.\narXiv:2308.08523v1 [cs.CG] 16 Aug 2023\n2 Improved Approximations for Translational Packing of Convex Polygons\n1 Introduction\nMany real-life situations require us to make decisions about optimally packing a collection\nof objects into a specific container. One particular category of these packing problems is\ntwo-dimensional packing, which is encountered in everyday scenarios like arranging items\non a shelf and in industrial applications such as cutting cookies from rolled-out dough\nor manufacturing sets of tiles from standard-sized panels made of wood, glass, or metal.\nAnother intriguing example involves cutting fabric pieces for clothing production. In this\ncase, the pieces often cannot be rotated freely, as they must adhere to a desired pattern\nin the final product, which is tailored of multiple elements. The widespread applicability\nof two-dimensional packing problems has led to a surge of interest in designing efficient\nalgorithms to address them. In this paper, we follow the line of research and study the\nproblem of packing convex polygons without rotations in various settings depending on the\ntype of containers used.\nPast research focusing on theoretical considerations of two-dimensional packings mainly\nconcentrates on the scenario when all objects are axis-parallel rectangles. In this paper, we\nwill discuss packing without rotations, in which only translations are permitted. There are\ntwo main classes of the problem depending on whether the size of the container is fixed and\nwe want to minimize the number of containers used or whether we want to minimize the\ncontainer\u2019s size with respect to some objective function.\nA seminal example of the first class is the Geometric Bin Packing problem in which\na number of unit size squared bins to pack is to be minimized. The problem is arguably\nthe most natural generalization of the regular (1D) Bin Packing to two dimensions, and\nits absolute approximability has been fully understood. Unless P = N P, the best possible\nefficient constant factor approximation is 2 [15], and such an algorithm is known [10].\nIn the second class, there are several variants to be considered. An example is the\nStrip Packing Problem which is concerned with packing objects into a strip of width\n1 and infinite height in such a way that the maximum of all the heights of the placed\nobjects is minimized. Like Geometric Bin Packing, Strip Packing generalizes (1D)\nBin Packing. The best known efficient constant factor approximation for Strip Packing\nhas approximation factor (5/3 + \u03f5) [9]. It is known that there can not exist a polynomial\ntime algorithm with an approximation ratio of (3/2 \u2212 \u03f5) for any \u03f5 > 0 unless P = N P, which\nfollows directly from the approximation hardness of (1D) Bin Packing. Both classes of\nproblems have been also considered in the asymptotic setting, see e.g. [11, 5, 12].\nIn younger time, there was also an increase of interest in cases where the objects in\nquestion are general convex polygons. Alt, de Berg and Knauer [2, 3] considered the problem\nof packing an instance consisting of a number of convex polygons of the form p \u2282 [0, 1]2into\na minimum area axis-parallel rectangular container. We refer to this problem as Polygon\nArea Minimization throughout this paper. In the special case where the instance consists\nof rectangles only, the problem is known to admit a PTAS [4]. They proved the existence of\nthe following efficient algorithm:\nA 23.78-approximation for Polygon Area Minimization.\nRecently, Aamand, Abrahamsen, Beretta and Kleist [1] showed that the algorithm of Alt,\nde Berg and Knauer can be leveraged to obtain also efficient approximation algorithms of\nfurther problems:\nA 7-approximation for Polygon Perimeter Minimization.\nA 51-approximation for Polygon Strip Packing.\nAn 11-approximation for Polygon Bin Packing for polygons with diameter at most 1\n10 .\nA. Kurpisz and S. Suter 3\n1.1 Our results\nThe results of Alt, de Berg and Knauer [2, 3] and Aamand et al. [1] are heavily based on\nso-called shelf packing algorithms. In shelf packing algorithms, the objects are first placed\non the shelves, possibly ordered by height, which are later stacked on one another to build\na final solution. Compared to axis-parallel rectangles, the main challenge in designing an\napproximation algorithm for polygon packing problems is that objects cannot be sorted by\nheight and orientation simultaneously. As a result, the algorithm and its analysis in [2, 3]\nhave such a large approximation guarantee. In this paper, we provide new insight into how\nshelf packing algorithms should be applied to polygon packing problems. We introduce a\nsequence of transformations of the objects that allow us first to sort them by height and later\nby orientation to build a solution of a much better approximation guarantee. More precisely,\nwe design polynomial-time algorithms with the following factors:\nA 9.45-approximation for Polygon Area Minimization.\nUsing this algorithm as a subroutine, we build upon the methods from Aamand et al. [1] to\nobtain the following efficient approximation algorithms:\nA (3.75 + \u03f5)-approximation for Polygon Perimeter Minimization.\nA 21.89-approximation for Polygon Strip Packing.\nA 5.09-approximation for Polygon Bin Packing for polygons which have their diameter\nbounded by 1\n10 .\nThe results are proved in Sections 4, 5, 6, and 7 respectively. Furthermore, in Section 8\nwe show the following results, which make progress towards solving an open question of a\nO(1)-approximation algorithm for Polygon Bin Packing for arbitrary polygons.\nThere is an efficient O(\n1\n\u03b4\n)-approximation algorithm for Polygon Bin Packing for\ninstances where each polygon has width or height at most 1 \u2212 \u03b4.\nThere is an efficient O(1)-approximation algorithm for Polygon Bin Packing for\ninstances with the property that all polygons share a spine (up to translation) with height\nat least 3\n4\n.\n2 Preliminaries\nWe start out considerations by recalling a classical and well-known problem in theoretical\ncomputer science, the Bin Packing problem: Given a list of numbers s1, . . . , sn \u2208 (0, 1] \u2229 Q,\nrepresenting the sizes of n objects, the goal is to find the minimum number of bins of size 1,\nso that we can pac...",

An efficient 2D irregular packing algorithm can effectively improve material utilization and reduce processing costs. The reduction in material consumption will also have a beneficial impact on the environment ([Ke et al., 2020](#B76)). Therefore, research of the packing problem is of great significance for technology and social interest.\nThe 2D packing problem is a type of combinatorial optimization problems to locate parts with different shapes compactly in one or more master sheet material to minimize the occupied space or maximize the utilization of the material. The 2D packing problem is currently recognized as a NP problem, which is mainly solved by heuristic algorithms. In recent years, many scholars have conducted research on 2D irregular packing problems with a verity of solutions.\nThere exists a number of review articles on packing and cutting problems. We have summarized the main review literature in the field of 2D packing and cutting as shown in[Table 1](#T1). Brown ([Brown, 1971](#B17)) introduced an optimum packing and depletion problem with optimization of space and resource usage. Harvey ([Salkin and De Kluyver, 1975](#B116)) surveyed the application of mathematical optimization models such as linear programming to the knapsack problem. Bruce ([Golden, 1976](#B50)) surveyed various approaches to the cutting stock problem. Hinxman ([Hinxman, 1980](#B65)) surveyed the trim-loss and assortment problems, this research paid more attention to cutting and packaging problems in practical applications, and did not mention much about theoretical methods. Garey and Coffman ([Garey and Johnson, 1981](#B47);[Coffman et al., 1984](#B27)) surveyed the approximation algorithms for bin packing problems. Israni ([Israni and Sanders, 1982](#B72)) reviewed the 2D cutting stock problem including almost all 2D packaging problems. The author also proposed a rectangular layout method. Sarin ([Sarin, 1983](#B118)) reviewed methodologies and literature to solve 2D stock cutting problems and introduced an interactive optimization procedure for a general 2D stock cutting problem. Dyckhoff ([Dyckhoff et al., 1985](#B38)) described a trim loss and related problems and categorized them briefly. Dudzi&#x00144;ski ([Dudzi&#x00144;ski and Walukiewicz, 1987](#B36)) summarized the exact methods for knapsack problems, such as linear programming. Matthias ([Rode and Rosenberg, 1987](#B114)) analyzed the algorithm for the trim-loss problems. Haessler ([Haessler and Sweeney, 1991](#B59)) reviewed the solution process of cutting stock problems, including placement algorithm and sequence optimization algorithm. Dowsland ([Dowsland and Dowsland, 1992](#B34)) reviewed the application of operations research methods to the packing problem and summarized some exact heuristics. Sweeney ([Sweeney and Paternoster, 1992](#B128)) categorized cutting and packing problems and made application-oriented research records. Cheng ([Cheng et al., 1994](#B22)) discussed 2D cutting stock problems and their application cases including the pallet loading problem and VLSI placement problem. With the gradual deepening of research on 2D layout problems, typology becomes a common research topic. 2D regular and irregular layout problems are clearly distinguished in practical applications and theoretical methods. Dowsland ([Dowsland and Dowsland, 1995](#B29)) gave a special review of the 2D irregular nesting problem for the first time. Mavridou ([Mavridou and Pardalos, 1997](#B98)) summarized applications of the genetic algorithm and simulated annealing algorithm in the optimization of facility layout problems. Dyckhoff ([Dyckhoff, 1990](#B37)) made a typology of the cutting and packing problems in detail, and W&#x000e4;scher ([W&#x000e4;scher et al., 2007](#B135)) improved the typology later. Hopper ([Hopper and Turton, 1999](#B67);[Hopper and Turton, 2001a](#B68);[Hopper and Turton, 2001b](#B69)) investigated the application of meta-heuristic and heuristic algorithms in 2D and 3D packing problems. Lodi ([Lodi et al., 2002a](#B90);[Lodi et al., 2002b](#B91)) reviewed algorithms proposed in the 1990s of 2D packing problems. Bennell et al. ([Bennell and Oliveira, 2008](#B10);[Bennell and Oliveira, 2009](#B9)) discussed 2D irregular packing problems and related geometric problems. Leao ([Leao et al., 2020](#B81)) introduced the mathematical models in the 2D irregular packing problem.\nTABLE 1\n[![www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/966691/fmech-08-966691-HTML/image_m/fmech-08-966691-t001.jpg)](https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/966691/fmech-08-966691-HTML/image_m/fmech-08-966691-t001.jpg)\n**TABLE 1**.

First-Fit Decreasing Height (FFDH) algorithm\nFFDH packs the next item\u00a0R (in non-increasing height)\non the first level where\u00a0R fits.\nIf no level can accommodate\u00a0R, a new level is created.\nTime complexity of FFDH: O(n\u00b7log n).\nApproximation ratio: FFDH(I)<=(17/10)\u00b7OPT(I)+1;\nthe asymptotic bound of 17/10 is tight.  [\\[6\\]](https://www.csc.liv.ac.uk/www.csc.liv.ac.uk#bib.6)\n2. Next-Fit Decreasing Height (NFDH) algorithm\nNFDH packs the next item\u00a0R (in non-increasing height)\non the current level if\u00a0R fits.\nOtherwise, the current level is \"closed\" and a new level is created.\nTime complexity: O(n\u00b7log n).\nApproximation ratio: NFDH(I) <= 2\u00b7OPT(I)+1;\nthe asymptotic bound of 2 is tight. [\\[6\\]](https://www.csc.liv.ac.uk/www.csc.liv.ac.uk#bib.6)\n3. Best-Fit Decreasing Height (BFDH) algorithm\nBFDH packs the next item\u00a0R (in non-increasing height) on the level, among those that can\naccommodate\u00a0R, for which the residual horizontal space is the minimum. If no level can\naccommodate\u00a0R, a new level is created.\n4. Bottom-Left (BL) Algorithm\nBL first order items by non-increasing width.\nBL packs the next item as near to the bottom as it will fit\nand then as close to the left as it can go without overlapping with\nany packed item.\nNote that BL is not a level-oriented packing algorithm.\nTime complexity: O(n2\n).\nApproximation ratio: BL(I)<=3\u00b7OPT(I)\u00a0.\n5. Baker's Up-Down (UD) algorithm\u00a0[\\[1\\]](https://www.csc.liv.ac.uk/www.csc.liv.ac.uk#bib.1)\nUD uses a combination of BL and a generalization of NFDH.\nThe width of the strip and the items are normalized\nso that the strip is of unit width.\nUD orders the items in non-increasing width and\nthen divides the items into five groups, each with width\nin the range (1/2, 1\\], (1/3,1/2\\],\n(1/4,1/3\\], (1/5,1/4\\], (0,1/5\\].\nThe strip is also divided into five regions\u00a0R1, \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 , R5.\nBasically, some items of width in the range (1/i+1, 1/i\\],\nfor 1 <= i <= 4,\nare packed to region\u00a0Ri by BL.\nSince BL leaves a space of increasing width from top to bottom at the right\nside of the strip, UD takes this advantage by first packing the item\nto Rj for j = 1, \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 , 4 (in order) from top to bottom.\nIf there is no such space, the item is packed to\u00a0Ri by BL.\nFinally, items of size at most\u00a01/5 are packed to\nthe spaces in R1, \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 , R4 by the (generalized) NFDH algorithm.\nAgain if there is no space in these regions, the item is packed to R5\nusing NFDH.\nApproximation ratio: UD(I) <= (5/4) \u00b7 OPT(I)+(53/8)H,\nwhere H is the maximum height of the items;\nthe asymptotic bound of 5/4 is tight\u00a0[\\[1\\]](https://www.csc.liv.ac.uk/www.csc.liv.ac.uk#bib.1).\n6. Reverse-fit (RF) algorithm [\\[12\\]](https://www.csc.liv.ac.uk/www.csc.liv.ac.uk#bib.12)\nRF also normalizes the width of the strip and the items\nso that the strip is of unit width.\nRF first stacks all items of width greater than\u00a01/2.\nRemaining items are sorted in non-increasing height and will\nbe packed above the height\u00a0H0 reached by those greater than\u00a01/2.\nThen RF repeats the following process.\nRoughly speaking, RF packs items from left to right with their bottom along the line\nof height\u00a0H0 until there is no more room.\nThen packs items from right to left and from top to bottom\n(called reverse-level) until the total width is at least\u00a01/2.\nThen the reverse-level is dropped down until (at least) one of them\ntouches some item below.\nThe drop down is somehow repeated and we refer the reader to [\\[10\\]](https://www.csc.liv.ac.uk/www.csc.liv.ac.uk#bib.10) for more details.\nApproximation ratio: RF(I) <= 2\u00b7OPT(I) [\\[10\\]](https://www.csc.liv.ac.uk/www.csc.liv.ac.uk#bib.10).\n7. Steinberg's algorithm [\\[12\\]](https://www.csc.liv.ac.uk/www.csc.liv.ac.uk#bib.12)\nSteinberg's algorithm, denoted as\u00a0M in the paper,\nestimates an upper bound of the height\u00a0H required\nto pack all the items such that it is proved that the input items\ncan be packed into a rectangle of width\u00a0W and height\u00a0H.\nThey then define seven procedures (with seven conditions),\neach to divide a problem into two smaller ones and solve\nthem recursively.\nIt has been showed that any tractable problem satisfies one\nof the seven conditions.\nApproximation ratio: M(I) <= 2\u00b7OPT(I).\n8.

      "text": "Optimal Rectangle Packing: A Meta-CSP Approach\nMichael D. Moffitt and Martha E. Pollack\nDepartment of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science\nUniversity of Michigan\nAnn Arbor, MI 48109, USA\n{mmoffitt, pollackm}@eecs.umich.edu\nAbstract\nWe present a new approach to optimal rectangle packing, an\nNP-complete problem that can be used to model many sim\u0002ple scheduling tasks. Recent attempts at incorporating artifi\u0002cial intelligence search techniques to the problem of rectangle\npacking have focused on a CSP formulation, in which partial\nassignments are defined to be the fixed placement of a sub\u0002set of rectangles. Our technique takes a significant departure\nfrom this search space, as we instead view partial assignments\nas subsets of relative pairwise relationships between rectan\u0002gles. This approach recalls the meta-CSP commonly con\u0002structed in constraint-based temporal reasoning, and is thus a\ncandidate for several pruning techniques that have been de\u0002veloped in that field. We apply these to the domain of rect\u0002angle packing, and develop a suite of new techniques that ex\u0002ploit both the symmetry and geometry present in this partic\u0002ular domain. We then provide experimental results demon\u0002strating that our approach performs competitively compared\nto the previous state-of-the-art on a series of benchmarks,\nmatching or surpassing it in speed on nearly all instances.\nFinally, we conjecture that our technique is particularly ap\u0002propriate for problems containing large rectangles, which are\ndifficult for the fixed-placement formulation to handle effi\u0002ciently.\nIntroduction\nThe problem of rectangle packing is one that has drawn at\u0002tention from several diverse fields of computer science. For\ninstance, in the context of scheduling, it can be used to rep\u0002resent scenarios where jobs require a fixed amount of time\nand resources, which compose the two dimensions of a sin\u0002gle rectangle. The task of packing many such rectangles into\nan enclosing space, so as to minimize the width, height, or\narea of this space, allows for the minimization of makespan,\nresources needed, or total wasted resource. In VLSI design,\nrectangles represent actual physical modules that need to be\nplaced in a spatial arrangement such that no two modules\noverlap.\nOne of the more recent approaches (Korf 2003) has cast\noptimal rectangle packing as a constraint satisfaction prob\u0002lem (CSP). In this formulation, a variable is created for each\nrectangle, whose legal values are the positions that rectan\u0002gle could occupy without exceeding the boundaries of the\nenclosing space. In addition, there is a binary constraint\nbetween each pair of rectangles, requiring that they do not\nCopyright \u0001c 2006, American Association for Artificial Intelli\u0002gence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved.\noverlap. To solve this CSP, Korf developed a backtracking\nalgorithm, where each partial assignment is defined to be\nthe fixed placement of a subset of rectangles. By obtaining\nlower bounds on the amount of wasted space at each node in\nthe search, an efficient algorithm is constructed, which was\nlater refined (Korf 2004) into the fastest known algorithm\nfor optimal rectangle packing.\nIn this paper, we present a new approach to rectangle\npacking. Specifically, we cast the problem of optimally\npacking a set of rectangles with fixed orientations as a meta\u0002CSP. In this formulation, we create a meta-variable for each\npair of rectangles, whose values are the four pairwise re\u0002lationships (i.e., above, below, left of, right of) that pre\u0002vent that pair from overlapping. As such, commitment to\nthe exact placement of any rectangle is not established un\u0002til a consistent solution has been generated. In this regard,\nour approach resembles graph-based methods for optimal\nrectangle packing (Onodera, Taniguchi, & Tamaru 1991),\nwhich have previously been unable to cope with more than a\nsmall handful of rectangles. The key difference in our meta\u0002CSP formulation is the introduction of modern artificial\u0002intelligence search techniques that greatly increase the effi\u0002ciency of exploring this alternative space. Some of these are\ndrawn from literature on constraint-based temporal reason\u0002ing (Dechter, Meiri, & Pearl 1991; Stergiou & Koubarakis\n1998; Tsamardinos & Pollack 2003), while others are en\u0002tirely new techniques that exploit the symmetry and geom\u0002etry present in this particular domain. We combine these\nmethods to create the BLUEBLOCKER solver, and provide ex\u0002perimental results demonstrating that our approach performs\ncompetitively compared to the previous state-of-the-art on a\nseries of benchmarks. Finally, we conjecture that our tech\u0002nique is particularly appropriate for problems containing\nlarge rectangles, which are difficult for the fixed-placement\nformulation to handle efficiently.\nBackground\nRectangle Packing\nConsider the following problem: we are given a set of N\njobs, where each job j requires a specific number of workers\n(or machines) mj and a specific amount of uninterrupted\nprocessing time pj . Assuming that all workers are paid the\nsame salary and work the same hours, one may wish to find\na schedule that minimizes the total cost of labor (which is\nproportional to the product of number of workers and the\ntotal hours worked).\n93\nThis problem can be approximated as a rectangle pack\u0002ing problem.1 Specifically, each job can be represented by a\nrectangle, with width wj being equal to the time required pj ,\nand height hj being equal to the required number of work\u0002ers mj . Minimizing the total labor cost is then equivalent to\nfinding an enclosing rectangle of dimensions W \u00d7 H whose\ntotal area is minimal. We refer to this as the Minimal Bound\u0002ing Box Problem. The decision variant of this, where the di\u0002mensions of the enclosing space are specified, we refer to as\nthe Containment Problem.\nPrevious work on rectangle packing has primarily focused\non generating approximate or suboptimal solutions, using\ntechniques such as genetic algorithms and simulated anneal\u0002ing. To facilitate these approaches, a number of data struc\u0002tures have been developed to represent a layout of rectangles\nincluding sequence pairs (Murata et al. 1995), BSG struc\u0002tures (Nakatake et al. 1996), and O-Trees (Guo, Cheng, &\nYoshimura 1999). We omit the details of such structures, as\nthey are largely unrelated to our formulation.\nThe first line of research to consider optimal two\u0002dimensional compactions of rectangles (Onodera,\nTaniguchi, & Tamaru 1991) applied a branch-and-bound\napproach, using a graph algorithm to maintain consistency\nat each step of the backtracking search. Extensions of\nthis method have been largely avoided, as it was shown to\nhandle no more than six rectangles tractably. More recently,\nan algorithm using the O-Tree representation was able\nto surpass this record by efficiently handling up to nine\nrectangles (Chan & Markov 2004).\nRectangle Packing as a CSP\nOne of the more distinctive approaches to rectangle packing\n(Korf 2003) applied artificial intelligence search techniques\nwith great success. In this work, rectangle packing is mod\u0002eled as a binary constraint satisfaction problem. There is a\nvariable for each rectangle, whose legal values are the po\u0002sitions it could occupy without exceeding the boundaries of\nthe enclosing space. In addition, there is a binary constraint\nbetween each pair of rectangles that they cannot overlap.\nTo solve this CSP, a backtracking algorithm is used. At\neach node in the search, a rectangle is given a fixed posi\u0002tion within the enclosing space. This is accomplished by\n\u201cdrawing\u201d the rectangle (or an outline of the rectangle) onto\na bitmap representing the entire area. For example, one such\npartial assignment is depicted in Figure 1. Here, two rect\u0002angles (in fact, squares) have been given assignments. The\nupper-left corner of the 6\u00d76 square has been placed at (0, 0),\nand the upper-left corner of the 5\u00d75 square has been placed\nat (6, 0). Suppose we have four more squares remaining,\nwith dimensions 4\u00d74, 3\u00d73, 2\u00d72, and 1\u00d71; by visual in\u0002spection...",

Lesh et al.\n1. INTRODUCTION\nPacking problems involve constructing an arrangement of items that minimizes\nthe total space required by the arrangement. In this paper, we specifically con\u0002sider the two-dimensional (2D) rectangular strip packing problem. The input\nis a list of n rectangles with their dimensions and a target width W. The goal is\nto pack the rectangles without overlap into a single rectangle of width W and\nminimum height H. We further restrict ourselves to the orthogonal variation,\nwhere rectangles must be placed parallel to the horizontal and vertical axes.\nWe consider two variations: fixed orientation, in which the rectangles cannot be\nrotated, and variable orientation, in which they can be rotated by 90\u25e6. Further,\nfor all our test cases, all dimensions are integers. Like most packing problems,\n2D rectangular strip packing (even with these restrictions) is NP-hard.\nA common method for packing rectangles is to take an ordered list of rect\u0002angles and greedily place them one by one. Perhaps the best studied and most\neffective such heuristic for the fixed-orientation variation is the Bottom-Left\n(BL) heuristic, where rectangles are sequentially placed first as close to the\nbottom and then as far to the left as they can fit. For some problems, BL can\u0002not find the optimal packing under any ordering of the rectangles [Baker et al.\n1980; Brown 1980], nor does it perform well in practice when applied to random\norderings. However, a very successful approach is to apply BL to the rectan\u0002gles ordered by decreasing height, width, perimeter, and area and return the\nbest of the four packings that result [Hopper 2000]. We refer to this scheme as\nBottom-Left-Decreasing (BLD).\nA natural alternative approach would be to find good orderings of the rectan\u0002gles for BL or other similar heuristics using standard search techniques, such\nas simulated annealing, genetic algorithms, or tabu search. Despite significant\nefforts in this area, the search space has not generally proved amenable to such\nsearch techniques; for more details see the thesis of Hopper [2000]. Recently,\ngenetic algorithms and tabu search, using a different search space, have proved\nmore successful [Iori et al. 2003].\nIn this paper, we present a variation of the BLD heuristic called BLD\u2217\nthat considers successive random perturbations of the original four decreasing\norderings. We also present an apparently novel generalization of BL and, conse\u0002quently, of BLD and BLD\u2217, for the variable orientation case. Our experiments on\nboth benchmark and randomly generated problems show that BLD\u2217 substan\u0002tially outperforms BLD, as well as BL applied to randomly chosen orderings.\nFor example, for the benchmarks taken from Hopper [2000] in the case of fixed\norientation, BLD\u2217 reduces the packing height from an average of 9.4% over\noptimal by BLD to about 4.9% over optimal after just one minute. These are\nthe best published results for these benchmarks that we are aware of. We note\nthat improvements of even 1% can be very valuable for industrial applications\nof this problem, such as glass and steel cutting.\nThis work was done as part of Human-Guided Search (HuGS) project, an\nongoing effort to develop interactive optimization systems [Klau et al. 2002a].\nDetermining how people can effectively interact with powerful stochastic search\nalgorithms is important because it leverages people\u2019s abilities in areas in which\nACM Journal of Experimental Algorithmics, Vol. 10, Article No. 1.2, 2005.\nNew Approaches to 2D Rectangular Strip Packing \u2022 3\nthey currently outperform computers, such as visual perception and strategic\nassessment. Furthermore, involving people in the process of optimization can\nhelp them understand and trust the produced solutions, as well as modify them\non the fly, if the need arises. Human-guided search makes particular sense in\nthe context of cutting and packing problems, where humans can often find\nbetter solutions than the best current algorithms. Our interactive optimization\nsystem is designed to allow people to effectively use the computer\u2019s speed and\npreprogrammed algorithms to more quickly find good solutions than they could\nfind alone, especially for larger problems.\nFor the 2D packing problem, we explored people\u2019s ability to guide our BLD\u2217\nheuristic. We found that people can reason about this problem to make use of the\ncomputer\u2019s power extremely well. People can identify particularly well-packed\nsubregions of a given packing and then focus a search algorithm on improving\nthe other parts. People can also devise multistep repairs to a packing problem to\nreduce unused space, often producing packings that could not be found by the BL\nheuristic for any ordering of rectangles. Our experiments on large benchmarks\nshow that interactive use of BLD\u2217 can produce solutions 1% closer to optimal\nin about 20 min than BLD\u2217 produces on its own in 2 hours. Thus, 2D packing\nseems to be a problem for which people and computers can currently produce\nbetter results together tha...",
