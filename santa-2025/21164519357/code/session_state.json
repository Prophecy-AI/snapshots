The problem is NP\u2011hard and appears in many industries (cutting\u2011stock, shipbuilding, textile, additive manufacturing) where material utilization is critical\u202f([Frontiers review](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmech.2022.966691/full)).  A broad taxonomy distinguishes **strip\u2011packing**, **bin\u2011packing**, and **nesting** (irregular\u2011shape) variants, each of which can be tackled with exact, approximation, or heuristic methods\u202f([Survey 2002](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0377221702001236);\u202f[Survey 2006](https://www.csc.liv.ac.uk/~epa/surveyhtml.html)).\n\n**Exact and mathematically rigorous approaches** model the placement as integer or constraint\u2011programming problems.
