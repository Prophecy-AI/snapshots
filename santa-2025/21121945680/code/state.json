The problem appears in ship\u2011building, sheet\u2011metal cutting, textile and furniture manufacturing, and is NP\u2011hard, so practical solvers rely on sophisticated heuristics, meta\u2011heuristics, and approximation algorithms rather than exact enumeration\u202f([Frontiers](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmech.2022.966691/full)).\n\nAmong the most effective approaches reported in recent literature are:  \n\n* **Hybrid meta\u2011heuristics** \u2013 a genetic algorithm combined with an intensive local\u2011search phase (often called a \u201cjostle\u201d or \u201c2\u2011level\u201d method) consistently outperforms pure heuristics on heterogeneous\u2011bin instances, achieving the lowest total bin area while allowing unrestricted rotation\u202f([Southampton ePrints](https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/415314)).  \n* **Adapted ",
