The problem appears in ship\u2011building, sheet\u2011metal cutting, textile and furniture manufacturing, and is NP\u2011hard, so practical solvers rely on sophisticated heuristics, meta\u2011heuristics, and approximation algorithms rather than exact enumeration\u202f([Frontiers](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmech.2022.966691/full)).\n\nAmong the most effective approaches reported in recent literature are:  \n\n* **Hybrid meta\u2011heuristics** \u2013 a genetic algorithm combined with an intensive local\u2011search phase (often called a \u201cjostle\u201d or \u201c2\u2011level\u201d method) consistently outperforms pure heuristics on heterogeneous\u2011bin instances, achieving the lowest total bin area while allowing unrestricted rotation\u202f([Southampton ePrints](https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/415314)).  \n* **Adapted selection\u2011placement heuristics** \u2013 the Djang\u2011Finch (DJD) selection rule, originally for 1\u2011D bin packing, paired with a fast placement routine gives very strong results on convex\u2011polygon instances and reduces computational cost dramatically\u202f([Springer](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10479-013-1341-4?error=cookies_not_supported&code=3c5ca47d-16b7-45a4-84c1-a2324b798285)).  \n* **Bottom\u2011left and shelf\u2011packing schemes** \u2013 sorting polygons by height (or a transformed \u201cheight\u201d after rotation) and inserting them with the bottom\u2011left strategy yields simple yet competitive solutions; recent work improves the underlying shelf\u2011packing approximation guarantees for translational (no\u2011rotation) convex polygons, achieving polynomial\u2011time O(1)\u2011approximation bounds\u202f([arXiv](https://export.arxiv.org/pdf/2308.08523v1.pdf)).  \n* **Two\u2011level / collision\u2011free region algorithms** \u2013 a hierarchical placement that first reserves collision\u2011free regions and then packs polygons inside them provides a deterministic framework that scales well to large, highly irregular shapes\u202f([Academia.edu](https://www.academia.edu/104990563/IRREGULAR_PLACEMENT_PROBLEM_Solved_with_a_2_Level_Algorithm_and_Collision_Free_Region)).  \n* **General meta\u2011heuristic families** \u2013 genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, tabu search and artificial neural\u2011network\u2011guided searches have all been applied to irregular strip\u2011packing, often as components of hybrid systems; they excel when the search space is huge and problem\u2011specific heuristics are unavailable\u202f([Springer Review](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1012590107280?error=cookies_not_supported&code=60bc48b4-b7d2-4520-acdb-8666b5b6d1b2)).\n\nThese methods are typically combined in practice: a fast constructive heuristic (bottom\u2011left or shelf\u2011packing) builds an initial layout, which is then refined by a meta\u2011heuristic (GA or tabu) and a local\u2011search \u201cjostle\u201d that re\u2011orients or swaps polygons to exploit unused space.

An efficient 2D irregular packing algorithm can effectively improve material utilization and reduce processing costs. The reduction in material consumption will also have a beneficial impact on the environment ([Ke et al., 2020](#B76)). Therefore, research of the packing problem is of great significance for technology and social interest.\nThe 2D packing problem is a type of combinatorial optimization problems to locate parts with different shapes compactly in one or more master sheet material to minimize the occupied space or maximize the utilization of the material. The 2D packing problem is currently recognized as a NP problem, which is mainly solved by heuristic algorithms. In recent years, many scholars have conducted research on 2D irregular packing problems with a verity of solutions.\nThere exists a number of review articles on packing and cutting problems. We have summarized the main review literature in the field of 2D packing and cutting as shown in[Table 1](#T1). Brown ([Brown, 1971](#B17)) introduced an optimum packing and depletion problem with optimization of space and resource usage. Harvey ([Salkin and De Kluyver, 1975](#B116)) surveyed the application of mathematical optimization models such as linear programming to the knapsack problem. Bruce ([Golden, 1976](#B50)) surveyed various approaches to the cutting stock problem. Hinxman ([Hinxman, 1980](#B65)) surveyed the trim-loss and assortment problems, this research paid more attention to cutting and packaging problems in practical applications, and did not mention much about theoretical methods. Garey and Coffman ([Garey and Johnson, 1981](#B47);[Coffman et al., 1984](#B27)) surveyed the approximation algorithms for bin packing problems. Israni ([Israni and Sanders, 1982](#B72)) reviewed the 2D cutting stock problem including almost all 2D packaging problems. The author also proposed a rectangular layout method. Sarin ([Sarin, 1983](#B118)) reviewed methodologies and literature to solve 2D stock cutting problems and introduced an interactive optimization procedure for a general 2D stock cutting problem. Dyckhoff ([Dyckhoff et al., 1985](#B38)) described a trim loss and related problems and categorized them briefly. Dudzi&#x00144;ski ([Dudzi&#x00144;ski and Walukiewicz, 1987](#B36)) summarized the exact methods for knapsack problems, such as linear programming. Matthias ([Rode and Rosenberg, 1987](#B114)) analyzed the algorithm for the trim-loss problems. Haessler ([Haessler and Sweeney, 1991](#B59)) reviewed the solution process of cutting stock problems, including placement algorithm and sequence optimization algorithm. Dowsland ([Dowsland and Dowsland, 1992](#B34)) reviewed the application of operations research methods to the packing problem and summarized some exact heuristics. Sweeney ([Sweeney and Paternoster, 1992](#B128)) categorized cutting and packing problems and made application-oriented research records. Cheng ([Cheng et al., 1994](#B22)) discussed 2D cutting stock problems and their application cases including the pallet loading problem and VLSI placement problem. With the gradual deepening of research on 2D layout problems, typology becomes a common research topic. 2D regular and irregular layout problems are clearly distinguished in practical applications and theoretical methods. Dowsland ([Dowsland and Dowsland, 1995](#B29)) gave a special review of the 2D irregular nesting problem for the first time. Mavridou ([Mavridou and Pardalos, 1997](#B98)) summarized applications of the genetic algorithm and simulated annealing algorithm in the optimization of facility layout problems. Dyckhoff ([Dyckhoff, 1990](#B37)) made a typology of the cutting and packing problems in detail, and W&#x000e4;scher ([W&#x000e4;scher et al., 2007](#B135)) improved the typology later. Hopper ([Hopper and Turton, 1999](#B67);[Hopper and Turton, 2001a](#B68);[Hopper and Turton, 2001b](#B69)) investigated the application of meta-heuristic and heuristic algorithms in 2D and 3D packing problems. Lodi ([Lodi et al., 2002a](#B90);[Lodi et al., 2002b](#B91)) reviewed algorithms proposed in the 1990s of 2D packing problems. Bennell et al. ([Bennell and Oliveira, 2008](#B10);[Bennell and Oliveira, 2009](#B9)) discussed 2D irregular packing problems and related geometric problems. Leao ([Leao et al., 2020](#B81)) introduced the mathematical models in the 2D irregular packing problem.\nTABLE 1\n[![www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/966691/fmech-08-966691-HTML/image_m/fmech-08-966691-t001.jpg)](https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/966691/fmech-08-966691-HTML/image_m/fmech-08-966691-t001.jpg)\n**TABLE 1**.

A link will be provided\nin a future version of this document.\narXiv:2308.08523v1 [cs.CG] 16 Aug 2023\n2 Improved Approximations for Translational Packing of Convex Polygons\n1 Introduction\nMany real-life situations require us to make decisions about optimally packing a collection\nof objects into a specific container. One particular category of these packing problems is\ntwo-dimensional packing, which is encountered in everyday scenarios like arranging items\non a shelf and in industrial applications such as cutting cookies from rolled-out dough\nor manufacturing sets of tiles from standard-sized panels made of wood, glass, or metal.\nAnother intriguing example involves cutting fabric pieces for clothing production. In this\ncase, the pieces often cannot be rotated freely, as they must adhere to a desired pattern\nin the final product, which is tailored of multiple elements. The widespread applicability\nof two-dimensional packing problems has led to a surge of interest in designing efficient\nalgorithms to address them. In this paper, we follow the line of research and study the\nproblem of packing convex polygons without rotations in various settings depending on the\ntype of containers used.\nPast research focusing on theoretical considerations of two-dimensional packings mainly\nconcentrates on the scenario when all objects are axis-parallel rectangles. In this paper, we\nwill discuss packing without rotations, in which only translations are permitted. There are\ntwo main classes of the problem depending on whether the size of the container is fixed and\nwe want to minimize the number of containers used or whether we want to minimize the\ncontainer\u2019s size with respect to some objective function.\nA seminal example of the first class is the Geometric Bin Packing problem in which\na number of unit size squared bins to pack is to be minimized. The problem is arguably\nthe most natural generalization of the regular (1D) Bin Packing to two dimensions, and\nits absolute approximability has been fully understood. Unless P = N P, the best possible\nefficient constant factor approximation is 2 [15], and such an algorithm is known [10].\nIn the second class, there are several variants to be considered. An example is the\nStrip Packing Problem which is concerned with packing objects into a strip of width\n1 and infinite height in such a way that the maximum of all the heights of the placed\nobjects is minimized. Like Geometric Bin Packing, Strip Packing generalizes (1D)\nBin Packing. The best known efficient constant factor approximation for Strip Packing\nhas approximation factor (5/3 + \u03f5) [9]. It is known that there can not exist a polynomial\ntime algorithm with an approximation ratio of (3/2 \u2212 \u03f5) for any \u03f5 > 0 unless P = N P, which\nfollows directly from the approximation hardness of (1D) Bin Packing. Both classes of\nproblems have been also considered in the asymptotic setting, see e.g. [11, 5, 12].\nIn younger time, there was also an increase of interest in cases where the objects in\nquestion are general convex polygons. Alt, de Berg and Knauer [2, 3] considered the problem\nof packing an instance consisting of a number of convex polygons of the form p \u2282 [0, 1]2into\na minimum area axis-parallel rectangular container. We refer to this problem as Polygon\nArea Minimization throughout this paper. In the special case where the instance consists\nof rectangles only, the problem is known to admit a PTAS [4]. They proved the existence of\nthe following efficient algorithm:\nA 23.78-approximation for Polygon Area Minimization.\nRecently, Aamand, Abrahamsen, Beretta and Kleist [1] showed that the algorithm of Alt,\nde Berg and Knauer can be leveraged to obtain also efficient approximation algorithms of\nfurther problems:\nA 7-approximation for Polygon Perimeter Minimization.\nA 51-approximation for Polygon Strip Packing.\nAn 11-approximation for Polygon Bin Packing for polygons with diameter at most 1\n10 .\nA. Kurpisz and S. Suter 3\n1.1 Our results\nThe results of Alt, de Berg and Knauer [2, 3] and Aamand et al. [1] are heavily based on\nso-called shelf packing algorithms. In shelf packing algorithms, the objects are first placed\non the shelves, possibly ordered by height, which are later stacked on one another to build\na final solution. Compared to axis-parallel rectangles, the main challenge in designing an\napproximation algorithm for polygon packing problems is that objects cannot be sorted by\nheight and orientation simultaneously. As a result, the algorithm and its analysis in [2, 3]\nhave such a large approximation guarantee. In this paper, we provide new insight into how\nshelf packing algorithms should be applied to polygon packing problems. We introduce a\nsequence of transformations of the objects that allow us first to sort them by height and later\nby orientation to build a solution of a much better approximation guarantee. More precisely,\nwe design polynomial-time algorithms with the following factors:\nA 9.45-approximation for Polygon Area Minimization.\nUsing this algorithm as a subroutine, we build upon the methods from Aamand et al. [1] to\nobtain the following efficient approximation algorithms:\nA (3.75 + \u03f5)-approximation for Polygon Perimeter Minimization.\nA 21.89-approximation for Polygon Strip Packing.\nA 5.09-approximation for Polygon Bin Packing for polygons which have their diameter\nbounded by 1\n10 .\nThe results are proved in Sections 4, 5, 6, and 7 respectively. Furthermore, in Section 8\nwe show the following results, which make progress towards solving an open question of a\nO(1)-approximation algorithm for Polygon Bin Packing for arbitrary polygons.\nThere is an efficient O(\n1\n\u03b4\n)-approximation algorithm for Polygon Bin Packing for\ninstances where each polygon has width or height at most 1 \u2212 \u03b4.\nThere is an efficient O(1)-approximation algorithm for Polygon Bin Packing for\ninstances with the property that all polygons share a spine (up to translation) with height\nat least 3\n4\n.\n2 Preliminaries\nWe start out considerations by recalling a classical and well-known problem in theoretical\ncomputer science, the Bin Packing problem: Given a list of numbers s1, . . . , sn \u2208 (0, 1] \u2229 Q,\nrepresenting the sizes of n objects, the goal is to find the minimum number of bins of size 1,\nso that we can pac...",

As packing tasks arecombinatorial problems with very large searchspaces, the recent literature encourages theuse of meta-heuristic search methods, inparticular genetic algorithms. The objective ofthis paper is to present and categorise thesolution approaches in the literature for 2Dregular and irregular strip packing problems.The focus is hereby on the analysis of themethods involving genetic algorithms. Anoverview of the methods applying othermeta-heuristic algorithms including simulatedannealing, tabu search, and artificial neuralnetworks is also given.\n\nThis is a preview of subscription content, [log in via an institution](https://wayf.springernature.com?redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1023%2FA%3A1012590107280%3Ferror%3Dcookies_not_supported%26code%3D60bc48b4-b7d2-4520-acdb-8666b5b6d1b2) to check access.\n\n## Access this article\n\n[Log in via an institution](https://wayf.springernature.com?redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1023%2FA%3A1012590107280%3Ferror%3Dcookies_not_supported%26code%3D60bc48b4-b7d2-4520-acdb-8666b5b6d1b2)\n\nBuy article PDF USD 39.95\n\nPrice excludes VAT (USA)\n\nTax calculation will be finalised during checkout.\n\nInstant access to the full article PDF.\n\nRent this article via DeepDyve\n\n[Institutional subscriptions](https://www.springernature.com/gp/librarians/licensing/agc/journals)\n\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n\n![](https://media.springernature.com/w215h120/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10479-021-04226-6/MediaObjects/10479_2021_4226_Fig1_HTML.png)\n\n### [A hybrid metaheuristic for the two-dimensional strip packing problem](https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10479-021-04226-6?fromPaywallRec=true)\n\nArticle24 August 2021\n\n![](https://media.springernature.com/w92h120/springer-static/cover-hires/book/978-3-662-44739-0?as=webp)\n\n### [An Analogy between Bin Packing Problem and Permutation Problem: A New Encoding Scheme](https://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-662-44739-0_70?fromPaywallRec=true)\n\nChapter\u00a9 2014\n\n![](https://media.springernature.com/w92h120/springer-static/cover-hires/book/978-3-319-22635-4?as=webp)\n\n### [Hybrid Heuristic Algorithms for the Multiobjective Load Balancing of 2D Bin Packing Problems](https://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-319-22635-4_19?fromPaywallRec=true)\n\nChapter\u00a9 2016\n\n## References\n\n- Adamowicz, M. & Albano, A.

In the two-dimensional case, not only is it the case that the piece\u2019s size is important but its shape also has a significant influence. Therefore, DJD as a selection heuristic has to be paired with a placement heuristic to completely construct a solution to the underlying packing problem. A successful adaptation of the DJD requires a routine to reduce computational costs, which is also proposed and successfully tested in this paper. Results, on a wide variety of instance types with convex polygons, are found to be significantly better than those produced by more conventional selection heuristics.\n\nThis is a preview of

The container has a fixed width, while its length can change so that all items are placed in it. The objective is to find a layout of the set of polygons that minimizes the length of the container. The proposed algorithm constructively creates layouts from an ordered list of items and a placement heuristic. The placement determines the collision free region (represents the set of translations to create a feasible layout) for the item to be placed. It is shown that the collision free region must be calculated using non-regularized Boolean operations, as contours of no-fit polygons should be ignored. The proposed algorithm to solve the placement problem has two levels, in the internal level the container has fixed dimensions, and the external level reduces or increases the variable dimension. The placement heuristic searches for degenerated vertices and edges as they represent local maximum compaction. Computational comparisons on benchmark problems show that the proposed algorithm generated highly competitive solutions. Moreover, our algorithm updated some best known results.\n...Read more\n## Key takeaways\n![sparkles](https://a.academia-assets.com/images/icons/sparkle.svg)\nAI\n1. The proposed two-level algorithm effectively minimizes container length for irregular polygon packing.\n2. Collision free regions (CFRs) are determined using non-regularized Boolean operations to avoid contour interference.\n3. Placement heuristic prioritizes degenerated edges and vertices for optimal item fitting and compaction.\n4. Benchmark tests with 13 datasets demonstrated competitive results, achieving 100% density in some cases.\n5. Simulated annealing (SA) is integrated for sequence and position control of item placements.\n## Related papers\n[Rotational Placement of Irregular Polygons over Containers with Fixed Dimensions using Simulated Annealing and No-Fit Polygons](https://www.academia.edu/58884840/Rotational_Placement_of_Irregular_Polygons_over_Containers_with_Fixed_Dimensions_using_Simulated_Annealing_and_No_Fit_Polygons)\n[Thiago de Castro Martins](https://independent.academia.edu/ThiagodeCastroMartins)\nJournal of the Brazilian Society of Mechanical Sciences and Engineering, 2008\nThis work deals with the problem of minimizing the waste of space that occurs on a rotational placement of a set of irregular bi-dimensional small items inside a bidimensional large object. This problem is approached with an heuristic based on simulated annealing. Traditional &quot;external penalization&quot; techniques are avoided through the application of the no-fit polygon, that determinates the collision-free region for each small item before its placement. The simulated annealing controls: the rotation applied and the placement of the small item. For each non-placed small item, a limited depth binary search is performed to find a scale factor that when applied to the small item, would allow it to be fitted in the large object. Three possibilities to define the sequence on which the small items are placed are studied: larger-first, random permutation and weight sorted. The proposed algorithm is suited for non-convex small items and large objects.\ndownloadDownload free PDF[View PDFchevron\\_right](https://www.academia.edu/58884840/Rotational_Placement_of_Irregular_Polygons_over_Containers_with_Fixed_Dimensions_using_Simulated_Annealing_and_No_Fit_Polygons)\n[An effective heuristic for the two-dimensional irregular bin packing problem](https://www.academia.edu/69875946/An_effective_heuristic_for_the_two_dimensional_irregular_bin_packing_problem)\n[Gabriela Ochoa](https://independent.academia.edu/GabrielaOchoa10)\nAnnals of Operations Research, 2013\nThis paper proposes an adaptation, to the two-dimensional irregular bin packing problem of the Djang and Finch heuristic (DJD), originally designed for the one-dimensional bin packing problem. In the two-dimensional case, not only is it the case that the piece&#39;s size is important but its shape also has a significant influence. Therefore, DJD as a selection heuristic has to be paired with a placement heuristic to completely construct a solution to the underlying packing problem. A successful adaptation of the DJD requires a routine to reduce computational costs, which is also proposed and successfully tested in this paper. Results, on a wide variety of instance types with convex polygons, are found to be significantly better than those produced by more conventional selection heuristics.\ndownloadDownload free PDF[View PDFchevron\\_right](https://www.academia.edu/69875946/An_effective_heuristic_for_the_two_dimensional_irregular_bin_packing_problem)\n[Irregular rotational placement of shapes over non-convex containers with fixed dimensions](https://www.academia.edu/104990568/Irregular_rotational_placement_of_shapes_over_non_convex_containers_with_fixed_dimensions)\n[Thiago de Castro Martins](https://independent.academia.edu/ThiagodeCastroMartins)\n8th IFAC International Workshop on Intelligent Manufacturing Systems, 2007, 2007\nThis work deals with the problem of minimize the waste of space that occurs on a placement of a set of bi-dimensional items inside a bi-dimensional container with fixed dimensions.

It explores the procedure of applying the bottom-left strategy to a given order the bottom-left algorithm. The chapter explains the irregular strip packing problem and introduces some practical algorithms for irregular packing problems. It focuses on the problem of packing irregular shapes represented in bitmap format and analyses the rectilinear block packing problem and also introduces various schemes used to represent solutions to the rectilinear block packing problem and algorithms based on such coding schemes. The chapter considers two-dimensional irregular packing problems, which have been actively studied in the last decade. It provides some basic techniques including bottom-left strategy, clustering strategy, and no-fit polygons. The chapter shows that various algorithms proposed for the irregular strip packing and bin packing problems and their variants. T. Imamichi et al. proposed an iterated local search based on nonlinear programming for the irregular strip packing problem.\n\n[Taylor & Francis Group Logo![Taylor & Francis Group Logo](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/assets/images/tfgroup-logo-white.svg)](https://www.taylorfrancis.com)\n\n- PoliciesPolicies\n\n- [Privacy Policy](https://informa.com/privacy-policy/)\n- [Terms & Conditions](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/terms-and-conditions/)\n- [Cookie Policy](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/cookie-policy/)\n\n- JournalsJournals\n\n- [Taylor & Francis Online](https://www.tandfonline.com)\n\n- CorporateCorporate\n\n- [Taylor & Francis Group](https://taylorandfrancis.com/)\n\n- Help & ContactHelp & Contact\n\n- [Students/Researchers](https://help.taylorfrancis.com/students_researchers)\n- [Librarians/Institutions](https://help.taylorfrancis.com/librarians_institutions)\n\n- Connect with us\n\n\nRegistered in England & Wales No. 3099067\n\n5 Howick Place \\| London \\| SW1P 1WG\u00a9 2024 Informa UK Limited\n\nBack to Top",

Irregular shape packing is one of the most recent variants to be widely researched and its history extends over 40 years. The evolution of solution approaches to this problem can be attributed to increased computer power and advances in geometric techniques as well as more sophisticated and insightful algorithm design. In this paper we will focus on the latter. Our aim is not to give a chronological account or an exhaustive review, but to draw on the literature to describe and evaluate the core approaches. Irregular packing is combinatorial and as a result solution methods are heuristic, save a few notable exceptions. We will explore different ways of representing the problem and mechanisms for moving between solutions. We will also propose where we see the future challenges for researchers in this area.\n\n## Suggested Citation\n\nJ A Bennell & J F Oliveira, 2009.\n\" **[A tutorial in irregular shape packing problems](https://ideas.repec.org/a/pal/jorsoc/v60y2009i1d10.1057_jors.2008.169.html)**,\"\n[Journal of the Operational Research Society](https://ideas.repec.org/s/pal/jorsoc.html), Palgrave Macmillan;The OR Society, vol. 60(1), pages 93-105, May.\nHandle: _RePEc:pal:jorsoc:v:60:y:2009:i:1:d:10.1057\\_jors.2008.169_\n\nDOI: 10.1057/jors.2008.169\n\nas\n\nHTMLHTML with abstractplain textplain text with abstractBibTeXRIS (EndNote, RefMan, ProCite)ReDIFJSON\n\n## Download full text from publisher\n\n**File URL:** http://link.springer.com/10.1057/jors.2008.169\n\n**File Function:** Abstract\n\n**Download Restriction:** Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.\n\n* * *\n\n**File URL:** https://libkey.io/10.1057/jors.2008.169?utm\\_source=ideas\n\n**LibKey link**: if access is restricted and if your library uses this service, LibKey will redirect you to where you can use your library subscription to access this item\n\n---><---\n\nAs the access to this document is restricted, you may want to [search](https://ideas.repec.org/cgi-bin/htsearch2?q=%22A+tutorial+in+irregular+shape+packing+problems%22) for a different version of it.\n\n## References listed on IDEAS\n\nas\n\nHTMLHTML with abstractplain textplain text with abstractBibTeXRIS (EndNote, RefMan, ProCite)ReDIFJSON\n\n01.
