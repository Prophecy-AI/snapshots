      "finding": "Two\u2011dimensional irregular\u2011polygon packing is usually tackled with a mix of geometric preprocessing and combinatorial optimisation.  The most widely adopted \u201cclassic\u201d pipelines first generate a **no\u2011fit polygon (NFP)** or an **envelope polygon** that captures the feasible relative positions of two pieces, then use a placement heuristic (e.g., bottom\u2011left, skyline) to build a layout inside a bounding box.  Variants of this pipeline include the **pixel\u2011based method** (which discretises shapes into a bitmap for fast overlap checks) and exact **mixed\u2011integer programming (MIP)** formulations for small instances\u202f([frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/mechanical-engineering/articles/10.3389/fmech.2022.966691/full)).  Recent refinements such as an **improved sliding algorithm for generating NFPs** make the geometric stage faster and more accurate, directly reducing the final box area\u202f([mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2227-7390/10/16/2941)).\n\nOn the optimisation side, **meta\u2011heur",
