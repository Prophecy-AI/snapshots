    "\n",
    "The better baseline (70.647306) from snapshot 21165874980 was rejected by Kaggle due to overlapping trees in group 042 (N=42). Our local validation didn't catch this.\n",

    "1. Why did our local validation miss the overlap?\n",
    "2. What is the actual overlap in group 042?\n",
    "3. Can we fix it?\n",
    "4. What is our best VALID submission?"
