      "text": "Two\u2011dimensional irregular\u2011polygon packing is usually tackled with a mix of geometric preprocessing and combinatorial optimisation.  The most widely adopted \u201cclassic\u201d pipelines first generate a **no\u2011fit polygon (NFP)** or an **envelope polygon** that captures the feasible relative positions of two pieces, then use a placement heuristic (e.g., bottom\u2011left, skyline) to build a layout inside a bounding box.  Variants of this pipeline include the **pixel\u2011based method** (which discretises shapes into a bitmap for fast overlap checks) and exact **mixed\u2011integer programming (MIP)** formulations for small instances\u202f([frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/mechanical-engineering/articles/10.3389/fmech.2022.966691/full)).  Recent refinements such as an **improved sliding algorithm for generating NFPs** make the geometric stage faster and more accurate, directly reducing the final box area\u202f([mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2227-7390/10/16/2941)).\n\nOn the optimisation side, **meta\u2011heuristics** dominate large\u2011scale industrial use.  A hybrid **genetic\u2011algorithm\u202f+\u202flinear\u2011programming (GA\u2011LP)** scheme iteratively refines piece sequences and then solves the positioning sub\u2011problem, achieving strong material\u2011utilisation on benchmark sets\u202f([mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/13/22/12474)).  An **enhanced genetic algorithm** that incorporates image\u2011processing\u2011based overlap detection and an \u201cexpanded\u2011area\u201d ordering further improves compactness\u202f([sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0952197625010401)).  A **knowledge\u2011reuse heuristic (KRIH)** builds on a twin\u2011neural\u2011network similarity measure to transfer good piece sequences from previous tasks and then applies an improved bottom\u2011left placement, yielding equal\u2011or\u2011better results on most test instances with modest runtime\u202f([nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5)).\n\nThe newest **learning\u2011based approaches** treat packing as a continuous optimisation problem.  **GFPack++** uses an attention\u2011driven gradient\u2011field model to encode both geometry and relational information, supporting arbitrary rotations and container shapes while generating collision\u2011free layouts much faster than traditional diffusion models\u202f([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1)).  Complementary **local\u2011search heuristics** combined with unrestricted rotation also show competitive performance, especially when integrated with the NFP framework\u202f([eprints.soton.ac.uk](https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/415314)).  \n\nIn practice, the most effective pipelines blend a fast NFP or pixel\u2011based overlap engine with a strong meta\u2011heuristic (GA\u2011LP or KRIH) and, when computational resources allow, augment the search with a learned gradient\u2011field model such as GFPack++.  This combination consistently yields the smallest bounding\u2011box areas across a wide range of irregular\u2011polygon instances.",

An efficient 2D irregular packing algorithm can effectively improve material utilization and reduce processing costs. The reduction in material consumption will also have a beneficial impact on the environment ( [Ke et al., 2020](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B76)). Therefore, research of the packing problem is of great significance for technology and social interest.\n\nThe 2D packing problem is a type of combinatorial optimization problems to locate parts with different shapes compactly in one or more master sheet material to minimize the occupied space or maximize the utilization of the material. The 2D packing problem is currently recognized as a NP problem, which is mainly solved by heuristic algorithms. In recent years, many scholars have conducted research on 2D irregular packing problems with a verity of solutions.\n\nThere exists a number of review articles on packing and cutting problems. We have summarized the main review literature in the field of 2D packing and cutting as shown in [Table 1](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#T1). Brown ( [Brown, 1971](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B17)) introduced an optimum packing and depletion problem with optimization of space and resource usage. Harvey ( [Salkin and De Kluyver, 1975](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B116)) surveyed the application of mathematical optimization models such as linear programming to the knapsack problem. Bruce ( [Golden, 1976](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B50)) surveyed various approaches to the cutting stock problem. Hinxman ( [Hinxman, 1980](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B65)) surveyed the trim-loss and assortment problems, this research paid more attention to cutting and packaging problems in practical applications, and did not mention much about theoretical methods. Garey and Coffman ( [Garey and Johnson, 1981](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B47); [Coffman et al., 1984](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B27)) surveyed the approximation algorithms for bin packing problems. Israni ( [Israni and Sanders, 1982](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B72)) reviewed the 2D cutting stock problem including almost all 2D packaging problems. The author also proposed a rectangular layout method. Sarin ( [Sarin, 1983](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B118)) reviewed methodologies and literature to solve 2D stock cutting problems and introduced an interactive optimization procedure for a general 2D stock cutting problem. Dyckhoff ( [Dyckhoff et al., 1985](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B38)) described a trim loss and related problems and categorized them briefly. Dudzi\u0144ski ( [Dudzi\u0144ski and Walukiewicz, 1987](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B36)) summarized the exact methods for knapsack problems, such as linear programming. Matthias ( [Rode and Rosenberg, 1987](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B114)) analyzed the algorithm for the trim-loss problems. Haessler ( [Haessler and Sweeney, 1991](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B59)) reviewed the solution process of cutting stock problems, including placement algorithm and sequence optimization algorithm. Dowsland ( [Dowsland and Dowsland, 1992](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B34)) reviewed the application of operations research methods to the packing problem and summarized some exact heuristics. Sweeney ( [Sweeney and Paternoster, 1992](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B128)) categorized cutting and packing problems and made application-oriented research records. Cheng ( [Cheng et al., 1994](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B22)) discussed 2D cutting stock problems and their application cases including the pallet loading problem and VLSI placement problem. With the gradual deepening of research on 2D layout problems, typology becomes a common research topic. 2D regular and irregular layout problems are clearly distinguished in practical applications and theoretical methods. Dowsland ( [Dowsland and Dowsland, 1995](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B29)) gave a special review of the 2D irregular nesting problem for the first time. Mavridou ( [Mavridou and Pardalos, 1997](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B98)) summarized applications of the genetic algorithm and simulated annealing algorithm in the optimization of facility layout problems. Dyckhoff ( [Dyckhoff, 1990](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B37)) made a typology of the cutting and packing problems in detail, and W\u00e4scher ( [W\u00e4scher et al., 2007](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B135)) improved the typology later. Hopper ( [Hopper and Turton, 1999](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B67); [Hopper and Turton, 2001a](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B68); [Hopper and Turton, 2001b](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B69)) investigated the application of meta-heuristic and heuristic algorithms in 2D and 3D packing problems.

The proposed attention-based diffusion model for 2D irregular packing, GFPack++, supports\ncontinuous rotation and accommodating arbitrary boundaries.\n\n## 1\\. Introduction\n\nIrregular shape packing is a classic challenge in operation research, with significant implications for various applications such as texture atlas generation and material utilization in manufacturing\u00a0(Wang et\u00a0al., [2021](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib34)). Its NP-hard nature requires practical and effective packing algorithms to optimize space utilization.\n\nTraditional numerical optimization methods are often slow and costly. Recently, learning-based methods have emerged as a promising alternative for irregular packing, mainly using reinforcement learning\u00a0(Xu et\u00a0al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib37); Yang et\u00a0al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib39)).\nAnother promising approach is the diffusion model, which learns geometric relationships from teacher packing examples and establishes a gradient field for all objects, guiding them to move simultaneously\u00a0(Hosseini et\u00a0al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib11); Xue et\u00a0al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib38)).\nIn particular, the work of (Xue et\u00a0al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib38)), namely GFPack, achieves a notable trade-off between computational cost and space utilization, demonstrating scalability in terms of polygon count and generalizability to rectangular container boundaries.\nHowever, it still faces unresolved issues, notably the lack of support for rotation, a relatively high occurrence of object collisions in results, and limited adaptability to arbitrary boundaries.\n\nThe main idea of the learning-based packing framework is to capture the geometric relationships between shapes, which are essential for the gradient computation.\nSuch relationships in latent space encompass multiple facets: the _spatial (position, orientation) relationship_ of the shapes, the _geometric features relationship_ among them, and the _container boundary conditions_ that constrain them.\nHowever, GFPack falls short in fully representing these relationships.\nIt solely focuses on the positional aspect, neglecting orientation, thus hindering rotational capabilities. Furthermore, it relies on PointNeXt\u00a0(Qian et\u00a0al., [2022](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib24)) for geometric feature extraction, ignoring critical details like polygon edges and resulting in a loss of topological and local features.\nThus, we argue that the full potential of gradient learning has not been thoroughly exploited in GFPack.\n\nIn this study, we introduce two primary strategies to tackle the challenge of learning packing policies.\nFirstly, we use a graph to represent each object and encode it with an _attention-based geometric encoder_, which can capture polygonal geometry information effectively.\nSecondly, we design an _attention-based relation encoding_ mechanism to encode intricate relationships both between polygons and among polygons and boundaries, eliminating the need to explicitly represent the relationships with a graph.\nThis attention-based diffusion model enhances the understanding of how objects interact with each other and the boundaries, resulting in superior performance in both training and inference.\nWe also investigate the utilization distribution between the teacher and inference data and design a weighting function to prioritize tighter teacher data during training, confirmed to be effective.\n\nThis paper makes the following contributions:\n\n1. -\n\n\nWe propose GFPack++, a novel packing framework that employs attention-based learning of gradient fields, supporting continuous rotation and enhancing generalization.\n\n2. -\n\n\nAdvancing beyond GFPack, we encapsulate geometric relationships in an attention-based encoder, incorporating mutual spatial (position, orientation) relationships of objects, their geometric features, and container boundary conditions, and a weighting function to facilitate effective learning policies.\n\n3. -\n\n\nGFPack++ achieves superior irregular packing results, demonstrating higher space utilization over several widely used baselines, one order of magnitude faster than the previous diffusion-based method, coupled with promising generalization for arbitrary boundaries.\n\n\n## 2\\. Related Work\n\n#### Traditional packing approaches\n\nTraditional methods usually involve placement optimization and sequence planning ( _c.f_.surveys\u00a0(Bennell and Oliveira, [2009](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib3); Leao et\u00a0al., [2020](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib18))). Most research focuses on placement optimization with heuristic rules (e.g., BL, BLF), NFP-based search\u00a0(Bennell and Song, [2008](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib4)), or mathematical models\u00a0(Hopper and Turton, [2001](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib10)). Novel approaches include SDF-based placement\u00a0(Pan et\u00a0al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib23)) and spectral domain correlation\u00a0(Cui et\u00a0al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib6)), but they only support limited rotations. Sequence planning combines heuristics\u00a0(Lopez et\u00a0al., [2013](htt...",

The classic packing solution is a hybrid algorithm based on heuristic positioning and meta-heuristic sequencing, which has the problems of complex solving rules and high time cost. In this study, the similarity measurement method based on the twin neural network model is used to evaluate the similarity of pieces in the source task and the target task. The reusability evaluation of packing tasks is designed to select appropriate source task knowledge. The transfer operator is used to transfer the piece sequence knowledge from the source task to complete the reuse of packing knowledge in the target task. The bottom-left algorithm is improved to complete the placement of 2D irregular pieces. The computational experiments show that the proposed algorithm for the bin packing problem using knowledge reuse and improved heuristic (KRIH) has good robustness. The KRIH algorithm can obtain 8 equal or better results on 16 instances in a relatively short time compared with some classical heuristic algorithms, which has good application potential.\n\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n\n### [A sampling-based winner determination model and algorithm for logistics service procurement auctions under double uncertainty](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-94748-x?fromPaywallRec=false)\n\nArticleOpen access08 April 2025\n\n### [Optimizing 2D irregular packing via image processing and computational intelligence](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-97202-0?fromPaywallRec=false)\n\nArticleOpen access10 April 2025\n\n### [Multi-objective steel plate cutting optimization problem based on real number coding genetic algorithm](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-27100-2?fromPaywallRec=false)\n\nArticleOpen access28 December 2022\n\n## Introduction\n\nPacking problems are commonly found in industries such as mechanical manufacturing, aviation, clothing, automotive manufacturing, shipbuilding, and furniture manufacturing. The manufacturing process of typical heavy industry products is shown in Fig.\u00a0[1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#Fig1). In actual production, efficient packing algorithms can improve the utilization of raw materials and reduce production costs within an acceptable time. In a sense, the reduction of raw material consumption can have a beneficial impact on the environment[1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#ref-CR1). Packing problems, also known as bin packing problems or nesting problems, can be divided into three categories[2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#ref-CR2): the one-dimensional (1D) packing problem (wire cutting stock problem)[3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#ref-CR3), [4](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#ref-CR4), the two-dimensional (2D) packing problem (planar packing problem)[5](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#ref-CR5), [6](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#ref-CR6) and the three-dimensional (3D) packing problem[7](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#ref-CR7). The 2D packing problem is an interesting combinatorial optimization problem, which is used to place pieces of different shapes on one or more plates according to certain rules to minimize the space occupied by pieces or maximize the utilization of raw materials. The pieces here are general terms. In the metal processing industry, it refers to the pieces to be processed. In the garment manufacturing industry, it refers to the sample to be cut. And in the logistics industry, it refers to the goods to be placed. The packing problem has a large solution space and is an NP-complete (NP-C) problem, and the optimal solution cannot be obtained in polynomial time[8](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#ref-CR8). According to the regularity of piece shape, 2D packing problems can be further divided into 2D regular and 2D irregular packing problems. Among them, 2D irregular packing problems have received widespread attention due to their more diverse piece shapes and complex packing operations. Compared with the rectangular packing problem, the 2D irregular piece packing problem is very different in constraint calculation, solution strategy, overlap detection, so it has a larger solution space and more complicated technical operation. The 2D irregular piece packing has more applications in actual production. For 2D irregular packing problems, the existing research focuses on finding the approximate optimal solution or satisfactory solution within an acceptable time. The solving of the 2D irregular packing problem often involves two stages: sequence optimization and position optimization. In the sequence optimization stage, the sequence of pieces arranged on the plate is optimized. In the position optimization stage, the final placement scheme of pieces on the plate is determined. Early solutions to the irregular packing problem include the polygonal envelope method[9](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#ref-CR9), clustering feature combination method, and fitting method[10](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#ref-CR10), etc. In the late 1970s, researchers began to study contour features based on the real shape of irregular pieces to judge the overlap between pieces. These methods include no-fit polygon (NFP)[11](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#ref-CR11), [12](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#ref-CR12), raster methods (also called pixel methods)[13](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#ref-CR13), linear programming (LP), and mixed-integer linear programming (MIP)[14](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#ref-CR14), [15](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#ref-CR15). Each method has its advantages, but the current mainstream method is NFP[16](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#ref-CR16). Burke E et al.[17](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#ref-CR17) designed an NFP algorithm capable of dealing with circular arcs, improved the track sliding method, and achieved good test results.\n\n**Fig. 1**\n\nThe manufacturing process of typical heavy industry products.\n\n[Full size image](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5/figures/1)\n\nIn the process of piece placement, commonly used positioning algorithms include the bottom-left (BL) algorithm[18](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#ref-CR18), the improving bottom-left (iBL) algorithm[19](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#ref-CR19), etc. Utilizing and improving the BL algorithm becomes one of the research points for solving 2D irregular packing problems. The sequence of piece placement is crucial for the final packing result. Therefore, the study of sequence optimization of the packing problem is another key point to improve the piece packing efficiency. Sequence optimization algorithm belongs to the meta-heuristic algorithm[20](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#ref-CR20), [21](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#ref-CR21) or intelligent algorithm, including simulated annealing algorithm[22](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#ref-CR22), tabu search algorithm[23](https://www.na...",

This research not only addresses key challenges in irregular packing through an AI-based approach but also establishes a new benchmark for future optimization techniques in this domain.</p></div></div><div><h2>Introduction</h2><section><p>Two-dimensional irregular packing problems have received considerable attention due to their wide applicability across industries such as manufacturing, logistics, and design (Gomes, 2013; Ma et al., 2018; Stoyan et al., 2016). The corresponding problems involve arranging irregularly shaped objects within a limited space in an efficient way to improve material utilization. The special challenges of the process arise due to the irregularities of shapes and the constraints involved.</p><p>In recent years, the advancements in algorithms and computational techniques have significantly pushed the boundaries of research in this area by offering innovative insights and solutions, including mathematical and advanced self-learning models (Fang et al., 2021, 2023; Gomes, 2013; Chen et al., 2022; Hu et al., 2018).</p><p>The genesis of contemporary approaches to irregular packing problems was proposed by Gomes and Oliveira (2006), who introduced a pioneering hybrid algorithm that combined simulated annealing with linear programming. Their approach significantly advanced the optimization of placement for irregular shaped parts, demonstrating the potential of combining metaheuristics with linear models for local optimization. The realm of guillotine cuts, a prevalent challenge in industries such as glass cutting, was addressed by Han et al. (2013) through the application of one-stage and two-stage strategies, underscoring the efficiency of direct guillotine-cutting layouts from irregular shapes without necessitating initial rectangle encasement.</p><p>Further exploration into the optimization of two-dimensional irregular bin packing problems was presented by Martinez-Sykora et al. (2017), who proposed constructive algorithms that leveraged integer programming for piece assignment and mixed integer programming for placement within bins. The incorporation of free rotation of pieces by Abeysooriya et al. (2018) marked a significant progress, allowing for a more flexible approach for packing irregular shapes and demonstrating the effectiveness of alternative placement criteria over the common bottom-left criteria.</p><p>The application of genetic algorithms to enhance traditional methods was explored by Wong et al. (2009), offering a hybrid methodology that improved the efficiency of packing processes for irregular-shaped parts. Gomes (2013) made significant contributions to the area by highlighting the computational geometry's role in enhancing nesting algorithms for irregular packing problems, emphasizing the requirement for advanced geometric tools in optimizing solutions.</p><p>In the realm of automated packing solutions, Bouganis and Shanahan (2007) presented a vision-based intelligent technique that utilized computer vision and artificial intelligence to pack 2D irregular shapes efficiently, showcasing significant advancements in computational efficiency and solution quality. The optimization of shape rotation angles for better packing outcomes was further refined by Guo et al. (2018) based on the application of Principal Component Analysis (PCA), demonstrating improved packing density. Liu et al. (2023) developed a hybrid approach combining genetic algorithm and linear programming to optimize two-dimensional irregular packing, significantly enhancing material utilization and efficiency. Cai et al. (2023) tackled the 2-D irregular bin packing issue by developing heuristics that accommodate specific degrees of rotation for packing irregular shapes efficiently. Their novel approach optimized the packing strategy by accounting for the material's texture constraints, delivering effective solutions to maximize utilization across various industries.</p><p>The extension of the orbital sliding method to handle arcs in irregular packing was discussed by Burke et al. (2010), improving the accuracy of no-fit polygon calculations and thus the efficiency of packing solutions. Terashima-Mar\u00edn et al. (2010) introduced a GA-based model for generating hyper-heuristics, showcasing the potential of hyper-heuristics in outperforming individual heuristics for both regular and irregular shapes. The adaptation of the Djang and Finch heuristic for two-dimensional irregular bin packing problems by L\u00f3pez-Camacho et al. (2013) and the introduction of a beam search approach by Bennell and Song (2010) further contributed to the advancement of efficient packing solutions.</p><p>Transitioning towards self-learning models, Zhang et al. (2021) introduced a model utilizing deep reinforcement learning and self-attention mechanisms, marking a significant advancement in the application of machine learning to bin packing problems. The learning-assisted method for packing 2D irregular shapes, focusing on UV patches from 3D models by Yang et al. (2023). Fang et al. (2023) proposed a hybrid reinforcement learning algorithm tailored for 2D irregular packing problems. This algorithm represents a pioneering attempt to combine machine learning strategies with traditional packing methodologies, highlighting the expanding scope of machine learning applications in optimizing raw material utilization.</p><p>Leao et al. (2020) and Guo et al. (2022) reviewed various mathematical models and solutions for solving two-dimensional irregular packing problems, emphasizing the latest advancements and challenges in the field. Their comprehensive analysis highlighted the need for more efficient algorithms capable of handling the complexity and diversity of real-world applications.</p><p>While previous studies have laid the groundwork in tackling two-dimensional irregular packing problems with innovative algorithms and heuristics, they always grapple with challenges in computational efficiency, adaptability to diverse industrial requirements, and practical application constraints. Our research seeks to build upon these foundations, addressing these gaps by introducing a novel approach that leverages advanced image processing and an enhanced genetic algorithm.

We also discuss the effect of different groups of stock sheet sizes.\n\nText\n\n**ICCL17\\_paper\\_43**\n**\\- Accepted Manuscript**\n\n[Download](https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/415314/1/ICCL17_paper_43.pdf) (729kB)\n\n## More information\n\ne-pub ahead of print date: October 2017\n\nPublished date: October 2017\n\nKeywords:\nIrregular shapes, Multiple bin size bin packing, Jostle Algorithm\n\n## Identifiers\n\nLocal EPrints ID: 415314\n\nURI: http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/id/eprint/415314\n\nDOI: [doi:10.1007/978-3-319-68496](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-68496)\n\nPURE UUID: e654d0b7-af4b-43c1-86e1-635828997331\n\nORCID for Antonio Martinez Sykora: [orcid.org/0000-0002-2435-3113](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2435-3113)\n\n## Catalogue record\n\nDate deposited: 07 Nov 2017 17:30\n\nLast modified: 16 Mar 2024 05:53\n\n## Export record\n\nASCII CitationAtomBibTeXData Cite XMLDublin CoreDublin CoreEP3 XMLEndNoteHTML CitationHTML CitationHTML ListJSONMETSMODSMPEG-21 DIDLOpenURL ContextObjectOpenURL ContextObject in SpanRDF+N-TriplesRDF+N3RDF+XMLRIOXX2 XMLReferReference ManagerSimple Metadata\n\n## Altmetrics\n\n## Share this record\n\n[Share this on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/415314/) [Share this on Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Efficient%20local%20search%20heuristics%20for%20packing%20irregular%20shapes%20in%20two%2Ddimensional%20heterogeneous%20bins+https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/415314/) [Share this on Weibo](http://service.weibo.com/share/share.php?url=Efficient%20local%20search%20heuristics%20for%20packing%20irregular%20shapes%20in%20two%2Ddimensional%20heterogeneous%20bins+https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/415314/)\n\n## Contributors\n\nAuthor:Ranga, Prasad Abeysooriya\n\nAuthor:Julia Bennell\n\nAuthor: [Antonio Martinez Sykora](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/business-school/about/staff/am1u10.page)\n\nEditor:Tolga Bektas\n\nEditor:Stefano Coniglio\n\nEditor:Antonio Martinez-Sykora\n\nEditor:Stefan Boss\n\n## Download statistics\n\nDownloads from ePrints over the past year.

The improved algorithm can cope with complex cases and is given an implementation in detail. The proposed concept of a touching group can simplify the judging process when recognizing the potential translation vector for an orbital polygon. In addition, the generation of the no-fit polygon only involves three main steps based on the proposed concept. The proposed algorithm has a mechanism that searches other start positions to generate a complete no-fit polygon for handling complex cases. To improve the efficiency, many acceleration strategies have been proposed, such as point exclusion strategy and point inclusion test. The robust and efficient performance of the algorithm is tested by well-known benchmark instances and degenerate and complex cases, such as holes, interlocking concavities and jigsaw-type pieces. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can produce complete no-fit polygons for complex cases, and acceleration strategies can reduce the creation time of no-fit polygon on benchmark instances by more than sixteen percent on average.\nKeywords:\n[no-fit polygon](https://www.mdpi.com/search?q=no-fit+polygon);[irregular packing problem](https://www.mdpi.com/search?q=irregular+packing+problem);[sliding algorithm](https://www.mdpi.com/search?q=sliding+algorithm);[cutting](https://www.mdpi.com/search?q=cutting);[configuration space obstacle](https://www.mdpi.com/search?q=configuration+space+obstacle)\nMSC:\n90; 68; 51\n## 1. Introduction\nIn the field of cutting and packing problems, there is a kind of problem known as the two-dimensional (2D) irregular packing problem or the nesting problem. It is commonly encountered in many industries and applications, such as metal sheet cutting [1,2], leather [3], clothing [4], paper [5] and spatial arrangement [6]. Through excellent algorithms to optimize the packing, even a one percent increase in the material utilization rate will save lots of resource costs for enterprises and generate huge economic benefits for the whole society. Despite the many practical applications and benefits, the problem has received relatively little attention in the literature when compared to the regular packing problem [7,8,9]. One of the main reasons is that researchers have to deal with the geometry problem, which is the first obstacle they encounter. This means that satisfying the constraint of having all irregular pieces without overlapping is much harder than regular pieces.\nDirect trigonometry involving line intersection and point inclusion testing is the classic method to identify the positional relationship between two polygons. However, the optimization algorithms will become inefficient when it adopts this method, which results in the slightly poor performance of the algorithms. The alternative used in irregular packing problems is the no-fit polygon (NFP), which is also used in the field of engineering and robot motion planning and the aircraft parking stand allocation problem [10]. The no-fit polygon facilitates the research of irregular packing problems [11,12,13,14]. It is an increasingly popular option since it is more efficient than direct trigonometry, particularly when using an iterative search. Determining whether polygons overlap, touch, or are separated only needs to conduct a simple test to identify whether the reference point is inside the NFP. Essentially, the no-fit polygon describes the region in which two polygons intersect. The computational efficiency gained by utilizing this method is very attractive. Hence, it is important to develop an algorithm for creating NFP for the research of irregular packing problems. The algorithm can enrich the application in 2D geometrical computer software.\nHowever, there are few published works on algorithms for generating NFP. Note the fact that developing a robust geometry library is still needed, and this task is very time-consuming and difficult. Furthermore, it is difficult to develop a robust NFP generator because of the complexity of irregular piece shapes. Thus, we propose an improved sliding algorithm for the generation of NFP and give an implementation in detail of our algorithm. Such an algorithm can become good preparation for applying more strategies to solve the irregular packing problem. For instance, in the work published by Costa et al. [15], if the NFP algorithm is efficient, it can directly calculate the new merged piece instead of approximating by one already computed because of this time-consuming operation. In other words, the more efficient the algorithm is, the better.\nThe proposed algorithm only involves two simple geometric stages. The first is generating the external NFP between two polygons, which includes three main steps: finding the touching group, determining the translation vector from all touching groups and computing the translation distance. The second stage is searching on the unvisited edges to determine whether there is a feasible starting point that can be found. If the starting point is available, then return to the first stage to generate the NFP.\nThe contributions of this study are:\n* To address the problem of the efficient and robust creation of the no-fit polygon;\n* To propose an improved sliding algorithm and provide a detailed implementation;\n* To present the concept of touching group, resulting in the number of cases to consider being reduced by half when determining the feasible translation vector;\n* To develop many acceleration strategies to improve the algorithm\u2019s efficiency, such as the point exclusion strategy, the right side test, and the point inclusion test;\n* To assess the performance of the proposed alg...",
