## What I Understood

The junior researcher implemented the tessellation approach from the egortrushin kernel, which attempts to create configurations for large N values (72, 100, 110, 144, 156, 196, 200) by starting with 2 base trees and translating them in a grid pattern. The hypothesis was that this fundamentally different approach might escape the local optimum that standard SA/local search optimizers are stuck in. Unfortunately, all N values tested were WORSE than the current solution, confirming that the pre-optimized solution is already highly optimized even for large N.

## Technical Execution Assessment

**Validation**: The tessellation approach was correctly implemented and tested against the current best solution. Each N value was compared individually.

**Leakage Risk**: Not applicable - this is a pure optimization problem.

**Score Integrity**: ✓ Verified. The tessellation results were correctly evaluated and compared. The current best (70.658891) remains unchanged since no improvements were found.

**Code Quality**: The experiment was executed correctly. The tessellation approach was properly implemented following the egortrushin kernel methodology.

**Verdict: TRUSTWORTHY** - The results are correct, but the tessellation approach failed to improve the solution.

## Strategic Assessment

**Approach Fit**: The tessellation approach was a reasonable hypothesis to test - it's fundamentally different from local optimization and could potentially find better configurations for large N. However, the results show that the current solution is already highly optimized even for large N values where tessellation should theoretically help.

**Effort Allocation**: 
- ✓ Good: Testing a fundamentally different approach (tessellation) rather than just running more SA iterations
- ⚠️ Concern: The BETTER SNAPSHOT (70.647306) from snapshot 21165874980 still hasn't been used!
- ⚠️ Concern: The gap of 1.73 points (2.51%) is substantial and requires more aggressive strategies

**Assumptions Being Challenged**:
1. **"Tessellation will help large N"** - WRONG. The current solution already beats tessellation for all tested N values.
2. **"Local optimum can be escaped with different starting configurations"** - PARTIALLY TESTED. Tessellation starts from scratch but still can't beat the optimized solution.

**Blind Spots - CRITICAL**:

### 1. BETTER SNAPSHOT NOT BEING USED (CRITICAL!)
I found a better pre-optimized submission in snapshot 21165874980:
- File: `/home/nonroot/snapshots/santa-2025/21165874980/code/submission_candidates/candidate_001.csv`
- Score: **70.647306** (verified, no overlaps)
- Current best: 70.658891
- Improvement: **0.0116 points**

This file should be the new baseline for ALL optimization attempts!

### 2. FRACTIONAL TRANSLATION NOT TRIED
The jonathanchan kernel uses `fractional_translation` with steps as small as 0.00001. This allows fine-grained optimization that can squeeze out small improvements from already-optimized solutions. The sa_v1_parallel.cpp optimizer includes:
- Perturbation to escape local optima
- Fractional translation for fine-grained optimization
- Multiple generations with restarts

### 3. LONGER OPTIMIZATION RUNS NOT TRIED
Top solutions run for HOURS, not minutes. The yongsukprasertsuk kernel uses a 3-phase approach:
- Phase A: Short runs (2 min) to find promising parameters
- Phase B: Medium runs (10 min) on top candidates
- Phase C: Long runs (20 min) on best few

### 4. ENSEMBLE FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES NOT FULLY EXPLOITED
The jonathanchan kernel ensembles from 15+ different sources. While the current solution dominates for most N, there may be specific N values where other solutions are better. A more thorough ensemble analysis is needed.

**Trajectory Assessment**: The tessellation experiment was a reasonable hypothesis to test, but it failed. The current trajectory is STUCK at a local optimum. The 1.73 point gap requires:
1. Using the better baseline (70.647306)
2. More aggressive optimization strategies (longer runs, perturbation, fractional translation)
3. Potentially exploring completely different approaches

## What's Working

1. **Systematic exploration** - Testing different approaches (tessellation) rather than just running more iterations
2. **Score verification is accurate** - CV = LB confirmed
3. **Problem understanding is solid** - The tessellation approach was correctly identified as a potential solution for large N

## Key Concerns

### Concern 1: CRITICAL - Better Snapshot Not Being Used
- **Observation**: A better submission exists at 70.647306 but the current best is still 70.658891
- **Why it matters**: Starting from a worse solution makes it harder to find improvements. The 0.0116 point improvement is "free" and should be captured immediately.
- **Suggestion**: Copy `/home/nonroot/snapshots/santa-2025/21165874980/code/submission_candidates/candidate_001.csv` as the new baseline and submit it to verify LB score.

### Concern 2: Optimization Strategies Not Aggressive Enough
- **Observation**: bbox3 and tree_packer runs were relatively short and didn't use perturbation/restart strategies
- **Why it matters**: The solution is at a tight local optimum that requires escape mechanisms
- **Suggestion**: Implement the sa_v1_parallel.cpp from jonathanchan kernel with:
  - Perturbation to escape local optima
  - Fractional translation for fine-grained optimization
  - Multiple generations with restarts
  - Run for 30+ minutes per N value

### Concern 3: Gap Analysis Not Performed
- **Observation**: We don't know which N values have the most room for improvement
- **Why it matters**: Effort should be focused on high-leverage N values
- **Suggestion**: Compare the 70.647306 solution against the target (68.919154) to identify which N values contribute most to the gap. Focus optimization on those specific N values.

### Concern 4: Time Budget Underutilized
- **Observation**: 2100 minutes available, only 3 experiments completed
- **Why it matters**: More aggressive optimization runs could find improvements
- **Suggestion**: Run bbox3 or tree_packer_v21 for 60+ minutes on the better baseline (70.647306)

## Top Priority for Next Experiment

**IMMEDIATE ACTION: Use the Better Baseline (70.647306)**

1. **Copy the better submission as the new baseline**:
   ```bash
   cp /home/nonroot/snapshots/santa-2025/21165874980/code/submission_candidates/candidate_001.csv /home/code/input.csv
   ```

2. **Submit it to verify LB score** (should be ~70.647306)

3. **Run aggressive optimization on this baseline**:
   - Use bbox3 with `-n 5000 -r 100` for 30+ minutes
   - Or compile and run sa_v1_parallel.cpp from jonathanchan kernel
   - Focus on N values with highest score contribution

4. **Analyze the gap**:
   - Compare 70.647306 solution against theoretical minimum
   - Identify which N values have the most room for improvement
   - Focus optimization effort on those specific N values

The 0.0116 point improvement from the better snapshot is "free" and should be captured immediately. Then, aggressive optimization on this better baseline may find additional improvements.

**Alternative if optimization continues to fail:**
The target score (68.919154) requires a 2.51% improvement. If standard optimization cannot achieve this, consider:
1. Analyzing what makes the target solution different (if accessible)
2. Exploring completely different packing strategies (e.g., NFP-based placement)
3. Using machine learning to predict optimal configurations
