    "notes": "Tried two approaches: (1) Translation-based tiling using egortrushin kernel base pattern - all 9 tested N values (36, 48, 72, 100, 110, 144, 156, 196, 200) produced WORSE scores than baseline (e.g., N=72: tiled=0.390 vs baseline=0.349). (2) Constructive tree-by-tree placement - all 4 tested N values (5, 10, 15, 20) produced WORSE scores (e.g., N=10: constructed=0.567 vs baseline=0.377). Both approaches confirm the baseline is at an extremely strong optimum that cannot be beaten by constructive methods."
