    "notes": "Crystallization pattern generator tested on N=10,15,20,25,30,40,50. All generated patterns scored MUCH WORSE than baseline (e.g., N=10: 0.919 vs baseline 0.377). Analysis of baseline shows: (1) N=2 is 100% interlocking (180° apart), (2) N=100 is 50.5% interlocking, (3) Smaller N values have less interlocking. The baseline configurations are highly optimized with complex patterns that cannot be replicated by simple lattice approaches."
