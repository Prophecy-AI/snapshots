    "notes": "Extended bbox3 optimization ran for 265s with 26 threads. Found essentially NO improvement (0.0000006 points = 0.00%). The solution from exp_037 is at an EXTREMELY STRONG local optimum. All optimization methods have been exhausted: ensemble (0.306 improvement), SA, GA, bbox3, backward/forward iteration, fix_direction - ALL found 0 additional improvements beyond 70.306694. The gap to target (1.44 points) cannot be closed with available methods."
