    "notes": "Ran SA for 100,000 iterations per N value (20 million total iterations) across all 26 CPU cores for 4.5 hours. Found ZERO improvements. Also checked bucket-of-chump dataset (70.647, worse) and nctuan dataset (158 CSV files, all worse). This definitively confirms the baseline is at an extremely strong local optimum that cannot be improved by local search methods or external data sources."
