    "notes": "Implemented centrosymmetric placement with three patterns (ring, spiral, grid). All patterns place trees in symmetric pairs around origin. Tested on 12 even N values (4-50). ALL patterns produced configurations WORSE than baseline. The baseline configurations are highly optimized irregular arrangements that cannot be matched by simple symmetric patterns. This confirms the baseline is not based on simple geometric patterns."
