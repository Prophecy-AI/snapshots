    "notes": "Genetic Algorithm for N=2-20 found NO improvements (363s runtime). Exhaustive fine search around N=2 baseline also found NO improvement. The baseline N=2 configuration has angles exactly 180 degrees apart (203.63 and 23.63) which is the optimal interlocking configuration. The solution is at an extremely strong local optimum that cannot be improved by any local search method."
