    "notes": "Implemented subset extraction (balabaskar technique) - extracting smaller N configurations from larger N by selecting trees closest to corners. Tested all source N from 20-200, all 4 corners, target N from 2-29. Found 0 improvements. The current solution is already optimal for this technique - extracting subsets from larger configurations does not produce better small N configurations than the current best."
