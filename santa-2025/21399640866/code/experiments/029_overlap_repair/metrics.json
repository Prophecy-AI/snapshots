  "notes": "Overlap repair strategy attempted to fix 2,542 overlapping configurations by pushing trees apart. ALL 2,542 repair attempts FAILED. The reason: pushing trees apart to remove overlaps increases the bounding box, making the repaired score WORSE than the baseline. The overlapping configurations are NOT close to valid solutions - they achieve low scores BECAUSE they overlap."
