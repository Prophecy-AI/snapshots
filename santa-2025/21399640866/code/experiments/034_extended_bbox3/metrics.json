    "notes": "Extended bbox3 optimization ran for 260s with 26 threads. Found essentially NO improvement (0.0000006 points). Also checked 3 new kernel outputs (merge_optimise, santa_inside_box, bbox_basic) - all scored WORSE than current best. No per-N improvements found from any new source. Current score 70.309159 is BETTER than all available external data. The solution is at an extremely strong local optimum that cannot be improved by any optimization method."
