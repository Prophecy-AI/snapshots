    "notes": "Tried three approaches: (1) Fresh start SA with random configs - all resulted in overlaps. (2) Penalty-based SA - too slow due to Shapely overlap checks. (3) Fast local search without overlap checking - found 4.75 points 'improvement' but all were INVALID due to overlaps. Verified baseline has NO overlaps. This confirms the baseline is at a valid local optimum that cannot be improved by local search."
