    "notes": "Implemented dense block generation functions from artemevstafyev kernel. Tested on N=50-200 but all generated configurations scored worse than baseline. Also tested small N optimization (N=1-10) but baseline is already optimal. The baseline appears to be at a very strong local optimum."
