    "notes": "Backward iteration v2 applied to SAFE baseline (exp_033_fix_overlaps which passed Kaggle). Found 2 improvements: N=122 (0.346682 -> 0.345835, +0.000847) and N=121 (0.350311 -> 0.348693, +0.001618). Total improvement: 0.002465. All other N values are IDENTICAL to the safe baseline. This should pass Kaggle validation since N=156 (which failed in exp_037) is unchanged from the safe baseline."
