No per-N improvements found. After 42 experiments, all approaches have been exhausted: ensemble (0.31 improvement), backward iteration v2 (0.002 improvement), SA, GA, bbox3, forward iteration, fix_direction, lattice construction, grid search, subset extraction, dense block - ALL found 0 additional improvements beyond 70.306694. The gap to target (1.44 points = 2.09%) remains."
