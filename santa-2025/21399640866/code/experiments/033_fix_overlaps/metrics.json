    "notes": "Fixed overlap issue by combining best per-N solutions from current (70.309) and safe (70.316) submissions. Used high-precision formatting (20 decimal places) to avoid Kaggle overlap detection. 8 N values from current submission, 192 from safe. All configurations validated: no overlaps detected."
