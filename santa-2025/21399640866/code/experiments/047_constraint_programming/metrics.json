    "notes": "Implemented CP-SAT solver with discretized positions and angles. Used minimum distance constraints as approximation for non-overlap. Exhaustive search for N=2 confirmed baseline is already optimal. CP-SAT couldn't find valid solutions due to simplified overlap constraints. The baseline configurations for small N are already at or near optimal."
