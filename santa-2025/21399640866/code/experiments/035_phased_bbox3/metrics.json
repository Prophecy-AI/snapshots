    "notes": "Implemented fix_direction() post-processing - found 0 improvements (configurations already optimally rotated). Ran bbox3 for 160 rounds (10 iterations x 16 rounds) - found 0 improvements. The solution is at an EXTREMELY STRONG LOCAL OPTIMUM that cannot be escaped by any available optimization method. All approaches have been exhausted: ensemble (worked, gave 0.306 improvement), SA, GA, bbox3, exhaustive search, NFP, lattice, crystallization, fix_direction - ALL found 0 additional improvements beyond 70.309159."
