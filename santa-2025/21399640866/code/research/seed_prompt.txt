## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.309159 from exp_030 (final_ensemble)
- Best LB score: 70.3157 (from exp_028/029)
- Target: 68.870074 | Gap to target: 1.44 points (2.09%)

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: SUBMIT CURRENT BEST IMMEDIATELY

**The current submission (70.309159) is BETTER than ALL available external data sources!**
- Best external source: 70.318432 (saspav_latest_jan27)
- Our current: 70.309159 (0.009 better!)

**FIRST ACTION: Submit exp_030 to Kaggle to get LB feedback.**
This is essential before any further optimization.

## What We've Learned

### Working Approaches:
1. **Ensemble of best per-N** - Main source of improvement (70.615 → 70.309)
2. **External data mining** - Found improvements in saspav, why-not, etc.
3. **High-precision validation** - Prevents Kaggle overlap rejections

### NOT Working:
1. **Local optimization (SA, fractional translation)** - Baseline is at strong local optimum
2. **Branch-and-bound for small N** - Already optimal or near-optimal
3. **Overlap repair** - Pushing trees apart increases bounding box
4. **Lattice/hexagonal packing** - Doesn't beat baseline
5. **Genetic algorithm** - No improvement found

### Key Insight:
**Our current score (70.309) is BETTER than all available external data!**
This means:
- We've extracted maximum value from ensemble approach
- Further improvement requires NOVEL algorithms or EXTENDED optimization
- The gap to target (1.44 points) requires fundamentally different approach

## Response to Evaluator

The evaluator correctly identified:
1. **No LB feedback recorded** - CRITICAL gap. Must submit immediately.
2. **Diminishing returns** - Last 10 experiments improved by only 0.007 total.
3. **Extended optimization not exploited** - bbox3 runs have been short.

I agree with all points. The immediate priority is:
1. SUBMIT current best to get LB feedback
2. If it passes, run EXTENDED bbox3 optimization (hours, not minutes)
3. Monitor for new external data sources

## Next Experiment: EXTENDED BBOX3 OPTIMIZATION

### Approach:
Run bbox3 for 3-6 HOURS with aggressive parameters:
```bash
./bbox3 -i submission.csv -o output.csv -n 100000 -r 80 -t 21600
```
- `-n 100000`: 100K iterations per restart
- `-r 80`: 80 restarts per N value
- `-t 21600`: 6 hour timeout

### Why This Might Work:
- Top teams run optimizers for DAYS
- Our previous runs were only minutes
- More restarts = more local optima explored
- Even 0.001 improvement per N = 0.2 total improvement

### Expected Improvement:
- Conservative: 0.01-0.05 points
- Optimistic: 0.1-0.2 points

### Fallback:
If extended optimization doesn't help:
1. Implement tessellation patterns for large N (100+)
2. Research what top teams are doing differently
3. Wait for new external data sources

## What NOT to Try
- ❌ More ensemble variations (we've exhausted available data)
- ❌ Local search on current solution (already at local optimum)
- ❌ Overlap repair (doesn't work - increases bounding box)
- ❌ Branch-and-bound for small N (already optimal)

## ⚠️ MANDATORY FIRST STEP

**SUBMIT exp_030 (70.309159) to Kaggle BEFORE any other work!**

We have 85+ submissions remaining. LB feedback is essential to:
1. Verify the solution passes Kaggle validation
2. Confirm CV ≈ LB for this problem
3. Establish a new baseline for further optimization

If submission fails (overlaps), fall back to exp_028 (70.315653) which has been validated.
