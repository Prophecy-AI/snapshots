## CRITICAL LEADERBOARD CONTEXT (Jan 27, 2026)
| Rank | Team | Score | Submissions |
|------|------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Jingle bins | 68.8946 | 953 |
| 2 | shr | 68.9019 | 82 |
| 3 | KiRaRe | 68.9216 | 183 |

| ~50 | **OUR SCORE** | **70.3067** | 22 |

**THE TARGET (68.8669) IS BETTER THAN THE CURRENT #1 (68.8946)!**

This means we need to discover techniques that even the top teams haven't found yet.
The top team has 953 submissions - they've been accumulating per-N improvements for months.

## Submission Log
| Exp | Approach | CV | LB | Notes |
|-----|----------|----|----|-------|
| 001 | valid_baseline | 70.615 | 70.615 | Starting point |
| 010 | safe_ensemble | 70.365 | 70.365 | Ensemble from snapshots |
| 037 | backward_iteration_v2 | 70.307 | 70.307 | Found N=121, N=122 improvements |
| 038-043 | various | 70.307 | 70.307 | No further improvements |

## Response to Evaluator

The evaluator correctly identified that:
1. All major techniques from public kernels have been exhaustively tested
2. The baseline is at an EXTREMELY strong local optimum
3. Dense block generation produces WORSE scores than baseline
4. Extended runtime optimization and asymmetric approaches haven't been fully explored

**Key insight from research:**
- Top teams use SA for N<58, Crystalline/Lattice for N>58
- LLMs are used to write optimized C++/Rust code with AVX2 vectorization
- The winning approach involves accumulating per-N improvements over 900+ submissions

**The gap to target (1.44 points) is essentially the gap to beat the world's best.**
This requires either:
1. A fundamentally novel algorithm not yet discovered by any team
2. Massive computational resources to run extended optimization
3. A breakthrough insight about the problem structure

## What Has Been Exhaustively Tested (43 experiments)
✅ Simulated annealing - 0 improvements
✅ Exhaustive search for N=2 - baseline is optimal
✅ NFP-based placement - 0 improvements
✅ Multi-start random - FAILED completely
✅ Ensemble from snapshots - Major improvement (70.615 → 70.365)
✅ Backward iteration - Found 2 improvements (N=121, N=122)
✅ Forward iteration - 0 improvements
✅ External datasets - All score WORSE
✅ Subset extraction (balabaskar) - 0 improvements
✅ Dense block generation - All configs WORSE
✅ Lattice/crystallization patterns - 0 improvements
✅ Genetic algorithm - 0 improvements
✅ Constraint programming - 0 improvements
✅ Extended bbox3 optimization - 0 improvements

## What NOT to Try (Proven Dead Ends)
- Running bbox3/SA with more iterations → Same score
- Dense block generation → Produces WORSE scores
- External datasets → All score WORSE than current best
- Subset extraction → 0 improvements
- Lattice patterns → 0 improvements

## Next Experiment: EXTENDED RUNTIME OPTIMIZATION (3+ HOURS)

The evaluator recommended extended runtime bbox3 optimization. This is the most promising unexplored direction.

**Implementation:**
1. Run bbox3 with extended parameters: n=[1000,1200,1500,1800,2000], r=[30,60,90,120]
2. Phase A: 2-min runs on all parameter combinations
3. Phase B: 10-min runs on top 3 configurations
4. Phase C: 20-min runs on best 2 configurations
5. Apply fix_direction() post-processing
6. Total runtime: 3+ hours

**Alternative approaches if extended runtime fails:**

### 1. ASYMMETRIC SMALL N OPTIMIZATION
N=3-10 have the worst packing efficiency (1.5-2.0x theoretical minimum).
Try scipy.optimize with many random restarts for asymmetric arrangements.

### 2. HYBRID APPROACH
- Use SA for N<58 (chaotic packings)
- Use crystalline/lattice for N>58 (regular patterns)
- This is what top teams reportedly use

### 3. ACCUMULATION STRATEGY
With 78 submissions remaining, we should:
- Submit EVERY experiment to get LB feedback
- Track per-N improvements across all submissions
- Build ensemble of best per-N from all sources

## ⛔ FORBIDDEN (WILL BE REJECTED)
- Declaring the target is unreachable
- Giving up because "all approaches have been tried"
- Running the same optimizer with slightly different parameters

## ✅ REQUIRED
1. Try extended runtime optimization (3+ hours)
2. If that fails, implement asymmetric optimization for small N
3. Submit every valid experiment to accumulate per-N improvements
4. Track which N values each approach does well on

## Key Insight
The target (68.87) is BETTER than the current world #1 (68.89).
This is an extremely ambitious target that may require:
- Novel algorithmic insights
- Massive computational resources
- Or accepting that we're already competitive (~50th place globally)

**SUBMIT THE CURRENT BEST (70.3067) to confirm our standing, then continue experimenting.**
