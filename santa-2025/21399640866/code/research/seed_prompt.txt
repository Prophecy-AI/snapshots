## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.306694 from exp_037 (backward_iteration_v2)
- Best LB score: 70.3092 (from exp_033)
- Target: 68.870074 | Gap to target: 1.44 points (2.09%)

## CRITICAL: SUBMIT exp_037 IMMEDIATELY!
The backward iteration v2 found REAL improvements (0.002465 points).
This is the FIRST improvement in 7+ experiments. SUBMIT IT NOW!

## Response to Evaluator
The evaluator was CORRECT:
1. ✅ Backward iteration v2 with current best (70.309159) found improvements
2. ✅ N=122 and N=121 were improved by removing trees from N+1
3. ✅ The evaluator's suggestion to "continue backward iteration" is valid

I AGREE with the evaluator's recommendations:
1. Submit to Kaggle immediately (exp_037)
2. Continue backward iteration from the new best
3. Try forward iteration (adding trees)
4. Extended bbox3 if iteration approaches fail

## What We've Learned
1. Ensemble approaches improved from 70.615 to 70.309 (0.306 points)
2. Local search (SA, exhaustive) found ZERO improvements on baseline
3. Backward iteration v2 found 0.002465 improvement - FIRST real progress!
4. The solution is NOT at global optimum - there's room for improvement

## Score Breakdown Analysis
- N=1-10: 4.3247 (avg 0.432) - WORST performers
- N=11-50: 14.6271 (avg 0.366)
- N=51-100: 17.4750 (avg 0.350)
- N=101-150: 17.0604 (avg 0.341)
- N=151-200: 16.8194 (avg 0.336) - BEST performers

## Next Experiment: exp_038 - CONTINUE BACKWARD ITERATION

### STEP 1: Submit exp_037 to Kaggle
```python
# The submission is ready at /home/submission/submission.csv
# Score: 70.306694 (verified, no overlaps)
# SUBMIT IT!
```

### STEP 2: Run backward iteration AGAIN from new best
The N=121 and N=122 configurations are now DIFFERENT.
Running backward iteration again might find more improvements.

```python
# Backward iteration v3 - from 70.306694
# Key insight: N=121 came from N=122, which came from N=123
# So N=120 might improve from the new N=121!

for n in range(199, 1, -1):
    # Get configuration from N+1 (which may have changed)
    xs_parent, ys_parent, angles_parent = configs[n+1]
    
    # Try removing each tree
    for i in range(n+1):
        xs_new = np.delete(xs_parent, i)
        ys_new = np.delete(ys_parent, i)
        angles_new = np.delete(angles_parent, i)
        
        if not check_overlaps(xs_new, ys_new, angles_new):
            score = compute_score(xs_new, ys_new, angles_new)
            if score < current_best[n]:
                # IMPROVEMENT FOUND!
                configs[n] = (xs_new, ys_new, angles_new)
```

### STEP 3: If no more backward improvements, try FORWARD iteration
```python
# Forward iteration - add trees from N-1 to create N
for n in range(2, 201):
    xs_parent, ys_parent, angles_parent = configs[n-1]
    
    # Try adding a tree at various positions
    for angle in range(0, 360, 10):
        for x_offset in np.linspace(-1, 1, 20):
            for y_offset in np.linspace(-1, 1, 20):
                # Add new tree
                xs_new = np.append(xs_parent, x_offset)
                ys_new = np.append(ys_parent, y_offset)
                angles_new = np.append(angles_parent, angle)
                
                if not check_overlaps(xs_new, ys_new, angles_new):
                    score = compute_score(xs_new, ys_new, angles_new)
                    if score < current_best[n]:
                        # IMPROVEMENT FOUND!
                        configs[n] = (xs_new, ys_new, angles_new)
```

## ⛔ FORBIDDEN
- bbox3, sa_fast, eazy_optimizer - FORBIDDEN (already at local optimum)
- subprocess.run() or os.system() - FORBIDDEN
- Running ANY binary or executable - FORBIDDEN
- "Optimizing" existing CSV files with binaries - FORBIDDEN

## ✅ REQUIRED
1. SUBMIT exp_037 to Kaggle FIRST
2. Run backward iteration again from 70.306694
3. If no improvements, try forward iteration
4. Track per-N improvements carefully
5. Use high-precision coordinates (20 decimal places)

## Expected Outcome
- Backward iteration v3 might find 1-3 more improvements
- Each improvement is ~0.001 points
- Need ~1440 improvements to reach target
- This approach alone won't reach target, but builds toward ensemble

## Long-term Strategy
The gap of 1.44 points is too large for micro-optimizations.
After exhausting backward/forward iteration:
1. Research what top teams (68.89) actually did
2. Consider fundamentally different representations
3. Look for N values where we're far from optimal
4. Extended bbox3 (3+ hours) as last resort
