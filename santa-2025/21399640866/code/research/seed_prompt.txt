## Current Status
- **Best CV score**: 70.316492 (exp_021)
- **Best LB score**: 70.316492 (exp_022, verified)
- **Target**: 68.874108 (lower is better)
- **Gap to target**: 1.44 points (2.09%)
- **Experiments**: 28 completed
- **Submissions**: 13/100 used (87 remaining)

## ⚠️ CRITICAL SITUATION: STUCK AT LOCAL OPTIMUM

**The last 8 experiments (exp_020 through exp_027) found ZERO improvement.**

All algorithmic approaches have converged to the same score (70.316492):
- Simulated Annealing, Branch-and-bound, Exhaustive search, NFP, Multi-start, Genetic algorithm, Lattice packing, Interlock patterns, Jostle algorithm, BLF heuristic

**C++ optimizer with 26 threads confirmed: 0% improvement possible.**

## Response to Evaluator

The evaluator correctly identified that extended C++ optimization and external data mining are the only remaining avenues. I agree. The ensemble approach was the ONLY method that improved scores (70.615 → 70.316 = 0.30 points).

## ✅ NEXT EXPERIMENT: DEEP EXTERNAL DATA MINING

Since ensemble was the ONLY approach that improved scores, we need to find MORE external data.

### Specific Actions:

1. **Systematically scan ALL 5724 CSV files in snapshots**:
   - For each N from 1 to 200
   - Find the best valid (no overlaps) score across ALL sources
   - Build a comprehensive per-N ensemble

2. **Focus on high-impact N values**:
   - N=2: Current 0.4508 - can we find better?
   - N=3: Current 0.4347 - can we find better?
   - N=4-10: Each contributes ~0.38-0.42

3. **Validate ALL improvements with high-precision overlap checking**:
   ```python
   from decimal import Decimal, getcontext
   getcontext().prec = 30
   SCALE = 10**18
   # Use integer arithmetic for overlap detection
   ```

4. **Create submission only if improvements found**

### Code Structure:
```
experiments/028_deep_data_mining/
├── scan_all_csvs.py      # Scan all 5724 CSVs
├── per_n_ensemble.py     # Build best per-N ensemble
├── validate_overlaps.py  # High-precision validation
└── metrics.json
```

### Expected Outcome:
- If we find even 0.01 improvement per N for 100 N values = 1.0 point improvement
- This could close the gap significantly

## ⚠️ FORBIDDEN (WILL BE REJECTED)
- Running bbox3/sa_fast/eazy_optimizer binaries (already proven ineffective)
- Any approach that gave 0% improvement in previous experiments
- Submitting without high-precision overlap validation

## SUBMIT AFTER THIS EXPERIMENT
- We have 87 submissions remaining
- LB feedback is valuable
- Even if CV doesn't improve, submit to verify
