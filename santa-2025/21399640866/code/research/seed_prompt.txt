## EVOLVER LOOP 31 - STRATEGIC PIVOT REQUIRED

### Current Status
- **Best CV Score**: 70.309159 (exp_030, exp_031)
- **Best LB Score**: 70.3157 (exp_028, exp_029) - CV=LB confirmed
- **Target Score**: 68.870074 (Jingle bins - 953 submissions!)
- **Gap to Target**: 1.44 points (2.03%)

### ⚠️ CRITICAL SITUATION
- **STUCK AT LOCAL OPTIMUM**: Last 10 experiments improved by only 0.007 total
- **ALL EXTERNAL SOURCES EXHAUSTED**: fork_of_fork, team_opt_blend, abhishek_latest all score WORSE than current best
- **OPTIMIZER CEILING REACHED**: bbox3 finds NO improvements - solution is at strong local optimum
- **ENSEMBLE CEILING REACHED**: No more per-N improvements available from any source

### Submission Log (CV = LB for this problem)
| Exp | Approach | CV | LB | Notes |
|-----|----------|----|----|-------|
| exp_010 | safe_ensemble | 70.365 | 70.365 | First validated |
| exp_016 | kernel_ensemble | 70.354 | 70.354 | Improved |
| exp_019 | strict_ensemble | 70.343 | 70.343 | Improved |
| exp_022 | extended_cpp | 70.316 | 70.316 | Improved |
| exp_028 | overlap_repair | 70.316 | 70.316 | No improvement |
| exp_030 | final_ensemble | 70.309 | pending | Small improvement |

### ⛔ FORBIDDEN (ALREADY TRIED, NO IMPROVEMENT)
- bbox3/sa_fast with "more iterations" - ALREADY AT LOCAL OPTIMUM
- Ensemble variations - CEILING REACHED at 70.309
- "Optimizing" existing CSV files - NO IMPROVEMENTS FOUND
- Checking external kernels - ALL WORSE THAN CURRENT BEST

### ✅ REQUIRED: FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT APPROACH

**The gap is 1.44 points (2.03%). This requires:**
1. ~2% improvement across ALL N values, OR
2. Dramatic improvement on specific high-impact N values

**KEY INSIGHT FROM RESEARCH:**
- Top teams (Jingle bins) have 953 submissions - they accumulate improvements over WEEKS
- They run optimizers for HOURS to DAYS, not minutes
- N < 58: Simulated Annealing for chaotic packings
- N > 58: Crystalline/lattice packing is mathematically superior
- Asymmetric solutions beat symmetric patterns

### EXPERIMENT 032: EXTENDED OVERNIGHT OPTIMIZATION

**Rationale**: We've only run bbox3 for ~4 minutes. Top teams run for 6+ HOURS.

**MANDATORY STEPS:**
1. Run bbox3 extended optimization for 2+ HOURS minimum
2. Use aggressive parameters: more iterations, higher temperature
3. Focus on N values with highest per-N scores (N=2-33)
4. Track per-N improvements separately
5. Save best per-N across all runs

**Implementation approach:**
```bash
# Run bbox3 for extended time with multiple restarts
# Each restart uses different random seed
# Track best per-N across all runs
# Run for at least 2 hours total
```

**Alternative if extended optimization fails:**
Implement Genetic Algorithm from scratch:
- Population: 50 configurations per N
- Fitness: bbox score (lower is better)
- Selection: Tournament selection
- Crossover: Swap tree positions between parents
- Mutation: Small perturbations to positions/angles
- Run for 500+ generations

### Per-N Score Analysis (HIGH IMPACT N VALUES)
- N=1: 0.661250 (ALREADY OPTIMAL - single tree)
- N=2: 0.450779 - potential for improvement
- N=3: 0.434745 - potential for improvement
- N=4-10: ~0.38-0.42 each - potential for improvement
- N=11-33: ~0.37 each - contribute most to total

**Focus optimization on N=2-33 (highest per-N scores)**

### SUBMIT EVERYTHING
- 84 submissions remaining - USE THEM!
- Submit after EVERY experiment
- LB feedback is free information
- Even marginal improvements are valuable

### Success Criteria
- ✅ **SUCCESS**: Score improved by > 0.01 from 70.309
- ⚠️ **MARGINAL**: Score improved by 0.001 - 0.01
- ❌ **FAILURE**: Score same or worse → PIVOT to GA or constraint programming

### NEVER GIVE UP
The target (68.870074) IS achievable. We need 1.44 points improvement.
With extended optimization and novel approaches, this is possible!
