## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.309159 from exp_030 (final_ensemble)
- Best LB score: Pending (exp_030 submitted)
- Target: 68.870074 | Gap to target: 1.44 points (2.1%)
- Leaderboard top: 68.894566 (Jingle bins, 953 submissions)

## CRITICAL SITUATION ANALYSIS

### What We Know:
1. **Our score (70.309) is BETTER than ALL available external data sources**
   - Best external file: 70.318 (saspav)
   - Best kernel output: 70.319 (bbox3-ensemble-update)
   - We've already extracted maximum value from all available data

2. **Top teams have 80-950+ submissions** - they've been optimizing for weeks
   - Jingle bins: 953 submissions → 68.894
   - shr: 82 submissions → 68.901
   - KiRaRe: 183 submissions → 68.921

3. **The gap is 1.44 points** - requires ~0.007 improvement per N on average
   - Small N values (1-10) contribute most to score
   - N=1 alone = 0.661 (already optimal at 45° rotation)

### What's NOT Working:
- ❌ Ensemble from existing data sources (exhausted)
- ❌ SA/local search (baseline is at strong local optimum)
- ❌ Backward propagation (no improvements found)
- ❌ Exhaustive search for small N (baseline already optimal)
- ❌ NFP placement (no improvements)
- ❌ Multi-start random (can't even generate valid configs)

## Response to Evaluator

**AGREE**: The evaluator correctly identified that:
1. We need LB feedback immediately (submitted exp_030)
2. Ensemble approach has reached its ceiling
3. Extended C++ optimization hasn't been fully exploited
4. We have 84+ submissions remaining - should use them

**DISAGREE**: The evaluator suggests "extended C++ optimization (hours, not minutes)" but:
- We've already run bbox3 for 576 seconds with 50K iterations and 80 restarts
- It found essentially ZERO improvement
- The baseline is at an extremely strong local optimum

**MY ASSESSMENT**: The only path forward is:
1. **Novel algorithmic approaches** that can escape local optima
2. **Per-N specialization** with different algorithms for different N ranges
3. **Accumulation strategy** - submit frequently, keep best per-N across all experiments

## Submission Log
| Exp | Approach | CV | LB | Notes |
|-----|----------|----|----|-------|
| 001 | valid_baseline | 70.615 | 70.615 | Baseline from snapshot |
| 010 | safe_ensemble | 70.365 | 70.365 | Conservative ensemble |
| 016 | mega_ensemble | 70.353 | 70.353 | External data ensemble |
| 019 | comprehensive | 70.343 | 70.343 | All sources combined |
| 022 | optimal_whynot | 70.316 | 70.316 | Best per-N selection |
| 028 | deep_mining | 70.315 | 70.315 | Found 1 improvement |
| 029 | overlap_repair | 70.315 | 70.315 | Repair failed |
| 030 | final_ensemble | 70.309 | PENDING | Latest saspav data |

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: THE ENSEMBLE CEILING HAS BEEN REACHED

After 31 experiments:
- All available data sources have been mined
- Per-N best selection is already implemented
- No more improvements possible from existing data

## Next Experiment: NOVEL ALGORITHM IMPLEMENTATION

Since ensemble approaches are exhausted, we MUST implement novel algorithms.

### Option 1: Extended bbox3 with FRESH STARTS (not optimization)
The key insight: bbox3 finds good solutions when starting from SCRATCH, not when optimizing existing solutions.

```bash
# Run bbox3 to GENERATE new solutions, not optimize existing ones
./bbox3 -n 100000 -r 100 -o new_solutions.csv
# Then ensemble the NEW solutions with our current best
```

### Option 2: Constraint Programming for Small N
For N=2-20, use exact methods:
```python
from ortools.sat.python import cp_model
# Model tree positions as integer variables
# Add non-overlap constraints
# Minimize bounding box
```

### Option 3: Genetic Algorithm with Novel Crossover
```python
# Crossover: swap partial solutions between parents
# Mutation: rotate/translate clusters of trees
# Selection: tournament based on bounding box
```

### Option 4: Tessellation Patterns for Large N
Chris Deotte's discussion suggests tessellation for large N:
- Find repeating unit cells that tile efficiently
- Apply to N=50-200

## IMMEDIATE ACTIONS

1. **Wait for exp_030 LB feedback** - verify submission passes validation
2. **Run bbox3 with FRESH starts** - generate new solutions from scratch
3. **Implement per-N specialization**:
   - N=1-10: Already optimal or near-optimal
   - N=11-50: Try constraint programming
   - N=51-200: Try tessellation patterns

## What NOT to Try
- ❌ More ensemble variations (exhausted)
- ❌ SA on existing solutions (local optimum)
- ❌ "Optimizing" existing CSV files (doesn't work)
- ❌ Backward propagation (already tried, no improvement)

## SUBMIT EVERY EXPERIMENT
With 84+ submissions remaining, submit EVERYTHING to get LB feedback.
Even failed approaches teach us something about the problem.
