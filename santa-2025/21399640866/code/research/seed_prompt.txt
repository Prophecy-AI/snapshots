## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.306694 (exp_043, verified on LB)
- Best LB score: 70.306694 (matches CV perfectly)
- Target: 68.866853 | Gap to target: 1.44 points (2.09%)
- Submissions used: 23/100 (77 remaining)

## ⛔⛔⛔ CRITICAL: LOCAL SEARCH IS EXHAUSTED ⛔⛔⛔

**PROOF:** Experiment 046 ran long parallel SA for:
- 4.5 HOURS (270 minutes)
- 20 MILLION total iterations (100,000 per N value)
- 26 CPU cores in parallel
- **RESULT: ZERO IMPROVEMENTS**

This DEFINITIVELY proves the baseline is at an extremely strong local optimum.
**NO MORE LOCAL SEARCH EXPERIMENTS.** They will not work.

## What Has Been Tried (ALL FAILED)
1. ❌ Simulated Annealing (multiple variants, 20M iterations) - ZERO improvements
2. ❌ Backward propagation (N→N-1 tree removal) - ZERO improvements
3. ❌ Exhaustive search for N=2 - baseline is already optimal
4. ❌ NFP-based placement - worse than baseline
5. ❌ Multi-start random initialization - cannot even generate valid configs
6. ❌ Constructive placement (tree-by-tree) - 40-50% WORSE than baseline
7. ❌ Translation-based tiling - WORSE than baseline
8. ❌ Dense block generation - WORSE than baseline
9. ❌ Subset extraction - ZERO improvements

## Response to Evaluator

The evaluator correctly identified that:
1. 9 consecutive experiments had ZERO improvement
2. The optimization paradigm is exhausted
3. We need to find better external data or fundamentally different approaches

I AGREE with this assessment. The long parallel SA experiment (4.5 hours, 20M iterations) provides DEFINITIVE proof that local search cannot improve the baseline.

## ⚠️ THE ONLY PATH FORWARD ⚠️

The gap to target (1.44 points) CANNOT be closed by:
- More SA iterations
- Different SA parameters
- Different local search methods
- Constructive heuristics

**The gap CAN ONLY be closed by:**
1. **Finding better external data sources** - The top teams have solutions we don't have
2. **Implementing bbox3 from scratch** - The C++ optimizer has sophisticated techniques we haven't replicated
3. **Running bbox3 for MUCH longer** - Top teams run for days, not minutes

## Next Experiment: IMPLEMENT BBOX3 CORE ALGORITHM

The "why-not" kernel shows bbox3 uses:
- Complex number vector coordination
- Fluid dynamics for tree movement
- Hinge pivot optimization
- Density gradient flow
- Global boundary tension

**TASK:** Implement the CORE bbox3 algorithm in Python:

```python
# Key techniques from bbox3.cpp:
# 1. Complex number representation for positions
# 2. Separation vector calculation (MTV approximation)
# 3. Aggressive overlap repair cycle
# 4. Global squeeze function
# 5. Corner tree optimization

# DO NOT run the binary - IMPLEMENT the algorithm
```

## ⛔ FORBIDDEN (WILL BE REJECTED)
- Running bbox3 binary with "more iterations" - ALREADY TRIED, DOESN'T WORK
- Running sa_fast binary - ALREADY TRIED, DOESN'T WORK
- Any local search on current baseline - PROVEN TO NOT WORK
- "Optimizing" existing CSV files - DOESN'T WORK

## ✅ REQUIRED: IMPLEMENT NOVEL ALGORITHM

Choose ONE of these approaches:

### Option A: Implement bbox3 Core in Python
Extract the key algorithms from bbox3.cpp and implement in Python:
1. Complex number vector coordination
2. Separation vector (MTV) calculation
3. Aggressive overlap repair
4. Global squeeze optimization
5. Corner tree optimization

### Option B: Genetic Algorithm with Custom Operators
Implement a GA that:
1. Uses ENTIRE configurations as chromosomes
2. Crossover: swap N values between parents (per-N selection)
3. Mutation: small perturbations with overlap repair
4. Selection: tournament selection based on total score

### Option C: Search for Better External Data
1. Download ALL Kaggle datasets related to Santa 2025
2. Look for the "team-optimization-blend" dataset
3. Create comprehensive ensemble from ALL available sources
4. The top teams have solutions we don't have access to

## Per-N Analysis (WHERE TO FOCUS)

From previous analysis:
- N=1 contributes 0.661 (highest single contribution) - ALREADY OPTIMAL
- N=2-10 contribute ~0.4 each - ALREADY NEAR OPTIMAL
- N=11-50: Potential for improvement if we find better solutions
- N=51-200: Largest potential for improvement

**Focus on finding better solutions for N=50-200 where the baseline may not be optimal.**

## Submission Strategy

- Current best (70.306694) is already submitted and verified
- Submit ANY experiment that shows improvement
- Even 0.001 improvement is valuable for accumulation
- We have 77 submissions remaining - USE THEM

## Success Criteria

- **IMMEDIATE SUCCESS**: Find ANY N value where we can beat the baseline
- **PARTIAL SUCCESS**: Implement a novel algorithm that produces valid solutions
- **FULL SUCCESS**: Achieve score < 70.0 (would be significant progress)

## What NOT to Try

1. ❌ More SA iterations - PROVEN TO NOT WORK (20M iterations = 0 improvements)
2. ❌ Different SA parameters - PROVEN TO NOT WORK
3. ❌ Backward/forward propagation - PROVEN TO NOT WORK
4. ❌ Constructive placement - PROVEN TO BE WORSE
5. ❌ Translation tiling - PROVEN TO BE WORSE
6. ❌ Random restarts - CANNOT GENERATE VALID CONFIGS

## THE TARGET IS ACHIEVABLE

The top team (Jingle bins) achieved 68.89 with 953 submissions.
They have access to better solutions than we do.
The path forward is finding those solutions or implementing the algorithms that generate them.

DO NOT GIVE UP. The solution exists. Find it.
