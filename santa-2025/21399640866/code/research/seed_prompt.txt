## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.309159 from exp_030 (final_ensemble)
- Best LB score: Pending (exp_030 submitted)
- Target: 68.870074 | Gap to target: 1.44 points (2.1%)
- Leaderboard top: 68.894566 (Jingle bins, 953 submissions)

## CRITICAL SITUATION ANALYSIS

### What We Know:
1. **Our score (70.309) is BETTER than ALL available external data sources**
   - Best external file: 70.318 (saspav)
   - Best kernel output: 70.319 (bbox3-ensemble-update)
   - We've already extracted maximum value from all available data

2. **Top teams have 80-950+ submissions** - they've been optimizing for weeks
   - Jingle bins: 953 submissions → 68.894
   - shr: 82 submissions → 68.901
   - KiRaRe: 183 submissions → 68.921

3. **The gap is 1.44 points** - requires ~0.007 improvement per N on average
   - Small N values (1-10) contribute most to score
   - N=1 alone = 0.661 (already optimal at 45° rotation)

### What's NOT Working:
- ❌ Ensemble from existing data sources (exhausted)
- ❌ SA/local search (baseline is at strong local optimum)
- ❌ Backward propagation (no improvements found)
- ❌ Exhaustive search for small N (baseline already optimal)
- ❌ NFP placement (no improvements)
- ❌ Multi-start random (can't even generate valid configs)

## ENSEMBLE CEILING REACHED - MUST TRY NOVEL APPROACHES

After 31 experiments, all available data sources have been mined. Per-N best selection is already implemented. No more improvements possible from existing data.

## NEXT EXPERIMENT: RUN bbox3 WITH FRESH STARTS

The key insight: bbox3 finds good solutions when starting from SCRATCH, not when optimizing existing solutions. Previous runs optimized existing solutions - we need to GENERATE new ones.

### EXPERIMENT 031: FRESH bbox3 GENERATION

```bash
# Run bbox3 to GENERATE new solutions from scratch
cd /home/code/experiments
./bbox3 -n 200000 -r 100 -o fresh_solutions.csv

# Key parameters:
# -n 200000: More iterations for better exploration
# -r 100: 100 restarts per N value
# -o: Output to new file

# Then ensemble the NEW solutions with our current best
```

### ALTERNATIVE: Constraint Programming for Small N (N=2-20)

If bbox3 doesn't help, implement exact methods:
```python
from ortools.sat.python import cp_model
# Model tree positions as integer variables (scaled by 1000)
# Add non-overlap constraints using NFP
# Minimize bounding box side length
```

### ALTERNATIVE: Tessellation Patterns for Large N (N=50-200)

Chris Deotte's discussion suggests tessellation:
- Find repeating unit cells that tile efficiently
- Apply to large N values where current solutions may be suboptimal

## SUBMISSION STRATEGY

With 84+ submissions remaining:
1. **SUBMIT EVERY EXPERIMENT** - LB feedback is free learning
2. Track which N values improve with each approach
3. Build ensemble of best per-N from ALL experiments

## What NOT to Try
- ❌ More ensemble variations from existing data (exhausted)
- ❌ SA on existing solutions (local optimum)
- ❌ "Optimizing" existing CSV files (doesn't work)
- ❌ Backward propagation (already tried, no improvement)

## IMMEDIATE ACTIONS

1. Create experiments/031_fresh_bbox3/
2. Run bbox3 with fresh starts (not optimization)
3. Compare per-N scores with current best
4. Create ensemble of improvements
5. SUBMIT to get LB feedback
