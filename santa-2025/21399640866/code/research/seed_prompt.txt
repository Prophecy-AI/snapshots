## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.309159 from exp_033 (VALIDATED on Kaggle LB)
- Best LB score: 70.3092 (confirmed)
- Target: 68.870074 | Gap to target: 1.439 points (2.05%)
- Submissions used: 19/100 (81 remaining)

## Response to Evaluator

The evaluator suggested implementing backward iteration ("BackPacking") approach. However:

1. **We already tried this in exp_002** - backward propagation from N=200 to N=2 found only 1 improvement with essentially 0 total improvement (4.6e-7).

2. **fix_direction() found 0 improvements** - The configurations are already optimally rotated.

3. **bbox3 (160 rounds) found 0 improvements** - The solution is at an extremely strong local optimum.

4. **N=1 is already at theoretical optimum** (0.661250 = 0.813173² / 1).

The evaluator's analysis is correct that the solution is at a strong local optimum. However, the backward iteration approach has already been exhausted.

## What We've Learned (36 experiments)

| Approach | Experiments | Result |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| Ensemble | 13 | EFFECTIVE - improved 0.306 points |
| Local search (SA, GA, bbox3) | 12 | 0 improvements |
| Novel algorithms (lattice, interlock, jostle, BLF, crystallization) | 6 | 0 improvements |
| fix_direction() | 1 | 0 improvements |
| Backward iteration | 1 | 0 improvements |

## Critical Analysis

### Why the Gap Exists (1.44 points):

1. **Top team has 953 submissions** vs our 19 - they've accumulated per-N improvements over WEEKS
2. **Access to private solutions** - Telegram, Discord channels with shared high-scoring CSVs
3. **Extended compute time** - days of optimization vs hours
4. **Possibly custom algorithms** - implementations we don't have access to

### What's Mathematically Possible:

- N=1 is already optimal (0.661250)
- Small N values (N=1-20) contribute 11.4% of total score
- Average improvement needed per N: 0.0072 points
- This requires finding configurations ~2% better for EVERY N value

### Realistic Assessment:

The 1.44 point gap likely requires:
1. Access to better external solutions (which we don't have)
2. OR fundamentally different algorithms that can find better configurations
3. OR weeks of accumulated per-N improvements through many submissions

## Next Experiment Strategy

Given the constraints, here are the remaining options:

### Option 1: Deep Per-N Mining (RECOMMENDED)
Focus on finding ANY improvement for specific N values:
- For each N from 2 to 50, run extended optimization (1 hour per N)
- Use multiple random restarts with SA
- Even 0.001 improvement per N would help

### Option 2: External Data Hunt
- Search for any new public kernels or datasets
- Check if any new high-scoring CSVs have been shared
- Look for Telegram/Discord shared solutions

### Option 3: Novel Algorithm Implementation
Implement from scratch:
- Constraint programming solver
- MILP formulation for small N
- Reinforcement learning approach

### Option 4: Submit Current Best and Accept Plateau
- Current score 70.309 is BETTER than all available external data
- The gap to target may not be achievable with available resources
- Focus on validating the current solution

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: DO NOT REPEAT FAILED APPROACHES

The following have been exhaustively tried and found 0 improvements:
- ❌ bbox3 with more iterations
- ❌ SA with different parameters
- ❌ GA optimization
- ❌ fix_direction() rotation
- ❌ Backward iteration
- ❌ Lattice packing
- ❌ Interlock patterns
- ❌ Jostle algorithm
- ❌ BLF constructive
- ❌ Crystallization

## Recommended Next Experiment: exp_036_deep_per_n_mining

Focus on finding improvements for specific N values through extended optimization:

```python
# For each N from 2 to 50 (highest per-N scores):
# 1. Load current best configuration
# 2. Run SA with 100,000 iterations and multiple restarts
# 3. Try different temperature schedules
# 4. Track any improvement, even tiny ones
# 5. Ensemble best per-N across all attempts

for n in range(2, 51):
    best_score = current_per_n_scores[n]
    for restart in range(10):
        # Random perturbation of current best
        # Run extended SA
        # Keep if improved
```

This approach might find small improvements that accumulate.

## Submission Strategy

- Submit exp_035 to get LB feedback (should match CV at 70.309159)
- Continue experimenting with deep per-N mining
- Submit any improvement, even small ones
