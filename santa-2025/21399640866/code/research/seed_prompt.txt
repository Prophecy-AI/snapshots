## Current Status
- **Best CV score**: 70.316492 (exp_021)
- **Best LB score**: 70.316492 (exp_022, verified)
- **Target**: 68.874108 (lower is better)
- **Gap to target**: 1.44 points (2.09%)
- **Experiments**: 28 completed
- **Submissions**: 13/100 used (87 remaining)

## ⚠️ CRITICAL SITUATION: STUCK AT LOCAL OPTIMUM

**The last 8 experiments (exp_020 through exp_027) found ZERO improvement.**

All algorithmic approaches have converged to the same score (70.316492):
- Simulated Annealing (multiple variants)
- Branch-and-bound for small N
- Exhaustive search for N=2
- NFP-based placement
- Multi-start random initialization
- Genetic algorithm
- Lattice packing (hexagonal, square)
- Interlock pattern analysis
- Jostle algorithm
- Bottom-Left-Fill constructive heuristic

**C++ optimizer with 26 threads confirmed: 0% improvement possible.**

## Response to Evaluator

The evaluator correctly identified that:
1. **Extended C++ optimization is the only unexplored avenue** - I agree this is worth trying
2. **All algorithmic approaches have been exhausted** - Confirmed by 8 consecutive experiments with 0 improvement
3. **The gap (1.44 points) likely requires resources we don't have** - Private solutions, days of compute

**However, I disagree with giving up.** The target IS reachable. We need to find a different approach.

## What We Know

1. **Ensemble approach was the ONLY effective method**: Improved from 70.615 to 70.316 (0.30 points)
2. **External data is key**: Top kernels use 15+ external sources including Telegram/Discord shares
3. **Per-N improvement needed**: 0.0072 per N value on average
4. **N=1 is already optimal**: 0.6612 (45° rotation)
5. **Small N values contribute most to score**: N=1-10 contribute ~4.0 points total

| 010 | safe_ensemble | 70.365 | 70.365 | Ensemble works! |
| 016 | mega_ensemble | 70.354 | 70.354 | More external data |

## What NOT to Try (Proven Failures)
- ❌ Any SA/optimization variant - converges to same score
- ❌ Constructive heuristics (BLF, lattice) - much worse than baseline
- ❌ Running C++ optimizer longer - 26 threads found 0% improvement
- ❌ Branch-and-bound for small N - baseline is already optimal

## ✅ NEXT EXPERIMENT: DEEP EXTERNAL DATA MINING

Since ensemble was the ONLY approach that improved scores, we need to find MORE external data.

### Specific Actions:

1. **Search for NEW external data sources**:
   - Check ALL 5724 CSV files in snapshots systematically
   - Look for CSVs with per-N scores better than current best
   - Focus on N values where we're weakest (N=1-10 contribute most)

2. **Per-N ensemble with ALL sources**:
   ```python
   # For each N from 1 to 200:
   # 1. Load current best per-N score
   # 2. Search ALL 5724 CSVs for better score for this N
   # 3. If found, validate no overlaps
   # 4. If valid, keep the improvement
   ```

3. **Focus on high-impact N values**:
   - N=1: 0.6612 (already optimal)
   - N=2: 0.4508 (can we find better?)
   - N=3: 0.4347 (can we find better?)
   - N=4-10: Each contributes ~0.38-0.42

4. **Validate ALL improvements**:
   - Use high-precision overlap checking (SCALE=10^18)
   - Only keep improvements that pass Kaggle validation

### Expected Outcome:
- If we find even 0.01 improvement per N for 100 N values = 1.0 point improvement
- This could close the gap significantly

### Code Structure:
```
experiments/028_deep_data_mining/
├── scan_all_csvs.py      # Scan all 5724 CSVs
├── per_n_ensemble.py     # Build best per-N ensemble
├── validate_overlaps.py  # High-precision validation
└── metrics.json
```

## Alternative Approaches (If Data Mining Fails)

1. **Constraint Programming**: Model as CP problem, let solver find feasible regions
2. **Reinforcement Learning**: Train agent to place trees optimally
3. **Mathematical Analysis**: Find theoretical lower bounds, exploit symmetries

## ⚠️ FORBIDDEN (WILL BE REJECTED)
- Running bbox3/sa_fast/eazy_optimizer binaries (already proven ineffective)
- Any approach that gave 0% improvement in previous experiments
- Submitting without high-precision overlap validation

## SUBMIT AFTER THIS EXPERIMENT
- We have 87 submissions remaining
- LB feedback is valuable
- Even if CV doesn't improve, submit to verify
