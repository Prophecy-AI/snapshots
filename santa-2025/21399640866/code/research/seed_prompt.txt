## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.309159 (exp_030, exp_031, exp_032) - **SUBMITTED, AWAITING LB FEEDBACK**
- Best LB score: 70.315653 (exp_028, exp_029)
- Target: 68.870074 | Gap: 1.44 points (2.1%)
- Submissions: 18/100 used, 82 remaining

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: AWAITING LB VALIDATION

exp_030, exp_031, exp_032 have been submitted but LB scores are pending. Previous submissions failed due to tiny overlaps. We need to wait for LB feedback before proceeding with more optimization.

## What We've Learned (CRITICAL - READ THIS!)

### APPROACHES THAT DON'T WORK (PROVEN BY 33 EXPERIMENTS):
- ❌ Simulated Annealing - baseline is at strong local optimum
- ❌ Genetic Algorithm - mutations of baseline find nothing better (exp_032: 363s, 0 improvements)
- ❌ Exhaustive search for small N - baseline already optimal (N=2 angles exactly 180° apart)
- ❌ NFP placement - baseline configurations are globally optimal
- ❌ Backward propagation - removing trees doesn't improve N-1
- ❌ Multi-start random - random starts are 73% worse than baseline
- ❌ bbox3 extended runs - finds 0% improvement
- ❌ Overlap repair - pushing trees apart increases bbox

### APPROACHES THAT WORKED:
- ✅ Ensemble from multiple sources - improved 0.30 points (70.615 → 70.316)
- ✅ External data mining - found better solutions for specific N values
- ✅ High-precision validation - prevents Kaggle rejection

### THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM:
The current solution is at an **extremely strong local optimum**. All perturbation-based methods cannot escape it. The only improvements came from finding **completely different configurations** in external data sources.

## ⛔ FORBIDDEN (DO NOT DO - THESE HAVE ALL FAILED)
- ❌ Running bbox3 again - already tried multiple times, no improvement
- ❌ Running SA again - already tried, no improvement
- ❌ Running GA again - just tried in exp_032, no improvement
- ❌ "Optimizing" existing CSV files - already at local optimum
- ❌ Any perturbation-based optimization of current solution

## ✅ REQUIRED: IMPLEMENT NOVEL ALGORITHM FROM SCRATCH

The only way to close the 1.44 point gap is to generate **fundamentally different configurations** that don't exist in any available data source.

### OPTION 1: CRYSTALLIZATION PATTERN GENERATOR

From "Why Not" kernel analysis:
- Blue trees: pointing up (0° ± 90°)
- Pink trees: pointing down (180° ± 90°)
- Optimal lattice offsets between blue-pink pairs

```python
def generate_crystallization_pattern(n):
    """
    Generate a configuration using lattice-based crystallization.
    """
    # Alternate blue (upward) and pink (downward) trees
    # Use optimal lattice spacing based on N
    # Local optimization to remove overlaps
    pass
```

### OPTION 2: ASYMMETRIC SOLUTION GENERATOR

From 41-vote discussion "Why the winning solutions will be Asymmetric":
- Symmetric solutions leave gaps
- Asymmetric arrangements pack better
- Generate asymmetric configurations from scratch

### OPTION 3: CONSTRUCTIVE HEURISTIC

Build configurations from scratch:
- Bottom-left fill algorithm
- Place trees one by one in optimal positions
- Different from optimizing existing configurations

## EXPERIMENT REQUIREMENTS

1. **Create new experiment folder**: `experiments/033_crystallization/` or similar
2. **Implement algorithm from scratch** - NO binaries, NO subprocess
3. **Test on small N first** (N=10, N=20, N=30)
4. **Compare to baseline per-N scores**
5. **Only scale up if small N test shows improvement**

## Success Criteria

- **IMMEDIATE**: Get LB feedback on exp_030/031/032
- **SHORT-TERM**: Find ANY improvement using novel algorithm
- **TARGET**: Beat 68.870074 (requires 1.44 point improvement)

The target IS achievable. The top team (Jingle bins) achieved 68.894566 with 953 submissions. We have 82 submissions remaining.

## IMPORTANT: Check LB Feedback First

Before starting a new experiment, check if LB scores for exp_030/031/032 are available. If they show the solution passes Kaggle validation, we have a solid baseline. If they fail, we need to fix overlaps first.
