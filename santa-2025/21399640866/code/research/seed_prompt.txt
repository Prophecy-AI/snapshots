## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.306694 from exp_037 (backward_iteration_v2)
- Best LB score: 70.3092 (from exp_033)
- Target: 68.870074 | Gap to target: 1.44 points (2.09%)

## CRITICAL SUCCESS: Backward iteration v2 WORKED!
Found 2 improvements (N=122: +0.000847, N=121: +0.001618) for total 0.002465.
This is the FIRST real improvement in 7+ experiments!

## Response to Evaluator
The evaluator was CORRECT:
1. ✅ Backward iteration v2 with current best found improvements
2. ✅ N=122 and N=121 were improved by removing trees from N+1
3. ✅ The evaluator's suggestion to "continue backward iteration" is valid

I AGREE with all evaluator recommendations:
1. Submit to Kaggle (exp_037 already submitted, pending LB)
2. Continue backward iteration from the new best
3. Try forward iteration (adding trees)
4. Extended bbox3 if iteration approaches fail

## Score Breakdown Analysis
- N=1-10: 4.3247 (avg 0.432) - WORST performers, high impact
- N=11-50: 14.6271 (avg 0.366)
- N=51-100: 17.4750 (avg 0.350)
- N=101-150: 17.0604 (avg 0.341)
- N=151-200: 16.8194 (avg 0.336) - BEST performers

## Next Experiment: exp_038 - CONTINUE BACKWARD ITERATION

### TASK 1: Run backward iteration AGAIN from new best (70.306694)
The N=121 and N=122 configurations are now DIFFERENT.
Running backward iteration again might find more improvements.

Key insight: N=121 came from N=122, which came from N=123.
So N=120 might improve from the new N=121!

```python
# Load current best from /home/submission/submission.csv
# Run backward iteration from N=199 to N=2
# For each N, try removing each tree from N+1 configuration
# Keep improvements where score improves by > 0.0001
# Continue until no more improvements found
```

### TASK 2: If backward iteration finds improvements, run AGAIN
Keep running backward iteration until no improvements found.
This is an iterative process - each run may unlock new improvements.

### TASK 3: If no backward improvements, try FORWARD iteration
```python
# Forward iteration - add trees from N-1 to create N
for n in range(2, 201):
    xs_parent, ys_parent, angles_parent = configs[n-1]
    
    # Try adding a tree at various positions around the existing configuration
    # Use the centroid and bounding box to guide placement
    # Check for overlaps before accepting
```

## ⛔ FORBIDDEN
- bbox3, sa_fast, eazy_optimizer - FORBIDDEN (already at local optimum)
- subprocess.run() or os.system() - FORBIDDEN
- Running ANY binary or executable - FORBIDDEN

## ✅ REQUIRED
1. Run backward iteration from 70.306694 (the new best)
2. If improvements found, run again until no more improvements
3. If no improvements, try forward iteration
4. Track per-N improvements carefully
5. Use high-precision coordinates (20 decimal places)
6. Validate no overlaps before saving

## Expected Outcome
- Backward iteration v3 might find 1-3 more improvements
- Each improvement is ~0.001 points
- Even small improvements are valuable for ensemble

## SUBMIT AFTER EXPERIMENT
After completing the experiment, SUBMIT to Kaggle to get LB feedback.
