      "text": "For 2D irregular polygon packing optimization, constraint programming (CP) and mixed-integer programming (MIP) approaches are prominent. CP models have been effectively used to handle non-overlap constraints, with recent developments introducing global constraints specifically designed for non-overlap conditions, which improve the efficiency of solving such problems ([Abeysooriya et al., 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214716019300594)). These models typically define decision variables for shape placement and orientation, utilizing global constraints to ensure non-overlap among irregular shapes.\n\nOn the other hand, MIP approaches have seen significant advancements through the development of specialized formulations like the Dotted-Board Model, which discretizes the problem space to facilitate exact solutions ([Toledo et al., 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0925527313001722)). More recent methods include the use of conflict graphs and clique coverings to reduce the number of constraints, as well as branch-and-bound-and-prune algorithms that leverage ad-hoc data structures for efficient search ([Lastra-D\u00edaz & Ortu\u00f1o, 2025](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.21009)). These approaches aim to improve solution accuracy and computational efficiency, especially for larger instances of irregular polygon packing problems.",

A small number of exact methods have been proposed to solve nesting problems, typically focusing on a single problem variant, the strip packing problem. There are however several other variants of the nesting problem which were identified in the literature and are very relevant in the industry.\n\nIn this paper, constraint programming (CP) is used to model and solve all the variants of irregular cutting and packing problems proposed in the literature. Three approaches, which differ in the representation of the variable domains, in the way they deal with the core constraints and in the objective functions, are the basis for the three models proposed for each variant of the problem. The non-overlap among pieces, which must be enforced for all the problem variants, is guaranteed through the new global constraint NoOverlap in one of the proposed approaches.\n\nTaking the benchmark instances for the strip-packing problem, new instances were generated for each problem variant. Extensive computational experiments were run with these problem instances from the literature to evaluate the performance of each approach applied to each problem variant. The models based on the global constraint NoOverlap performed consistently better for all variants due to the increased propagation and to the low memory usage.\n\nThe performance of the CP model for the strip packing problem with the global constraint NoOverlap was then compared with the Dotte...",

It differs from other 2-D C&P problems in the irregular shape of the pieces. This paper proposes a new mixed-integer model in which binary decision variables are associated with each discrete point of the board (a dot) and with each piece type. It is much more flexible than previously proposed formulations and solves to [optimality](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/optimality) larger instances of the nesting problem, at the cost of having its precision dependent on board [discretization](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/discretization). To date no results have been published concerning optimal solutions for nesting problems with more than 7 pieces. We ran computational experiments on 45 problem instances with the new model, solving to [optimality](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/optimality) 34 instances with a total number of pieces ranging from 16 to 56, depending on the number of piece types, grid resolution and the size of the board. A strong advantage of the model is its insensitivity to piece and board geometry, making it easy to extend to more complex problems such as non-convex boards, possibly with defects. Additionally, the number of binary variables does not depend on the total number of pieces but on the number of piece types, making the model particularly suitable for problems with few piece types. The discrete nature of the model requires a trade-off between grid resolution and problem size, as the number of binary variables grows with the square of the selected grid resolution and with board size.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe nesting problem, also known as irregular packing problem, belongs to the more generic class of cutting and packing (C&P) problems. As in all C&P problems, one or more big objects have to be divided into smaller items or pieces so that (1) unused regions of the big object, usually designated as waste, are minimized \u2014 input minimization problems, according to W\u00e4scher typology, or (2) the value of the pieces cut from the big object is maximized \u2014 output maximization problem, according to the same typology (W\u00e4scher et al., 2007). The problem addressed in this paper is a two-dimensional (2D) C&P problem, i.e. only two of the dimensions of the objects are relevant, as the third dimension is equal for all objects and pieces. Moreover, the goal is to minimize the used length of a big rectangular object (the board), of unbound length, making it a 2D Open Dimension Problem. It is often called irregular strip packing.\n\nThe nesting problem differs from other 2D C&P problems in the irregular shape of the pieces. Irregular shapes are those that involve non-trivial handling of the geometry (Bennell and Oliveira, 2008). This leaves out of our scope rectangles and circles, in which the evaluation of the distance between two pieces can be performed by simple coordinate comparison. The most common representation, in the literature, for the irregular shape of a piece is the polygon, and although geometric operations with polygons are not trivial, we will also assume that all pieces are represented by polygons. No additional constraints are imposed on the polygon characteristics, so we deal with the harder to tackle class of non-convex polygons.\n\nNesting problems are not only a scientific challenge, as they add the geometry handling complexity to the combinatorial optimization nature of C&P problems, but they are also most relevant in real-world applications. Indeed they arise in a wide variety of industrial production processes, including textile, garment, metalware, furniture and shoe industries. In all cases saving raw-materials represents an important contribution to the economic and environmental performance of companies.\n\nNesting problems have been addressed by many authors. However, given the problem complexity, to the best of the authors' knowledge there is no published exact mathematical programming based method to solve it, reaching guaranteed optimal solutions for the problem. Although a thorough tutorial on the nesting problem resolution is available (Bennell and Oliveira, 2009), the approaches that more closely relate to the work reported in this paper will be briefly highlighted.\n\nNot surprisingly, heuristic and metaheuristic algorithms are the basis of the overwhelming majority of the published approaches. Among these, the most recent approaches with best performance are from Gomes and Oliveira (2006), Egeblad et al. (2007), Imamichi et al. (2009), Bennell and Song (2010), and Leung et al. (2012). A pioneering work on the exact resolution of non-convex nesting problems (Carravilla et al., 2003) used constraint logic programming as resolution method and has solved to optimality problems with up to 7 pieces. All the other approaches deal with approximations or simpler forms of the nesting problem.\n\nThe first approximation is geometric and consists in considering only rectangular shapes. The first exact solution procedure for the constrained (i.e. with an upper bound on the number of pieces of each type to cut or pack) 2D non-guillotine rectangular problem was proposed by Beasley (1985) and was based on a binary integer programming formulation. The author assumes that all rectangle's lengths and widths are integers, leading to a discrete model, as pieces can only be placed on a set of discrete points of the board.

Recent performance gains of the Mixed-Integer Linear\nProgramming (MILP) solvers have encouraged the proposal of exact optimization\nmodels for nesting. The Dotted-Board (DB) MILP model solves the discrete version\nof the nesting problem by constraining the positions of the polygons to be on a grid of\nfixed points. However, its number of non-overlapping constraints grows exponentially\nwith the number of dots and types of polygons, which encouraged the proposal\nof a reformulation called the DB Clique Covering (DB-CC) that sets the current\nstate-of-the-art by significantly reducing the constraints required. However, DB-CC\nrequires a significant preprocessing time to compute edge and vertex clique coverings.\nMoreover, current knowledge of the stable set polytope suggests that achieving a\ntighter formulation is unlikely. Thus, our hypothesis is that an ad-hoc exact algorithm\nrequiring no preprocessing might be a better option to solve the DB model than the\ncostly Branch-and-Cut approach. This work proposes an exact branch-and-bound\u0002and-prune algorithm to solve the DB model from the conflict inverse graph based\non ad-hoc data structures, bounding, and forward-checking for pruning the search\nspace. We introduce two 0-1 ILP DB reformulations with discrete rotations and\na new lower-bound algorithm as by-products. Our experiments show that DB-PB\nsignificantly reduces the resolution time compared to our replication of the DB-CC\nmodel. Seventeen open instances are solved up to optimality.\n1. Introduction\nCutting and packing regular (convex) and irregular (non-convex) polygons onto a rectangular strip with\nunbounded length is a tedious and usual task in most manufacturing industries based on the cutting of any flat\nmaterial. For instance, Milenkovic et al. [84] study the nesting problem for the fashion and apparel industry,\nwhilst Heistermann and Lengauer [64] and Whelan and Batchelor [124] do it for leather manufacturing,\nElamvazuthi et al. [45] in furniture, Han et al. [62] in the glass industry, Alves et al. [8] in the automotive\nindustry, and Cheok and Nee [29] and Hamada et al. [61] in shipbuilding. The irregular strip-packing problem\nis also known as nesting or marker making in the industry, and it consists in computing a non-overlapping\nplacement of a set of irregular polygons, called pieces, onto a fixed-width rectangular strip with unbounded\nlength, called the board, whose length is the minimum possible. Another closely related problem, called\ntwo-dimensional bin packing [80, 66], is defined as the computation of a non-overlapping placement of a set\nof polygons onto a larger closed polygon, called the bin, to minimize the number of bins required. Regular\nand irregular strip and bin packing problems, and all their variants concerning the geometry of the pieces\n\u2217Corresponding author\njlastra@ucm.es (J.J.

[122], and extensively reviewed by Sweeney and Paternoster [116], Dowsland and\nDowsland [41], Wang and W\u00e4scher [120], and Bennell et al. [18], among others.\nResearch on the irregular strip and bin packing problems can be traced back to the pioneering Linear\nProgramming (LP) models for rectangular bin packing introduced by Gilmore and Gomory [55], and the\npioneering heuristic methods for irregular strip packing proposed by Art [10], Adamowicz and Albano [4, 3],\nand Albano and Sapuppo [6] in the late nineteen sixties and seventies. These early works introduce many of\nthe basic ideas subsequently exploited by all heuristics methods reported in the literature, such as the notion\nof a feasible non-overlapping region between pieces based on the No-Fit Polygon (NFP) representation [16],\nand the sequential placement of pieces based on bottom-left heuristics. The boundary and outer region of the\nno-fit polygon \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc39 \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc35 set the feasible positions in which polygon \ud835\udc35 can be placed, without rotating, into\na non-overlapping position with respect to polygon \ud835\udc34. Thus, the no-fit polygon allows one to compute the\nfeasible relative placements between polygons \ud835\udc34 and \ud835\udc35 a priori by checking whether their relative position\nvector \ud835\udeff\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc35 = \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc35 \u2212 \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc34 belongs to either the boundary or the outer region of \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc39 \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc35, where \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc34 and \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc35\ndenote their corresponding reference points. This property has converted the NFP into the most broadly\nadopted and effective geometric representation for nesting reported in the literature, both for the families of\nheuristics methods [17] and for exact mathematical models [73].\nFowler et al. [51] show that the irregular strip-packing problem is NP-complete. For this reason, most\npractical solutions reported in the literature since the pioneering work of Art [10] are based on sequential\nplacement heuristics to build efficiently feasible solutions that are combined with meta-heuristics for\nexploring the space of feasible solutions, as shown in most of surveys on nesting [42, 43, 65, 17, 102]. Elkeran\n[46] introduces the current state-of-the-art heuristic method for nesting, called Guided Cuckoo Search (GCS),\nwhich defines a two-stage method based on piece clustering and NFP-based bottom-left heuristics [57] to\nbuild an initial feasible solution that is shrunk by solving an overlap minimization problem using a variant\nof the cuckoo search meta-heuristics. Although GCS was introduced more than a decade ago, subsequent\nworks have been unable to outperform its results, as shown by Pinheiro et al. [98, table 3], Sato et al. [107,\ntable 5], Cherri et al. [30, table 4], Mundim et al. [87, table 6], Amaro J\u00fanior et al. [9, table 2], and Sato et al.\n[106, tables 4-5]. More recently, other authors have introduced new heuristics for the continuous and discrete\nversions of the nesting problem, such as the works of Fang et al. [48], Na and Yang [88], Guo et al. [60],\nSato et al. [108], Queiroz and de Queiroz [101], Umetani and Murakami [119], and Queiroz and Andretta\n[100]. For a recent comparison of heuristics and exact mathematical models for nesting, we refer the readers\nto the comparative evaluation carried out by Giovenali et al. [56].\nThe recent performance gains achieved by state-of-the-art Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) solvers\n[22, 2, 67] have encouraged the proposal of exact mathematical models for nesting during the last\ndecade, as shown by the literature reviews of Leao et al. [73] and Lastra-D\u00edaz and Ortu\u00f1o [70]. The\nexact mathematical models for nesting can be categorized into mixed-integer linear programming models,\nConstraint Programming (CP) models, and non-linear programming models, as shown in the categorization\nof Lastra-D\u00edaz and Ortu\u00f1o [70, Fig. 1]. In turn, the family of mathematical programming models for nesting\ncan be categorized into three large families according to the type of decision variables used to represent\nthe position of the pieces as follows.

It adopts two neighborhoods, swapping two given polygons in a placement and placing one polygon into a new position. The local search algorithm is used to minimize the overlap on the basis of the neighborhoods mentioned above and the unconstrained[nonlinear programming](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/nonlinear-programming)model is adopted to further minimize the overlap during the search process. Moreover, the[tabu](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/tabu)search algorithm is used to avoid[local minima](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/local-minimum), and a compact algorithm is presented to improve the result. The results of standard test instances indicate that when compared with other existing algorithms, the presented algorithm does not only show some signs of competitive power but also updates several best known results.\n## Introduction\nThe irregular strip packing problem, also known as the nesting problem, has a wide area of applications. Given a set of irregular shapes and a rectangular strip with a fixed width and an arbitrary length, the target of the two-dimensional irregular strip packing problem is to place all shapes within the strip such that the length of the strip is minimized and the irregular shapes do not overlap. A classic example application is clothing industry. Several pieces of clothes will be cut from a roll of fabric and the objective is to minimize the waste of fabric. The fabric has a fixed width and its length can be generally assumed infinite; so the problem is to minimize the length required for producing the specified number of irregular shapes.\nThe irregular strip packing problem is a NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem [1]. Numerous papers on nesting problem have been published since the first paper by Art [2]. Meta-heuristics are often used to solve this problem. Hopper and Turton [3] reviewed these methods, and a summary of geometric methods was published by Bennell and Oliveira [4]. As research progressed, further breakthroughs in algorithms for this problem have achieved in recent years. When compared with the previous years, these solutions have markedly improved the effect and speed of nesting results. The typical methods include Burke et al. [5], Gomes and Oliveira [6], Egeblad et al. [7], Imamichi et al. [8], etc.\nAlbano and Sapuppo [9] proposed an algorithm that places each shape at the bottom-left position, and the sequence of places is obtained by tree search. Jakobs [10] proposed a two-stage solution which first generates the rectangular enclosure of each irregular shape, and then finds the placement for these enclosures through a genetic algorithm. Secondly, a shrinking algorithm moves the shapes to another one as close as possible using the idea of the bottom-left heuristic. Gomes and Oliveira [11] based on bottom-left heuristic and find a good placement by exchanging two shapes in the layout. Dowsland et al. [12] developed a compact algorithm to improve the bottom-left heuristic algorithm. The algorithm first gets the initial placement by the bottom-left heuristic, and then uses a shaking process to compact the placement. Burke et al. [5] presented a new bottom-left heuristic algorithm based on discretization, and combination with hill climbing or tabu search to get a high quality solution. This algorithm can also pack the shapes with circular arcs and holes. Egeblad et al. [7] proposed an efficient fast local search method whose neighborhood is any horizontal or vertical translation of a given shape. They also formulated a polynomial time algorithm to find a translation with minimum overlap area between the given polygon and the other polygons in the current placement. Gomes and Oliveira [6] presented a separation algorithm to locally optimize the placement based on linear programming models, and used simulated annealing to guide the search. A new separation algorithm based on unconstrained nonlinear programming is proposed by Imamichi et al. [8]. They also designed an algorithm that swaps two polygons in a placement, and then the algorithms are combined as a component into an iterated local search algorithm for the overlap minimization problem. This method yielded several best known results on the standard test instances. Our algorithm is based on a separation algorithm presented by Imamichi et al. [8], and local search is adopted to guide the search. Moreover, a tabu search algorithm is used to avoid local minima and a compacted algorithm is used to improve the packing results.\n## Section snippets\n## Formulation\nIn this section, some fundamental elements of geometry are first defined, before formulation of the irregular strip packing problem algorithm is given.\n**Definition 1 (point)**\nA point*p*in two-dimensional space is represented by a pair:p=(px,py)\u2208R2.\n**Definition 2 (line segment)**\nA line segment*s*is a point set defined by two endpoints*p**a*and*p**b*:s={p\u2208R2,t\u2208[0,1]|p=pa+t(pb\u2212pa)}.\n**Definition 3 (polygon)**\nA polygon is a plane figure bounded by a closed path composes of a finite sequence of line segments denoted by*S*.

We focus on exact methods and relaxations for the four main problems from the literature: finding a packing with minimum height, packing the items into the minimum number of bins, finding a packing of maximum value, and determining the existence of a feasible packing.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe number of publications on cutting and packing problems has been increasing considerably in recent years. In cutting problems, we are given a set of standardized stock units to be cut into smaller _items_ so as to fulfill a given demand, while in packing problems a set of items has to be packed into one or more containers. These two classes of problems are strongly correlated, as packing an item into a container may be equivalent to cutting an item from a stock unit, and hence the same solution methods are often adopted. In the following, we will denote as _bins_ both the stock units and the containers. In certain applications the unique container is a _strip_ of (theoretically) infinite height.\n\nCutting and packing problems have been widely studied in the literature both for their theoretical interest and their many practical applications, in which they appear in a number of different variants. Some problems consider one-dimensional items and bins, whereas other problems refer to higher dimensions, like, e.g., the (three-dimensional) container loading problem (see Bortfeldt & W\u00e4scher, 2013). Items and bins may have rectangular or general (convex or non-convex) shape. Several practical constraints may also be part of the problems, as cargo stability in container loading problems or the need of producing guillotine patterns in cutting problems. In certain applications, cutting and packing problems are combined with other problems, for example in the integrated lot-sizing and cutting stock problems studied by Melega, Araujo, and Jans (2018) or in the routing problems with loading constraints considered by Iori and Martello (2010). Packing problems also appear in many other fields, such as telecommunications (Lodi et\u00a0al., 2011, Martello, 2014), newspapers paging (Strecker & Hennig, 2009), production (Nesello, Delorme, Iori, & Subramanian, 2018), scheduling (Kwon & Lee, 2015), and maritime logistics (Xu & Lee, 2018). Most cutting and packing problems are NP-hard and very challenging in practice. For this reason, sophisticated solution methods are needed for their solution, motivating the frequent literature updating of this area of research.\n\nSeveral surveys have been dedicated to solution methods for cutting and packing problems. Specifically, referring to surveys published in the last two decades:\n\n- \u2022\n_One-dimensional cutting and packing_. Val\u00e9rio de Carvalho (2002) reviews linear programming models for one-dimensional bin packing and cutting stock problems. Approximation algorithms for packing problems generally belong to two main categories: (i) _on-line_ algorithms sequentially pack the items in the order encountered on input, without knowledge of items not yet packed; (ii) _off-line_ algorithms have complete information about the item set, and may perform preprocessing, reordering, grouping, etc. before packing. Approximation results (for both on-line and off-line algorithms) have been reviewed by Coffman\u00a0Jr., Csirik, Galambos, Martello, and Vigo (2013) (Sections\u00a03 and 4, respectively). A recent survey on mathematical models and exact algorithms for one-dimensional packing problems was presented by Delorme, Iori, and Martello (2016), who also set up a library, the BPPLIB (Delorme, Iori, & Martello, 2018), of computer codes and benchmark instances (see [http://or.dei.unibo.it/library/bpplib](http://or.dei.unibo.it/library/bpplib)). The books by Martello and Toth (1990) and Kellerer, Pferschy, and Pisinger (2004) present a comprehensive treatment on the knapsack problem and its variants but do not consider the corresponding two-dimensional versions;\n\n- \u2022\n_Two-dimensional rectangular shape cutting and packing_. After the classical 2002 surveys by Lodi, Martello, and Vigo (2002b) and Lodi, Martello, and Monaci (2002a), a partial updating was presented by the same authors in 2014 (Lodi, Martello, Monaci, & Vigo, 2014). The following results appeared in the last decade. A survey on guillotine packing was produced by Ntene and van Vuuren (2009). Silva, Oliveira, and W\u00e4scher (2016) reviewed exact and heuristic algorithms for a particular problem (pallet loading) in which all items are identical, including a thorough analysis of benchmark instances and methodologies adopted in the literature for numerical experiments. Oliveira, J\u00fanior, Silva, and Carravilla (2016) presented a review of heuristic algorithms for the strip packing problem. Christensen, Khan, Pokutta, and Tetali (2017) proposed a survey on approximation and on-line algorithms, also including a list of open problems in this area. Recently, Russo, Boccia, Sforza, and Sterle (2020) presented a survey on relaxations for two-dimensional cutting problems with guillotine constraints and a categorization of the resulting bounds, while Bezerra, Leao, Oliveira, and Santos (2020) reviewed models for the two-dimensional level strip packing problem;\n\n- \u2022\n_Two-dimensional irregular shape cutting and packing._ To the best of our knowledge, the first survey dedicated to the packing of irregular shapes into rectangular containers was presented in the 90\u2019s by Dowsland and Dowsland (1995). More recently, two tutorials by Bennell, Oliveira, 2008, Bennell, Oliveira, 2009 reviewed the main geometric methodologies and algorithmic approaches for the heuristic solution o...",

At its core is an innovative mixed integer programme model that places irregular pieces and defines guillotine cuts. The two-dimensional irregular shape bin [packing problem](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/packing-problem) with guillotine constraints arises in the glass cutting industry, for example, the cutting of glass for conservatories. Almost all cutting and packing problems that include guillotine cuts deal with rectangles only, where all cuts are orthogonal to the edges of the stock sheet and a maximum of two [angles of rotation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/angles-of-rotation) are permitted. The literature tackling packing problems with irregular shapes largely focuses on strip packing i.e. minimizing the length of a single fixed width stock sheet, and does not consider guillotine cuts. Hence, this problem combines the challenges of tackling the complexity of packing irregular pieces with free rotation, guaranteeing guillotine cuts that are not always orthogonal to the edges of the stock sheet, and allocating pieces to bins. To our knowledge only one other recent paper tackles this problem. We present a hybrid algorithm that is a constructive heuristic that determines the relative position of pieces in the bin and guillotine constraints via a mixed integer programme model. We investigate two approaches for allocating guillotine cuts at the same time as determining the placement of the piece, and a two phase approach that delays the allocation of cuts to provide flexibility in space usage. Finally we describe an improvement procedure that is applied to each bin before it is closed. This approach improves on the results of the only other publication on this problem, and gives competitive results for the classic rectangle bin packing problem with guillotine constraints.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe paper focuses on the two-dimensional bin packing problem (BBP) with irregular convex pieces and guillotine cuts. Guillotine cuts arise due to the cutting process of certain materials, where cuts are restricted to extend from one edge of the stock-sheet to another. This is commonly found in the glass cutting industry and research has almost exclusively focused on the cutting of rectangles where the cuts are orthogonal to the edges of the stock sheet. The problem tackled here is a generalized version of the rectangle single size stock sheet bin packing problem with guillotine constraints, where the pieces to be cut are irregular convex polygons and the guillotine cuts are not constrained to be orthogonal to the edges of the bin. We present a number of constructive heuristics that exploit a mixed integer programming (MIP) model for placing the pieces in the bin while satisfying all the geometric constraints and the guillotine cuts and provide comprehensive results for benchmark instances for this problem and the rectangular bin packing problem with guillotine cuts. The results are compared with the best in the literature and new lower bound is presented.\n\nThe motivation for tackling this problems arises in the cutting of glass sheets, for example, the glass panes for conservatories. Glass is cut by scoring and snapping the material. Each cut divides the sheet in two and is called a guillotine cut. As a result, only convex pieces can be cut directly. Since the properties of the material are homogeneous, pieces can be cut at any angle of rotation, and in some cases reflected. Typically, cutting plans involve multiple stock sheets. An example solution to this problem is given in Fig. 1. Note that the pieces must be removed by the guillotine cuts (in bold) in a specific order so that each cut begins and ends at the edge of the complete or divided stock sheet.\n\nThe requirement for guillotine cuts arise in many industries such as glass, wood boards or fibre glass for printed circuit boards. Each industrial setting implies a particular class of cutting and packing problem. For example, Malaguti et al. \\[15\\] consider a cutting stock problem with multiple stocksheets found in the wood industry, while Cui \\[8\\] tackles the cutting of metal of coils where a stock sheet is considered to have unrestricted length.\n\nThe literature tackling packing problems with irregular shapes largely focuses on strip packing i.e. minimizing the length of a single fixed width stock sheet, see \\[3\\], and does not consider guillotine cuts. Further, almost all cutting and packing problems that include guillotine cuts deal with rectangles only, where all cuts are orthogonal to the edges of the stock sheet and a maximum of two angles of rotation of the pieces are permitted. Hence, this problem combines the challenges of tackling the complexity of packing irregular pieces with free rotation, guaranteeing guillotine cuts that may or may not be orthogonal to the edges of the stock sheet, and allocating pieces to bins or stock sheets. To our knowledge, Han et al. \\[13\\] is the only other paper that tackles this problem. They propose two different construction heuristics. The first heuristic, they call a one-stage algorithm, constructs multiple parallel clusters of pieces by iteratively joining two blocks, where a block is either a piece or the convex hull of a cluster of pieces. Blocks are combined by matching pairs of edges and selecting the best match according to a dynamic solution evaluation function. Since each accepted match, starting with two individual pieces, is transformed into its convex block by taking the convex hull, the guillotine cut structure is always satisfied. The approach uses threshold parameters to control the number of blocks generated and as a result the computational time. The second constructive heuristic, a two-stage algorithm, combines pairs of p...",

In this paper we make a systematic study of the problem and develop an exact Branch &amp; Bound Algorithm. The initial existing mixed integer formulations are reviewed, tested and used as a starting point to develop a new and more efficient formulation. We also study several branching strategies, lower bounds and procedures for fixing variables, reducing the size of the problem to be solved at each node. An extensive computational study allows us first to determine the best strategies to be used in the Branch &amp; Bound Algorithm and then to explore its performance and limits. The results show that the algorithm is able to solve instances of up to 16 pieces to[optimality](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/optimality).\n## Introduction\nNesting problems are two-dimensional cutting and packing problems involving irregular shapes. These problems arise in a wide variety of industries like garment manufacturing, sheet metal cutting, furniture making and shoe manufacturing. The wide range of applications implies many different variants of the problem. The placement areas into which the pieces have to be packed or cut can be rectangular, as in the case of materials provided in rolls, or can have irregular shapes, as in the case of leather hides for making shoes. This placement area can have a uniform quality or different qualities depending on the region, including sometimes defective parts that cannot be used for pieces. The pieces to be cut can be described as polygons, convex or not, or can include curved edges. Depending on the real application, the pieces can be rotated freely, at specific angles only (90\u00b0, 180\u00b0, \u2026), or not rotated at all. There may also be different objectives, usually involving the minimization of the area required for cutting the pieces or the maximization of the value of the pieces cut. Using the typology proposed by W\u00e4scher et al. (2007), nesting problems, in general, are open-dimension problems with irregular pieces.\nIn this paper we consider a nesting problem in which we have to arrange a set of two-dimensional irregular shapes without overlapping in a rectangular stock sheet of a fixed width, where the objective is to minimize the required length. We will consider the pieces to be described as polygons, not necessarily convex, which cannot be rotated.\nThe main difficulty of nesting problems is to ensure that the pieces have a non-overlapping configuration. This question has been studied extensively in recent years and there are several approaches which determine when two polygons overlap. Bennell and Oliveira (2008) give a tutorial on the different approaches which study the geometry of nesting problems. The problem is NP-complete and as a result solution methodologies predominantly utilize heuristics.\n*Pixel/Raster*methods transform the continuous stock sheet into a discrete grid represented by a matrix, and the position of each piece adds a given coded value to each matrix element. Identifying possible overlapping comes down to checking the matrix values. There are three known codification schemes the first one proposed by Segenreich and Braga (1986), the second one by Oliveira and Ferreira (1993), and the last one by Babu and Babu (2001).\nWhen pieces are represented (or approximated) using polygons, there are tests for edge intersection and for point inclusion that can be used for identifying overlapping (Konopasek, 1981, Ferreira et al., 1998). The most widely used tool for checking whether two polygons overlap is the No-Fit Polygon (NFP). It can be used, along with the vector difference of the position of the two polygons, to determine whether these polygons overlap, touch or are separated, by conducting a simple test to identify whether the resulting vector is inside the NFP. There are three approaches to generating the NFP the orbiting algorithm by Mahadevan (1984), improved by Burke et al. (2007); the Minkowski sums used by Milenkovic et al. (1991) and Bennell and Dowsland (2001); and the decomposition into star-shaped polygons (Daniels et al., 1994) or convex polygons (Watson and Tobias, 1999, Agarwal et al., 2002).\nA more general tool that generalizes the NFP is the*Phi-function*. Its purpose is to represent all the mutual positions of two polygons. The*Phi-functions*for cutting and packing were conceived of and applied by Stoyan et al., 2001, Stoyan et al., 2004, Scheithauer et al. (2005). Bennell et al. (2010) provide a good explanation of how the*Phi-functions*can be built, as well as some applications for them.\nMany different heuristic and metaheuristic approaches have been proposed for solving nesting problems. Simple heuristic rules are used for building a solution step by step, placing one piece at a time, using different placement procedures and different piece sequences. Metaheuristic procedures are used for working with complete solutions and modifying them iterat...",

These problems arise in many industrial fields such as apparel manufacturing, sheet metal layout, shoe manufacturing, VLSI layout, furniture layout, etc., and are known by a variety of names: layout, packing, nesting, loading, placement, marker making, etc. When the 2-dimensional objects to be packed are non-rectangular the problem is known as the nesting problem. The nesting problem is strongly NP-hard. Furthermore, the geometrical aspects of this problem make it really hard to solve in practice.\nIn this paper we describe a Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) model for the nesting problem based on an earlier proposal of Daniels, Li and Milenkovic, and analyze it computationally. We also introduce a new MIP model for a subproblem arising in the construction of nesting solutions, called the multiple containment problem, and show its potentials in finding improved solutions.\nThis is a preview of subscription content,[log in via an institution](https://wayf.springernature.com/?redirect_uri&#x3D;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10732-008-9088-9?error=cookies_not_supported&code=a15d5567-1592-497b-af8f-cb3f16359982)to check access.\n## Access this article\n[Log in via an institution](https://wayf.springernature.com/?redirect_uri&#x3D;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10732-008-9088-9?error=cookies_not_supported&code=a15d5567-1592-497b-af8f-cb3f16359982)\n## Subscribe and save\nSpringer+\nfrom $39.99 /Month\n* Starting from 10 chapters or articles per month\n* Access and download chapters and articles from more than 300k books and 2,500 journals\n* Cancel anytime[View plans](https://link.springer.com/product/springer-plus)\n## Buy Now\nBuy article PDF USD 39.95\nPrice excludes VAT (USA)\nTax calculation will be finalised during checkout.\nInstant access to the full article PDF.\n[Institutional subscriptions](https://www.springernature.com/gp/librarians/licensing/agc/journals)\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n![](https://media.springernature.com/w92h120/springer-static/cover-hires/book/978-3-031-47686-0?as&#x3D;webp)\n### [An Integer Programming Approach for\u00a0a\u00a02D Bin Packing Problem with\u00a0Precedence Constraints in\u00a0the\u00a0Sheet Metal Industry](https://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-031-47686-0_12?fromPaywallRec=true)\nChapter\u00a9 2024\n![](https://media.springernature.com/w92h120/springer-static/cover-hires/book/978-3-031-28863-0?as&#x3D;webp)\n### [Capacitated Disassembly Lot-Sizing Problem with Disposal Decisions for Multiple Product Types with Parts Commonality](https://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-031-28863-0_15?fromPaywallRec=true)\nChapter\u00a9 2023\n![](https://media.springernature.com/w92h120/springer-static/cover-hires/book/978-3-319-20863-3?as&#x3D;webp)\n### [Extended Model Formulation of the Facility Layout Problem with Aisle Structure](https://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-319-20863-3_7?fromPaywallRec=true)\nChapter\u00a9 2016\n### Explore related subjects\nDiscover the latest articles, books and news in related subjects, suggested using machine learning.\n* [Combinatorics](https://link.springer.com/subjects/combinatorics)\n* [Combinatorial Geometry](https://link.springer.com/subjects/combinatorial-geometry)\n* [Computer Modelling](https://link.springer.com/subjects/computer-modelling)\n* [Discrete Mathematics](https://link.springer.com/subjects/discrete-mathematics)\n* [Mathematical Modeling and Industrial Mathematics](https://link.springer.com/subjects/mathematical-modeling-and-industrial-mathematics)\n* [Polytopes](https://link.springer.com/subjects/polytopes)\n## References\n* Blazewicz, J., Moret-Salvador, A., Walkowiak, R.: Parallel tabu search approaches for two-dimensional cutting.
