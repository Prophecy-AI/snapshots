    "**exp_029 (overlap_repair)**: LB = 70.3157 (matches CV exactly)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Critical Insight\n",
    "The overlap repair strategy FAILED completely:\n",
    "- 2,542 repair attempts, 0 successes\n",
    "- Reason: Overlapping solutions achieve low scores BECAUSE they overlap\n",
    "- Pushing trees apart increases bounding box → worse score\n",
    "\n",
    "### Score Status\n",
    "- Current best: 70.315653\n",
    "- Target: 68.870074\n",
    "- Gap: 1.445579 (2.10%)\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We've Learned\n",
    "1. All external data sources have been exhausted (best external = 70.319, worse than current)\n",
    "2. SA/bbox3 optimization has hit its ceiling\n",
    "3. Overlap repair is a dead end\n",
    "4. The baseline is at an extremely strong local optimum"
