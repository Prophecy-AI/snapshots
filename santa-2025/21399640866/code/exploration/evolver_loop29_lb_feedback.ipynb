    "The overlap repair strategy FAILED completely:\n",
    "- 2,542 repair attempts, 0 successes\n",
    "- Reason: Overlapping solutions achieve low scores BECAUSE they overlap\n",
    "- Pushing trees apart increases bounding box → worse score\n",

    "1. All external data sources have been exhausted (best external = 70.319, worse than current)\n",

    "3. Overlap repair is a dead end\n",
