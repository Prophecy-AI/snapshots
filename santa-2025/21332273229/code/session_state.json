IMPLEMENT THE ALGORITHM.\n\n## Top Approaches from Public Kernels\n\n### 1. bbox3.cpp Optimizer (jazivxt \"Why Not\" kernel)\nPath: `../research/kernels/jazivxt_why-not/why-not.ipynb`\n**Key Features:**\n- Complex Number Vector Coordination\n- Fluid Dynamics simulation\n- Hinge Pivot mechanism\n- Density Gradient Flow\n- Global Boundary Tension\n- Aggressive overlap repair using separation vectors\n\n### 2. tree_packer_v21.cpp (smartmanoj \"Santa Claude\" kernel)\nPath: `../research/kernels/smartmanoj_santa-claude/santa-claude.ipynb`\n**Key Features:**\n- Swap moves between trees\n- Multi-angle restarts\n- Higher temperature simulated annealing\n- Squeeze, compaction, and local search\n- Backward propagation (bp.cpp)\n\n### 3. Backward Propagation (bp.cpp)\nFor each N from 200 down to 2:\n- Try removing each boundary-touching tree\n- If resulting (N-1) config is better than stored, save it\n\n## Academic Techniques from Research (IMPLEMENT THESE!)\n\n### 1. No-Fit Polygon (NFP) - HIGHLY RECOMMENDED\nThe NFP precomputes all feasible relative positions between two polygons. Once computed, overlap checking becomes O(1) - just check if reference point is inside NFP.\n\n```python\ndef compute_nfp(polygon_a, polygon_b):\n    \"\"\"Compute no-fit polygon between two polygons.\n    The NFP boundary represents all positions where B touches A.\n    Inside NFP = overlap, Outside NFP = no overlap.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Use Minkowski sum: NFP = A \u2295 (-B)\n    # Or use sliding algorithm for non-convex polygons\n    pass\n\ndef can_place(tree_a, tree_b, nfp):\n    \"\"\"Check if tree_b can be placed without overlapping tree_a.\"\"\"\n    relative_pos = (tree_b.x - tree_a.x, tree_b.y - tree_a.y)\n    return not point_in_polygon(relative_pos, nfp)\n```\n\n### 2. Jostle Heuristics\n- Iteratively \"jostle\" pieces to reduce waste\n- Handles both allocation and placement\n- Supports free rotation\n- Bottom-left criteria doesn't always perform best - try other placement criteria\n\n### 3. Hybrid GA + Linear Programming\n- Use genetic algorithm to optimize the SEQUENCE of placement\n- Use linear programming to optimize POSITIONS given a sequence\n- Crossover: combine good subsequences from parents\n- Mutation: swap, insert, or rotate pieces\n\n### 4. Branch-and-Bound for Small N\nFor N <= 10, exhaustive search is feasible:\n```python\ndef branch_and_bound(n, trees_so_far, best_score):\n    if len(trees_so_far) == n:\n        return compute_score(trees_so_far)\n    \n    for angle in np.arange(0, 360, 1):  # Discretize angles\n        for position in get_feasible_positions(trees_so_far, angle):\n            new_tree = ChristmasTree(position[0], position[1], angle)\n            if not has_overlap(trees_so_far + [new_tree]):\n                score = branch_and_bound(n, trees_so_far + [new_tree], best_score)\n                if score < best_score:\n                    best_score = score\n    return best_score\n```\n\n### 5. Extended Local Search with Separation Algorithm\n- Swap two polygons in placement\n- Use nonlinear programming to minimize overlap\n- Tabu search to avoid local minima\n- Compact algorithm to improve results\n\n## Score Breakdown by N (Highest Contributors)\n```\nN=1:  side=0.813, score=0.661 (HIGHEST - optimize this!)\nN=2:  side=0.950, score=0.451\nN=3:  side=1.142, score=0.435\nN=5:  side=1.444, score=0.417\nN=4:  side=1.291, score=0.417\n```\n**Small N values (1-15) contribute disproportionately to the total score!**\n\n## CRITICAL INSIGHTS FROM PREVIOUS EXPERIMENTS\n\n### What Has Been Tried (and didn't work):\n1. **Short optimization runs** - Local optimum is too tight\n2. **Simple ensemble** - santa-2025.csv dominates all N values\n3. **Backward propagation on pre-optimized** - Found no improvements\n4. **Standard SA parameters** - Cannot escape local optimum\n\n### What MUST Be Tried:\n\n#### 1. **LATTICE/TESSELLATION APPROACH FOR LARGE N (N >= 58)** [HIGHEST PRIORITY]\n- Start with 2 trees in a specific configuration\n- Translate them in x and y directions to create a grid pattern\n- Use simulated annealing to optimize the base configuration\n- Parameters: `nt = [nx, ny]` where nx*ny >= N\n- This generates crystalline/lattice packings that can be tighter than random optimization\n\n```python\n# Lattice approach pseudocode\ndef generate_lattice(n, base_config, dx, dy):\n    \"\"\"Generate n trees by translating base_config\"\"\"\n    trees = []\n    rows = int(np.ceil(np.sqrt(n)))\n    cols = int(np.ceil(n / rows))\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            if len(trees) >= n:\n                break\n            for tree in base_config:\n                new_tree = translate(tree, i*dx, j*dy)\n                trees.append(new_tree)\n    return trees[:n]\n```\n\n#### 2. **FOCUS ON SMALL N VALUES (1-10)** [HIGH PRIORITY]\nThese have the highest score contribution:\n- N=1: side=0.813, contributes 0.66 to score (HIGHEST!)\n- For N=1, optimal angle is 45 degrees (minimizes bounding box)\n- Try exhaustive search for optimal rotation angles\n- For N=2, N=3: Try systematic angle combinations\n\n```python\n# Exhaustive search for N=1\ndef optimize_n1():\n    best_side = float('inf')\n    best_angle = 0\n    for angle in np.arange(0, 360, 0.01):\n        tree = ChristmasTree(0, 0, angle)\n        side = get_bounding_box_side(tree)\n        if side < best_side:\n            best_side = side\n            best_angle = angle\n    return best_angle\n```\n\n#### 3. **ASYMMETRIC SOLUTIONS** [MEDIUM PRIORITY]\n- Symmetric solutions may be optimal for small N\n- Asymmetric solutions outperform for larger N\n- Try breaking symmetry in optimization\n\n#### 4. **IMPLEMENT NOVEL OPTIMIZATION FROM SCRATCH** [REQUIRED]\nInstead of using pre-compiled binaries:\n- Implement your own simulated annealing with novel move operators\n- Try genetic algorithms with custom crossover\n- Implement constraint programming approach\n\n## Submission Format\n```csv\nid,x,y,deg\n001_0,s0.0,s0.0,s90.0\n002_0,s0.0,s0.0,s90.0\n002_1,s0.202736,s-0.511271,s90.0\n...\n```\n- id: `{n:03d}_{tree_index}` (e.g., 001_0, 002_0, 002_1)\n- x, y, deg: prefixed with 's' to preserve precision\n- Total rows: 20100 (1+2+3+...+200)\n- Coordinates must be within [-100, 100]\n\n## Overlap Detection (CRITICAL)\n```python\nfrom shapely.geometry import Polygon\nfrom shapely import affinity\nfrom shapely.strtree import STRtree\nfrom decimal import Decimal\n\nclass ChristmasTree:\n    def __init__(self, center_x='0', center_y='0', angle='0'):\n        self.center_x = Decimal(str(center_x))\n        self.center_y = Decimal(str(center_y))\n        self.angle = Decimal(str(angle))\n        \n        TX = [0, 0.125, 0.0625, 0.2, 0.1, 0.35, 0.075, 0.075, -0.075, -0.075, -0.35, -0.1, -0.2, -0.0625, -0.125]\n        TY = [0.8, 0.5, 0.5, 0.25, 0.25, 0, 0, -0.2, -0.2, 0, 0, 0.25, 0.25, 0.5, 0.5]\n        \n        initial_polygon = Polygon(zip(TX, TY))\n        rotated = affinity.rotate(initial_polygon, float(self.angle), origin=(0, 0))\n        self.polygon = affinity.translate(rotated, xoff=float(self.center_x), yoff=float(self.center_y))\n\ndef has_overlap(trees):\n    polygons = [t.polygon for t in trees]\n    tree_index = STRtree(polygons)\n    for i, poly in enumerate(polygons):\n        indices = tree_index.query(poly)\n        for idx in indices:\n            if idx != i and poly.intersects(polygons[idx]) and not poly.touches(polygons[idx]):\n                return True\n    return False\n```\n\n## Scoring Function\n```python\ndef get_total_score(submission_df):\n    total = 0\n    for n in range(1, 201):\n        trees = load_trees_for_n(submission_df, n)\n        xys = np.concatenate([np.asarray(t.polygon.exterior.xy).T for t in trees])\n        side = max(xys.max(axis=0) - xys.min(axis=0))\n        total += side**2 / n\n    return total\n```\n\n## Recommended Experiment Strategy\n\n### Experiment 0: Establish Baseline\n1. Copy best pre-optimized submission (score: 70.676102)\n2. Verify score calculation matches\n3. Submit to confirm LB score\n\n### Experiment 1: Small N Optimization (HIGH PRIORITY)\n1. Focus on N=1 to N=10 specifically\n2. For N=1: Try all angles from 0 to 360 in 0.01 degree increments\n3. For N=2, N=3: Try systematic angle combinations\n4. These contribute ~4.5 points to total score!\n\n### Experiment 2: Implement Lattice Approach for Large N\n1. Implement tessellation/lattice packing for N >= 58\n2. Start with 2 base trees, translate to create grid\n3. Optimize base configuration and translation vectors\n4. This is a fundamentally different approach that can beat local optima\n\n### Experiment 3: Implement Novel SA from Scratch\n1. Write your own simulated annealing in Python\n2. Use novel move operators:\n   - Swap two trees\n   - Rotate single tree\n   - Translate single tree toward center\n   - Perturb all trees slightly\n3. Use adaptive temperature schedule\n\n### Experiment 4: Genetic Algorithm\n1. Implement GA with population of configurations\n2. Custom crossover: combine good sub-configurations\n3. Mutation: random perturbations\n4. Selection: tournament selection based on score\n\n### Experiment 5: No-Fit Polygon Approach\n1. Precompute NFPs for tree-tree interactions at various angles\n2. Use NFPs to quickly find valid placements\n3. Combine with bottom-left heuristic for construction\n\n## What NOT to Try\n- Simple ensemble (already tried - one source dominates)\n- Short optimization runs (local optimum is too tight)\n- fix_direction post-processing (causes precision loss and overlaps)\n- Micro-optimizations on pre-optimized submission\n- Running pre-compiled binaries with different parameters\n\n## Technical Notes\n- Use high-precision Decimal arithmetic to avoid floating-point errors\n- Validate for overlaps before submitting (Kaggle rejects overlapping trees)\n- C++ optimizers use OpenMP for parallelization (check available threads with `nproc`)\n- Pre-optimized files available in `/home/nonroot/snapshots/santa-2025/21116303805/code/preoptimized/`\n\n## Key Insight\nThe gap of ~1.8 points requires fundamentally different approaches, not micro-optimization. The pre-optimized submission is already at a very tight local optimum. To beat the target, we need:\n1. **Lattice/tessellation approach** for large N (fundamentally different algorithm)\n2. **Focus on high-contribution small N values** (N=1 alone contributes 0.66!)\n3. **Implement novel algorithms from scratch** (not just run binaries)\n4. **Fresh starting configurations** to escape local optima\n\n## Mathematical Lower Bound Consideration\nFor a single tree (N=1), the minimum bounding box is achieved when the tree is rotated to minimize the diagonal. The current N=1 side of 0.813 may already be near optimal, but verify this.\n\nFor large N, the theoretical packing density approaches a limit based on the tree's area. The tree area is approximately 0.35 square units, so for N trees, the minimum possible bounding box area is roughly N * 0.35 / packing_efficiency.\n\n## Validation Checklist\n1. No overlapping trees (use has_overlap function)\n2. All coordinates within [-100, 100]\n3. All 200 configurations present (20100 rows)\n4. Values prefixed with 's' in submission\n",

      "feedback": "## What I Understood\n\nThe junior researcher has completed the baseline experiment (exp_000), establishing a starting point using a pre-optimized submission from snapshots. The baseline score is 70.676102, and the target to beat is 68.889699 - a gap of ~1.79 points. This is a 2D polygon packing optimization problem where Christmas tree shapes (15-vertex polygons) must be packed into the smallest square bounding box for N=1 to 200 trees. The scoring formula is \u03a3(s_n\u00b2/n), so small N values contribute disproportionately to the total score.\n\n## Technical Execution Assessment\n\n**Validation**: The baseline score calculation is sound. The notebook correctly:\n- Loads the pre-optimized submission (20100 rows as expected)\n- Parses the 's'-prefixed values correctly\n- Computes bounding boxes using Shapely polygons\n- Calculates the total score using the correct formula (s\u00b2/n summed over N=1 to 200)\n\n**Leakage Risk**: Not applicable for this optimization problem - there's no train/test split.\n\n**Score Integrity**: Verified in notebook output - 70.676102 matches the metrics.json file.\n\n**Code Quality**: Clean implementation with proper ChristmasTree class and scoring functions. The submission was correctly copied to /home/submission/submission.csv.\n\nVerdict: **TRUSTWORTHY** - The baseline is correctly established and the score calculation is verified.\n\n## Strategic Assessment\n\n**Approach Fit**: The baseline is appropriate as a starting point. The strategy document correctly identifies that:\n1. Small N values (1-15) contribute disproportionately to the score\n2. N=1 alone contributes 0.66 points (the highest single contributor)\n3. The pre-optimized submission is at a tight local optimum\n\n**Effort Allocation**: The strategy document outlines the right priorities:\n- **HIGH PRIORITY**: Small N optimization (N=1 to N=10) - these have the highest score contribution\n- **HIGH PRIORITY**: Lattice/tessellation approach for large N (N >= 58)\n- **REQUIRED**: Implement novel algorithms from scratch (no pre-compiled binaries)\n\n**Assumptions Being Made**:\n1. The pre-optimized submission is near-optimal for most N values\n2. The gap of ~1.79 points requires fundamentally different approaches\n3. Small N values offer the most improvement potential\n\n**Blind Spots & Opportunities**:\n\n1. **N=1 Optimization is CRITICAL**: The current N=1 has side=0.813, contributing 0.66 to the score. For a single tree, the optimal rotation minimizes the bounding box diagonal. The tree has width 0.7 and height 1.0, so at 0\u00b0 rotation the bounding box is 0.7 \u00d7 1.0. At 45\u00b0 rotation, the diagonal becomes the limiting factor. The OPTIMAL angle for N=1 should be analytically computable - this is a quick win worth pursuing immediately.\n\n2. **Score Breakdown Analysis**: Looking at the top contributors:\n   - N=1: 0.6612 (side=0.813)\n   - N=2: 0.4508 (side=0.950)\n   - N=3: 0.4347 (side=1.142)\n   - N=4: 0.4165 (side=1.291)\n   - N=5: 0.4168 (side=1.444)\n   \n   The top 5 N values contribute ~2.37 points. If we could reduce each by even 5%, that's ~0.12 points saved.\n\n3. **Theoretical Lower Bounds**: For N=1, the minimum bounding box for a 15-vertex polygon can be computed exactly using rotating calipers algorithm. This should be done to understand how close the current solution is to optimal.\n\n4. **Public Kernels**: The research shows sophisticated C++ optimizers (bbox3.cpp, tree_packer_v21.cpp) using:\n   - Complex number vector coordination\n   - Fluid dynamics simulation\n   - Hinge pivot mechanisms\n   - Aggressive overlap repair with separation vectors\n   \n   These are highly optimized. To beat them, we need either:\n   a) Much longer compute time\n   b) Fundamentally different algorithmic approaches (lattice packing)\n   c) Focus on specific N values where they may not be optimal\n\n**Trajectory**: This is the starting point. The strategy is well-defined. The key is to execute on the high-priority items rather than trying to micro-optimize the existing solution.\n\n## What's Working\n\n1. **Clear problem understanding**: The strategy document correctly identifies the scoring formula and its implications\n2. **Correct baseline establishment**: Score verified, submission format correct\n3. **Good prioritization**: Focus on small N values and novel algorithms is the right approach\n4. **Research done**: Public kernels and academic techniques have been reviewed\n\n## Key Concerns\n\n1. **Observation**: No actual optimization has been attempted yet - only baseline established\n   **Why it matters**: We need to start making progress toward the target\n   **Suggestion**: Immediately implement N=1 optimization using exhaustive angle search (0\u00b0 to 360\u00b0 in 0.01\u00b0 increments) - this is computationally trivial and could yield quick gains\n\n2. **Observation**: The strategy forbids using pre-compiled binaries, but the gap is 1.79 points\n   **Why it matters**: This is a significant gap that requires substantial algorithmic innovation\n   **Suggestion**: Focus first on the \"low-hanging fruit\" - small N values where exhaustive/analytical solutions are feasible, then tackle larger N with lattice approaches\n\n3. **Observation**: No submission has been made to Kaggle yet (0/100 used)\n   **Why it matters**: We don't know if the local score matches the leaderboard score\n   **Suggestion**: Submit the baseline to verify score alignment before investing in optimizations\n\n## Top Priority for Next Experiment\n\n**IMMEDIATE ACTION: Optimize N=1 through N=5 using exhaustive/analytical methods**\n\nFor N=1:\n- Implement rotating calipers or exhaustive angle search to find the EXACT optimal rotation\n- The tree polygon is fixed, so this is a 1D optimization problem (just angle)\n- Expected improvement: potentially 0.01-0.05 points if current angle isn't optimal\n\nFor N=2 and N=3:\n- These are still tractable for exhaustive search over angle combinations\n- Use grid search over (angle1, angle2, relative_position) space\n- Can be parallelized easily\n\nThis is the highest-leverage first step because:\n1. It's computationally feasible (small search space)\n2. Small N values have the highest score contribution\n3. It establishes whether the pre-optimized solution is actually optimal for these cases\n4. Success here provides confidence and insights for larger N\n\n**Secondary Priority**: Submit baseline to Kaggle to verify local score matches LB score.\n",
