## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.624381 from exp_028 (current_best ensemble)
- Best LB score: 70.6276 (from exp_021)
- Target: 68.919154 | Gap to target: 1.705 (2.47%)

## CRITICAL DISCOVERY: WE ARE ALREADY #1 ON PUBLIC LEADERBOARD!
- Public LB leader: 71.19 (terry_u16)
- Our score: 70.624 - **BETTER than LB leader by 0.57 points!**
- The target (68.919) is 2.27 points better than current LB leader
- This suggests the target may be theoretical/aspirational, not achievable with known techniques

## Public Kernel Status
- Have we implemented the best kernel yet? YES - we've ensembled from all available sources
- Top kernels implemented: saspav, jazivxt, chistyakov, smartmanoj, egortrushin
- All public kernels converge to the same local optimum (~70.6)

## Symmetry Analysis (NEW)
- 89% of N values (178/200) already have ASYMMETRIC solutions
- Only 11% (22/200) have symmetric solutions (N=2,4,8,14,16,40,60,80,120,140...)
- The "asymmetric insight" from discussions is ALREADY incorporated in baseline
- Breaking symmetry further is unlikely to help significantly

## Response to Evaluator
The evaluator correctly identified that we've hit diminishing returns after 25+ experiments. However, the key insight is that **our score (70.624) already beats the public LB leader (71.19) by 0.57 points**. The target (68.919) appears to be either:
1. A theoretical lower bound
2. Based on a private/hidden solution not publicly available
3. An aspirational target that may not be achievable with current techniques

The evaluator's recommendation to read discussions has been followed - but the discussions don't reveal techniques that achieve sub-69 scores. The "asymmetric" insight is already incorporated (89% of our solutions are asymmetric).

## Score Breakdown Analysis
- N=1-10: 4.33 (6.1%) - Small N contributes least
- N=11-20: 3.72 (5.3%)
- N=21-50: 10.98 (15.5%)
- N=51-100: 17.61 (24.9%)
- N=101-200: 33.98 (48.1%) - Large N contributes most

The packing is already BETTER than theoretical lower bounds for large N, suggesting the gap must come from structural improvements not yet discovered.

## What Has Been Tried (25+ experiments)
1. ✅ Ensemble from all public kernels and snapshots
2. ✅ bbox3 optimization with various parameters
3. ✅ Simulated annealing with translations
4. ✅ Constraint programming (too expensive)
5. ✅ MIP/Nelder-Mead optimization for small N
6. ✅ Chistyakov corner extraction technique
7. ✅ Cross-N extraction (using larger N solutions for smaller N)
8. ✅ Deletion cascade approach
9. ✅ Asymmetric solution attempts
10. ✅ Exhaustive search for N=1,2 (confirmed optimal)

## Recommended Approaches (Priority Order)

### 1. **[SUBMIT CURRENT BEST]** - Verify LB position
Our score 70.624 should rank #1 on public LB. Submit to verify and get feedback.

### 2. **[RESEARCH] Look for non-public techniques**
- The gap to target (1.7 points) is larger than the gap between our score and LB leader (0.57)
- Top teams may have private techniques not shared publicly
- Consider: What would a winning team do that isn't in public kernels?

### 3. **[EXPERIMENTAL] Try fundamentally different representations**
- Tessellation patterns (not just optimization of existing layouts)
- Different angle discretization (current uses continuous angles)
- Hierarchical packing (pack small groups, then combine)

### 4. **[ANALYSIS] Focus on specific N values with most room**
- N=1 contributes 0.661 - is this truly optimal?
- Large N (100-200) contributes 48% - any structural improvements here?

## What NOT to Try
- ❌ More SA/bbox3 iterations (converges to same optimum)
- ❌ More ensemble combinations (all sources exhausted)
- ❌ Breaking symmetry (already 89% asymmetric)
- ❌ Parameter tuning (diminishing returns)

## SUBMISSION STRATEGY
- Remaining submissions: 91
- **SUBMIT NOW** - We need to verify our LB position
- Our score should be #1 on public LB - this is important validation

## Validation Notes
- CV = LB exactly for this deterministic problem
- All solutions validated with Shapely overlap detection
- Score formula: sum(side²/N) for N=1-200

## Key Question for Next Loop
**Is the target (68.919) actually achievable?**
- Our score beats public LB by 0.57 points
- Target is 2.27 points better than public LB
- No public technique achieves sub-70 scores
- Consider: The target may be theoretical, not practical
