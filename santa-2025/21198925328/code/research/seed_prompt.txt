## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.624381 from exp_027/028 (deletion cascade + ensemble)
- Best LB score: 70.6276 (exp_021)
- Target: 68.919154 | Gap to target: 1.705 (2.47%)
- Submissions used: 9/100 (91 remaining - ABUNDANT!)

## CV-LB Relationship Analysis
- CV = LB exactly for this deterministic optimization problem
- All 9 submissions confirm perfect alignment
- No distribution shift - pure optimization problem

## Response to Evaluator
The evaluator correctly identified that after 25+ experiments, we're stuck at a local optimum. All optimization approaches (SA, bbox3, Nelder-Mead, basin hopping, cross-N extraction, deletion cascade) converge to the same ~70.62 score. The evaluator's key recommendations:

1. **Read competition discussions** - AGREED. The discussions about asymmetric solutions (666880) and symmetric optimal solutions (664824) likely contain the key insight. However, FetchDiscussion returns "not found" for these IDs.

2. **Analyze score distribution by N** - DONE. Small N (1-10) contribute most per-N score. N=1 has efficiency 0.37 (worst), meaning most room for improvement.

3. **Try different structural basins** - AGREED. This is the key insight. We need to find DIFFERENT initial configurations, not optimize the current one.

## Key Insight from Research
**The gap between public best (~70.99) and top private (~69.03) is closed with hand-crafted tweaks and bespoke search.**

This means:
- The public baselines are at a LOCAL optimum
- Top teams found DIFFERENT structural basins with better global optima
- The techniques are NOT public - they're custom implementations

## What Has Been Exhausted (DO NOT REPEAT)
- ❌ SA/bbox3 optimization (converges to same optimum)
- ❌ Ensemble from public sources (all at same optimum)
- ❌ Cross-N extraction (no improvements found)
- ❌ Deletion cascade (only 0.00004 improvement)
- ❌ MIP/Nelder-Mead for small N (baseline is optimal)
- ❌ Random restart SA (random configs are worse)
- ❌ Asymmetric perturbations of baseline (makes score worse)

## Recommended Approaches (Priority Order)

### 1. **[HIGHEST PRIORITY] Implement GFPack++ or Similar Learning-Based Packer**
Research mentions "GFPack++ builds an attention-based encoder for geometry and relational features, then learns a continuous gradient field that directly drives polygons toward collision-free, high-density placements."

This is fundamentally different from SA/local search - it learns a placement policy.

**Action:**
```python
# Implement a simple gradient-field approach:
# 1. For each tree, compute gradient toward center of mass
# 2. Move trees along gradient while avoiding overlaps
# 3. Use attention mechanism to weight tree interactions
```

### 2. **[HIGH PRIORITY] Crystalline/Tessellation Patterns**
Research mentions "crystallography-inspired lattice packing" and "17 plane-group symmetries". The key insight is that DIFFERENT lattice patterns may have better optima.

**Action:**
```python
# Try different tessellation patterns:
# - p4mm (square lattice with mirrors)
# - p6mm (hexagonal lattice)
# - p2 (oblique lattice)
# For each pattern, optimize within that structural constraint
```

### 3. **[HIGH PRIORITY] Chebyshev Distance Square Packing**
Research mentions "Chebyshev distance square packing" as a technique for sub-69 scores.

**Action:**
```python
# Implement Chebyshev (L∞) distance-based placement:
# 1. Place trees to minimize max(|dx|, |dy|) between any pair
# 2. This naturally creates square-like arrangements
# 3. Different from Euclidean distance optimization
```

### 4. **[MEDIUM PRIORITY] Scan-Line Linear Packing**
Research mentions "scan-line linear packing" - treating the layout as 1D scanlines.

**Action:**
```python
# Implement scan-line approach:
# 1. Discretize trees into horizontal line segments
# 2. Pack scanlines using 1D bin-packing (first-fit decreasing)
# 3. This may find different structural arrangements
```

### 5. **[EXPERIMENTAL] Manual Optimization for Small N**
The interactive editor exists. For N=1-10, manual optimization might find better configurations.

**Action:**
- Visualize current solutions for N=1-10
- Identify if any trees can be repositioned
- Test manual adjustments

## SUBMISSION STRATEGY
- **SUBMIT EVERY EXPERIMENT** - we have 91 submissions remaining
- LB feedback is free information
- Even if score doesn't improve, we learn what doesn't work

## What NOT to Try
- ❌ More SA iterations (exhausted)
- ❌ Different SA parameters (exhausted)
- ❌ Ensemble from same sources (exhausted)
- ❌ Cross-N extraction (exhausted)
- ❌ Random perturbations (makes score worse)

## Validation Notes
- CV = LB exactly (deterministic problem)
- Use Shapely for overlap detection
- Score formula: sum(S²/N) for N=1-200

## CRITICAL: The Target IS Achievable
- Top private LB is ~69.03 (per research)
- Our score is 70.62
- Gap is 1.6 points (2.3%)
- This gap is closed with DIFFERENT structural approaches, not more optimization

**NEXT EXPERIMENT:** Implement one of the fundamentally different approaches above. Start with GFPack++ or Chebyshev distance packing.
