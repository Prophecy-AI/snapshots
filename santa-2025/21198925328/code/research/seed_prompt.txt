## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.624381 from exp_027 (deletion cascade)

- Target: 68.919154 | Gap to target: 1.705 (2.42%)

## Response to Evaluator

The evaluator correctly identified that after 25+ experiments, we've hit diminishing returns. This loop confirmed:

1. **MIP/CP for small N failed**: Nelder-Mead from multiple random starts converges to the same local optimum. The baseline is OPTIMAL for small N (N=3-6).

2. **Deletion cascade found tiny improvement**: The chistyakov "rebuild from corners" technique found only 0.000043 improvement (N=87).

3. **Full snapshot ensemble**: Ensembling ALL 62 valid snapshots improved score by 0.001494 (70.625918 → 70.624424).

4. **Tessellation patterns don't beat baseline**: Simple alternating/hexagonal/diagonal patterns are worse than the optimized baseline.

**KEY INSIGHT**: The baseline is at a STRONG LOCAL OPTIMUM. All optimization approaches converge to the same basin. The target (68.919) requires a fundamentally different structural approach that hasn't been discovered yet.

## What We've Learned

1. **Score breakdown by N range**:
   - N=1-10: 6.1% of total score (highest per-tree contribution)
   - N=11-50: 20.8%
   - N=51-100: 24.9%
   - N=101-150: 24.3%
   - N=151-200: 23.8%

2. **Angle patterns**: Solution uses primarily 4 angles (68°, 248°, 338°, 158°) - a tessellation pattern.

3. **Invalid snapshots have better scores**: Snapshot 21145966992 has score 70.572798 (0.053 better) but has 72 overlapping N values. If we could repair these overlaps, we'd gain significant improvement.

4. **Medium article insight**: Top teams use different strategies for different N ranges:
   - N < 58: Simulated Annealing for chaotic packings
   - N > 58: "Crystalline Packing" (regular geometric lattices)

## Recommended Approaches (Priority Order)

### 1. **[IMMEDIATE] SUBMIT exp_027**
We have 91 submissions remaining. Submit to verify our LB position and get feedback.

### 2. **[HIGH PRIORITY] Repair Invalid Snapshots**
Snapshot 21145966992 has score 70.572798 with 72 overlaps. If we can repair these:
- Total potential improvement: 0.093 points
- Key N values: N=5 (0.023), N=2 (0.013), N=56 (0.011)

Approach:
- For each invalid N, try small perturbations to remove overlaps
- Use SA with overlap penalty to find valid configurations
- Accept slightly worse score if it removes overlaps

### 3. **[HIGH PRIORITY] Asymmetric Solutions for Specific N**
The "Why the winning solutions will be Asymmetric" discussion (34 votes) suggests asymmetric layouts help for certain N values. Previous attempt (exp_020) failed because it started from scratch.

New approach:
- Start from current best solution
- For each N, try breaking symmetry by perturbing ONE tree
- Use local search to optimize the asymmetric configuration
- Focus on N values with highest score contribution

### 4. **[MEDIUM PRIORITY] Different Tessellation Angles**
Current solution uses 68°/248°/338°/158° pattern. Try:
- 45°/225°/135°/315° (diagonal pattern)
- 60°/240°/120°/300° (hexagonal pattern)
- Optimize angles per-N rather than globally

### 5. **[EXPERIMENTAL] Constructive Heuristics**
Instead of optimizing existing solutions, try building from scratch:
- Greedy bottom-left placement
- Beam search with multiple candidates
- Start with optimal small N and grow

## What NOT to Try
- ❌ More SA/bbox3 iterations (converges to same optimum)
- ❌ More snapshot ensembling (all 62 snapshots already used)
- ❌ Nelder-Mead/gradient descent (gradient is zero at optimum)
- ❌ Random restarts (all converge to same basin)
- ❌ Simple tessellation patterns (worse than baseline)

## Validation Notes
- CV = LB exactly for this deterministic problem
- All solutions validated with Shapely overlap detection
- Score formula: sum of (side²/N) for N=1-200

## SUBMISSION STRATEGY
- Remaining submissions: 91
- **SUBMIT exp_027** - our best score (70.624381)
- Continue experimenting with repair/asymmetric approaches

## Critical Gap Analysis

The gap to target is 1.705 points (2.42%). This requires:
- Average side length reduction of 1.2% per N
- OR significant improvements on high-impact N values

The invalid snapshot 21145966992 shows that scores below 70.6 ARE achievable - the challenge is making them valid. Focus on repairing invalid solutions rather than optimizing valid ones.
