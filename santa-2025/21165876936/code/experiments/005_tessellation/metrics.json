  "notes": "Tessellation approach (grid patterns with optimized spacing) found 0 improvements for any rectangular N value. Tested 23 rectangular N values with 6 different seed configurations. The baseline solutions are already better than any tessellation pattern we could generate. This confirms the public solutions are at a very tight optimum."
