  "notes": "Exhaustive search for N=2 (30M+ configs) and beam search for N=3 found WORSE scores than baseline. N=2: baseline 0.4508 vs exhaustive 0.4765. N=3: baseline 0.4347 vs beam 0.5208. The baseline solutions are already highly optimized for small N values. This confirms the public solutions are at a very tight optimum that cannot be beaten by exhaustive search, SA, GA, tessellation, or any other approach we've tried."
