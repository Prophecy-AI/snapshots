A broad survey of the field notes that genetic algorithms (GAs) are the work\u2011horse technique, often combined with problem\u2011specific operators or a linear\u2011programming (LP) sub\u2011solver to handle geometric constraints\u202f([Frontiers](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmech.2022.966691/full)).  Variants such as a GA\u2011LP hybrid have been shown to outperform pure GA or pure LP on benchmark strip\u2011packing instances\u202f([MDPI](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/13/22/12474)).  Other meta\u2011heuristics that repeatedly appear in the literature include **simulated annealing, tabu search, ant\u2011colony optimisation and particle\u2011swarm optimisation**, each adapted to the irregular\u2011shape context\u202f([Springer](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1012590107280)).
