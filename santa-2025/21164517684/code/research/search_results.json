An alternative NFP formulation using **line\u2011and\u2011arc NFPs** also yields tight collision detection for highly irregular shapes\u202f([ideas.repec.org](https://ideas.repec.org/a/inm/oropre/v58y2010i4-part-1p948-970.html)).\n\nBeyond deterministic heuristics, **meta\u2011heuristic approaches** dominate state\u2011of\u2011the\u2011art results for minimizing the bounding\u2011box area.  **Genetic algorithms (GAs)** combined with local search have been shown to outperform pure local\u2011search methods on heterogeneous bin sets, exploring both piece ordering and continuous rotation without restricting orientations\u202f([eprints.soton.ac.uk](https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/415314)).

An efficient 2D irregular packing algorithm can effectively improve material utilization and reduce processing costs. The reduction in material consumption will also have a beneficial impact on the environment ([Ke et al., 2020](#B76)). Therefore, research of the packing problem is of great significance for technology and social interest.\nThe 2D packing problem is a type of combinatorial optimization problems to locate parts with different shapes compactly in one or more master sheet material to minimize the occupied space or maximize the utilization of the material. The 2D packing problem is currently recognized as a NP problem, which is mainly solved by heuristic algorithms. In recent years, many scholars have conducted research on 2D irregular packing problems with a verity of solutions.\nThere exists a number of review articles on packing and cutting problems. We have summarized the main review literature in the field of 2D packing and cutting as shown in[Table 1](#T1). Brown ([Brown, 1971](#B17)) introduced an optimum packing and depletion problem with optimization of space and resource usage. Harvey ([Salkin and De Kluyver, 1975](#B116)) surveyed the application of mathematical optimization models such as linear programming to the knapsack problem. Bruce ([Golden, 1976](#B50)) surveyed various approaches to the cutting stock problem. Hinxman ([Hinxman, 1980](#B65)) surveyed the trim-loss and assortment problems, this research paid more attention to cutting and packaging problems in practical applications, and did not mention much about theoretical methods. Garey and Coffman ([Garey and Johnson, 1981](#B47);[Coffman et al., 1984](#B27)) surveyed the approximation algorithms for bin packing problems. Israni ([Israni and Sanders, 1982](#B72)) reviewed the 2D cutting stock problem including almost all 2D packaging problems. The author also proposed a rectangular layout method. Sarin ([Sarin, 1983](#B118)) reviewed methodologies and literature to solve 2D stock cutting problems and introduced an interactive optimization procedure for a general 2D stock cutting problem. Dyckhoff ([Dyckhoff et al., 1985](#B38)) described a trim loss and related problems and categorized them briefly. Dudzi&#x00144;ski ([Dudzi&#x00144;ski and Walukiewicz, 1987](#B36)) summarized the exact methods for knapsack problems, such as linear programming. Matthias ([Rode and Rosenberg, 1987](#B114)) analyzed the algorithm for the trim-loss problems. Haessler ([Haessler and Sweeney, 1991](#B59)) reviewed the solution process of cutting stock problems, including placement algorithm and sequence optimization algorithm. Dowsland ([Dowsland and Dowsland, 1992](#B34)) reviewed the application of operations research methods to the packing problem and summarized some exact heuristics. Sweeney ([Sweeney and Paternoster, 1992](#B128)) categorized cutting and packing problems and made application-oriented research records. Cheng ([Cheng et al., 1994](#B22)) discussed 2D cutting stock problems and their application cases including the pallet loading problem and VLSI placement problem. With the gradual deepening of research on 2D layout problems, typology becomes a common research topic. 2D regular and irregular layout problems are clearly distinguished in practical applications and theoretical methods. Dowsland ([Dowsland and Dowsland, 1995](#B29)) gave a special review of the 2D irregular nesting problem for the first time. Mavridou ([Mavridou and Pardalos, 1997](#B98)) summarized applications of the genetic algorithm and simulated annealing algorithm in the optimization of facility layout problems. Dyckhoff ([Dyckhoff, 1990](#B37)) made a typology of the cutting and packing problems in detail, and W&#x000e4;scher ([W&#x000e4;scher et al., 2007](#B135)) improved the typology later. Hopper ([Hopper and Turton, 1999](#B67);[Hopper and Turton, 2001a](#B68);[Hopper and Turton, 2001b](#B69)) investigated the application of meta-heuristic and heuristic algorithms in 2D and 3D packing problems. Lodi ([Lodi et al., 2002a](#B90);[Lodi et al., 2002b](#B91)) reviewed algorithms proposed in the 1990s of 2D packing problems. Bennell et al. ([Bennell and Oliveira, 2008](#B10);[Bennell and Oliveira, 2009](#B9)) discussed 2D irregular packing problems and related geometric problems. Leao ([Leao et al., 2020](#B81)) introduced the mathematical models in the 2D irregular packing problem.\nTABLE 1\n[![www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/966691/fmech-08-966691-HTML/image_m/fmech-08-966691-t001.jpg)](https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/966691/fmech-08-966691-HTML/image_m/fmech-08-966691-t001.jpg)\n**TABLE 1**.

The improved algorithm can cope with complex cases and is given an implementation in detail. The proposed concept of a touching group can simplify the judging process when recognizing the potential translation vector for an orbital polygon. In addition, the generation of the no-fit polygon only involves three main steps based on the proposed concept. The proposed algorithm has a mechanism that searches other start positions to generate a complete no-fit polygon for handling complex cases. To improve the efficiency, many acceleration strategies have been proposed, such as point exclusion strategy and point inclusion test. The robust and efficient performance of the algorithm is tested by well-known benchmark instances and degenerate and complex cases, such as holes, interlocking concavities and jigsaw-type pieces. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can produce complete no-fit polygons for complex cases, and acceleration strategies can reduce the creation time of no-fit polygon on benchmark instances by more than sixteen percent on average.\nKeywords:\n[no-fit polygon](https://www.mdpi.com/search?q=no-fit+polygon);[irregular packing problem](https://www.mdpi.com/search?q=irregular+packing+problem);[sliding algorithm](https://www.mdpi.com/search?q=sliding+algorithm);[cutting](https://www.mdpi.com/search?q=cutting);[configuration space obstacle](https://www.mdpi.com/search?q=configuration+space+obstacle)\nMSC:\n90; 68; 51\n## 1. Introduction\nIn the field of cutting and packing problems, there is a kind of problem known as the two-dimensional (2D) irregular packing problem or the nesting problem. It is commonly encountered in many industries and applications, such as metal sheet cutting [1,2], leather [3], clothing [4], paper [5] and spatial arrangement [6]. Through excellent algorithms to optimize the packing, even a one percent increase in the material utilization rate will save lots of resource costs for enterprises and generate huge economic benefits for the whole society. Despite the many practical applications and benefits, the problem has received relatively little attention in the literature when compared to the regular packing problem [7,8,9]. One of the main reasons is that researchers have to deal with the geometry problem, which is the first obstacle they encounter. This means that satisfying the constraint of having all irregular pieces without overlapping is much harder than regular pieces.\nDirect trigonometry involving line intersection and point inclusion testing is the classic method to identify the positional relationship between two polygons. However, the optimization algorithms will become inefficient when it adopts this method, which results in the slightly poor performance of the algorithms. The alternative used in irregular packing problems is the no-fit polygon (NFP), which is also used in the field of engineering and robot motion planning and the aircraft parking stand allocation problem [10]. The no-fit polygon facilitates the research of irregular packing problems [11,12,13,14]. It is an increasingly popular option since it is more efficient than direct trigonometry, particularly when using an iterative search. Determining whether polygons overlap, touch, or are separated only needs to conduct a simple test to identify whether the reference point is inside the NFP. Essentially, the no-fit polygon describes the region in which two polygons intersect. The computational efficiency gained by utilizing this method is very attractive. Hence, it is important to develop an algorithm for creating NFP for the research of irregular packing problems. The algorithm can enrich the application in 2D geometrical computer software.\nHowever, there are few published works on algorithms for generating NFP. Note the fact that developing a robust geometry library is still needed, and this task is very time-consuming and difficult. Furthermore, it is difficult to develop a robust NFP generator because of the complexity of irregular piece shapes. Thus, we propose an improved sliding algorithm for the generation of NFP and give an implementation in detail of our algorithm. Such an algorithm can become good preparation for applying more strategies to solve the irregular packing problem. For instance, in the work published by Costa et al. [15], if the NFP algorithm is efficient, it can directly calculate the new merged piece instead of approximating by one already computed because of this time-consuming operation. In other words, the more efficient the algorithm is, the better.\nThe proposed algorithm only involves two simple geometric stages. The first is generating the external NFP between two polygons, which includes three main steps: finding the touching group, determining the translation vector from all touching groups and computing the translation distance. The second stage is searching on the unvisited edges to determine whether there is a feasible starting point that can be found. If the starting point is available, then return to the first stage to generate the NFP.\nThe contributions of this study are:\n* To address the problem of the efficient and robust creation of the no-fit polygon;\n* To propose an improved sliding algorithm and provide a detailed implementation;\n* To present the concept of touching group, resulting in the number of cases to consider being reduced by half when determining the feasible translation vector;\n* To develop many acceleration strategies to improve the algorithm\u2019s efficiency, such as the point exclusion strategy, the right side test, and the point inclusion test;\n* To assess the performance of the proposed alg...",

We also discuss the effect of different groups of stock sheet sizes.\n\nText\n\n**ICCL17\\_paper\\_43**\n**\\- Accepted Manuscript**\n\n[Download](https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/415314/1/ICCL17_paper_43.pdf) (729kB)\n\n## More information\n\ne-pub ahead of print date: October 2017\n\nPublished date: October 2017\n\nKeywords:\nIrregular shapes, Multiple bin size bin packing, Jostle Algorithm\n\n## Identifiers\n\nLocal EPrints ID: 415314\n\nURI: http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/id/eprint/415314\n\nDOI: [doi:10.1007/978-3-319-68496](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-68496)\n\nPURE UUID: e654d0b7-af4b-43c1-86e1-635828997331\n\nORCID for Antonio Martinez Sykora: [orcid.org/0000-0002-2435-3113](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2435-3113)\n\n## Catalogue record\n\nDate deposited: 07 Nov 2017 17:30\n\nLast modified: 16 Mar 2024 05:53\n\n## Export record\n\nASCII CitationAtomBibTeXData Cite XMLDublin CoreDublin CoreEP3 XMLEndNoteHTML CitationHTML CitationHTML ListJSONMETSMODSMPEG-21 DIDLOpenURL ContextObjectOpenURL ContextObject in SpanRDF+N-TriplesRDF+N3RDF+XMLRIOXX2 XMLReferReference ManagerSimple Metadata\n\n## Altmetrics\n\n## Share this record\n\n[Share this on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/415314/) [Share this on Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Efficient%20local%20search%20heuristics%20for%20packing%20irregular%20shapes%20in%20two%2Ddimensional%20heterogeneous%20bins+https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/415314/) [Share this on Weibo](http://service.weibo.com/share/share.php?url=Efficient%20local%20search%20heuristics%20for%20packing%20irregular%20shapes%20in%20two%2Ddimensional%20heterogeneous%20bins+https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/415314/)\n\n## Contributors\n\nAuthor:Ranga, Prasad Abeysooriya\n\nAuthor:Julia Bennell\n\nAuthor: [Antonio Martinez Sykora](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/business-school/about/staff/am1u10.page)\n\nEditor:Tolga Bektas\n\nEditor:Stefano Coniglio\n\nEditor:Antonio Martinez-Sykora\n\nEditor:Stefan Boss\n\n## Download statistics\n\nDownloads from ePrints over the past year.

The container has a fixed width, while its length can change so that all items are placed in it. The objective is to find a layout of the set of polygons that minimizes the length of the container. The proposed algorithm constructively creates layouts from an ordered list of items and a placement heuristic. The placement determines the collision free region (represents the set of translations to create a feasible layout) for the item to be placed. It is shown that the collision free region must be calculated using non-regularized Boolean operations, as contours of no-fit polygons should be ignored. The proposed algorithm to solve the placement problem has two levels, in the internal level the container has fixed dimensions, and the external level reduces or increases the variable dimension. The placement heuristic searches for degenerated vertices and edges as they represent local maximum compaction. Computational comparisons on benchmark problems show that the proposed algorithm generated highly competitive solutions. Moreover, our algorithm updated some best known results.\n...Read more\n## Key takeaways\n![sparkles](https://a.academia-assets.com/images/icons/sparkle.svg)\nAI\n1.

This problem is approached with an heuristic based on simulated annealing. Traditional &quot;external penalization&quot; techniques are avoided through the application of the no-fit polygon, that determinates the collision-free region for each small item before its placement. The simulated annealing controls: the rotation applied and the placement of the small item. For each non-placed small item, a limited depth binary search is performed to find a scale factor that when applied to the small item, would allow it to be fitted in the large object. Three possibilities to define the sequence on which the small items are placed are studied: larger-first, random permutation and weight sorted. The proposed algorithm is suited for non-convex small items and large objects.\ndownloadDownload free PDF[View PDFchevron\\_right](https://www.academia.edu/58884840/Rotational_Placement_of_Irregular_Polygons_over_Containers_with_Fixed_Dimensions_using_Simulated_Annealing_and_No_Fit_Polygons)\n[An effective heuristic for the two-dimensional irregular bin packing problem](https://www.academia.edu/69875946/An_effective_heuristic_for_the_two_dimensional_irregular_bin_packing_problem)\n[Gabriela Ochoa](https://independent.academia.edu/GabrielaOchoa10)\nAnnals of Operations Research, 2013\nThis paper proposes an adaptation, to the two-dimensional irregular bin packing problem of the Djang and Finch heuristic (DJD), originally designed for the one-dimensional bin packing problem. In the two-dimensional case, not only is it the case that the piece&#39;s size is important but its shape also has a significant influence. Therefore, DJD as a selection heuristic has to be paired with a placement heuristic to completely construct a solution to the underlying packing problem. A successful adaptation of the DJD requires a routine to reduce computational costs, which is also proposed and successfully tested in this paper. Results, on a wide variety of instance types with convex polygons, are found to be significantly better than those produced by more conventional selection heuristics.\ndownloadDownload free PDF[View PDFchevron\\_right](https://www.academia.edu/69875946/An_effective_heuristic_for_the_two_dimensional_irregular_bin_packing_problem)\n[Irregular rotational placement of shapes over non-convex containers with fixed dimensions](https://www.academia.edu/104990568/Irregular_rotational_placement_of_shapes_over_non_convex_containers_with_fixed_dimensions)\n[Thiago de Castro Martins](https://independent.academia.edu/ThiagodeCastroMartins)\n8th IFAC International Workshop on Intelligent Manufacturing Systems, 2007, 2007\nThis work deals with the problem of minimize the waste of space that occurs on a placement of a set of bi-dimensional items inside a bi-dimensional container with fixed dimensions.

The local search algorithm is used to minimize the overlap on the basis of the neighborhoods mentioned above and the unconstrained[nonlinear programming](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/nonlinear-programming)model is adopted to further minimize the overlap during the search process.

The results of standard test instances indicate that when compared with other existing algorithms, the presented algorithm does not only show some signs of competitive power but also updates several best known results.\n## Introduction\nThe irregular strip packing problem, also known as the nesting problem, has a wide area of applications. Given a set of irregular shapes and a rectangular strip with a fixed width and an arbitrary length, the target of the two-dimensional irregular strip packing problem is to place all shapes within the strip such that the length of the strip is minimized and the irregular shapes do not overlap. A classic example application is clothing industry. Several pieces of clothes will be cut from a roll of fabric and the objective is to minimize the waste of fabric. The fabric has a fixed width and its length can be generally assumed infinite; so the problem is to minimize the length required for producing the specified number of irregular shapes.\nThe irregular strip packing problem is a NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem [1]. Numerous papers on nesting problem have been published since the first paper by Art [2]. Meta-heuristics are often used to solve this problem. Hopper and Turton [3] reviewed these methods, and a summary of geometric methods was published by Bennell and Oliveira [4]. As research progressed, further breakthroughs in algorithms for this problem have achieved in recent years. When compared with the previous years, these solutions have markedly improved the effect and speed of nesting results. The typical methods include Burke et al. [5], Gomes and Oliveira [6], Egeblad et al. [7], Imamichi et al. [8], etc.\nAlbano and Sapuppo [9] proposed an algorithm that places each shape at the bottom-left position, and the sequence of places is obtained by tree search. Jakobs [10] proposed a two-stage solution which first generates the rectangular enclosure of each irregular shape, and then finds the placement for these enclosures through a genetic algorithm. Secondly, a shrinking algorithm moves the shapes to another one as close as possible using the idea of the bottom-left heuristic. Gomes and Oliveira [11] based on bottom-left heuristic and find a good placement by exchanging two shapes in the layout. Dowsland et al. [12] developed a compact algorithm to improve the bottom-left heuristic algorithm. The algorithm first gets the initial placement by the bottom-left heuristic, and then uses a shaking process to compact the placement. Burke et al. [5] presented a new bottom-left heuristic algorithm based on discretization, and combination with hill climbing or tabu search to get a high quality solution. This algorithm can also pack the shapes with circular arcs and holes. Egeblad et al. [7] proposed an efficient fast local search method whose neighborhood is any horizontal or vertical translation of a given shape. They also formulated a polynomial time algorithm to find a translation with minimum overlap area between the given polygon and the other polygons in the current placement. Gomes and Oliveira [6] presented a separation algorithm to locally optimize the placement based on linear programming models, and used simulated annealing to guide the search. A new separation algorithm based on unconstrained nonlinear programming is proposed by Imamichi et al. [8]. They also designed an algorithm that swaps two polygons in a placement, and then the algorithms are combined as a component into an iterated local search algorithm for the overlap minimization problem. This method yielded several best known results on the standard test instances. Our algorithm is based on a separation algorithm presented by Imamichi et al. [8], and local search is adopted to guide the search. Moreover, a tabu search algorithm is used to avoid local minima and a compacted algorithm is used to improve the packing results.\n## Section snippets\n## Formulation\nIn this section, some fundamental elements of geometry are first defined, before formulation of the irregular strip packing problem algorithm is given.\n**Definition 1 (point)**\nA point*p*in two-dimensional space is represented by a pair:p=(px,py)\u2208R2.\n**Definition 2 (line segment)**\nA line segment*s*is a point set defined by two endpoints*p**a*and*p**b*:s={p\u2208R2,t\u2208[0,1]|p=pa+t(pb\u2212pa)}.\n**Definition 3 (polygon)**\nA polygon is a plane figure bounded by a closed path composes of a finite sequence of line segments denoted by*S*.

The detection of intersections is a critical operation within the irregular two-dimensional stock-cutting problem (also known as \u201cnesting\u201d), which aims to place shapes onto sheets of material so that the material is utilised as efficiently as possible and the waste (or trim loss) is reduced. The problem forms an important process within many real-world manufacturing industries such as metalworking, automotive production, aerospace, clothing and conservatory manufacture, and others. If manufacturers can reduce their costs by utilising raw materials more effectively, this can directly translate into increased profit margins or greater competitiveness within the marketplace. Moreover, there are significant environmental benefits to be gained. Several methods have been proposed to calculate no-fit polygons, but most, if not all, can only operate on geometry that consists of line segments. This paper extends the orbital sliding method of calculating no-fit polygons to enable it to handle arcs and then shows the resultant no-fit polygons being utilised successfully on the two-dimensional irregular packing problem. As far as the authors are aware, this is the first time that a no-fit polygon algorithm has been able to handle arcs robustly without decomposing to their line approximations. The modification of the authors' previously published packing algorithm to utilise the proposed no-fit polygon approach yields solutions of excellent quality (including several best-known) on well-established literature benchmark problems after only a few minutes. The authors believe that the success of the packing strategy and the line and arc no-fit polygon algorithm make this approach a serious candidate for use in real-world production environments.\n## Suggested Citation\n* E.
