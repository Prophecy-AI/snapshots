    "## Key Findings:\n",
    "1. LB submission 008 confirmed CV=LB exactly (70.675457)\n",
    "2. Found BETTER solution in snapshots: 70.659944 (overlap-free) - 0.0155 better than our best\n",
    "3. Found even better solution: 70.586631 but has 71 overlaps\n",
    "4. The 70.659944 came from ensembling ALL 723 CSV files across ALL snapshots\n",
    "\n",
    "## Strategy:\n",
    "1. Copy the 70.659944 solution and submit it\n",
    "2. Try to fix the overlaps in the 70.586631 solution\n",
    "3. Create our own full ensemble from all available CSVs"
