Tsuzuki\nAdditional information is available at the end of the chapter\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5772/50302\n1. Introduction\nSimulated annealing has been applied to a wide range of problems: combinatorial and\ncontinuous optimizations. This work approaches a new class of problems in which the\nobjective function is discrete but the parameters are continuous. This type of problem arises in\nrotational irregular packing problems. It is necessary to place multiple items inside a container\nsuch that there is no collision between the items, while minimizing the items occupied area.\nA feedback is proposed to control the next candidate probability distribution, in order to\nincrease the number of accepted solutions. The probability distribution is controlled by\nthe so called crystallization factor. The proposed algorithm modifies only one parameter\nat a time. If the new configuration is accepted then a positive feedback is executed to\nresult in larger modifications. Different types of positive feedbacks are studied herein. If\nthe new configuration is rejected, then a negative feedback is executed to result in smaller\nmodifications. For each non-placed item, a limited depth binary search is performed to find a\nscale factor that, when applied to the item, allows it to be fitted in the layout. The proposed\nalgorithm was used to solve two different rotational puzzles. A geometrical cooling schedule\nis used. Consequently, the proposed algorithm can be classified as simulated quenching.\nThis work is structured as follows. Section 2 presents some simulated annealing and\nsimulated quenching key concepts. In section 3 the objective function with discrete values and\ncontinuous parameters is explained. Section 4 explains the proposed adaptive neighborhood\nbased on the crystallization factor. Section 5 explains the computational experiments and\nsection 6 presents the results. Finally, section 7 rounds up the work with the conclusions.\n2. Background\nSimulated annealing is a probabilistic meta-heuristic with a capacity of escape from local\nminima. It came from the Metropolis algorithm and it was originally proposed in the area\nof combinatorial optimization [9], that is, when the objective function is defined in a discrete\n\u00a92012 Tsuzuki et al., licensee InTech.

The simulated annealing was modified in order to apply to the optimization of\nmultimodal functions defined on continuous domain [4]. The choices of the cooling schedule\nand of the next candidate distribution are the most important decisions in the definition of a\nsimulated annealing algorithm [13]. The next candidate distribution for continuous variables\nis discussed herein.\nIn the discrete domain, such as the traveling salesman and computer circuit design problems,\nthe parameters must have discrete values; the next point candidate xk+1 corresponds to a\npermutation in the list of cities to be visited, interchanges of circuit elements, or other discrete\noperation. In the continuous application of simulated annealing a new choice of the next point\ncandidate must be executed. Bohachevsky et al. [1] proposed that the next candidate xk+1 can\nbe obtained by first generating a random direction vector u, with |u| = 1, then multiplying it\nby a fixed step size \u0394r, and summing the resulting vector to the current candidate point xk.\nBrooks & Verdini [2] showed that the selection of \u0394r is a critical choice. They observed that an\nappropriate choice of this parameter is strictly dependent on the objective function F(x), and\nthe appropriate value can be determined by presampling the objective function.\nThe directions in [1] are randomly sampled from the uniform distribution and the step size is\nthe same in each direction. In this way, the feasible region is explored in an isotropic way and\nthe objective function is assumed to behave in the same way in each direction. But this is not\noften the case. The step size to define the next candidate point xk+1 should not be equal for all\nthe directions, but different directions should have different step sizes; i.e. the space should\nbe searched in an anisotropic way. Corana et al. [4] explored the concept of anisotropic search;\nthey proposed a self-tuning simulated annealing algorithm in which the step size is configured\nin order to maintain a number of accepted solutions. At each iteration k, a single variable of\nxk is modified in order to obtain a new candidate point xk+1, and iterations are subdivided\ninto cycles of n iterations during which each variable is modified. The new candidate point is\nobtained from xk in the following form xk+1 = xk + v \u00b7 \u0394ri \u00b7 ei. Where v is a uniform random\nnumber in [\u22121, 1], and \u0394ri is the step size along direction ei of the i-th axis. The anisotropy is\nobtained by choosing different values of \u0394ri for all the directions. The step size is kept fixed\nfor a certain number of cycles of variables, and the fraction of accepted moves in direction ei\nis calculated. If the fraction of accepted moves generated in the same direction is below 0.4,\nthen the step size \u0394ri along ei is decreased. It is assumed that the algorithm is using too large\nsteps along ei thus causing many moves to be rejected. If the fraction is between 0.4 and 0.6\nthe step size is left unchanged. If the fraction is above 0.6 then \u0394ri is increased. It is assumed\nthat the step size is too small thus causing many moves to be accepted.\nThis procedure may not be the best possible to process the different behavior of the objective\nfunction along different axes. Ingber [7] proposed that the random variable should follow a\nCauchy distribution with different sensitivities at different temperatures. The maximum step\nsize is kept constant during the algorithm and it allows escaping from local minima even at\nlow temperatures. The parameter space can have completely different sensitivities for each\ndimension, therefore the use of different temperatures for each dimension is suggested. This\nmethod is often referred to as very fast simulated re-annealing (VFSR) or adaptive simulated\nannealing (ASA). The sensitivity of each parameter is given by the partial derivative of the\nfunction with relation to the i-th dimension [3].\n4 Simulated Annealing \u2013 Advances, Applications and Hybridizations\nAdaptive Neighborhood Heuristics for Simulated Annealing over Continuous Variables 3\n3. Integer objective function with float parameters\nIrregular packing problems arise in the industry whenever one must place multiple items\ninside a container such that there is no collision between the items, while minimizing the\narea occupied by the items. It can be shown that even restricted versions of this problem (for\ninstance, limiting the polygon shape to rectangles only) are NP complete, which means that\nall algorithms currently known for optimal solutions require a number of computational steps\nthat grow exponentially with the problem size rather than according to a polynomial function\n[5]. Usually probabilistic heuristics relax the original constraints of the problem, allowing the\nsearch to go through points outside the space of valid solutions and applying penalization to\ntheir cost. This technique is known as external penalization. The most adopted penalization\nheuristic for external solutions of packing problems is to apply a penalization based on\nthe overlapping area of colliding items. While this heuristic leads to very computationally\nefficient iterations of the optimization process, the layout with objective function in minimum\nvalue may have overlapped items [6].\nFig. 1 shows an example in which the c...",

High material utilization is of particular interest to mass production industries since small improvements of the layout can result in large savings of material and considerably reduce production cost.\nThe knapsack problem belongs to the more general class of combinatorial problems known as cutting and packing problems. According to Dyckhoff (1990), the cutting and packing problems are mainly characterized by the number of relevant dimensions, the regularity and irregularity of the shapes of the small items and large objects and the problem assignment. Considering assignment, it is possible to identify two situations: output maximization and input minimization. In the input minimization, the set of large objects is sufficient to accommodate all small items, and there is no selection regarding the small items. In the case of output maximization, the set of large objects is not sufficient to accommodate all the small items and a set of small items has to be assigned to a given set of large objects. The survey made by Wascher et al. (2005) improved the typology of cutting and packing problems proposed by Dyckhoff (1990). According to Wascher et al. (2005), the problem studied in this work can be defined as: \" ... the knapsack problem represents a problem category which is characterized by a strongly heteroge-neous assortment of small items which have to be allocated to a given set of large objects. Again, the availability of the large objects is limited such that not all small items can be accommodated. The value of the accommodated small items is to be maximized\" .

      "text": "Hybrid Simulated Annealing with Cosine Cooling and\nL\u00e9vy Flights for Circle Packing\nAnonymous Author(s)\nAffiliation\nAddress\nemail\nAbstract\n1 The circle packing problem\u2014arranging non-overlapping circles within a bounded\n2 domain to maximize a chosen metric\u2014arises in computational geometry, material\n3 science, and visual design. In the specific case of maximizing the sum of radii in\n4 a unit square, existing methods such as greedy placement, grid-based heuristics,\n5 gradient optimization, and particle swarm optimization often suffer from premature\n6 convergence, poor scalability, or suboptimal exploration of the solution space. We\n7 present a novel hybrid algorithm that combines latin hypercube sampling with a\n8 modified simulated annealing procedure incorporating cosine-annealing tempera\u00029 ture decay, occasional L\u00e9vy-flight-inspired perturbations to escape local optima,\n10 and a dynamically shrinking local search radius. This design strategically balances\n11 exploration and exploitation while maintaining feasibility through geometric and\n12 boundary constraints. Our algorithm generates a new world record score of\n2.6359372 on 26 circles 113 , exceeding the best-known hand-crafted algorithms and\n14 recent Google AlphaEvolve solution (2.634 and 2.6358627, respectively).

This problem intersects with\n24 multiple disciplines, including material science, industrial manufacturing, and graphic design, where\n25 efficient spatial arrangements are paramount [1\u20133]. In particular, the variant considered here in\u000226 volves positioning a fixed number of non-overlapping circles inside a unit square to maximize the\n27 sum of their radii. This objective emphasizes maximizing the total usable material space or visual\n28 prominence, rather than the more commonly studied problem of maximizing the uniform radius in\n29 congruent circle packing.\n30 The significance of this problem extends to several practical domains. In materials engineering,\n31 optimal packing configurations can minimize waste when cutting circular components from square\n32 sheets. In visual design, deliberate packing arrangements influence balance and aesthetic perception,\n33 while in manufacturing, space-efficient layouts contribute to reduced costs and improved machining\n34 efficiency [4, 5].

Classical greedy placement and incremental\n39 addition approaches often suffer from severe sensitivity to initialization, limiting their ability to find\n40 global optima. Grid-based heuristics, while computationally fast, impose artificial discretization that\n41 prevents exploiting fine-grained adjustments in high-quality solutions [4]. Continuous optimization\n42 strategies, including gradient-based methods, require careful handling of geometric constraints and\n43 tend to stagnate when encountering flat objective landscapes [7]. Population-based metaheuristics\n44 such as genetic algorithms, particle swarm optimization, and simulated annealing have been applied\n45 in related contexts [1, 8] but may exhibit premature convergence and inefficient traversal of vast\n46 feasible spaces.\n47 Recent research on circle packing has pursued several methodological directions. Geometry-driven\n48 algorithms have produced efficient configurations in specific domains, such as arbitrary shapes [3]\n49 and regular polygons [9]. Discretization-based optimization has allowed mixed-integer programming\n50 formulations, though often at the cost of reduced flexibility [4]. Analytical approaches, including\n51 convexification and semidefinite relaxations [2], have clarified the theoretical limits of exact formula\u000252 tions but are generally impractical for large instances. Nature-inspired metaheuristics such as bat\n53 algorithms, firefly algorithms, and swarm intelligence [1] continue to improve practical outcomes\n54 for mid-scale problems but inherit issues of parameter sensitivity and slow convergence. Hybrid\n55 strategies have also been explored for related packing problems\u2014combining global search heuristics\n56 with local improvement [8, 10]\u2014yet often remain problem-specific or focused on congruent rather\n57 than unequal circles.\n58 These observations reveal a clear research gap: existing algorithms either emphasize computational\n59 speed at the expense of fine-grained optimization, or they achieve high-quality solutions without\n60 providing a principled balance between exploration and exploitation. Moreover, transparent, hybrid\n61 designs capable of exceeding state-of-the-art performance in unequal circle packing within a unit\n62 square remain underexplored\u2014particularly those that integrate statistically robust initialization,\n63 adaptive stochastic search, and occasional long-range perturbations.\n2\n64 In this paper, we address this gap with a novel Hybrid Simulated Annealing algorithm incorporating\n65 cosine temperature cooling, L\u00e9vy-flight-inspired jumps, and adaptive local search shrinkage.

INTRODUCTION\nCutting and packing are classic problems of finding the\nmost efficient layout for a set of input items out of a\ngiven container with the objective of minimizing the waste\nmaterial. The applications of cutting and packing, e.g.\nclothing, shipbuilding, and furniture industry are numer\u0002ous. W\u00a8ascher et al. (2007) have developed a typology that\nclassifies the nesting problems according to dimension,\nobjective, assortment of item type, as well as the number\nand nature of the container where the items are to be\nallocated. In this paper, we consider the irregular shape\npacking problem, classified as a two-dimensional irregular\nopen dimension problem (ODP).\nThe problem is NP-complete (Fowler et al., 1981) and\nas a result solution methodologies predominantly utilize\nheuristics. Although there are many different solution\napproaches presented in the literature, there appears to\nbe two key strategies for representing and searching the\nsolution space. The first approach represents the solution\nas an ordered list of items and applies a placement rule\nto construct the solution (Babu and Babu, 2001; Gomes\nand Oliveira, 2002; Burke et al., 2007, 2006). The second\napproach represents the solution as a physical layout on\nthe container and moves items within the layout (Bennell\n1 e-mail: andre.kubagawa@gmail.com.

This author was partially supported by\nCNPq (grant 304258/2007-5) and FAPESP (grant 2009/07173-2).\nand Dowsland, 1999; Gomes and Oliveira, 2006; Egeblad\net al., 2007). The former strategy is dependent on two\ncritical characteristics of the algorithm; the placement rule\nand the placement order of the items.\nWhen irregular shaped items are involved an extra di\u0002mension of complexity is generated by the geometry. The\nno-fit polygon is the principal approach for handling the\ngeometry in cutting and packing problems with irregular\nshaped items (Burke et al., 2007; Bennell and Song, 2008;\nCosta et al., 2009). The no-fit polygon is used to ensure\nfeasible layouts; i.e. layouts where the items do not overlap\nand fit inside the container.\nIn this paper, the solution is represented as an ordered\nlist of items and a constructive heuristic is applied se\u0002quentially. A simulated annealing algorithm controls how\nthe items are ordered in the list and where the items are\nconstructively placed. The proposed algorithm has two\nhierarchical levels. The inner level solves the placement\nproblem where the container has fixed dimensions. The\nexternal level reduces or increases the container dimen\u0002sion that must be minimized. Experiments show that the\nproposed method is very efficient compared with other\npublished methods.\n2. PREVIOUS WORKS\nThe no-fit polygon alone has limited utility in cutting\nand packing problems. Some recent works are using the\ncollision free region to determine feasible layouts in con\u0002tainers with fixed dimensions. Martins and Tsuzuki (2006)\nproposed a constructive heuristic where the collision free\nPreprints of the 18th IFAC World Congress\nMilano (Italy) August 28 - September 2, 2011\nCopyright by the\nInternational Federation of Automatic Control (IFAC)\n3968\nFig. 1. Cost function behavior when the container has fixed\ndimensions. The cost function assumes only discrete\nvalues, while the rotating angle \u03b8 is continuous.\nregion represents feasible placements for a moveable item\nconsidering the already placed items and the container.\nThe cost function is the non occupied area inside the\ncontainer with fixed dimensions. As the non occupied\narea can change only by adding or removing areas of\nitems, the cost function can assume only a finite set of\nvalues, becoming discontinuous (see Fig. 1). A simulated\nannealing algorithm with adaptive neighborhood (Martins\nand Tsuzuki, 2008, 2009a) controls the sequence of items\nand the placement on the collision free region boundary.\nThe collision free region was calculated using regularized\nBoolean operations implemented with limited precision\n(Hobby, 1999).\nMartins and Tsuzuki (2007) combined the simulated an\u0002nealing with deterministic heuristics (larger first and bot\u0002tom left). They showed that it is possible to create problem\ninstances where deterministic heuristics cannot reach the\nlayout associated with the global optimum.\nSato et al. (2010) implemented a robust algorithm to\ndetermine the collision free region with two dimension\nnon manifold Boolean operations. They created a problem\ninstance where the the global optimum can not be reached\nby placing the moveable item exclusively on collision free\nregion vertices. Such situation rarely occurs considering\nstudied and practical problems. They showed several re\u0002sults where the area of the container was exactly equal\nto the total area of the items. The layout associated with\nglobal optimum was reached in averagely 15 times fewer\niterations when compared to previously published results\n(Martins and Tsuzuki, 2009b, 2010) where the area of the\ncontainer was larger than the total area of the items. The\ncorrect calculation of the collision free region showed to be\nan effective tool to obtain such results.\n3. NO-FIT POLYGONS AND COLLISION FREE\nREGION\nNo-fit polygons represent set of translations of an item\nand are mathematically represented by a set of vectors.\nFor a better understanding of the properties of the no-fit\npolygons, the set of translations of an item is represented\nby polygons in the plane. Every item has a reference point\nthat can be internal or external to it. The no-fit polygon\nrepresents a set of forbidden translations, as shown in\nFig. 2. For an item P, let i(P) be its interior, \u2202P be its\nboundary and c(P) be its complement.\nFig. 2. Set of translations of a shape represented as a region\ncontaining all possible translations from its reference\npoint.\nDefinition 3.1. The no-fit polygon induced by item Pi to\nitem Pj , denoted by \u03a5(Pi, Pj ), is the set of translation\nvectors applied to Pj that leads it to a collision with Pi.\nThus,\n\u03a5(Pi, Pj ) = i(Pi) \t i(Pj ) (1)\n= {v | \u2203 a \u2208 i(Pj ), a + v \u2208 i(Pi)}\nThe no-fit polygon can be obtained by the Minkowski\nsum algorithm (Agarwal et al., 2002), that can be calcu\u0002lated very efficiently for convex polygons.

This problem is approached with an heuristic based on Simulated Annealing (SA) with adaptive neighborhood. Traditional \u201cexternal penalization\u201d techniques are avoided through the application of the no\u2013fit polygon, that determinates the collision-free area for each polygon before its placement. The SA controls continuous and discrete parameters. The rotation applied and the translation of the polygon are continuous parameters, and the sequence of placement is represented as a set of discrete parameters. For each non\u2013placed item, a limited depth binary search is performed to find a scale factor that when applied to the item, would allow it to be fitted in the container.\n\n- [Previous article in issue](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1474667015355488)\n- [Next article in issue](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1474667015355506)\n\n## Keywords\n\nSimulated Annealing\n\nPlacement Problems\n\nOptimization\n\nProbabilistic Heuristics\n\n[View PDF](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S147466701535549X/pdf?md5=7bca88c33d2daef044751913b4156e2b&pid=1-s2.0-S147466701535549X-main.pdf)\n\nSpecial issue articlesRecommended articles\n\n## References\n\n01.

In the past, very large combinatorial optimization problems have been solved using this technique. It has also been shown that this method is effective in obtaining close-to-optimal solutions for problems known to be NP complete. Further, this technique is applicable to a whole class of problems that satisfy a few requirements.\n\nThe purpose of this paper is to illustrate an efficient version of the simulated annealing method as applied to a variant of the bin-packing problem. The computational complexity of the method is linear in input size similar to various well-known heuristic methods for the problem. The solutions obtained, however, are much better than any of the heuristic methods. The particular variant of the bin-packing problem we consider has several practical applications such as static task allocation in process scheduling and batch processing. At the time of this writing, we have not yet seen a stochastic solution to the bin-packing problem in the literature.\n\nOne of the distinguishing features of our research is the high quality of solutions obtained by our method. Extensive simulation experiments we have carried out show that the solutions obtained by the stochastic method show a significant improvement over those obtained by any of the well-known heuristic methods.\n\n- [Previous article in issue](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0898122194900760)\n- [Next article in issue](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0898122194900787)\n\n## Keywords\n\nBin-Packing\n\nCombinatorial optimization\n\nGlobal minimum\n\nMonte Carlo methods\n\nNP completeness\n\nSimulated annealing\n\nStatistical cooling\n\n[View PDF](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0898122194900779/pdf?md5=30492ae375a8dc570527f689a4f3bffb&pid=1-s2.0-0898122194900779-main.pdf)\n\nRecommended articles\n\n## References\n\n01.

Here it is applied to the[travelling salesman problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem)to minimize the length of a route that connects all 125 points.[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1e/3D_TSP_solved_with_simulated_annealing_2.5_MB.gif/250px-3D_TSP_solved_with_simulated_annealing_2.5_MB.gif)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:3D_TSP_solved_with_simulated_annealing_2.5_MB.gif)Travelling salesman problem in 3D for 120 points solved with simulated annealing.\n**Simulated annealing**(**SA**) is a[probabilistic technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probabilistic_algorithm)for approximating the[global optimum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_optimum)of a given[function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)). Specifically, it is a[metaheuristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaheuristic)to approximate[global optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_optimization)in a large[search space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution_space)for an[optimization problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimization_problem). For large numbers of local optima, SA can find the global optimum.[&#91;1&#93;](#cite_note-1)It is often used when the search space is discrete (for example the[traveling salesman problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traveling_salesman_problem), the[boolean satisfiability problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_satisfiability_problem),[protein structure prediction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_structure_prediction), and[job-shop scheduling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Job-shop_scheduling)). For problems where a fixed amount of computing resource is available, finding an approximate global optimum may be more relevant than attempting to find a precise local optimum. In such cases, SA may be preferable to exact algorithms such as[gradient descent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent)or[branch and bound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_and_bound). The problems solved by SA are currently formulated by an[objective function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective_function)of many variables, subject to several[mathematical constraints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_constraints). In practice, a constraint violation can be penalized as part of the objective function.\nSimilar techniques have been independently introduced on several occasions, including Pincus (1970),[&#91;2&#93;](#cite_note-2)Khachaturyan et al. (1979,[&#91;3&#93;](#cite_note-3)1981[&#91;4&#93;](#cite_note-4)), Kirkpatrick, Gelatt and Vecchi (1983), and Cerny (1985).[&#91;5&#93;](#cite_note-5)In 1983, this approach was used by Kirkpatrick, Gelatt Jr., and Vecchi[&#91;6&#93;](#cite_note-:2-6)for a solution of the[traveling salesman problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traveling_salesman_problem). They also proposed its current name, simulated annealing.\nThe name of the algorithm comes from[annealing in metallurgy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annealing_(metallurgy)), a technique involving heating and controlled cooling of a material to alter its[physical properties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_properties). This notion of slow cooling implemented in the simulated annealing algorithm is interpreted as a slow decrease in the probability of accepting worse solutions as the solution space is explored. Accepting worse solutions allows for a more extensive search for the global optimal solution. Simulated annealing algorithms work by progressively decreasing the temperature from an initial positive value to zero. At each time step, the algorithm randomly selects a solution close to the current one, measures its quality, and moves to it according to the temperature-dependent probabilities of selecting better or worse solutions.\nThe simulation can be performed either by a solution of[kinetic equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kinetic_equations&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1)for[probability density functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_density_functions),[&#91;7&#93;](#cite_note-:0-7)[&#91;8&#93;](#cite_note-:1-8)or by using a[stochastic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic)sampling method.[&#91;6&#93;](#cite_note-:...",

We expect a fun puzzle. We get a nightmare of Combinatorial Optimization.\nThis year\u2019s edition,**\u201cSanta 2025: The Christmas Tree Packing Challenge,\u201d**is no exception. The goal? Pack $N$ irregular \u201cTree Polygons\u201d into the smallest possible square bounding box for $N=1$ to $200$.\nIf you checked the leaderboard today (Dec 21), you noticed a trend:**Reinforcement Learning (RL) is getting crushed.**\nDespite the massive hype around \u201cReasoning Models\u201d and PPO agents this year, the top 100 teams aren\u2019t using neural networks. They are using 1980s physics simulations. Here is why the \u201cOld School\u201d is winning, and how the pros are using LLMs to cheat the system.\n## The Problem: Why RL Hates \u201cPacking\u201d\nOn paper, this looks like a game.*Place a tree, check for overlap, repeat.*Perfect for a DQN agent, right?\nWrong. The geometry kills the gradient.\n1. **Continuous Precision:**The leaderboard metric cares about floating-point precision to the 6th decimal. RL agents (which output discrete actions or probability distributions) struggle to make the \u201cmicro-adjustments\u201d needed to squeeze a tree into a 0.001mm gap.\n2. **The \u201cCollision\u201d Cliff:**In packing, a move is either valid (reward = 1) or it overlaps by a pixel (reward = -100). This sparse, binary feedback loop makes it nearly impossible for an agent to \u201clearn\u201d a gradient. It doesn\u2019t know*how*to fix the overlap, just that it failed.## The Solution: Simulated Annealing (on Steroids)\nThe \u201cSecret Sauce\u201d currently dominating the leaderboard is**Simulated Annealing (SA)**combined with**Lattice Generation**.\nInstead of training a model to*predict*the position, teams are writing physics engines that*shake*the box.\n* **High Temperature:**Randomly spin and throw trees into the box (Explorer Phase).\n* **Low Temperature:**Jiggle the trees by microscopic amounts to resolve collisions (Exploiter Phase).\nThe best solutions right now use a \u201cHybrid\u201d strategy:\n* **N &lt; 58:**Use Simulated Annealing to find unstructured, chaotic packings.\n* **N &gt; 58:**Switch to \u201cCrystalline Packing\u201d (regular geometric lattices) which is mathematically superior for large numbers.## The Twist: How LLMs are Actually Helping\nIf RL is dead, where is the AI?\nTop competitors aren\u2019t using LLMs to*solve*the puzzle; they are using LLMs to**write the solver**.\nPython is too slow for 10 billion annealing steps. The meta this year is to prompt Gemini 3 or Claude to:\n\u201cRewrite this Python overlap-check function in Rust/C++ with AVX2 vectorization.\u201d\nWe are seeing \u201cHybrid\u201d workflows where the**Human**defines the heuristics, the**LLM**writes the highly optimized C++ kernels, and**Simulated Annealing**does the heavy lifting.\n## The Starter Code: A Simple Annealer\nIf you want to jump in before the January deadline, don\u2019t start with PyTorch. Start here.\nHere is a conceptual snippet for a \u201cPerturbation\u201d mover \u2014the heart of any good annealing solution.\n```\nimport numpy as np\nimport math\ndef anneal(layout, max\\_temps=10000):\n# layout: Array of [x, y, rotation] for N trees\ncurrent\\_score = calculate\\_area(layout)\ntemperature = 1.0\ncooling\\_rate = 0.9995\nfor i in range(max\\_temps):\n# 1. Propose a Move (The &quot;Shake&quot;)\n# We only move ONE tree slightly to save compute\nidx = np.random.randint(0, len(layout))\noriginal\\_pos = layout[idx].copy()\n# Perturb: Move x/y by small amount, rotate slightly\nlayout[idx][0] += np.random.normal(0, temperature)\nlayout[idx][1] += np.random.normal(0, temperature)\nlayout[idx][2] += np.random.normal(0, temperature \\* 10) # Rotate\n# 2. Check Constraints (The &quot;Wall&quot;)\nif check\\_overlap(layout):\n# Revert immediately if invalid\nlayout[idx] = original\\_pos\ncontinue\n# 3. Acceptance Criteria (Metropolis-Hastings)\nnew\\_score = calculate\\_area(layout)\ndelta = new\\_score - current\\_score\n# If better, accept. If worse, accept with prob based on Temp.\nif delta &lt; 0 or math.exp(-delta / temperature) &gt; np.random.rand():\ncurrent\\_score = new\\_score\nelse:\nlayout[idx] = original\\_pos # Revert\n# Cool down\ntemperature \\*= cooling\\_rate\nreturn layout, current\\_score\n# Pro Tip: Ask an LLM to convert &#x27;&#x27;check\\_overlap&#x27;&#x27; to Cython for 100x speed.\n```\nThe competition ends**January 30, 2026**. You have 40 days. Put down the Neural Network and pick up a physics textbook.\n*(****Discussion:****Are you using a Lattice approach or pure Annealing for N=200?
