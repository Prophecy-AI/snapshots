      "text": "2D polygon\u2011packing is a highly multimodal combinatorial problem, so techniques that deliberately introduce diversity or \u201cescape moves\u201d are essential for reaching the global optimum.  A prominent strategy is to use **non\u2011elitist evolutionary algorithms** with tournament\u2011style selection and carefully tuned mutation rates; the non\u2011linear selection profile lets a sub\u2011population linger on a local optimum while the rest explores the fitness valley, turning an otherwise exponential\u2011time search into polynomial\u2011time performance on multimodal benchmarks\u3010aaai.org\u3011.  Hybrid **genetic algorithms** that are combined with deterministic local refinements (e.g., shift\u2011and\u2011rotate moves) also help avoid premature convergence by periodically re\u2011optimising promising individuals\u3010cs.nott.ac.uk\u3011.\n\nAnother effective class is **adaptive meta\u2011heuristics** that modify their neighbourhood on the fly.  **Simulated annealing** with an adaptive neighbourhood can jump out of shallow basins by enlarging the perturbation size when the temperature is high, then gradually focusing on finer moves as the search cools\u3010sciencedirect.com (IFAC)\u3011.  Variants such as **iterated local search / monotonic basin hopping** use strong perturbation operators (both combinatorial and continuous) to restart the local optimiser from a distant region, which has shown strong empirical results on irregular rectangle and polygon instances\u3010optimization-online.org\u3011.  **Fast neighbourhood search** and **two\u2011level search** frameworks further accelerate this process by quickly scanning large move sets and then applying a deeper optimisation on a reduced sub\u2011problem\u3010sciencedirect.com (EJOR)\u3011\u3010sciencedirect.com (CIE)\u3011.\n\nThe most recent **general heuristic for maximum polygon packing** combines several of these ideas: the container and polygons are first partitioned into manageable sub\u2011problems, then a **differential\u2011evolution** engine explores the global search space, while **local search** and **tabu search** intensify promising regions and prevent cycling\u3010drops.dagstuhl.de\u3011.  In practice, the best results are obtained by hybridising a population\u2011based global search (EA, DE, or GA) with adaptive neighbourhood\u2011based local refinements (SA, tabu, fast\u2011neighbourhood) and occasional large\u2011scale perturbations, thereby maintaining diversity and systematically escaping local optima toward the global optimum.",

      "text": "Escaping Local Optima with Non-Elitist Evolutionary Algorithms\nDuc-Cuong Dang1, Anton Eremeev2, Per Kristian Lehre3\n1Southampton Business School, University of Southampton, University Road, Southampton, SO17 1BJ, United Kingdom\n2Sobolev Institute of Mathematics SB RAS, 13, Pevtsov str., Omsk, 644099, Russia\n3School of Computer Science, University of Birmingham, Edgbaston, B15 2TT Birmingham, United Kingdom\nd.c.dang@soton.ac.uk, eremeev@ofim.oscsbras.ru, p.k.lehre@cs.bham.ac.uk\nAbstract\nMost discrete evolutionary algorithms (EAs) implement\nelitism, meaning that they make the biologically implausible\nassumption that the fittest individuals never die. While elitism\nfavours exploitation and ensures that the best seen solutions\nare not lost, it has been widely conjectured that non-elitism is\nnecessary to explore promising fitness valleys without getting\nstuck in local optima. Determining when non-elitist EAs out\u0002perform elitist EAs has been one of the most fundamental open\nproblems in evolutionary computation. A recent analysis of a\nnon-elitist EA shows that this algorithm does not outperform\nits elitist counterparts on the benchmark problem JUMP.\nWe solve this open problem through rigorous runtime analy\u0002sis of elitist and non-elitist population-based EAs on a class\nof multi-modal problems. We show that with 3-tournament\nselection and appropriate mutation rates, the non-elitist EA\noptimises the multi-modal problem in expected polynomial\ntime, while an elitist EA requires exponential time with over\u0002whelmingly high probability.\nA key insight in our analysis is the non-linear selection profile\nof the tournament selection mechanism which, with appropri\u0002ate mutation rates, allows a small sub-population to reside on\nthe local optimum while the rest of the population explores the\nfitness valley. In contrast, we show that the comma-selection\nmechanism which does not have this non-linear profile, fails\nto optimise this problem in polynomial time.\nThe theoretical analysis is complemented with an empirical\ninvestigation on instances of the set cover problem, showing\nthat non-elitist EAs can perform better than the elitist ones.\nWe also provide examples where usage of mutation rates close\nto the error thresholds is beneficial when employing non-elitist\npopulation-based EAs.\nIntroduction\nEvolutionary algorithms (EAs) are heuristic optimisation\nmethods inspired by evolution. Departing from nature \u2013\nwhere even the fittest individuals eventually die \u2013 EAs were\nearly on designed with elitism (Cavicchio 1970; De Jong\n1975), where some of the fittest individuals are always copied\nunchanged into the next generation. Both from a practical\nand theoretical point of view, elitism was considered a neces\u0002sary mechanism to ensures monotone progress. Elitism was\nthought necessary to saturate good solutions (Beyer 1997),\nCopyright \u00a9 2021, Association for the Advancement of Artificial\nIntelligence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved.\nand Rudolph used elitism as the essential property to guaran\u0002tee that the canonical genetic algorithm (CGA) converges to\nthe optimum (Rudolph 1994).\nIn contrast, the less frequently employed non-elitist EAs\nproduce the new generation solely from the offspring of the\nold generation, and the old generation is then discarded. Non\u0002elitist EAs are highly inefficient if their mutation rates and\nselection pressure have not been set appropriately. In par\u0002ticular, if the mutation rate exceeds the error threshold, a\nquantity which depends on the selective pressure, then the\nEA will require at least exponential time to locate any unique\nglobal optimum (Lehre 2010). Error thresholds (or mutation\u0002selection balance) were originally studied in population genet\u0002ics (Wilke 2005), virology (Biebricher and Eigen 2005), and\nlater introduced to evolutionary computation (Ochoa 2006).\nNon-elitist EAs with mutation rates below the error threshold\noptimise many pseudo-Boolean problems in expected poly\u0002nomial time (Corus et al. 2018). For certain problems, the\nmutation rate must be neither too high nor too low to ensure\npolynomial runtime (Lehre and Yao 2012).\nOur aim is to contribute to the long-standing open prob\u0002lem in evolutionary computation, to determine whether\nnon-elitism can lead to more efficient search than elitism\n(Jagerskupper and Storch 2007; Doerr 2020). An attractive \u00a8\nhypothesis, which we call the escape hypothesis, is that non\u0002elitism helps EAs escape local optima. Some believe that if\nthe population contains a local optimum, a non-elitist EA\nmay allow a sub-population sufficient time to explore less fit\nfitness valleys around the optimum, to eventually discover\nbetter solutions. In contrast, the locally optimal individual\nin an elitist EA are thought to take over the population too\nquickly. To progress, the elitist EA will require a long time to\ndiscover a fitter solution through a low probability mutation\n(or crossover) event.\nSo far, there has been no convincing evidence that the\nescape hypothesis is true. To test the hypothesis, one could\nattempt to analyse the runtime of elitist and non-elitist EAs\non multi-modal problems with well known structure.\nThe CLIFF problem has local optima which can be reached\neasily through hill-climbing, and which are all separated\nfrom the optimum by a fitness valley of Hamming width k.\nThe non-elitist (1,\u03bb) EA with population size \u03bb \u2265 5 log(n)\noptimises CLIFF (for k = bn/3c) in expected time O(e\n5\u03bb\n),\nwhereas the elitist (1+\u03bb) EA needs at least n\nn/4\nfunction eval\u0002The Thirty-Fifth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-21)\n12275\nuations with overwhelmingly high probability (Jagerskupper \u00a8\nand Storch 2007). This result is non-convincing for two rea\u0002sons. Both algorithms require astronomical runtime on this\nproblem, and the EAs have a (parent) population size of one.\nClearly, these algorithms cannot help us understand how less\nfit sub-populations can survive.\nThe Strong Selection Weak Mutation (SSWM) model from\npopulation genetics was studied in the context of evolution\u0002ary computation (Paixao et al. 2017). The authors proved a \u02dc\nspeed-up of e\n\u2126(d) of SSWM over the expected runtime \u0398(nd\n)\nof the (1+1) EA on the CLIFF function. Here, the quantity\nd refers both to the \u201cheight\u201d of the local optima and their\ndistance to the global optimum. Based on the construction\nof LONGPATH, the VALLEYPATH function was introduced\nin (Oliveto et al. 2018). It was shown that the non-elitist al\u0002gorithms with population of size 1, such as the SSWM and\nMetropolis, are able to cross a valley of deceptive fitness, and\ntheir ability to escape the current local optimum depends on\nthe depth of the valley. This is in contrast to the (1+1) EA\nin which case the ability to escape crucially depends on the\nwidth of the valley. Both of these results concern evolutionary\nmodels with population size one. However, these results give\nno insights into the population-dynamics of non-elitist EAs.\nThe JUMP problem has a similar (but not identical) struc\u0002ture to the CLIFF problem. Doerr proved that the non-elitist\n(\u00b5, \u03bb) EA below the error threshold has asymptotically the\nsame optimisation time on the JUMP problem, as the eli\u0002tist (\u00b5+\u03bb) EA (Doerr 2020). (Above the error threshold, the\n(\u00b5, \u03bb) EA requires exponential time.) While these algorithms\nare true population-based EAs, they fail to show any dif\u0002ference in performance between the algorithms. The author\nargues that the (\u00b5,\u03bb) EA operates in one of two modes. Above\nthe error threshold, the algorithm easily leaves the local op\u0002timum, but fails to find the global optimum efficiently as\nproved earlier (Lehre 2010). Below the error threshold, the\nalgorithm has a similar behaviour to the elitist (\u00b5+\u03bb) EA, and\nhas a difficulty in leaving the optimum.\nThis dichotomy of the (\u00b5,\u03bb) EA was already well known\nand studied several years earlier (Dang and Lehre 2016b).\nFor the PEAK problem, it was shown that the (\u00b5, \u03bb) EA be\u0002low the error threshold requires exponential time to escape\nthe local optimum.

It adopts two neighborhoods, swapping two given polygons in a placement and placing one polygon into a new position. The local search algorithm is used to minimize the overlap on the basis of the neighborhoods mentioned above and the unconstrained[nonlinear programming](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/nonlinear-programming)model is adopted to further minimize the overlap during the search process. Moreover, the[tabu](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/tabu)search algorithm is used to avoid[local minima](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/local-minimum), and a compact algorithm is presented to improve the result. The results of standard test instances indicate that when compared with other existing algorithms, the presented algorithm does not only show some signs of competitive power but also updates several best known results.\n## Introduction\nThe irregular strip packing problem, also known as the nesting problem, has a wide area of applications. Given a set of irregular shapes and a rectangular strip with a fixed width and an arbitrary length, the target of the two-dimensional irregular strip packing problem is to place all shapes within the strip such that the length of the strip is minimized and the irregular shapes do not overlap. A classic example application is clothing industry. Several pieces of clothes will be cut from a roll of fabric and the objective is to minimize the waste of fabric. The fabric has a fixed width and its length can be generally assumed infinite; so the problem is to minimize the length required for producing the specified number of irregular shapes.\nThe irregular strip packing problem is a NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem [1]. Numerous papers on nesting problem have been published since the first paper by Art [2]. Meta-heuristics are often used to solve this problem. Hopper and Turton [3] reviewed these methods, and a summary of geometric methods was published by Bennell and Oliveira [4]. As research progressed, further breakthroughs in algorithms for this problem have achieved in recent years. When compared with the previous years, these solutions have markedly improved the effect and speed of nesting results. The typical methods include Burke et al. [5], Gomes and Oliveira [6], Egeblad et al. [7], Imamichi et al. [8], etc.\nAlbano and Sapuppo [9] proposed an algorithm that places each shape at the bottom-left position, and the sequence of places is obtained by tree search. Jakobs [10] proposed a two-stage solution which first generates the rectangular enclosure of each irregular shape, and then finds the placement for these enclosures through a genetic algorithm. Secondly, a shrinking algorithm moves the shapes to another one as close as possible using the idea of the bottom-left heuristic. Gomes and Oliveira [11] based on bottom-left heuristic and find a good placement by exchanging two shapes in the layout. Dowsland et al. [12] developed a compact algorithm to improve the bottom-left heuristic algorithm. The algorithm first gets the initial placement by the bottom-left heuristic, and then uses a shaking process to compact the placement. Burke et al. [5] presented a new bottom-left heuristic algorithm based on discretization, and combination with hill climbing or tabu search to get a high quality solution. This algorithm can also pack the shapes with circular arcs and holes. Egeblad et al. [7] proposed an efficient fast local search method whose neighborhood is any horizontal or vertical translation of a given shape. They also formulated a polynomial time algorithm to find a translation with minimum overlap area between the given polygon and the other polygons in the current placement. Gomes and Oliveira [6] presented a separation algorithm to locally optimize the placement based on linear programming models, and used simulated annealing to guide the search. A new separation algorithm based on unconstrained nonlinear programming is proposed by Imamichi et al. [8]. They also designed an algorithm that swaps two polygons in a placement, and then the algorithms are combined as a component into an iterated local search algorithm for the overlap minimization problem. This method yielded several best known results on the standard test instances. Our algorithm is based on a separation algorithm presented by Imamichi et al. [8], and local search is adopted to guide the search. Moreover, a tabu search algorithm is used to avoid local minima and a compacted algorithm is used to improve the packing results.\n## Section snippets\n## Formulation\nIn this section, some fundamental elements of geometry are first defined, before formulation of the irregular strip packing problem algorithm is given.\n**Definition 1 (point)**\nA point*p*in two-dimensional space is represented by a pair:p=(px,py)\u2208R2.\n**Definition 2 (line segment)**\nA line segment*s*is a point set defined by two endpoints*p**a*and*p**b*:s={p\u2208R2,t\u2208[0,1]|p=pa+t(pb\u2212pa)}.\n**Definition 3 (polygon)**\nA polygon is a plane figure bounded by a closed path composes of a finite sequence of line segments denoted by*S*.

In the past, very large combinatorial optimization problems have been solved using this technique. It has also been shown that this method is effective in obtaining close-to-optimal solutions for problems known to be NP complete. Further, this technique is applicable to a whole class of problems that satisfy a few requirements.\n\nThe purpose of this paper is to illustrate an efficient version of the simulated annealing method as applied to a variant of the bin-packing problem. The computational complexity of the method is linear in input size similar to various well-known heuristic methods for the problem. The solutions obtained, however, are much better than any of the heuristic methods. The particular variant of the bin-packing problem we consider has several practical applications such as static task allocation in process scheduling and batch processing. At the time of this writing, we have not yet seen a stochastic solution to the bin-packing problem in the literature.\n\nOne of the distinguishing features of our research is the high quality of solutions obtained by our method. Extensive simulation experiments we have carried out show that the solutions obtained by the stochastic method show a significant improvement over those obtained by any of the well-known heuristic methods.\n\n- [Previous article in issue](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0898122194900760)\n- [Next article in issue](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0898122194900787)\n\n## Keywords\n\nBin-Packing\n\nCombinatorial optimization\n\nGlobal minimum\n\nMonte Carlo methods\n\nNP completeness\n\nSimulated annealing\n\nStatistical cooling\n\n[View PDF](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0898122194900779/pdf?md5=30492ae375a8dc570527f689a4f3bffb&pid=1-s2.0-0898122194900779-main.pdf)\n\nRecommended articles\n\n## References\n\n01.

This problem is approached with an heuristic based on Simulated Annealing (SA) with adaptive neighborhood. Traditional \u201cexternal penalization\u201d techniques are avoided through the application of the no\u2013fit polygon, that determinates the collision-free area for each polygon before its placement. The SA controls continuous and discrete parameters. The rotation applied and the translation of the polygon are continuous parameters, and the sequence of placement is represented as a set of discrete parameters. For each non\u2013placed item, a limited depth binary search is performed to find a scale factor that when applied to the item, would allow it to be fitted in the container.\n\n- [Previous article in issue](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1474667015355488)\n- [Next article in issue](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1474667015355506)\n\n## Keywords\n\nSimulated Annealing\n\nPlacement Problems\n\nOptimization\n\nProbabilistic Heuristics\n\n[View PDF](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S147466701535549X/pdf?md5=7bca88c33d2daef044751913b4156e2b&pid=1-s2.0-S147466701535549X-main.pdf)\n\nSpecial issue articlesRecommended articles\n\n## References\n\n01.

It is based on a simple local search scheme in which the neighborhood is any horizontal or vertical translation of a given polygon from its current position. To escape local minima we apply the meta-heuristic method*Guided Local Search*.\nThe strength of our solution method comes from a new algorithm which is capable of searching the neighborhood in polynomial time. More precisely, given a single polygon with*m*edges and a set of polygons with*n*edges the algorithm can find a translation with minimum overlap in time O(*mn*log(*mn*)). Solutions for standard test instances are generated by an implementation and a comparison is done with recent results from the literature. The solution method is very robust and most of the best solutions found are also the currently best results published.\nOur approach to the problem is*very*flexible regarding problem variations and special constraints, and as an example we describe how it can handle materials with quality regions.\nFinally, we generalize the algorithm for the fast neighborhood search and present a solution method for three-dimensional nesting problems.\n## Introduction\nNesting is a term used for many related problems. The most common problem is strip-packing where a number of irregular shapes must be placed within a rectangular strip such that the strip-length is minimized and no shapes overlap. The clothing industry is a classical example of an application for this problem. Normally, pieces of clothes are cut from a roll of fabric. A high utilization is desirable and it requires that as little of the roll is used as possible. The width of the roll is fixed, hence the problem is to minimize the length of the fabric. Other nesting problem variations exist, but in the following the focus is on the strip-packing variant. Using the typology of W\u00e4scher et al. (2006) this is a two-dimensional irregular open dimension problem (ODP).\nIn the textile industry the shapes of the pieces of clothes are usually referred to as*markers*or*stencils*. In the following we will use the latter term except when the pieces need to be defined more precisely e.g. as polygons.\nIn order to state the problem formally we first define the associated decision problem:\n**Nesting Decision Problem**\nGiven a set of stencilsSand a piece of material, position the stencilsSsuch that\n* \u2022No pair of stencils overlap.\n* \u2022All stencils are contained within the boundaries of the material.\nThe strip-packing variant can now be stated as\n**Strip Nesting Problem**\nGiven a set of stencilsSand a strip (the material) with width*w*find the minimal length*l*for which the Nesting Decision Problem can be solved (Fig. 1).\nThe Strip Nesting Problem is NP-hard (e.g. Nielsen and Odgaard, 2003).\nIn this paper we present a new solution method for the Strip Nesting Problem. After a short analysis of some of the existing approaches to the problem (Section 2) we present a short outline of the new solution method in Section 3. In short, the approach is a local search method (Section 4) using the meta-heuristic*Guided Local Search*(Section 5) to escape local minima. A very efficient search of the neighborhood in the local search is the subject of Section 6.\nIn the definitions above we have ignored the additional constraints which are often given for a nesting problem e.g. whether rotating and/or flipping the stencils is allowed. In Section 7 a discussion on how we handle such problem variations emphasizes the flexibility of our solution method.\nExperiments show that our solution method is very efficient compared with other published methods. Results are presented in Section 8. Finally, in Section 9, it is shown that our solution method is quite easily generalized to three-dimensional nesting problems.\n## Section snippets\n## Existing approaches to nesting problems\nThere exists numerous solution methods for nesting problems. A thorough survey by Dowsland and Dowsland (1995) exists, but a more recent survey has also been done by Nielsen and Odgaard (2003). Meta-heuristics are one of the most popular tools for solving nesting problems. A detailed discussion of these can be found in the introductory sections of Bennell and Dowsland (1999).\nThe following is a brief discussion of some of the most interesting approaches to nesting problems previously presented\n## Solution method outline\nIn this section we will give a brief outline of our solution method. Our method is a relaxed placement method and it can handle irregular polygons with holes. A new geometric approach is utilized and the*Guided Local Search*meta-heuristic is used to escape local minima. This approach is inspired by a paper by Faroe et al. (2003) which presented a similar approach for the two-dimensional Bin Packing Problem for rectangles.\nThe following describes the basic algorithm for the Strip Nesting Problem.\n* (1)\n## Placement\nFirst we define a*placement*formally. LetS={s1,\u2026,sn}be a set of polygons. A placement ofs\u2208Scan be described by the tuple(sx,sy,s\u03b8,sf)\u2208R\u00d7R\u00d7[0,2\u03c0)\u00d7{false,true}where (*s**x*,*s**y*) is the position,*s**\u03b8*is the rotation angle and*s**f*states whether*s*is flipped. Now the mapp:S\u2192R\u00d7R\u00d7[0,2\u03c0)\u00d7{false,true}is a placement of the polygonsS.\n## Objective function\nGiven a set of polygonsS={s1,\u2026,sn}and a fixed-length strip with length*l*and width*w*, letPbe the space of possible placements. We now wish to minimize the objective\n## Guided local search\nTo escape local minima encountered during local search we apply the meta-heuristic*Guided Local Search*(*GLS*). GLS was introduced by Voudouris and Tsang (1995) and has previously been successfully applied to e.g. the*Traveling Salesman Problem*(Voudouris and Tsang, 1999) and two- and thre...",

In our algorithm, the rectangles are placed into the container one by one and each rectangle should be packed at a position by a corner-occupying action so that it touches two items without overlapping other already packed rectangles. At the first level of our algorithm, a simple algorithm called*A*0selects and packs one rectangle according to the highest degree first rule at every iteration of packing. At the second level,*A*0is itself used to evaluate the benefit of a CCOA more globally. Computational results show that the resulted[packing algorithm](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/packing-algorithm)called*A*1produces high-density solutions within short running times.\n## Introduction\nThe two-dimensional (2D) rectangular packing problem is an optimization problem of allocating a set of rectangular items to larger containers with the objective of minimizing the waste. The 2D rectangular packing problem has been widely studied in recent decades, as it has numerous applications in the cutting and packing industry, e.g. wood, glass and cloth industries, newspapers paging, VLSI floor planning and so on, with different applications incorporating different constraints and objectives (Chan and Markov, 2004, Hifi and Ouafi, 1998, Lee and Sewell, 1999, Lesh et al., 2004, Lodi et al., 2002). The 2D rectangular packing problem belongs to a subset of classical cutting and packing problems and has been shown to be an NP hard problem (Hochbaum &amp; Maass, 1985). Therefore, various approximation or heuristic algorithms have been proposed for approaching the problem.\nIn rectangle packing, one of the earliest approaches is the so-called bottom-left (BL) heuristic (Baker, Coffman, &amp; Rivest, 1980). In BL, the rectangles to be placed are, starting from the top-right corner of the container, first slide vertically downward as far as possible, followed by sliding horizontally as far as possible to the left, so as to reduce the number of possible packing patterns. One improved variant of BL is the bottom-left-fill (BLF) heuristic, in which the rectangles are placed directly into the lowest positions available and then left justified. Both BL and BLF are later used in meta-heuristic based algorithms. Hybrid algorithms combining genetic algorithm (GA) and deterministic methods were proposed by Jakobs, 1996, Liu and Teng, 1999, Dagli and Poshyanonda, 1997. An empirical investigation of the result of different combinations of simulated annealing (SA) and GA with various heuristics such as BL or BLF was given by Hopper and Turton (2001).\nInspired by enhancing some working experience of professional masons in their everyday work, a Less Flexibility First (LFF) packing principle was proposed in Tam et al., 1998, Wu et al., 2002 for solving the rectangular packing problem. Recently, by introducing a tightness measure to represent the degree of fitting between rectangles and placement locations, an enhanced version of LFF, called LFFT, was proposed in Wu, Chan, and SAGA (2005). More recently, a fast heuristic recursive (HR) algorithm based on divide-and-conquer and greedy strategies was proposed in Zhang, Kang, and Deng (2006), and an effective GA, called SPGAL, was proposed in Bortfeldt (2006) for the four subtypes of the 2D strip packing problem.\nBased on the previous studies (Huang et al., 2005, Tam et al., 1998, Wu et al., 2002), we will propose a quite different class of efficient heuristic for the 2D rectangular packing problem in this paper. Different from the stochastic search methods where the researches are mainly focused on finding the efficient data structures for presenting packing results so that the search space and the processing time of the underling search engine can be minimized, our algorithm is a deterministic algorithm and no data structure is needed. Similar to LFF, our algorithm packs the rectangles into the container one by one and each rectangle should be packed at a position occupying an empty corner in the container. The computational results of our proposed algorithm is very encouraging in terms of both packing density and running time.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 gives the problem definition. Section 3 describes the details of the algorithm. Section 4 presents our experimental results for two sets of test instances. We draw our conclusions in Section 5.\n## Section snippets\n## Problem definition\nWe consider the following rectangular packing problem: given a rectangular empty container with fixed width and infinite height and a set of rectangles with various sizes, the rectangle packing problem is to pack each rectangle into the container such that no two rectangles overlap and the used height of the container is minimized.

We also want to thank Dominik Krupke for providing a\nhelpful official validator for solutions.\n1 Introduction\nThe recent CG:SHOP 2024 Challenge introduced a variant of irregular packing problems\nknown as the Maximum Polygon Packing (MPP) problem. The MPP problem involves a\nconvex polygonal container C and a polygon set P = {p1, p2, ..., pN }, where polygon piis\nassociated with a value vi. It seeks for a non-overlapping packing with the maximum total\nvalue. The challenge presents a total of 180 instances whose number of polygons ranges from\n28 to 50,000. The official document [4] gives a detailed description of the challenge.\nOur proposed algorithm employs a general process to solve these instances indiscriminately,\nand the overall framework is presented in Figure 1. We first partition a large-scale problem\ninto multiple small-scale subproblems (Section 2) and then solve each subproblem using\nupper-level polygon ordering (Section 3.1) and lower-level packing optimization techniques\n(Section 3.2). Section 4 presents our experimental results, followed by conclusions.\n1 Corresponding author: Zhouxing Su\n\u00a9 Canhui Luo, Zhouxing Su, and Zhipeng L\u00fc;\nlicensed under Creative Commons License CC-BY 4.0\n40th International Symposium on Computational Geometry (SoCG 2024).\nEditors: Wolfgang Mulzer and Jeff M.

It involves two components: partitioning the container C into\nmultiple regions and assigning polygons to each region.\n2.1 Container Partitioning\nThe container partitioning process consists of two steps, as shown in Figure 2. Initially, we\narrange two-dimensional square grids starting from the bottom-left corner of the bounding\nbox until the entire container is covered. The subregions formed by the intersection of the\ncontainer with all the grids constitute its partition C = C1 \u222a C2 \u222a ... \u222a Cm. Subsequently,\nwe merge the small subregions with adjacent grids, which are difficult to be used effectively.\nThe grid is dimensioned to keep the scale of each subproblem at approximately 300 polygons,\nmaking a trade-off between effectiveness and efficiency of lower-level packing optimization.\n2.2 Polygon Assignment\nWe adopt a simple approach of randomly assigning polygons to each subregion. Specifically, for\neach subregion Ci, we randomly select a polygon pj from P until\nP\nj\narea(pj )\narea(Ci) \u2265\nPN\ni=0\narea(pi)\narea(C)\n.\nThe advantage of random assignment lies in ensuring that the overall characteristics of each\nsubproblem align with the original problem.\nC.

We repeatedly select one remaining polygon with the\nhighest priority (ties are broken by value) and try to insert it into the current solution. If the\ninsertion with lower-level packing optimization fails, we skip the current polygon and turn to\nthe next one. For the majority of instances, the priority is defined as the value-to-area ratio\nof a polygon (we also call it unit value). Polygons with higher unit values are prioritized\nfor putting in the container, which is called the Unit Value First (UVF) strategy. For\nsmall-scale instances (N < 100), we employ the \u03b1\u03b2-random strategy. It randomly selects\n\u03b1% and \u03b2% of the polygons and reassigns their UVF-based priority to the highest and the\nlowest, respectively. These instances are run for multiple times to ensure comprehensive\noptimization, with \u03b1 and \u03b2 set to 10 in our implementation.\n3.2 Lower-Level Packing Optimization\nThe position of a polygon can be represented by the coordinates l = (x, y) of a reference point,\nsuch as the bottom-left corner of the boundary. Then, the translation of a polygon can be\nrepresented by a vector pointing from its original position to its new position. Given a feasible\npacking S and a polygon p to be placed, it is impossible to find a non-overlapping position\nfor p without moving other polygons in most cases. This section introduces the algorithm for\neliminating overlaps for an invalid packing, which involves solving an unconstrained nonlinear\nproblem and heuristic polygon movement.\nS o C G 2 0 2 4\n86:4 A General Heuristic Approach for Maximum Polygon Packing\n3.2.1 Overlap Minimization\nTo determine the appropriate translation for the polygons, we utilized the no-fit polygon\n(NFP) and inner-fit polygon (IFP), which are fundamental in algorithmic approaches to\ngeometric design and optimization challenges. For a fixed polygon pi and a movable polygon\npj , NFP(pi, pj ) describes their non-overlapping positions with boundaries in contact precisely,\nwhich can be utilized to determine the minimum translation for pj to avoid overlap. Similarly,\nIFP(pi, pj ) is employed to determine the minimum translation to place pj inside pi. Figure 3\nillustrates the polygon translations determined using NFP (left) and IFP (right). The readers\nmay refer to Burke et al. [2] for a more detailed description.\nFor a packing S, based on NFP and IFP, we define the overlap between polygons pi\nand pj as fij (S), representing the minimum translation to separate them, and f0i(S) as the\nminimum translation for moving pi to fit into the container. Subsequently, we employ the\nseparation algorithm proposed by Imamichi et al. [7] to minimize the overlap, which involves\nsolving an unconstrained nonlinear programming problem as follows:\nmin\nS\nF(S) = X\n0\u2264i<j\u2264N\nf\n2\nij (S) (1)\nThe model relaxes the non-overlapping constraint but introduces repulsion forces between\nany two overlapped polygons. We use the classic L-BFGS (limited memory BFGS) method\nto solve this problem. It makes the packing S converge to a local optimum but strongly\ndepends on the initial layout. ...",

For large numbers of local optima, SA can find the global optimum.[&#91;1&#93;](#cite_note-1)It is often used when the search space is discrete (for example the[traveling salesman problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traveling_salesman_problem), the[boolean satisfiability problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_satisfiability_problem),[protein structure prediction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_structure_prediction), and[job-shop scheduling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Job-shop_scheduling)). For problems where a fixed amount of computing resource is available, finding an approximate global optimum may be more relevant than attempting to find a precise local optimum. In such cases, SA may be preferable to exact algorithms such as[gradient descent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent)or[branch and bound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_and_bound). The problems solved by SA are currently formulated by an[objective function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective_function)of many variables, subject to several[mathematical constraints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_constraints). In practice, a constraint violation can be penalized as part of the objective function.\nSimilar techniques have been independently introduced on several occasions, including Pincus (1970),[&#91;2&#93;](#cite_note-2)Khachaturyan et al. (1979,[&#91;3&#93;](#cite_note-3)1981[&#91;4&#93;](#cite_note-4)), Kirkpatrick, Gelatt and Vecchi (1983), and Cerny (1985).[&#91;5&#93;](#cite_note-5)In 1983, this approach was used by Kirkpatrick, Gelatt Jr., and Vecchi[&#91;6&#93;](#cite_note-:2-6)for a solution of the[traveling salesman problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traveling_salesman_problem). They also proposed its current name, simulated annealing.\nThe name of the algorithm comes from[annealing in metallurgy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annealing_(metallurgy)), a technique involving heating and controlled cooling of a material to alter its[physical properties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_properties). This notion of slow cooling implemented in the simulated annealing algorithm is interpreted as a slow decrease in the probability of accepting worse solutions as the solution space is explored. Accepting worse solutions allows for a more extensive search for the global optimal solution. Simulated annealing algorithms work by progressively decreasing the temperature from an initial positive value to zero. At each time step, the algorithm randomly selects a solution close to the current one, measures its quality, and moves to it according to the temperature-dependent probabilities of selecting better or worse solutions.\nThe simulation can be performed either by a solution of[kinetic equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kinetic_equations&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1)for[probability density functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_density_functions),[&#91;7&#93;](#cite_note-:0-7)[&#91;8&#93;](#cite_note-:1-8)or by using a[stochastic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic)sampling method.[&#91;6&#93;](#cite_note-:...",
