      "text": "Packing irregular polygons tightly in a two\u2011dimensional bin\u2011packing setting is usually tackled with a combination of constructive placement rules and powerful improvement heuristics.  Modern approaches start by generating an initial layout with a fast heuristic such as First\u2011Fit\u2011Decreasing (FFD) or a block\u2011generation step that groups two or more pieces into composite blocks, which helps to fill residual spaces more efficiently\u202f([Computers\u202f&\u202fOperations\u202fResearch\u202f2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0305054823002629)).  Once a feasible layout is obtained, a suite of local\u2011search moves\u2014bottom\u2011left placement, fine\u2011tuning shifts, piece\u2011exchange, replacement, and swap operations\u2014are applied to explore the neighbourhood of the solution and reduce waste\u202f([Computers\u202f&\u202fOperations\u202fResearch\u202f2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0305054823002629)).  When rotations are allowed, allowing unrestricted angles (rather than a fixed set) dramatically enlarges the search space and improves density, a strategy exploited by the Jostle algorithm and its diversified variants\u202f([Southampton\u202fePrints\u202f2018](https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/414392)).\n\nTwo families of meta\u2011heuristics have proven especially effective.  A local\u2011search heuristic combined with a genetic algorithm can simultaneously decide which heterogeneous stock sheets to use, how to allocate pieces to them, and how to orient each polygon; experiments show the local\u2011search component often outperforms the GA on solution quality\u202f([Southampton\u202fePrints\u202f2017](https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/415314)).  More recently, a knowledge\u2011reuse framework (KRIH) uses a twin\u2011neural\u2011network similarity measure to transfer piece\u2011ordering knowledge from solved instances to new ones, then refines the layout with an improved bottom\u2011left placement; this method matches or beats classical heuristics on the majority of benchmark sets while keeping computation time modest\u202f([Nature\u202f2024](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5)).\n\nFor problems that must respect guillotine cuts (common in sheet\u2011metal or glass cutting), constructive procedures that embed guillotine constraints into mixed\u2011integer programming models and then apply local search have shown superior results, especially when multiple bin sizes and free rotation are allowed\u202f([Omega\u202f2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0305048314001285)).  In practice, the most robust pipelines combine a fast constructive phase (FFD\u202f+\u202fblock generation), a rotation\u2011aware placement rule (enhanced bottom\u2011left or Jostle), and an intensive local\u2011search/knowledge\u2011reuse refinement, optionally wrapped in a genetic or evolutionary outer loop for large\u2011scale industrial instances.",

At its core is an innovative mixed integer programme model that places irregular pieces and defines guillotine cuts. The two-dimensional irregular shape bin [packing problem](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/packing-problem) with guillotine constraints arises in the glass cutting industry, for example, the cutting of glass for conservatories. Almost all cutting and packing problems that include guillotine cuts deal with rectangles only, where all cuts are orthogonal to the edges of the stock sheet and a maximum of two [angles of rotation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/angles-of-rotation) are permitted. The literature tackling packing problems with irregular shapes largely focuses on strip packing i.e. minimizing the length of a single fixed width stock sheet, and does not consider guillotine cuts. Hence, this problem combines the challenges of tackling the complexity of packing irregular pieces with free rotation, guaranteeing guillotine cuts that are not always orthogonal to the edges of the stock sheet, and allocating pieces to bins. To our knowledge only one other recent paper tackles this problem. We present a hybrid algorithm that is a constructive heuristic that determines the relative position of pieces in the bin and guillotine constraints via a mixed integer programme model. We investigate two approaches for allocating guillotine cuts at the same time as determining the placement of the piece, and a two phase approach that delays the allocation of cuts to provide flexibility in space usage. Finally we describe an improvement procedure that is applied to each bin before it is closed. This approach improves on the results of the only other publication on this problem, and gives competitive results for the classic rectangle bin packing problem with guillotine constraints.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe paper focuses on the two-dimensional bin packing problem (BBP) with irregular convex pieces and guillotine cuts. Guillotine cuts arise due to the cutting process of certain materials, where cuts are restricted to extend from one edge of the stock-sheet to another. This is commonly found in the glass cutting industry and research has almost exclusively focused on the cutting of rectangles where the cuts are orthogonal to the edges of the stock sheet. The problem tackled here is a generalized version of the rectangle single size stock sheet bin packing problem with guillotine constraints, where the pieces to be cut are irregular convex polygons and the guillotine cuts are not constrained to be orthogonal to the edges of the bin. We present a number of constructive heuristics that exploit a mixed integer programming (MIP) model for placing the pieces in the bin while satisfying all the geometric constraints and the guillotine cuts and provide comprehensive results for benchmark instances for this problem and the rectangular bin packing problem with guillotine cuts. The results are compared with the best in the literature and new lower bound is presented.\n\nThe motivation for tackling this problems arises in the cutting of glass sheets, for example, the glass panes for conservatories. Glass is cut by scoring and snapping the material. Each cut divides the sheet in two and is called a guillotine cut. As a result, only convex pieces can be cut directly. Since the properties of the material are homogeneous, pieces can be cut at any angle of rotation, and in some cases reflected. Typically, cutting plans involve multiple stock sheets. An example solution to this problem is given in Fig. 1. Note that the pieces must be removed by the guillotine cuts (in bold) in a specific order so that each cut begins and ends at the edge of the complete or divided stock sheet.\n\nThe requirement for guillotine cuts arise in many industries such as glass, wood boards or fibre glass for printed circuit boards. Each industrial setting implies a particular class of cutting and packing problem. For example, Malaguti et al. \\[15\\] consider a cutting stock problem with multiple stocksheets found in the wood industry, while Cui \\[8\\] tackles the cutting of metal of coils where a stock sheet is considered to have unrestricted length.\n\nThe literature tackling packing problems with irregular shapes largely focuses on strip packing i.e. minimizing the length of a single fixed width stock sheet, see \\[3\\], and does not consider guillotine cuts. Further, almost all cutting and packing problems that include guillotine cuts deal with rectangles only, where all cuts are orthogonal to the edges of the stock sheet and a maximum of two angles of rotation of the pieces are permitted. Hence, this problem combines the challenges of tackling the complexity of packing irregular pieces with free rotation, guaranteeing guillotine cuts that may or may not be orthogonal to the edges of the stock sheet, and allocating pieces to bins or stock sheets. To our knowledge, Han et al. \\[13\\] is the only other paper that tackles this problem. They propose two different construction heuristics. The first heuristic, they call a one-stage algorithm, constructs multiple parallel clusters of pieces by iteratively joining two blocks, where a block is either a piece or the convex hull of a cluster of pieces. Blocks are combined by matching pairs of edges and selecting the best match according to a dynamic solution evaluation function. Since each accepted match, starting with two individual pieces, is transformed into its convex block by taking the convex hull, the guillotine cut structure is always satisfied.

Despite a large number of studies on the two-dimensional irregular strip packing problem, much less attention has been paid to the two-dimensional irregular bin packing problem (2DIBPP), and most of the current research on 2DIBPP is about free rotations. However, limited by the texture of the material, sometimes only some specific degrees of rotations are allowed. To pack a set of irregular pieces with some specific degrees into multi-stock sheets and maximize the utilization, we propose a heuristic algorithm that combines some pieces into one block for packing and uses residual spaces with reference lines to help select the next piece to be packed. In order to further increase the utilization of bins, we adopt fine-tuning, movement, filling, replacement and swap operations, as well as partial and full repack strategies. The computational results show that the proposed algorithm can obtain superior results on the instances with small number of pieces, relatively large number of types of pieces, large bins and more specific degrees of rotations.\n\n## Introduction\n\nIrregular packing problems are also called nesting problems (Bennell and Oliveira, 2009). Irregular packing problems can be further divided into different variants based on various perspectives. W\u00e4scher et al. (2007) introduced six kinds of cutting and packing problems, namely Identical Item Packing Problem (IIPP) (Costa et al., 2009), Placement Problem (PP) (Romanova et al., 2019), Knapsack Problem (KP) (Baldacci et al., 2014), Open Dimension Problem (ODP) (Rodrigues and Toledo, 2017, Mundim et al., 2017, Wang et al., 2018), Cutting Stock Problem (CSP) (MirHassani and Bashirzadeh, 2015) and Bin Packing Problem (BPP) (Martinez-Sykora et al., 2017, Abeysooriya et al., 2018, Bennell et al., 2018).\n\nThis paper addresses the two-dimensional irregular bin packing problem (2DIBPP) where the pieces are irregular with concavities. Even though many studies have focused on the two-dimensional irregular packing problem in recent years, they are mainly about the irregular strip packing problem which is a type of ODP. In the strip packing problem, the width of the stock sheet is fixed and the objective is to minimize the total length (Rodrigues and Toledo, 2017, Cherri et al., 2016). However, in real life, manufactures often use multi-stock sheets (bins) with fixed dimensions, which is related to 2DIBPP. 2DIBPP is a type of BPP and can be classified as a two-dimensional Single Bin Size Bin Packing Problem (SBSBPP).\n\nRotation is an important attribute of pieces, and plays a vital role on the final packing patterns. For two-dimensional irregular packing problems, rotations are usually divided into {0,180} degrees, {0,90,180,270} degrees (Sato et al., 2019), and free rotations (Martinez-Sykora et al., 2017, Abeysooriya et al., 2018, Cherri et al., 2018). For example, in the garment industry, the rotation is restricted, while in glass and sheet metal cutting applications, free rotations are allowed. For three-dimensional irregular packing problems, the vertical direction is sometimes fixed but the horizontal direction can be rotated, that is, the bottom area is unchanged. For some specific situations, items can be rotated in any direction (Romanova et al., 2018).\n\nCurrently, most studies of the 2DIBPP are about free rotations. Martinez-Sykora et al. (2017) combined the free rotation of irregular pieces with the bin packing problem for the first time. Abeysooriya et al. (2018) applied Jostle algorithm and addressed simultaneously both the allocation of pieces and the placement of bins. However, due to the limitation of material texture, only some specific degrees of rotations are allowed. Liu et al. (2020) proposed a heuristic for 2DIBPP with limited rotations where the overlapping removal based placement was used. Zhang et al. (2022) proposed an iteratively doubling local search approach for 2DIBPP with limited rotations, including a least waste first decreasing strategy, a simple greedy local search approach and an overlap minimization approach. In this study, we also consider the 2DIBPP with limited rotations but design different heuristics to solve it.\n\nOur study makes several contributions to the literature. First, our paper is the first to introduce blocks to 2DIBPP, which were previously used for strip packing problems. We also extend to generate blocks with more than two pieces. The pieces are combined into blocks so that the shapes of the pieces can be complementary to reduce wasted bin space. Second, we are the first to apply residual spaces with reference lines to 2DIBPP to guide the selection of the next piece to pack. Third, a series of operations are used to further increase the utilization of bins, including fine-tuning, movement, filling and replacement for the placement of one bin, and swap between bins. Most of these operations are rarely used in the irregular packing problems. Fourth, to find better solutions without increasing too much computational time, we newly propose the partial and full repack strategies. Partial repack draws on previous experience to keep some of the higher utilization bins intact and only repack the remaining bins, while full repack throws away the experience and starts packing from the first empty bin. Finally, we can improve the best-known results for some benchmark instances.\n\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we define some notations and describe the problem. Section 3 introduces our heuristic method, including the block, residual spaces with reference lines, fine-tuning, movement, filling, replacement and swap operations, and partial and full repack strategies. In Section 4, we present the experimental data and the computational results. We summarize our conclusions and ...",

The classic packing solution is a hybrid algorithm based on heuristic positioning and meta-heuristic sequencing, which has the problems of complex solving rules and high time cost. In this study, the similarity measurement method based on the twin neural network model is used to evaluate the similarity of pieces in the source task and the target task. The reusability evaluation of packing tasks is designed to select appropriate source task knowledge. The transfer operator is used to transfer the piece sequence knowledge from the source task to complete the reuse of packing knowledge in the target task. The bottom-left algorithm is improved to complete the placement of 2D irregular pieces. The computational experiments show that the proposed algorithm for the bin packing problem using knowledge reuse and improved heuristic (KRIH) has good robustness. The KRIH algorithm can obtain 8 equal or better results on 16 instances in a relatively short time compared with some classical heuristic algorithms, which has good application potential.\n\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n\n### [A sampling-based winner determination model and algorithm for logistics service procurement auctions under double uncertainty](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-94748-x?fromPaywallRec=false)\n\nArticleOpen access08 April 2025\n\n### [Optimizing 2D irregular packing via image processing and computational intelligence](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-97202-0?fromPaywallRec=false)\n\nArticleOpen access10 April 2025\n\n### [Multi-objective steel plate cutting optimization problem based on real number coding genetic algorithm](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-27100-2?fromPaywallRec=false)\n\nArticleOpen access28 December 2022\n\n## Introduction\n\nPacking problems are commonly found in industries such as mechanical manufacturing, aviation, clothing, automotive manufacturing, shipbuilding, and furniture manufacturing. The manufacturing process of typical heavy industry products is shown in Fig.\u00a0[1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#Fig1). In actual production, efficient packing algorithms can improve the utilization of raw materials and reduce production costs within an acceptable time. In a sense, the reduction of raw material consumption can have a beneficial impact on the environment[1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#ref-CR1). Packing problems, also known as bin packing problems or nesting problems, can be divided into three categories[2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#ref-CR2): the one-dimensional (1D) packing problem (wire cutting stock problem)[3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#ref-CR3), [4](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#ref-CR4), the two-dimensional (2D) packing problem (planar packing problem)[5](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#ref-CR5), [6](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#ref-CR6) and the three-dimensional (3D) packing problem[7](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#ref-CR7). The 2D packing problem is an interesting combinatorial optimization problem, which is used to place pieces of different shapes on one or more plates according to certain rules to minimize the space occupied by pieces or maximize the utilization of raw materials. The pieces here are general terms. In the metal processing industry, it refers to the pieces to be processed. In the garment manufacturing industry, it refers to the sample to be cut. And in the logistics industry, it refers to the goods to be placed. The packing problem has a large solution space and is an NP-complete (NP-C) problem, and the optimal solution cannot be obtained in polynomial time[8](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#ref-CR8). According to the regularity of piece shape, 2D packing problems can be further divided into 2D regular and 2D irregular packing problems. Among them, 2D irregular packing problems have received widespread attention due to their more diverse piece shapes and complex packing operations. Compared with the rectangular packing problem, the 2D irregular piece packing problem is very different in constraint calculation, solution strategy, overlap detection, so it has a larger solution space and more complicated technical operation. The 2D irregular piece packing has more applications in actual production. For 2D irregular packing problems, the existing research focuses on finding the approximate optimal solution or satisfactory solution within an acceptable time. The solving of the 2D irregular packing problem often involves two stages: sequence optimization and position optimization. In the sequence optimization stage, the sequence of pieces arranged on the plate is optimized. In the position optimization stage, the final placement scheme of pieces on the plate is determined. Early solutions to the irregular packing problem include the polygonal envelope method[9](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#ref-CR9), clustering feature combination method, and fitting method[10](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#ref-CR10), etc. In the late 1970s, researchers began to study contour features based on the real shape of irregular pieces to judge the overlap between pieces. These methods include no-fit polygon (NFP)[11](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#ref-CR11), [12](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#ref-CR12), raster methods (also called pixel methods)[13](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#ref-CR13), linear programming (LP), and mixed-integer linear programming (MIP)[14](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#ref-CR14), [15](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#ref-CR15). Each method has its advantages, but the current mainstream method is NFP[16](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#ref-CR16). Burke E et al.[17](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#ref-CR17) designed an NFP algorithm capable of dealing with circular arcs, improved the track sliding method, and achieved good test results.\n\n**Fig. 1**\n\nThe manufacturing process of typical heavy industry products.\n\n[Full size image](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5/figures/1)\n\nIn the process of piece placement, commonly used positioning algorithms include the bottom-left (BL) algorithm[18](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#ref-CR18), the improving bottom-left (iBL) algorithm[19](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#ref-CR19), etc. Utilizing and improving the BL algorithm becomes one of the research points for solving 2D irregular packing problems. The sequence of piece placement is crucial for the final packing result. Therefore, the study of sequence optimization of the packing problem is another key point to improve the piece packing efficiency. Sequence optimization algorithm belongs to the meta-heuristic algorithm[20](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#ref-CR20), [21](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#ref-CR21) or intelligent algorithm, including simulated annealing algorithm[22](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#ref-CR22), tabu search algorithm[23](https://www.na...",

The problem consists of placing a set of pieces represented as 2D polygons in rectangular bins with different dimensions such that the total area of bins used is minimized. Most packing algorithms available in the literature for 2D irregular bin packing consider single size bins only. However, for many industries the material can be supplied in a number of standard size sheets, for example, metal, foam, plastic and timber sheets. For this problem, the cut plans must decide the set of standard size stock sheets as well as which pieces to cut from each bin and how to arrange them in order to minimise waste material. Moreover, the literature constrains the orientation of pieces to a single or finite set of angles. This is often an artificial constraint that makes the solution space easier to navigate. In this paper we do not restrict the orientation of the pieces. We show that the local search heuristic and the genetic algorithm can address all of these decisions and obtain good solutions, with the local search performing better. We also discuss the affect of different groups of stock sheet sizes.\n\nThis is a preview of subscription content, [log in via an institution](https://wayf.springernature.com?redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Fchapter%2F10.1007%2F978-3-319-68496-3_37%3Ferror%3Dcookies_not_supported%26code%3D6c4d7962-9a74-4c0e-ac70-bc76101d9408) to check access.\n\n## Access this chapter\n\n[Log in via an institution](https://wayf.springernature.com?redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Fchapter%2F10.1007%2F978-3-319-68496-3_37%3Ferror%3Dcookies_not_supported%26code%3D6c4d7962-9a74-4c0e-ac70-bc76101d9408)\n\nChapter\n\nUSD\u00a029.95\n\nPrice excludes VAT (USA)\n\n- Available as PDF\n- Read on any device\n- Instant download\n- Own it forever\n\nBuy Chapter\n\neBookUSD\u00a039.99Price excludes VAT (USA)\n\n- Available as PDF\n- Read on any device\n- Instant download\n- Own it forever\n\nBuy eBook\n\nSoftcover BookUSD\u00a054.99Price excludes VAT (USA)\n\n- Compact, lightweight edition\n- Dispatched in 3 to 5 business days\n- Free shipping worldwide - [see info](https://support.springernature.com/en/support/solutions/articles/6000233448-coronavirus-disease-covid-19-delivery-information)\n\nBuy Softcover Book\n\nTax calculation will be finalised at checkout\n\nPurchases are for personal use only\n\n[Institutional subscriptions](https://www.springernature.com/gp/librarians/licensing/agc/ebooks)\n\n## Preview\n\nUnable to display preview.\u00a0[Download preview\\\nPDF.](https://page-one.springer.com/pdf/preview/10.1007/978-3-319-68496-3_37)\n\nUnable to display preview.\u00a0[Download preview\\\nPDF.](https://page-one.springer.com/pdf/preview/10.1007/978-3-319-68496-3_37)\n\n## References\n\n01.

To solve the 2DIRBPP, we use the First Fit Decreasing (FFD) strategy to assign the pieces to the bins, then use the Bottom-Left algorithm and the pieces exchange method to place pieces into each bin, and finally perform a local search to improve the solution. The results show that our approach is competitive with all existing approaches on several sets of standard benchmark.\n\nThis is a preview of subscription content, [log in via an institution](https://wayf.springernature.com?redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Fchapter%2F10.1007%2F978-3-030-55789-8_24%3Ferror%3Dcookies_not_supported%26code%3Dca9db67e-e24f-4483-b361-fc0f877891e7)\nto check access.\n\n## Access this chapter\n\n[Log in via an institution](https://wayf.springernature.com?redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Fchapter%2F10.1007%2F978-3-030-55789-8_24%3Ferror%3Dcookies_not_supported%26code%3Dca9db67e-e24f-4483-b361-fc0f877891e7)\n\n## Subscribe and save\n\nSpringer+\n\nfrom $39.99 /Month\n\n- Starting from 10 chapters or articles per month\n- Access and download chapters and articles from more than 300k books and 2,500 journals\n- Cancel anytime\n\n[View plans](https://link.springer.com/product/springer-plus)\n\n## Buy Now\n\nChapter\n\nUSD\u00a029.95\n\nPrice excludes VAT (USA)\n\n- Available as PDF\n- Read on any device\n- Instant download\n- Own it forever\n\nBuy Chapter\n\neBookUSD\u00a0129.00Price excludes VAT (USA)\n\n- Available as EPUB and PDF\n- Read on any device\n- Instant download\n- Own it forever\n\nBuy eBook\n\nSoftcover BookUSD\u00a0169.99Price excludes VAT (USA)\n\n- Compact, lightweight edition\n- Dispatched in 3 to 5 business days\n- Free shipping worldwide - [see info](https://support.springernature.com/en/support/solutions/articles/6000233448-coronavirus-disease-covid-19-delivery-information)\n\nBuy Softcover Book\n\nTax calculation will be finalised at checkout\n\nPurchases are for personal use only\n\n[Institutional subscriptions](https://www.springernature.com/gp/librarians/licensing/agc/ebooks)\n\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n\n### [Efficient Local Search Heuristics for Packing Irregular Shapes in Two-Dimensional Heterogeneous Bins](https://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-319-68496-3_37?fromPaywallRec=true)\n\nChapter\u00a9 2017\n\n### [A hierarchical hyper-heuristic for the bin packing problem](https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00500-022-07118-4?fromPaywallRec=true)\n\nArticleOpen access07 May 2022\n\n### [Comparative Study of Heuristics for the One-Dimensional Bin Packing Problem](https://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-031-28999-6_19?fromPaywallRec=true)\n\nChapter\u00a9 2023\n\n### Explore related subjects\n\nDiscover the latest articles, books and news in related subjects, suggested using machine learning.\n\n- [Combinatorics](https://link.springer.com/subjects/combinatorics)\n- [Discrete Mathematics](https://link.springer.com/subjects/discrete-mathematics)\n- [Discrete Optimization](https://link.springer.com/subjects/discrete-optimization)\n- [Genome assembly algorithms](https://link.springer.com/subjects/genome-assembly-algorithms)\n- [Optimization](https://link.springer.com/subjects/optimization)\n- [Polytopes](https://link.springer.com/subjects/polytopes)\n\n## References\n\n01.

We hope that this review could provide guidance for researchers in the field of 2D irregular packing.\n## 1 Introduction\nTwo-dimensional (2D) irregular packing problems are widespread in industries such as machinery manufacturing, aviation, shipbuilding, automobile manufacturing, clothing and furniture manufacturing. An efficient 2D irregular packing algorithm can effectively improve material utilization and reduce processing costs. The reduction in material consumption will also have a beneficial impact on the environment ([Ke et al., 2020](#B76)). Therefore, research of the packing problem is of great significance for technology and social interest.\nThe 2D packing problem is a type of combinatorial optimization problems to locate parts with different shapes compactly in one or more master sheet material to minimize the occupied space or maximize the utilization of the material. The 2D packing problem is currently recognized as a NP problem, which is mainly solved by heuristic algorithms. In recent years, many scholars have conducted research on 2D irregular packing problems with a verity of solutions.\nThere exists a number of review articles on packing and cutting problems. We have summarized the main review literature in the field of 2D packing and cutting as shown in[Table 1](#T1). Brown ([Brown, 1971](#B17)) introduced an optimum packing and depletion problem with optimization of space and resource usage. Harvey ([Salkin and De Kluyver, 1975](#B116)) surveyed the application of mathematical optimization models such as linear programming to the knapsack problem. Bruce ([Golden, 1976](#B50)) surveyed various approaches to the cutting stock problem. Hinxman ([Hinxman, 1980](#B65)) surveyed the trim-loss and assortment problems, this research paid more attention to cutting and packaging problems in practical applications, and did not mention much about theoretical methods. Garey and Coffman ([Garey and Johnson, 1981](#B47);[Coffman et al., 1984](#B27)) surveyed the approximation algorithms for bin packing problems. Israni ([Israni and Sanders, 1982](#B72)) reviewed the 2D cutting stock problem including almost all 2D packaging problems. The author also proposed a rectangular layout method. Sarin ([Sarin, 1983](#B118)) reviewed methodologies and literature to solve 2D stock cutting problems and introduced an interactive optimization procedure for a general 2D stock cutting problem. Dyckhoff ([Dyckhoff et al., 1985](#B38)) described a trim loss and related problems and categorized them briefly. Dudzi&#x00144;ski ([Dudzi&#x00144;ski and Walukiewicz, 1987](#B36)) summarized the exact methods for knapsack problems, such as linear programming. Matthias ([Rode and Rosenberg, 1987](#B114)) analyzed the algorithm for the trim-loss problems. Haessler ([Haessler and Sweeney, 1991](#B59)) reviewed the solution process of cutting stock problems, including placement algorithm and sequence optimization algorithm. Dowsland ([Dowsland and Dowsland, 1992](#B34)) reviewed the application of operations research methods to the packing problem and summarized some exact heuristics. Sweeney ([Sweeney and Paternoster, 1992](#B128)) categorized cutting and packing problems and made application-oriented research records. Cheng ([Cheng et al., 1994](#B22)) discussed 2D cutting stock problems and their application cases including the pallet loading problem and VLSI placement problem. With the gradual deepening of research on 2D layout problems, typology becomes a common research topic. 2D regular and irregular layout problems are clearly distinguished in practical applications and theoretical methods. Dowsland ([Dowsland and Dowsland, 1995](#B29)) gave a special review of the 2D irregular nesting problem for the first time. Mavridou ([Mavridou and Pardalos, 1997](#B98)) summarized applications of the genetic algorithm and simulated annealing algorithm in the optimization of facility layout problems. Dyckhoff ([Dyckhoff, 1990](#B37)) made a typology of the cutting and packing problems in detail, and W&#x000e4;scher ([W&#x000e4;scher et al., 2007](#B135)) improved the typology later. Hopper ([Hopper and Turton, 1999](#B67);[Hopper and Turton, 2001a](#B68);[Hopper and Turton, 2001b](#B69)) investigated the application of meta-heuristic and heuristic algorithms in 2D and 3D packing problems. Lodi ([Lodi et al., 2002a](#B90);[Lodi et al., 2002b](#B91)) reviewed algorithms proposed in the 1990s of 2D packing problems. Bennell et al. ([Bennell and Oliveira, 2008](#B10);[Bennell and Oliveira, 2009](#B9)) discussed 2D irregular packing problems and related geometric problems. Leao ([Leao et al., 2020](#B81)) introduced the mathematical models in the 2D irregular packing problem.\nTABLE 1\n[![www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/966691/fmech-08-966691-HTML/image_m/fmech-08-966691-t001.jpg)](https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/966691/fmech-08-966691-HTML/image_m/fmech-08-966691-t001.jpg)\n**TABLE 1**. Review literature in the field of cutting and packing problems.\nThe scope of these reviews is broad, mainly for all 2D packing problems including rectangular packing and other regular packing problems. These review papers are out of date with missed innovative algorithms of 2D irregular packing. Since 2010, only Leao ([Leao et al., 2020](#B81)) reviewed 2D irregular packing problems. But he only introduced the mathematical models, instead of reviewing 2D irregular packing problems comprehensively. In recent years, there is not ...",
