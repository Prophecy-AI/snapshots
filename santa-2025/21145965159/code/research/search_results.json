      "text": "Kaggle winners tackling 2\u2011D packing challenges usually combine a fast constructive heuristic with a powerful meta\u2011heuristic that can \u201cshake\u201d the solution out of local minima.  A common pattern is to start with a bottom\u2011left or best\u2011fit placement (e.g., the classic Bottom\u2011Left or Best\u2011Fit\u2011Corner strategies) to obtain a feasible layout, then run an evolutionary or local\u2011search loop that repeatedly perturbs the item order, re\u2011applies the constructive step, and accepts improvements through simulated\u2011annealing\u2011type or tabu\u2011search acceptance criteria\u202f([IEEE Xplore](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6023883);\u202f[ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0377221706003018)).  \n\nRecent winning solutions go further by embedding learned knowledge or adaptive search policies.  One line of work re\u2011uses piece\u2011sequence knowledge from previously solved instances via a twin\u2011neural\u2011network similarity measure and a transfer operator, then feeds the transferred sequence into an improved Bottom\u2011Left algorithm, achieving consistently better scores on benchmark sets\u202f([Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5)).  Another successful approach treats the packing problem as a hyper\u2011heuristic: a deep\u2011reinforcement\u2011learning agent selects among a pool of low\u2011level heuristics (e.g., four\u2011corners, best\u2011fit, rotation) based on state features, learning a stage\u2011dependent policy that outperforms static heuristics\u202f([Expert Systems with Applications](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417423010709)).  Monte\u202fCarlo Tree Search (MCTS) has also been integrated with meta\u2011heuristics or neural nets to explore promising placement sequences while providing interpretable search trees, which helps guide perturbations away from stagnation\u202f([Journal of Heuristics](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10732-024-09525-2)).  \n\nIn practice, Kaggle winners stitch these ideas together: they run multiple random restarts, apply a hybrid GA\u2011LP or GA\u2011MCTS framework to evolve item orders, use adaptive perturbations such as the four\u2011corners heuristic to generate diverse neighborhoods, and employ learned or handcrafted scoring functions to prune unpromising branches.  The combination of a deterministic constructive baseline, aggressive diversification (knowledge transfer, RL\u2011driven heuristic selection, MCTS sampling), and disciplined intensification (local search, simulated annealing, tabu) is what enables top\u2011ranked teams to escape local optima and push the solution quality beyond what classic heuristics alone can achieve.",

The classic packing solution is a hybrid algorithm based on heuristic positioning and meta-heuristic sequencing, which has the problems of complex solving rules and high time cost. In this study, the similarity measurement method based on the twin neural network model is used to evaluate the similarity of pieces in the source task and the target task. The reusability evaluation of packing tasks is designed to select appropriate source task knowledge. The transfer operator is used to transfer the piece sequence knowledge from the source task to complete the reuse of packing knowledge in the target task. The bottom-left algorithm is improved to complete the placement of 2D irregular pieces. The computational experiments show that the proposed algorithm for the bin packing problem using knowledge reuse and improved heuristic (KRIH) has good robustness. The KRIH algorithm can obtain 8 equal or better results on 16 instances in a relatively short time compared with some classical heuristic algorithms, which has good application potential.\n\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n\n### [A sampling-based winner determination model and algorithm for logistics service procurement auctions under double uncertainty](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-94748-x?fromPaywallRec=false)\n\nArticleOpen access08 April 2025\n\n### [Optimizing 2D irregular packing via image processing and computational intelligence](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-97202-0?fromPaywallRec=false)\n\nArticleOpen access10 April 2025\n\n### [Multi-objective steel plate cutting optimization problem based on real number coding genetic algorithm](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-27100-2?fromPaywallRec=false)\n\nArticleOpen access28 December 2022\n\n## Introduction\n\nPacking problems are commonly found in industries such as mechanical manufacturing, aviation, clothing, automotive manufacturing, shipbuilding, and furniture manufacturing. The manufacturing process of typical heavy industry products is shown in Fig.\u00a0[1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#Fig1). In actual production, efficient packing algorithms can improve the utilization of raw materials and reduce production costs within an acceptable time. In a sense, the reduction of raw material consumption can have a beneficial impact on the environment[1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#ref-CR1). Packing problems, also known as bin packing problems or nesting problems, can be divided into three categories[2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#ref-CR2): the one-dimensional (1D) packing problem (wire cutting stock problem)[3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#ref-CR3), [4](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#ref-CR4), the two-dimensional (2D) packing problem (planar packing problem)[5](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#ref-CR5), [6](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#ref-CR6) and the three-dimensional (3D) packing problem[7](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#ref-CR7). The 2D packing problem is an interesting combinatorial optimization problem, which is used to place pieces of different shapes on one or more plates according to certain rules to minimize the space occupied by pieces or maximize the utilization of raw materials. The pieces here are general terms. In the metal processing industry, it refers to the pieces to be processed. In the garment manufacturing industry, it refers to the sample to be cut. And in the logistics industry, it refers to the goods to be placed. The packing problem has a large solution space and is an NP-complete (NP-C) problem, and the optimal solution cannot be obtained in polynomial time[8](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#ref-CR8). According to the regularity of piece shape, 2D packing problems can be further divided into 2D regular and 2D irregular packing problems. Among them, 2D irregular packing problems have received widespread attention due to their more diverse piece shapes and complex packing operations. Compared with the rectangular packing problem, the 2D irregular piece packing problem is very different in constraint calculation, solution strategy, overlap detection, so it has a larger solution space and more complicated technical operation. The 2D irregular piece packing has more applications in actual production. For 2D irregular packing problems, the existing research focuses on finding the approximate optimal solution or satisfactory solution within an acceptable time. The solving of the 2D irregular packing problem often involves two stages: sequence optimization and position optimization. In the sequence optimization stage, the sequence of pieces arranged on the plate is optimized. In the position optimization stage, the final placement scheme of pieces on the plate is determined. Early solutions to the irregular packing problem include the polygonal envelope method[9](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#ref-CR9), clustering feature combination method, and fitting method[10](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#ref-CR10), etc. In the late 1970s, researchers began to study contour features based on the real shape of irregular pieces to judge the overlap between pieces. These methods include no-fit polygon (NFP)[11](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#ref-CR11), [12](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#ref-CR12), raster methods (also called pixel methods)[13](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#ref-CR13), linear programming (LP), and mixed-integer linear programming (MIP)[14](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#ref-CR14), [15](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#ref-CR15). Each method has its advantages, but the current mainstream method is NFP[16](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#ref-CR16). Burke E et al.[17](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#ref-CR17) designed an NFP algorithm capable of dealing with circular arcs, improved the track sliding method, and achieved good test results.\n\n**Fig. 1**\n\nThe manufacturing process of typical heavy industry products.\n\n[Full size image](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5/figures/1)\n\nIn the process of piece placement, commonly used positioning algorithms include the bottom-left (BL) algorithm[18](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#ref-CR18), the improving bottom-left (iBL) algorithm[19](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#ref-CR19), etc. Utilizing and improving the BL algorithm becomes one of the research points for solving 2D irregular packing problems. The sequence of piece placement is crucial for the final packing result. Therefore, the study of sequence optimization of the packing problem is another key point to improve the piece packing efficiency. Sequence optimization algorithm belongs to the meta-heuristic algorithm[20](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#ref-CR20), [21](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#ref-CR21) or intelligent algorithm, including simulated annealing algorithm[22](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81749-5#ref-CR22), tabu search algorithm[23](https://www.na...",

The four corners\u2019 (FC) heuristic is specifically designed to increase the search efficiency of EAs. Experiments with the FC heuristic are conducted on 31 problems from the literature both with rotations permitted and without rotations permitted, using two different EA algorithms: a self-adaptive parallel recombinative simulated annealing (PRSA) algorithm, and a self-adaptive genetic algorithm (GA). Results on bin packing problems yield the smallest trim losses we have seen in the published literature; with the FC heuristic, zero trim loss was achieved on problems of up to 97 rectangles. A comparison of the self-adaptive GA to fixed-parameter GAs is presented and the benefits of self-adaption are highlighted.\n\n## Introduction\n\nTwo-dimensional (2D) packing problems occur in a wide range of industries. The goal is simply the optimal utilization of space or material available. In the garment and paper industries the problem is often to cut smaller pieces from a large roll of cloth or paper while reducing the scrap. In the wood, glass, and metal industries the task is not to cut from a roll, but to cut from a fixed size sheet or plate. In the semiconductor industry the task is VLSI floor planning with the goal being to optimize the use of space on the chip.\n\nThere are two major variants of the 2D packing problem: bin packing and strip packing. In the 2D bin packing variant, rectangles are to be packed in bins of given width and height, the goal being to minimize the number of bins used. In the 2D strip packing variant, rectangles must be packed in a fixed width, infinite height strip, the goal being to minimize the height. The bin packing variant is most suitable for the wood, glass, metal, and semiconductor industries, while the strip packing variant will generally apply to the paper and garment industries.\n\nAn important consideration is whether or not the rectangles can be rotated as they are placed. In the wood and garment industries one may care about the grain of the material and rotations may not be permitted. While in the paper, glass, and semiconductor industries there may be no particular restrictions. Allowing rotations adds flexibility and can result in a better packing, while at the same time apparently complicating the task.\n\nGiven the many permutations of 2D packing problems, most research focuses on a particular type of the packing problem: either bin packing or strip packing, with or without rotations. A recent survey of 2D packing problems is given by Lodi et al. (2002). A typology of cutting and packing problems is defined in W\u00e4scher et al. (2006).\n\nBeing NP-hard, the 2D packing problems are an attractive challenge for evolutionary algorithms (EA). For application to strip packing problems, Jakobs (1996) developed a genetic algorithm (GA) using the bottom-left (BL) packing method with support for rotation of rectangles. Hopper and Turton (2001) provide a comprehensive comparison of GA, simulated annealing (SA), na\u00efve evolution, and simple hill-climbing for the strip packing problem with rotations and for various BL methods. A recent paper by Lesh et al. (2004) gives a method to find strip packing solutions using an exact branch and bounds exhaustive search. They successfully find perfect packings (zero trim loss) for problem sizes up to 30 rectangles. In regards to bin packing problems, Babu and Babu (1999) use a GA and a BL packing heuristic. Recently, Leung et al. (2003) developed a mixed simulated annealing-genetic algorithm.\n\nIn this paper, we design the four corners\u2019 (FC) packing heuristic with the aim to increase the search efficiency of EAs when applied to bin packing problems. By the nature of the FC heuristic, the packings produced are non-guillotineable and bottom-left stability is not preserved. In this research we study only orthogonal packing problems, consisting of one bin with the goal to seek minimum trim loss. In the typology of cutting and packing problems as defined by W\u00e4scher et al. (2006), we deal with a two-dimensional, output maximization problem: we have one large rectangle of fixed dimensions, into which the value of the placed smaller rectangles (assumed proportional to area of the rectangle) must be maximized. The smaller rectangles are strongly heterogeneous and must be laid out orthogonally. Specifically, we study the two-dimensional single orthogonal knapsack problem.\n\nThe FC heuristic is tested with two different self-adapting EAs: a self-adapting parallel recombinative simulated annealing (PRSA) algorithm and a self-adapting GA. The results are presented both with and without support for rotations. The FC heuristic combined with the self-adapting PRSA algorithm is found to produce tighter packings than any of the methods we have seen published in the literature.\n\nThis paper is outlined as follows. In Section 2, an analysis on how EAs work on packing problems is performed and the EA-friendly four corners\u2019 packing heuristic is introduced. In Section 3, a detailed description of the EA components developed in this study is given. Section 4 describes details of the PRSA implementation. Section 5 describes the GA implementation. The remaining sections cover the experimental settings, results, and conclusions.\n\n## Section snippets\n\n## Designing the four corners\u2019 heuristic\n\nIn this section, we analyze how EAs commonly function on packing problems and propose a four corners\u2019 heuristic designed specifically for EAs. GAs are chosen as the representative EA for this discussion, however most of the principles apply in general to the many types of EAs. For example, SA can be implemented using the genome encoding and the mutation operators of a GA. An implementation of PRSA (see Section 4) could use both the mutation and crossover operators of a GA as is done in this\n\n## Common components of a self-adapting evolutionary algorithm\n\nThe PRSA and GA algorithms implemented in this paper share the genome structure, the crossover operators, mutation operators, and the fitness function.\n\n## Self-adaptive parallel recombinative simulate...",

Hyper-heuristic is a generic search framework, capable of intelligently selecting or generating algorithms to solve a class of optimisation problems with stochastic or dynamic settings. This paper proposes a new general framework for solving online packing problems using deep reinforcement learning hyper-heuristics. Although analytical approaches can address most offline packing problems successfully, their online versions have proved much more challenging and the performance of the existing methods is often not satisfactory. In this paper, we extend a recent deep reinforcement learning hyper-heuristic framework by fusing the visual information of real-time packing with distributional information of random parameters of the problem. Computational experiments show that our method outperforms the state of the art online methods with reductions in optimality gap between 2%\u201319% for knapsack problem and 0.7% for the online strip packing problem. In addition, a new visual analysis presentation is also devised to better interpret the learned packing strategies, which can reveal more information than the widely used landscape analysis. As online packing problems are widely available in production environments, the proposed approach can serve as an important reference to solve other similar combinatorial optimisation problems for which visual layout inputs would aid learning.\n\n- Previous article in issue\n- Next article in issue\n\n## Keywords\n\nHyper-heuristic\n\nDeep reinforcement learning\n\nFeature fusion\n\nKnapsack problem\n\nStrip packing problem\n\nRecommended articles\n\n## Data availability\n\nThe data that has been used is confidential.\n\n[1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/www.sciencedirect.com#bfn1)\n\nORCID: 0000-0002-9730-3563.\n\n[2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/www.sciencedirect.com#bfn2)\n\nORCID: 0000-0003-1722-568X.\n\n[3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/www.sciencedirect.com#bfn3)\n\nORCID: 0000-0002-2679-2275.\n\n[4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/www.sciencedirect.com#bfn4)\n\nORCID: 0000-0002-4152-6784.\n\n[5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/www.sciencedirect.com#bfn5)\n\nORCID: 0000-0002-6300-3503.\n\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

The goal of this optimization problem is to place a set of irregular\npolygons onto a material sheet without overlapping and in a way that minimizes wasted\nmaterial.\nIn this thesis, we delve into a fast 2D packing algorithm that automatically arranges\nparts of a user\u2019s design onto their available material sheets to provide live feedback on\nhow much material they have left. To do this, we make use of the concept of the no fit\npolygon to generate candidate placements, and we utilize custom heuristics and performance\noptimization to improve packing quality and runtime .\nOur technical evaluation shows that the implementation is fast enough to work at\ninteractive speeds and produce solutions of similar quality to other tools and algorithms that\nperform automated packing.\nThesis Supervisor: Stefanie Mueller\nTitle: Assistant Professor\n3\n4\nAcknowledgments\nFirst of all, I would like to extend my deepest gratitude to my advisor, Professor Stefanie\nMueller. She has been especially supportive during these trying times and has always been\navailable to give guidance and instruction. I would also like to give the hugest of thank yous\nto Ticha Sethapakdi and Daniel Anderson without whom this thesis could not have been\npossible. Ticha was the mastermind of Fabricaide and its user interface, and also somehow\nsimultaneously manages to be one of the coolest and one of the most awkward people I\nknow. Dan was always available to provide guidance and support in wrangling with C++\nand other difficult aspects of the implementation. Even outside the context of working on\nFabricaide, Ticha and Dan have been great friends and role models throughout the time I\ngot to know them. I could not have asked for a better group of mentors and colleagues than\nProfessor Mueller, Ticha and Dan.\nI am extremely grateful to my friends and family both here in the MIT community as\nwell as back home in the Philippines all the way at the other side of the world. I am thankful\nfor all the love and concern I\u2019ve received from them in spite of current circumstances.\nFinally, I would like to thank the rest of the Human Computer Interaction Engineering\nGroup for creative such a fun and welcoming environment. Be it sharing and discussing\nideas during lab meetings or hitting the dance floor with Just Dance for celebrations, I have\nnever had a boring moment with this great group of people.\nLanguage and Figure Note\nThroughout this thesis, I use the word \u201cwe\u201d to signify that this work has been a group effort.\nHowever, the work that is provided in detail is my own. Figures and images were jointly\ncreated by the project team.\n5\n6\nContents\n1 Introduction 13\n2 Related Work 15\n2.1 Preparing Designs for Laser Cutting . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 15\n2.2 Arranging Parts of a 2D Design . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 16\n3 Packing Algorithm 19\n3.1 Preliminaries . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 19\n3.1.1 No Fit Polygons . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 19\n3.1.2 Applying NFPs to the Packing Problem . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 20\n3.1.3 Bin Selection . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 21\n3.2 Overview . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 23\n3.3 Implementation . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 24\n3.3.1 Sheets with Holes . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 24\n3.3.2 Basic Part Placement Algorithm . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 24\n3.3.3 Order and Rotations of Parts . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 25\n3.3.4 Heuristics . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 29\n3.3.5 Placement across Multiple Sheets . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 30\n3.3.6 Partial Packing . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 32\n3.3.7 Complexity Analysis . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 33\n3.4 Implementation Optimizations . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 35\n3.4.1 Caching of NFPs . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 35\n3.4.2 Incremental Heuristic Calculation . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 36\n7\n3.4.3 Shape Dilation and Simplification . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 36\n3.5 Technical Evaluation of Part Placement Algorithm . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 37\n3.5.1 Benchmark Dataset . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 37\n3.5.2 Benchmark Setup . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 38\n3.5.3 Evaluation of Runtime . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 38\n3.5.4 Evaluation of Solution Quality . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 39\n3.5.5 Additional Evaluation for Standard Datasets . . . . . . . . . . . . . 40\n4 Fabricaide System Overview 43\n4.1 Core System Features . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 43\n4.1.1 Drawing Parts and Assigning Materials . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 43\n4.1.2 Live Packing Previews . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 44\n4.1.3 Material Warnings and Suggested Substitutes . . . . . . . . . . . . 46\n4.1.4 Material Utilization . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 47\n4.2 Implementation . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 47\n4.2.1 Splitting a Design into Constituent Materials . . . . . . . . . . . . 47\n4.2.2 Calculating Material Utilization . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 48\n4.3 Qualitative Evaluation of Fabricaide . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 49\n4.3.1 User Study Procedure . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 49\n4.3.2 User Study Findings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 49\n5 Conclusions 53\n8\nList of Figures\n3-1 A fixed-position polygon (black), a polygon to place (gray), and their NFP\n(red).

You saw an interesting challenge or the big prize money but feel a bit lost about how to tackle the competition ?\nThis blog provides a broad overview of Kaggle competitions, guides you through the winning methodologies, and offers tips and tricks to help you tackle a Kaggle competition more effectively.\n## All you need to know about Kaggle competitions\n![](https://dataroots.ghost.io/content/images/2023/06/Untitled-1.png)Kaggle competition overview page\n\ud83d\udca1Kaggle is a platform where data enthusiasts come together to explore and analyse datasets and participate in machine learning competitions. The platform is a fun and collaborative space that encourages learning, problem-solving, and innovation.\nWhile Kaggle has grown substantially over the last few years to a more all-round data science hub, the competitions were and remain Kaggle\u2019s raison d\u2019\u00eatre and come in all shapes and forms but can be divided into three main (albeit slightly arbitrary) categories: getting-started , community competitions, and cash prize competitions.\nFirstly there are the**getting-started competitions**, such as the[Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic?ref=dataroots.ghost.io)or[Digit Recognizer](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer?ref=dataroots.ghost.io)ones. These are meant more as a sandbox with a well-defined goal to allow newcomers to become familiar with ML concepts, libraries and the Kaggle ecosystem in a fun way. Together with the**community competitions**, where someone just had an idea for an interesting competition, these generally list \u201ckudos\u201d, \u201cswag\u201d or \u201cknowledge\u201d as their prizes with the reasoning that the journey and knowledge gained on the way are more important than the destination.\nWhat actually tends to attract people to Kaggle are the**competitions with cash prizes**. These \u00a0attach prize money to top leaderboard spots and are usually set up by companies or research institutes that actually want a problem solved and would like the broader audience to take a shot at this. With prizes ranging from a few 100\u2019s to multiple 100 000\u2019s of dollars, these attract some of the best in their respective fields, which makes competing challenging but very rewarding.\nEvery single one of those competitions is defined by a**dataset**and an**evaluation score**. Here the labels from the dataset define the problem to be solved and the evaluation score is the single objective measure that indicates how well a solution solves this problem (and that will be used to rank the solutions for the leaderboard).\nWhile the********************train set********************is publicly available, the data used to evaluate solutions is not and is usually divided into two parts. First there is the**public leaderboard test set**which is used to calculate leaderboard scores while the competition is still going on. This can be used by teams to check how well their solution performs on unseen data and verify their validation strategy. Secondly there is the**private leaderboard test set.**This is used to calculate the private leaderboard scores, which decides ones actual final place, and these are only disclosed after the competition ended.\nThis not only prevents fine-tuning on the test data but also keeps things exiting since leaderboards can completely change last minute if people did (either intentionally or not) do this anyway. The resulting shuffle usually makes for some interesting drama where long-reigning champions fall from grace and unnoticed underdogs, who kept best practices in mind, suddenly rise to the top.\n### Notebooks\nTo compete one can either work on private resources (such as a local machine or cloud-hosted vm or compute instance) or use a Kaggle notebook.\nPrivate resources do have some advantages since one has full freedom about the environment, packages, etc. Especially if you want to use packages such as MLFlow or Tensorboard, which do not work in the Kaggle notebooks. Next to this, not having a limit to running times, memory and disk space can be quite convenient.\nThe Kaggle notebooks are Jupyter notebooks running on a maintained and standardised environment, hosted by Kaggle and they come with unlimited, free CPU time (with session limits of 12h) and 30h of GPU time (per user) each week for most of your parallel computing needs. This ensures that everybody who wants to compete can compete and is not limited by their hardware, which makes the competitions as democratic as possible. Additionally, you can easily import Kaggle datasets in a few seconds, which is especially convenient for the larger ones which can easily exceed 100s of GBs. Finally they are also the way to submit a solution to the competition. The submission notebook will have to read in a (private )test set and generate predictions on this set that will be used to calculate the leaderboard score. So even if you work on your own resources for training and fine-tuning, you will have to convert your code to a Kaggle notebook eventually.\n## How to take the W in a Kaggle competition ?\nIt is a matter of approach taken and how many of your ideas you could try out to finish high on the leaderboard !\nWe participated in the[Vesuvius Challenge - Ink Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/c/vesuvius-challenge-ink-detection?ref=dataroots.ghost.io)competition. While we did not win any prizes, some of the top Kaggle competitors shared their solutions after the competition ended. The methodology used by the winners seems to be more or less the same across the board. Interested to know them ? Let\u2019s break them down in few simple steps !\n### 1. Have a good understanding of the competition and how to tackle the problem\nAs the people who are organising these competitions often already spend a lot of time finding a good solution themselves, a ton of material might be already available. We would recommend you to:\n* Read the competition overview and linked resources thoroughly\n* Get familiar with the data. Look at samples, plot statistics, all the usual EDA\n* Check existing literature on approaches that were tried/succeeded in solving this or similar problems### 2. Get inspired by other participants\u2019 work to get started\nTo earn Kaggle medals or because they are genuinely nice, some competitors share their knowledge through making notebooks and datasets public or sharing findings and insights in discussions to get \u201cupvotes\u201d. We recommend reading the ones that got a lot of upvotes. This step is really a must as there are so much things to try out to improve your result it is impossible to cover everything with your team.\n![](https://dataroots.ghost.io/content/images/2023/06/Untitled--1--1.png)Go in the \"Code\" section of the competition page. You can select notebooks with the most votes and check the number of upvotes on the right side of the notebook\nBased on your readings, choose a clear and simple notebook with a decent LB score as**baseline**. Try to come up with a strategy on how to improve this baseline based on your thoughts and what you read from the shared work.\n### 3. Improve your model in an efficient way\nIn this phase, you will experiment a lot in the hopes of improving your LB. The goal here is to maximise the number of experiments you will try in a limited amount of time !\n##### Create datasets for intermediate results / preprocessed data\nSaved preprocessed datasets and trained models will make your results comparis...",
