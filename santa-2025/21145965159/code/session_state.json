A common baseline is the **bottom\u2011left placement strategy**, which orders pieces and then inserts each one as far down and to the left as possible while respecting geometry; this simple rule underlies many practical algorithms for general\u2011shape packing\u202f([taylorfrancis.com](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.1201/9781351236423-33/practical-algorithms-two-dimensional-packing-general-shapes-yannan-hu-hideki-hashimoto-shinji-imahori-mutsunori-yagiura)).  Building on that, the **Djang\u2011Finch (DJD) heuristic**\u2014originally for 1\u2011D bin packing\u2014has been adapted to irregular 2\u2011D items and paired with a placement routine, yielding results that outperform conventional selection heuristics on convex\u2011polygon instances\u202f([springer.com](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10479-013-1341-4)).",
