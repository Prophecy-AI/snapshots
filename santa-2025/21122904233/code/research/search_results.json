      "text": "Packing irregular polygons into a square is tackled most effectively by a handful of algorithmic families, each trading off solution quality, runtime, and geometric flexibility.  **Heuristic placement rules** such as the classic bottom\u2011left strategy and its refinement\u202f\u2013\u202fthe lowest\u2011gravity\u2011center policy built on a fast No\u2011Fit\u2011Polygon (NFP) computation\u202f\u2013\u202fare very fast and can handle arbitrary rotations and holes, but they usually give modest area\u2011utilisation ratios\u202f([Result\u202f1](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.1201/9781351236423-33/practical-algorithms-two-dimensional-packing-general-shapes-yannan-hu-hideki-hashimoto-shinji-imahori-mutsunori-yagiura), [Result\u202f2](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1141277.1141507)).  \n\n**Meta\u2011heuristic approaches** (genetic algorithms, particle\u2011swarm optimisation, and related swarm\u2011based methods) explore many placement sequences and often achieve near\u2011optimal utilisation on benchmark sets, at the cost of higher CPU time.  A PSO\u2011driven sequence optimiser combined with a conventional placement phase beats or matches the best known solutions on 10 of 31 test instances\u202f([Result\u202f8](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/ffde/6265dfb61c0be38b1259a451269bb06b006b.pdf)), while a hybrid GA\u2011local\u2011minimisation scheme reported in the literature also shows strong performance for irregular nesting\u202f([Result\u202f2](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1141277.1141507)).  \n\n**Exact and advanced local\u2011search methods** provide provably optimal or very tight bounds but scale poorly with instance size.  A branch\u2011and\u2011bound framework can guarantee optimal cuts for small\u2011to\u2011medium problems\u202f([Result\u202f7](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0925527313001692)), whereas an extended local\u2011search algorithm that embeds nonlinear programming yields high\u2011quality solutions with reasonable runtimes for larger strip\u2011packing cases\u202f([Result\u202f5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0305054811001596)).  \n\nFinally, **raster\u2011based techniques** such as the COMPACT method represent polygons on a pixel grid, allowing arbitrary rotations and enabling unconstrained optimisation that directly maximises internal contact and boundary filling; this approach is especially attractive when implementation simplicity and flexibility outweigh the discretisation error\u202f([Result\u202f9](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.05148)).  \n\nIn practice, the \u201cbest\u201d choice depends on the problem size and required precision: use fast NFP\u2011based heuristics for quick, decent layouts; meta\u2011heuristics (GA/PSO) when higher utilisation is needed and time permits; branch\u2011and\u2011bound or nonlinear\u2011programming local search for small instances demanding optimality; and raster/COMPACT methods when arbitrary rotations and easy coding are priorities.",

Compared with existing algorithms, the proposed NFP algorithm has lower time-complexity and higher robustness due to the introduction of trace lines. The proposed lowest-gravity-center policy places a piece to the position which has the lowest gravity center based on NFP. Compared with the bottom-left piece placement policy, the proposed lowest-gravity-center policy results in a relatively flat boundary for the pieces. The proposed nesting algorithm can deal with pieces with arbitrary rotation and holes. It achieved competitive layout solutions both in nesting pattern height and area-utilization ratio.\n\n## References\n\n\\[1\\]\n\nE. Hopper and B. C. H. Turton.

It adopts two neighborhoods, swapping two given polygons in a placement and placing one polygon into a new position. The local search algorithm is used to minimize the overlap on the basis of the neighborhoods mentioned above and the unconstrained[nonlinear programming](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/nonlinear-programming)model is adopted to further minimize the overlap during the search process. Moreover, the[tabu](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/tabu)search algorithm is used to avoid[local minima](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/local-minimum), and a compact algorithm is presented to improve the result. The results of standard test instances indicate that when compared with other existing algorithms, the presented algorithm does not only show some signs of competitive power but also updates several best known results.\n## Introduction\nThe irregular strip packing problem, also known as the nesting problem, has a wide area of applications. Given a set of irregular shapes and a rectangular strip with a fixed width and an arbitrary length, the target of the two-dimensional irregular strip packing problem is to place all shapes within the strip such that the length of the strip is minimized and the irregular shapes do not overlap. A classic example application is clothing industry. Several pieces of clothes will be cut from a roll of fabric and the objective is to minimize the waste of fabric. The fabric has a fixed width and its length can be generally assumed infinite; so the problem is to minimize the length required for producing the specified number of irregular shapes.\nThe irregular strip packing problem is a NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem [1]. Numerous papers on nesting problem have been published since the first paper by Art [2]. Meta-heuristics are often used to solve this problem. Hopper and Turton [3] reviewed these methods, and a summary of geometric methods was published by Bennell and Oliveira [4]. As research progressed, further breakthroughs in algorithms for this problem have achieved in recent years. When compared with the previous years, these solutions have markedly improved the effect and speed of nesting results. The typical methods include Burke et al. [5], Gomes and Oliveira [6], Egeblad et al. [7], Imamichi et al. [8], etc.\nAlbano and Sapuppo [9] proposed an algorithm that places each shape at the bottom-left position, and the sequence of places is obtained by tree search. Jakobs [10] proposed a two-stage solution which first generates the rectangular enclosure of each irregular shape, and then finds the placement for these enclosures through a genetic algorithm. Secondly, a shrinking algorithm moves the shapes to another one as close as possible using the idea of the bottom-left heuristic. Gomes and Oliveira [11] based on bottom-left heuristic and find a good placement by exchanging two shapes in the layout. Dowsland et al. [12] developed a compact algorithm to improve the bottom-left heuristic algorithm. The algorithm first gets the initial placement by the bottom-left heuristic, and then uses a shaking process to compact the placement. Burke et al. [5] presented a new bottom-left heuristic algorithm based on discretization, and combination with hill climbing or tabu search to get a high quality solution. This algorithm can also pack the shapes with circular arcs and holes. Egeblad et al. [7] proposed an efficient fast local search method whose neighborhood is any horizontal or vertical translation of a given shape. They also formulated a polynomial time algorithm to find a translation with minimum overlap area between the given polygon and the other polygons in the current placement. Gomes and Oliveira [6] presented a separation algorithm to locally optimize the placement based on linear programming models, and used simulated annealing to guide the search. A new separation algorithm based on unconstrained nonlinear programming is proposed by Imamichi et al. [8]. They also designed an algorithm that swaps two polygons in a placement, and then the algorithms are combined as a component into an iterated local search algorithm for the overlap minimization problem. This method yielded several best known results on the standard test instances. Our algorithm is based on a separation algorithm presented by Imamichi et al. [8], and local search is adopted to guide the search. Moreover, a tabu search algorithm is used to avoid local minima and a compacted algorithm is used to improve the packing results.\n## Section snippets\n## Formulation\nIn this section, some fundamental elements of geometry are first defined, before formulation of the irregular strip packing problem algorithm is given.\n**Definition 1 (point)**\nA point*p*in two-dimensional space is represented by a pair:p=(px,py)\u2208R2.\n**Definition 2 (line segment)**\nA line segment*s*is a point set defined by two endpoints*p**a*and*p**b*:s={p\u2208R2,t\u2208[0,1]|p=pa+t(pb\u2212pa)}.\n**Definition 3 (polygon)**\nA polygon is a plane figure bounded by a closed path composes of a finite sequence of line segments denoted by*S*.

Research publications on these problems are relatively scarce compared with other cutting and packing problems with rectangular shapes, and are focused mostly on heuristic approaches. In this paper we make a systematic study of the problem and develop an exact Branch &amp; Bound Algorithm. The initial existing mixed integer formulations are reviewed, tested and used as a starting point to develop a new and more efficient formulation. We also study several branching strategies, lower bounds and procedures for fixing variables, reducing the size of the problem to be solved at each node. An extensive computational study allows us first to determine the best strategies to be used in the Branch &amp; Bound Algorithm and then to explore its performance and limits. The results show that the algorithm is able to solve instances of up to 16 pieces to[optimality](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/optimality).\n## Introduction\nNesting problems are two-dimensional cutting and packing problems involving irregular shapes. These problems arise in a wide variety of industries like garment manufacturing, sheet metal cutting, furniture making and shoe manufacturing. The wide range of applications implies many different variants of the problem. The placement areas into which the pieces have to be packed or cut can be rectangular, as in the case of materials provided in rolls, or can have irregular shapes, as in the case of leather hides for making shoes. This placement area can have a uniform quality or different qualities depending on the region, including sometimes defective parts that cannot be used for pieces. The pieces to be cut can be described as polygons, convex or not, or can include curved edges. Depending on the real application, the pieces can be rotated freely, at specific angles only (90\u00b0, 180\u00b0, \u2026), or not rotated at all. There may also be different objectives, usually involving the minimization of the area required for cutting the pieces or the maximization of the value of the pieces cut. Using the typology proposed by W\u00e4scher et al. (2007), nesting problems, in general, are open-dimension problems with irregular pieces.\nIn this paper we consider a nesting problem in which we have to arrange a set of two-dimensional irregular shapes without overlapping in a rectangular stock sheet of a fixed width, where the objective is to minimize the required length. We will consider the pieces to be described as polygons, not necessarily convex, which cannot be rotated.\nThe main difficulty of nesting problems is to ensure that the pieces have a non-overlapping configuration. This question has been studied extensively in recent years and there are several approaches which determine when two polygons overlap. Bennell and Oliveira (2008) give a tutorial on the different approaches which study the geometry of nesting problems. The problem is NP-complete and as a result solution methodologies predominantly utilize heuristics.\n*Pixel/Raster*methods transform the continuous stock sheet into a discrete grid represented by a matrix, and the position of each piece adds a given coded value to each matrix element. Identifying possible overlapping comes down to checking the matrix values. There are three known codification schemes the first one proposed by Segenreich and Braga (1986), the second one by Oliveira and Ferreira (1993), and the last one by Babu and Babu (2001).\nWhen pieces are represented (or approximated) using polygons, there are tests for edge intersection and for point inclusion that can be used for identifying overlapping (Konopasek, 1981, Ferreira et al., 1998). The most widely used tool for checking whether two polygons overlap is the No-Fit Polygon (NFP). It can be used, along with the vector difference of the position of the two polygons, to determine whether these polygons overlap, touch or are separated, by conducting a simple test to identify whether the resulting vector is inside the NFP. There are three approaches to generating the NFP the orbiting algorithm by Mahadevan (1984), improved by Burke et al. (2007); the Minkowski sums used by Milenkovic et al. (1991) and Bennell and Dowsland (2001); and the decomposition into star-shaped polygons (Daniels et al., 1994) or convex polygons (Watson and Tobias, 1999, Agarwal et al., 2002).\nA more general tool that generalizes the NFP is the*Phi-function*. Its purpose is to represent all the mutual positions of two polygons. The*Phi-functions*for cutting and packing were conceived of and applied by Stoyan et al., 2001, Stoyan et al., 2004, Scheithauer et al. (2005). Bennell et al. (2010) provide a good explanation of how the*Phi-functions*can be built, as well as some applications for them.\nMany different heuristic and metaheuristic approaches have been proposed for solving nesting problems. Simple heuristic rules are used for building a solution step by step, placing one piece at a time, using different placement procedures and different piece sequences. Metaheuristic procedures are used for working with complete solutions and modifying them iterat...",

The problem is to assign, a \nset of 2-D irregular-shaped items to a rectangular sheet. The width of the sheet is fixed, while its length is extendable \nand has to be minimized. A sequence-based approach is developed and tested. The approach involves two phases; opti\u0002mization phase and placement phase. The optimization phase searches for the packing sequence that would lead to an \noptimal (or best) solution when translated to an actual pattern through the placement phase. A Particle Swarm Optimi\u0002zation algorithm is applied in this optimization phase. Regarding the placement phase, a combined algorithm based on \ntraditional placement methods is developed. Competitive results are obtained, where the best solutions are found to be \nbetter than, or at least equal to, the best known solutions for 10 out of 31 benchmark data sets. A Statistical Design of \nExperiments and a random generator of test problems are also used to characterize the performance of the entire algo\u0002rithm. \nKeywords: Cutting and Packing; Irregular Strip Packing; Nesting; Placement Procedures; Particle Swarm Optimization \n1. Introduction \nThe problem of packing or cutting out shapes with \nminimal waste is a classical problem that exists in many \nindustrial fields. Common applications are found in sheet \nmetal, leather, furniture, shipbuilding, and textile Indus\u0002tries. Cutting stock, trim loss, bin packing, strip packing, \npallet loading, nesting, and knapsack problems, are all \nrelated names for cutting and packing problems. The first \ngeneral classification for cutting and packing problems is \nintroduced in Dychkoff [1]. Dychkoff developed a spe\u0002cial classification for cutting and packing problems in \nwhich he called it a typology. Recently, an improved \ntypology was developed by W\u00e4scher [2], which is par\u0002tially based on Dyckhoff\u2019s original one, but it adopts new \ncategorization criteria. \nThe scope of this research is the two-dimensional Ir\u0002regular Strip Packing Problem which is classified as an \nOpen Dimension Problem (ODP), according to W\u00e4scher\u2019s \nimproved typology. The problem is to assign (cut or \npack), a set of two-dimensional irregular-shaped items to \na rectangular object (sheet for cutting or container for \npacking). The width of the object is fixed, while its \nlength is extendable and has to be minimized. A typical \napplication for this problem is found in the textile Indus\u0002try under the name \u201cMarker-Making\u201d. Another popular \nname is \u201cNesting\u201d which has been, and still, used by \nmany authors for the Irregular Strip Packing Problems, \nand even for other irregular cutting and packing prob\u0002lems in general. The problem is schematically demon\u0002strated in Figure 1, where the best arrangement for the \ngiven items into the strip to minimize the pattern length \nis sought. \nThe 2-D rectangular packing problem has been shown \nby Fowler et al. [3] to be NP-complete. As the irregular \ncase is more complex, hence it could also be considered \nas NP-complete, and as a result they are practically tack\u0002led through heuristic approaches. Two main heuristic \napproaches are applied; sequence-based approach and \ndirect approach. The first approach utilizes an optimiza\u0002tion technique to find the packing sequence of items that \nwould lead to the best possible pattern when employed \nunder a certain placement method (Babu and Babu [4], \nFischer and Dagli [5], Takahara et al. [6], and Burke et al. \n[7]). While the second approach heuristically builds an \ninitial pattern that may not be a feasible one, and an op\u0002timization technique is directly applied to the items posi\u0002tions seeking the best possible feasible pattern (Bennell \nand Dowsland [8], Gomes and Oliveira [9], Immamichi \net al. [10], and Umetani et al. [11]). \nOther solution approaches are found in the literature \nthat could not be categorized under any of the two main \napproaches mentioned above. These approaches involve; \nmathematical programming approach followed by Grinde \nCopyright \u00a9 2013 SciRes. AJOR\nM. A. SHALABY, M. KASHKOUSH 269\nSheet Width \nSheet Length (Open) Pattern length \nFigure 1. A schematic illustration for the 2-D irregular strip \npacking problem. \nand Daniels [12] and Fischetti and Luzzi [13], Constraint \nLogic Programming (CLP) approach followed by Carra\u0002villa et al. [14], and dynamic sequence-based approach \nfollowed by Oliveira et al. [15], and Bennell and Song \n[16]. \nDeveloping a geometrical technique for handling the \ngraphical aspects of irregular shapes is used to be the \nmain obstacle among extending the research in this \nproblem, compared to the regular cutting and packing \none. Three geometry handling techniques are widely \nused in the literature. Pixel or Raster Method is an ap\u0002proximate method that is employed by Jain and Gea [17], \nBabu and Babu [4], and Fischer and Dagli [5]. Direct \ntrigonometry techniques are used by Hifi and M\u2019Hallah \n[18], Takahara et al. [6], and Burke et al. [7]. A more \nsophisticated technique is the no-fit polygon which is \napplied by Oliveira et al. [15], Bennell and Song [16], \nand Imamichi et al. [10]. \nMany authors used to incorporate meta-heuristic \nsearch techniques in their solution algorithms. Three \nmain meta-heuristics are commonly used with irregular \ncutting and packing problems, they are; Genetic Algo\u0002rithm (Jakobs [19], Hifi and M\u2019Hallah [18], and Hu-yao \nand Yuan-jun [20]), Simulated Annealing (Oliveira and \nFerreira [21], Han and Na [22], Heckmann and Lengauer \n[23], and Gomes and Oliveira [9]), and Tabu Search \n(Blazewicz et al. [24], Bennell and Dowsland [8], and \nBurke et al. [7]). \nFrom the above review, much interest could be noticed \nin the Irregular Strip Packing Problem for the last few \nyears. This could be attributed to two main reasons; \nfirstly, until now, no optimal solution could be found for \na real-sized problem, a very small improvement in a \ngiven arrangement in a cutting or packing operation \ncould save a considerably large amount of money. Sec\u0002ondly, is the significant increase in the capabilities of \nmodern computational engines, which made it available \nto apply techniques that would be impractical to apply 15 \nyears ago. Several heuristic and meta-heuristic optimiza\u0002tion techniques have been applied and investigated with \nthe problem. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algo\u0002rithm, originally introduced by Kennedy and Eberhart \n[25], is a lately developed stochastic optimization tech\u0002nique that has proved good performance in various opti\u0002mization fields, but has not been applied to a Strip Pack\u0002ing Problem or any cutting or packing problem. This \nresearch investigates the performance of PSO to find a \ncompetitive (or even better) performance to the existing \napproaches. \n2. Proposed Solution Approach \nThe solution approach proposed in this paper, which is \ngiven the name \u201cSwarmNest\u201d, is a sequence-based ap\u0002proach that consists of two phases; optimization phase \nand placement phase. SwarmNest assumes only hole-free \npolygons that are allowed to rotate by increments of 90\u02da. \nFor the optimization phase, a Particle Swarm Optimi\u0002zation (PSO) algorithm is employed to search for the \noptimal packing sequence. Up to our knowledge, this is \nthe first time Particle Swarm is utilized in tackling an \nirregular packing problem. A proposed Local Search \nroutine is also used to enhance the algorithm perform\u0002ance. As to the placement phase, a combined placement \nalgorithm is develop...",

One group of approaches is the raster methods, which rely on approximating the objects \nwith pixelated representations. Although they are versatile in treating irregular geometries, the raster methods \nreceived limited attention in solving problems involving rotatable objects, where available studies generally \nanalyze only right-angled rotations. In addition, raster approximation allows the use of unique performance \nmetrics and indirect consideration of constraints, which have not been exploited in the literature. This study \npresents the new Concurrent or Ordered Matrix-based Packing Arrangement Computation Technique\n(COMPACT). The method relies on raster representations of the objects that can be rotated by arbitrary angles, \nunlike the right-angled rotation restrictions imposed in many existing packing optimization studies based on \nraster methods. The raster approximations are obtained through loop-free operations that improve efficiency.\nBesides, a novel performance metric is introduced, which favors efficient filling of the available space by\nmaximizing the internal contact between the objects as well as the contact between the objects and domain \nboundaries. Moreover, the objective functions are exploited to discard overlap and overflow constraints and \nenable the use of unconstrained optimization methods. Several test problems involving concurrent and \nordered packing of multiple rectangular and circular objects into square bins are investigated. The results show \nthat the proposed technique performs effectively in determining the packing arrangements.\nKeywords: Packing; heuristics; raster representation; concurrent optimization; rotatable objects.\n1. Introduction\nPacking optimization is an important problem class that concerns various disciplines including warehouse \nmanagement, shipping, and design of engineering products. The widespread nature of this problem requires\nrobust and efficient algorithms that are easy to utilize.\nVarious techniques have been developed to solve different packing optimization problems. A large amount \nof available studies addresses the problem of packing two-dimensional rectangular objects into rectangular \nbins while keeping the object edges orthogonal to the domain boundaries. For instance, Chen and Huang (2007) \ncomputed solutions for two-dimensional rectangle packing problems by introducing a search algorithm that \nplaces the rectangles into the container one by one using a corner occupation strategy. Later, Leung, Zhang, \nZhou, and Wu (2012) proposed a hybrid heuristic algorithm that combines greedy strategy and simulated \nannealing methods to solve the rectangular knapsack packing problem. Recently, Chen et al. (2019) developed \na deterministic heuristic algorithm for solving the two-dimensional rectangular packing problems that require \nmaximizing the filled portion of the rectangular domain.\nPacking problems concerning nonrectangular objects and domains were also prevalently investigated. For \nexample, Del Valle, Queiroz, Miyazawa, and Xavier (2012) developed heuristic approaches for solving 2D \ncutting/packing problems involving irregular objects. Later, Chen et al. (2018) proposed a heuristic algorithm \nfor solving circle packing problems for placing multiple identical circles into the smallest circular container.\nLately, Bouzid and Salhi (2020) investigated orthogonal packing of rectangular objects into a circular space of \nfixed radius.\n \n* Email address: serhat@is.mpg.de (Gokhan Serhat)\nPreprint submitted to Elsevier\n2\nThe complexity of the packing problems notably increases when the nonorthogonal rotation of the objects \nis allowed in addition to the translation (Cherri et al., 2016). These problems received relatively lesser attention\ncompared to the problems involving fixed object orientations or orthogonal rotations. In one study, Zhang and \nZhang (2009) introduced a 2D packing optimization technique called finite-circle method, which approximates \npolygons with a set of circles and converts the non-overlapping constraints into simple constraints between \ncircles. Martins and Tsuzuki (2010) used a heuristic approach to minimize the waste space during the rotational\nplacement of two-dimensional polygons into irregular containers. In another study by Martinez-Sykora et al. \n(2017), a strategy was proposed to solve bin packing problems with irregular pieces that can be freely rotated.\nThe difficulties in the formulations for packing problems involving irregular objects have led to the \ndevelopment of raster point methods, which rely on approximating the objects on a discretized grid. With \nthese methods, packing configurations can be represented by assigning zeroes to the free domain cells and \ndifferent values to the cells where a single object is present or multiple objects overlap. The key advantage of \nraster techniques is their applicability to the problems involving objects with complex shapes, where the main \ndrawback is their resolution-dependent precision (Leao et al., 2019). In the literature, the research on packing \noptimization with raster methods is limited compared to the available work based on other techniques. In a\nparticular study, Toledo et al. (2013) proposed a discrete modeling approach called the Dotted-Board Model, \nwhich relies on representing the bin with a two-dimensional grid and using the plausible grid points for the\nplacement of arbitrary polygons. Later, Mundim, Andretta, and de Queiroz (2017) extended the Dotted-Board \nModel for packing non-polygonal objects with curved edges and used it within a heuristic approach based on\ngenetic algorithms. Recently, Sato, Martins, Gomes, and Tsuzuki (2019) developed the raster overlap \nminimization algorithm to solve the irregular strip packing problem using a raster method that limits the \nsolution space.\nThis study presents the new Concurrent or Ordered Matrix-based Packing Arrangement Computation \nTechnique (COMPACT). In this framework, the object shapes are approximated by matrix-based (raster)\nrepresentations. The objects can be rotated by angles that are not necessarily restricted to be right-angle \nmultiples, unlike the conditions imposed in many existing packing optimization studies relying on raster \nmethods. The raster approximations are obtained through loop-free operations that improve efficiency.\nBesides, a novel performance metric is introduced, which aids efficient filling of the available space by \nmaximizing the internal contact between the objects as well as the contact between the objects and domain \nboundaries. Moreover, the possibility of exploiting the objective functions for discarding overlap and overflow\nconstraints is explored to enable the use of unconstrained optimization methods. As case studies, the \ndeveloped technique is utilized to pack multiple rectangular and circular objects in square domains using \nconcurrent and ordered placement strategies. The results show that the proposed technique performs\neffectively in determining the packing arrangements. The organization of the study is as follows: The matrix\u0002based object representation that forms the backbone of the developed technique is described in the following \nsection. Section 3 covers the details regarding the formulation of the optimization problem. Section 4 covers \nthe results from various case studies. In Section 5, the conclusions are stated and the directions for future \nstudies are outlined.\n2.

Irregular shape packing is one of the most recent variants to be widely researched and its history extends over 40 years. The evolution of solution approaches to this problem can be attributed to increased computer power and advances in geometric techniques as well as more sophisticated and insightful algorithm design. In this paper we will focus on the latter. Our aim is not to give a chronological account or an exhaustive review, but to draw on the literature to describe and evaluate the core approaches. Irregular packing is combinatorial and as a result solution methods are heuristic, save a few notable exceptions. We will explore different ways of representing the problem and mechanisms for moving between solutions. We will also propose where we see the future challenges for researchers in this area.\n\n## Suggested Citation\n\nJ A Bennell & J F Oliveira, 2009.\n\" **[A tutorial in irregular shape packing problems](https://ideas.repec.org/a/pal/jorsoc/v60y2009i1d10.1057_jors.2008.169.html)**,\"\n[Journal of the Operational Research Society](https://ideas.repec.org/s/pal/jorsoc.html), Palgrave Macmillan;The OR Society, vol. 60(1), pages 93-105, May.\nHandle: _RePEc:pal:jorsoc:v:60:y:2009:i:1:d:10.1057\\_jors.2008.169_\n\nDOI: 10.1057/jors.2008.169\n\nas\n\nHTMLHTML with abstractplain textplain text with abstractBibTeXRIS (EndNote, RefMan, ProCite)ReDIFJSON\n\n## Download full text from publisher\n\n**File URL:** http://link.springer.com/10.1057/jors.2008.169\n\n**File Function:** Abstract\n\n**Download Restriction:** Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.\n\n* * *\n\n**File URL:** https://libkey.io/10.1057/jors.2008.169?utm\\_source=ideas\n\n**LibKey link**: if access is restricted and if your library uses this service, LibKey will redirect you to where you can use your library subscription to access this item\n\n---><---\n\nAs the access to this document is restricted, you may want to [search](https://ideas.repec.org/cgi-bin/htsearch2?q=%22A+tutorial+in+irregular+shape+packing+problems%22) for a different version of it.\n\n## References listed on IDEAS\n\nas\n\nHTMLHTML with abstractplain textplain text with abstractBibTeXRIS (EndNote, RefMan, ProCite)ReDIFJSON\n\n01.

The container has a fixed width, while its length can change so that all items are placed in it. The objective is to find a layout of the set of polygons that minimizes the length of the container. The proposed algorithm constructively creates layouts from an ordered list of items and a placement heuristic. The placement determines the collision free region (represents the set of translations to create a feasible layout) for the item to be placed. It is shown that the collision free region must be calculated using non-regularized Boolean operations, as contours of no-fit polygons should be ignored. The proposed algorithm to solve the placement problem has two levels, in the internal level the container has fixed dimensions, and the external level reduces or increases the variable dimension. The placement heuristic searches for degenerated vertices and edges as they represent local maximum compaction. Computational comparisons on benchmark problems show that the proposed algorithm generated highly competitive solutions. Moreover, our algorithm updated some best known results.\n...Read more\n## Key takeaways\n![sparkles](https://a.academia-assets.com/images/icons/sparkle.svg)\nAI\n1. The proposed two-level algorithm effectively minimizes container length for irregular polygon packing.\n2. Collision free regions (CFRs) are determined using non-regularized Boolean operations to avoid contour interference.\n3. Placement heuristic prioritizes degenerated edges and vertices for optimal item fitting and compaction.\n4. Benchmark tests with 13 datasets demonstrated competitive results, achieving 100% density in some cases.\n5. Simulated annealing (SA) is integrated for sequence and position control of item placements.\n## Related papers\n[Rotational Placement of Irregular Polygons over Containers with Fixed Dimensions using Simulated Annealing and No-Fit Polygons](https://www.academia.edu/58884840/Rotational_Placement_of_Irregular_Polygons_over_Containers_with_Fixed_Dimensions_using_Simulated_Annealing_and_No_Fit_Polygons)\n[Thiago de Castro Martins](https://independent.academia.edu/ThiagodeCastroMartins)\nJournal of the Brazilian Society of Mechanical Sciences and Engineering, 2008\nThis work deals with the problem of minimizing the waste of space that occurs on a rotational placement of a set of irregular bi-dimensional small items inside a bidimensional large object. This problem is approached with an heuristic based on simulated annealing. Traditional &quot;external penalization&quot; techniques are avoided through the application of the no-fit polygon, that determinates the collision-free region for each small item before its placement. The simulated annealing controls: the rotation applied and the placement of the small item. For each non-placed small item, a limited depth binary search is performed to find a scale factor that when applied to the small item, would allow it to be fitted in the large object. Three possibilities to define the sequence on which the small items are placed are studied: larger-first, random permutation and weight sorted. The proposed algorithm is suited for non-convex small items and large objects.\ndownloadDownload free PDF[View PDFchevron\\_right](https://www.academia.edu/58884840/Rotational_Placement_of_Irregular_Polygons_over_Containers_with_Fixed_Dimensions_using_Simulated_Annealing_and_No_Fit_Polygons)\n[An effective heuristic for the two-dimensional irregular bin packing problem](https://www.academia.edu/69875946/An_effective_heuristic_for_the_two_dimensional_irregular_bin_packing_problem)\n[Gabriela Ochoa](https://independent.academia.edu/GabrielaOchoa10)\nAnnals of Operations Research, 2013\nThis paper proposes an adaptation, to the two-dimensional irregular bin packing problem of the Djang and Finch heuristic (DJD), originally designed for the one-dimensional bin packing problem. In the two-dimensional case, not only is it the case that the piece&#39;s size is important but its shape also has a significant influence. Therefore, DJD as a selection heuristic has to be paired with a placement heuristic to completely construct a solution to the underlying packing problem. A successful adaptation of the DJD requires a routine to reduce computational costs, which is also proposed and successfully tested in this paper. Results, on a wide variety of instance types with convex polygons, are found to be significantly better than those produced by more conventional selection heuristics.\ndownloadDownload free PDF[View PDFchevron\\_right](https://www.academia.edu/69875946/An_effective_heuristic_for_the_two_dimensional_irregular_bin_packing_problem)\n[Irregular rotational placement of shapes over non-convex containers with fixed dimensions](https://www.academia.edu/104990568/Irregular_rotational_placement_of_shapes_over_non_convex_containers_with_fixed_dimensions)\n[Thiago de Castro Martins](https://independent.academia.edu/ThiagodeCastroMartins)\n8th IFAC International Workshop on Intelligent Manufacturing Systems, 2007, 2007\nThis work deals with the problem of minimize the waste of space that occurs on a placement of a set of bi-dimensional items inside a bi-dimensional container with fixed dimensions.
