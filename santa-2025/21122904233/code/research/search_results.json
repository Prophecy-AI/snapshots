This can be obtained by a short trial run and scaling the temperature until the desired ratio is observed\u202f([Springer\u202fPDF](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/BF00143921.pdf)).\n\n2. **Choose a logarithmic decay as the baseline schedule** \u2013 the schedule  \n   \\[\n   T_k = \\frac{T_0}{1 + \\alpha \\ln(1+k)}\n   \\]  \n   where *k* is the iteration index and *\u03b1* is tuned so that the final temperature \\(T_f\\) is reached after the planned number of iterations.  Stander\u202f&\u202fSilverman show that, with proper first and last temperatures, the logarithmic schedule is \u201calmost optimal\u201d and robust to the exact choice of \\(T_0\\)\u202f([Springer\u202fPDF](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/BF00143921.pdf)).\n\n3. **Adapt the decay rate during the run** \u2013 monitor the acceptance ratio every few hundred moves; if it falls below a lower threshold (e.g., 0.2) slow the cooling (reduce *\u03b1*), and if it stays too high (e.g., >0.6) speed it up (increase *\u03b1*).  This adaptive temperature control improves convergence compared with a fixed schedule\u202f([ScienceDirect\u202fadaptive study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0305054803001977)).\n\n4. **Incorporate a reheating mechanism** \u2013 when the algorithm stalls (no improvement for a predefined number of iterations), temporarily raise the temperature by a factor (e.g., 1.2\u202f\u00d7\u202fcurrent\u202f\\(T\\)) and then resume the logarithmic decay.

This creates a quasi\u2011geometrical cooling of the move magnitude, known as simulated quenching, and has been shown to raise the number of accepted solutions in rotational packing problems\u202f([Semantics Scholar PDF](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/6509/3a9d2d6b9b38ac2c9a2da79c3905b76ef008.pdf)).\n\n6. **Terminate at a sufficiently low final temperature** \u2013 ensure \\(T_f\\) is low enough that virtually no uphill moves are accepted (acceptance ratio <\u202f0.01).  Stander\u202f&\u202fSilverman note that performance is sensitive to the choice of the last temperature; setting it too high wastes iterations, while too low may halt prematurely\u202f([Springer\u202fPDF](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/BF00143921.pdf)).\n\n7. **Validate the schedule empirically** \u2013 run the annealer on a set of benchmark 2\u2011D packing instances, record solution quality and runtime, and fine\u2011tune the parameters (initial temperature, \u03b1, reheating factor, acceptance\u2011ratio thresholds).

SILVERMAN \nUniversity of Bristol, Department of Mathematics, Bristol BS8 1TW, UK \nReceived January 1993 and accepted June 1993 \nIt is well known that the behaviour of the simulated annealing approach to optimization is \ncrucially dependent on the choice of temperature schedule. In this paper, a dynamic program\u0002ming approach is used to find the temperature schedule which is optimal for a simple minimi\u0002zation problem. The optimal schedule is compared with certain standard non-optimal choices. \nThese generally perform well provided the first and last temperatures are suitably selected. \nIndeed, these temperatures can be chosen in such a way as to make the performance of the \nlogarithmic schedule almost optimal. This optimal performance is fairly robust to the choice \nof the first temperature. \nThe dynamic programming approach cannot be applied directly to problems of more \nrealistic size, such as those arising in statistical image reconstruction. Nevertheless, some \nsimulation experiments suggest that the general conclusions from the simple minimization \nproblem do carry over to larger problems. Various families of schedules can be made to \nperform well with suitable choice of the first and last temperatures, and the logarithmic \nschedule combines good performance with reasonable robustness to the choice of the first \ntemperature. \nKeywords: Dynamic programming, image reconstruction, stochastic optimization \n1. Introduction \nAssume that we want to find the global minimum of a \ncomplicated function E(x) over a finite, but usually very \nlarge, set of possible configurations X. Simulated annealing \nhas been extensively used for this task in the last decade. \nSee Laarhoven and Aarts (1987) and Bertsimas and Tsitsiklis \n(1993) for general reviews of the literature about this sto\u0002chastic optimization technique, and Ripley (1988) for a very \nclear introduction which we now summarize. \nAssume here for simplicity that there is only one con\u0002figuration, s that achieves the global minimum of E(x) \nover 2(. Define a family of probability measures P~, \nindexed by temperature r > 0, on P( by \nP~ (x) oc exp {-E(x) } 1/~- \n* Address for correspondence: University of Plymouth, School of Mathe\u0002matics and Statistics, Plymouth PL4 8AA, UK. \n0960-3174 \u000e9 1994 Chapman & Hall \nand note that as 7- decreases to 0, P~ increasingly \nconcentrates on 2. In particular, if at each discrete time t \nand temperature Tt we take a sample X(~-t) from P~-' and \nif we let Tt tend to 0 as t increases, we would hope that \nX(Tt) \"~ s in some sense. \nThe rate at which 7t decreases as t increases is crucial. \nGeman and Geman (1984) and Hajek (1988) present \nsome asymptotic results about this rate. Essentially, Hajek \nshows that, under certain mild assumptions, a necessary \nand sufficient condition for \nX(Tt) ~ :~ in probability as t ~ oc (1) \nis that \nEexp - =~, (2) \nt=l \\ \nwhere d* is a constant depending on E and the sampling \nmechanism, but independent of the starting configuration. \nIf r t is taken to be F/log (t + 1) then the necessary and \n22 Julian Stander and Bernard W. Silverman \nsufficient condition (2) holds if and only if F > d*. How\u0002ever, it is well known that Hajek's result does not in itself \ngive a satisfactory temperature schedule, and that the \nconvergence rates it demonstrates are unacceptably slow \nin practice. \nIn this paper we study the choice of temperature \nschedule in simulated annealing as applied to problems of \nvastly different degrees of complexity. In Section 2 of this \npaper we present a dynamic programming algorithm \nwhich, for any given initial distribution on 2( and any \ninteger T, yields the temperature schedule of length T that \nmaximizes the probability that X('rr) = 2. This approach \nis only computationally feasible when 2( is small, and \nwe apply it to find optimal schedules of various lengths in \na 'toy' problem where the function to be minimized is \nexplicitly specified. We compare the optimal schedules so \nproduced with schedules given by one- and two-step\u0002ahead strategies, as well as a number of commonly used \nfamilies of schedules parametrized by their first and last \ntemperatures. \nIn Section 3 we turn to the application of simulated \nannealing to problems of more realistic size arising in \nimage reconstruction. A simulation study enables various \ntemperature schedules to be compared. We discover that \nmany of our findings about the temperature schedule \nfrom the 'toy' minimization problem carry over to this \nmuch more complicated setup. Minimization problems \narising from two separate image reconstruction problems \nare considered. In the first, the reconstruction of a binary \nimage, the global optimum of the objective function can \nin fact be found explicitly by a completely different algo\u0002rithm (Greig et al. 1989), and so there is a benchmark \nagainst which simulated annealing can be compared. In \nthe second, the reconstruction of a grey-level image, there \nis no such absolute standard, and comparisons can only \nbe made between different iterative methods. \nFinally, in Section 4 we present our conclusions and \nmake some tentative suggestions for the application of \nour work. \n2. A dynamic programming approach to finding the \noptimal temperature schedule \nLabel the points in 2( in such a way that 1 corresponds to \nthe global minimum of the function E. Let 7r (~ be the \ninitial probabilities of the points in X, Q (0-) be a matrix \nof transition probabilities that defined the sampling \nmechanism employed by the simulated annealing algo\u0002rithm at temperature 0-, and T be an arbitrary but fixed \ninteger. Our objective is to find, for any 7c (~ the maximum \nvalue of the probability of being in state I after Titerations, \nthat is \n[0r(~ Q (0-1)Q (0-2)'\" Q (~-r)]l, (3) \nover all temperature schedules of length T, \n(0-1,.--, o-r), (4) \nwhere 0-i -> 0 for i = 1,..., Tand [~b]t is used to denote the \nfirst component of the vector r We shall refer to the maxi\u0002mizing temperature schedule as the optimal temperature \nschedule. \n2.1. The dynamic programming approach \nWe shall use a standard dynamic programming approach, \nas described in Bellman (1957) for example, to find the \noptimal temperature schedule. The algorithm comprises \ntwo stages. \nThe first stage involves setting up a table of results, as \nfollows: \nStep 1. For all probability vectors 7r, find 0-~ (Tr) that \nmaximizes \n[7rQ(0-1)]1 over 0-1 >- 0, \nand store the maximum value as p l(Tr). \nSteps k = 2,..., T. For all probability vectors ~r, find \n0-~ (Tr) that maximizes \npk-({TrQ(0-k)} over 0-k -- 0, \nand store the maximum value as pk(Tr). The values of \nPk_l{~rQ(0-k)} were found in Step k - 1. \nThese T steps can be thought of as yielding an infinite \ntable of T rows. The entries of this table are 0-~ (st) and \npg (st) for k = 1,..., T and for all probability vectors st. \nOf course, when this is implemented on the computer, \nsome form of discretization has to be employed for \nthe 7rs. In the simple case that we shall discuss below in \nsection 2.3, 71=(71l,Tr2, Tr3) , where 7rl,Tr2, Tr3~0 and \n7rl + ~r2 + 7r3 = 1. We calculate the required quantities \non a regular grid of points in the appropriate region. \nIf a value is required at an intermediate point, we use \nlinear interpolation between the calculated values. The \ngauge of the grid was 0.02; finer grids did not give notice\u0002ably better results. Other types of discretization with \nappropriate interpolation were tried. For example, we \nexperimented with the case when the discretization became \nfiner as the value of the probability of being in state 1 \napproached unity. Again, this did not give notice\u0002ably better results than those obtained by using the regular \ngrid. \nThe second stage of the dynamic programming approach \ninvolves reading off the sche...",

In the conventional simulated annealing, the temperature declines constantly, providing the search with a higher transition probability in the beginning of the search and lower probability toward the end of the search. In the first proposed method, an adaptive temperature control scheme is used that changes temperature based on the number of consecutive improving moves. In the second method, a tabu list has been added to the adaptive simulated annealing algorithm in order to avoid revisits. The performance of these two algorithms is evaluated and favorably compared with the conventional simulated annealing.\n\n## Introduction\n\nMetaheuristics have gained considerable attention and have experienced remarkable growth over the past decade. Among their benefits is their flexibility in applications to complex optimization problems. Simulated annealing, tabu search and genetic algorithms are among the most popular metaheuristics. In their standard forms, each of these heuristics has a unique search mechanism that allows them to escape local optima. The performance of these heuristics can be further improved if used in conjunction with an application-specific procedure. For instance, in tabu search, a tabu list is a standard feature that forbids the move to the most recently visited solutions, and in simulated annealing, a transition probability is a standard feature that allows a non-improving move to be made. Any of these methods may be used for a local search step in an application-specific algorithm. For example in application to job shop scheduling problems, Taillard \\[1\\] proposed a tabu search to find a good schedule for any sub-problem generated by a divide-and-conquer algorithm. Similarly, Yamada and Nakano \\[2\\] used a _shifting bottleneck_ method to enhance the performance of their simulated annealing algorithm. In this paper, the focus is on standard features of simulated annealing regardless of the area of application. However, to evaluate the performance of the proposed method, the job shop scheduling problem has been selected. The job shop scheduling problem studied in this paper is to schedule a set of jobs on a set of machines such that each job has a specific sequence of operations without preemption and each machine can handle at most one job at a time. The objective is to minimize the _makespan_, the duration in which all jobs are completed. The job shop scheduling problem is among the hardest combinatorial optimization problems and proved to be NP-hard \\[3\\]. The problem can be formulated as follows.\n\nLet\n\n_J_ ={1,\u2026, _n_} denote the set of jobs;\n\n_M_ ={1,\u2026, _m_} denote the set of machines;\n\n_O_ _j_ be the set of pairs of operations ( _k_, _r_) of job j constrained by the precedence relations;\n\n_p_ _jk_ denote the processing time of job j on machine k; and\n\n_x_ _jk_ be the start time of job j on machine k.\n\nGiven the above definitions, the problem can be stated asMinimizeCmax=maxj,k{xjk+pjk}subjecttoxjr\u2a7exjk+pjk\u2200j\u2208J,(k,r)\u2208Oj,xik\u2a7exjk+pjk\u2228xjk\u2a7exik+pik\u2200i,j\u2208J,k\u2208M,xjk\u2a7e0\u2200j\u2208J,k\u2208M.\n\nIn the above model, the first set of constraints describes the precedence relations among operations of each job, and the second set is to avoid having two jobs scheduled simultaneously on the same machine. This formulation is a disjunctive programming problem due to the either-or constraint. A mixed-integer programming transformation of this problem is discussed in Ref. \\[4\\].\n\nOne of the optimization algorithms for job shop scheduling is branch and bound where a dynamically constructed tree representing all feasible schedules is searched. Through rules and procedures of this technique, large portions of the tree can be iteratively eliminated until an optimal solution is found. For many years, branch and bound was the most popular technique. However, due to limitations of enumeration techniques, approximation methods became another alternative \\[5\\]. The shifting bottleneck procedure \\[6\\] is among the well-known approximation methods for job shop scheduling. This procedure employs a sequence of decomposition, bottleneck identification, single-machine scheduling and re-optimization. Nonetheless, other research showed that this method suffers from difficulty in the re-optimization phase and infeasible solutions \\[7\\]. Iterative algorithms with local search are another popular category of job shop scheduling methods, and simulated annealing \\[8\\] is one of the most popular techniques in this category. The driving mechanism of simulated annealing is based on a neighborhood search in which a probability function determines the transition from one solution to another. The magnitude of this probability depends in part on a temperature parameter that declines according to a cooling schedule. In this paper, we propose two adaptations of simulated annealing. The first method uses an adaptive temperature control instead of a constantly descending function, and the second one has the same temperature control mechanism but it is accompanied by a tabu list that keeps track of recently visited solutions. While many authors have developed several application-specific metaheuristics to solve job shop scheduling problem (for a comprehensive review see \\[9\\]), this paper focuses on the standard form of simulated annealing.\n\nIn the following sections, first the conventional simulated annealing method is discussed. Then, the two proposed methods, the adaptive simulated annealing and the adaptive tabu-simulated annealing, are presented. In Section 3, the performance of these three methods are tested and compared.\n\n## Section snippets\n\n## Conventional simulated annealing\n\nSimul...",

Tsuzuki\nAdditional information is available at the end of the chapter\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5772/50302\n1. Introduction\nSimulated annealing has been applied to a wide range of problems: combinatorial and\ncontinuous optimizations. This work approaches a new class of problems in which the\nobjective function is discrete but the parameters are continuous. This type of problem arises in\nrotational irregular packing problems. It is necessary to place multiple items inside a container\nsuch that there is no collision between the items, while minimizing the items occupied area.\nA feedback is proposed to control the next candidate probability distribution, in order to\nincrease the number of accepted solutions. The probability distribution is controlled by\nthe so called crystallization factor. The proposed algorithm modifies only one parameter\nat a time. If the new configuration is accepted then a positive feedback is executed to\nresult in larger modifications. Different types of positive feedbacks are studied herein. If\nthe new configuration is rejected, then a negative feedback is executed to result in smaller\nmodifications. For each non-placed item, a limited depth binary search is performed to find a\nscale factor that, when applied to the item, allows it to be fitted in the layout. The proposed\nalgorithm was used to solve two different rotational puzzles. A geometrical cooling schedule\nis used. Consequently, the proposed algorithm can be classified as simulated quenching.\nThis work is structured as follows. Section 2 presents some simulated annealing and\nsimulated quenching key concepts. In section 3 the objective function with discrete values and\ncontinuous parameters is explained. Section 4 explains the proposed adaptive neighborhood\nbased on the crystallization factor. Section 5 explains the computational experiments and\nsection 6 presents the results. Finally, section 7 rounds up the work with the conclusions.\n2. Background\nSimulated annealing is a probabilistic meta-heuristic with a capacity of escape from local\nminima. It came from the Metropolis algorithm and it was originally proposed in the area\nof combinatorial optimization [9], that is, when the objective function is defined in a discrete\n\u00a92012 Tsuzuki et al., licensee InTech.

The simulated annealing was modified in order to apply to the optimization of\nmultimodal functions defined on continuous domain [4]. The choices of the cooling schedule\nand of the next candidate distribution are the most important decisions in the definition of a\nsimulated annealing algorithm [13]. The next candidate distribution for continuous variables\nis discussed herein.\nIn the discrete domain, such as the traveling salesman and computer circuit design problems,\nthe parameters must have discrete values; the next point candidate xk+1 corresponds to a\npermutation in the list of cities to be visited, interchanges of circuit elements, or other discrete\noperation. In the continuous application of simulated annealing a new choice of the next point\ncandidate must be executed. Bohachevsky et al. [1] proposed that the next candidate xk+1 can\nbe obtained by first generating a random direction vector u, with |u| = 1, then multiplying it\nby a fixed step size \u0394r, and summing the resulting vector to the current candidate point xk.\nBrooks & Verdini [2] showed that the selection of \u0394r is a critical choice. They observed that an\nappropriate choice of this parameter is strictly dependent on the objective function F(x), and\nthe appropriate value can be determined by presampling the objective function.\nThe directions in [1] are randomly sampled from the uniform distribution and the step size is\nthe same in each direction. In this way, the feasible region is explored in an isotropic way and\nthe objective function is assumed to behave in the same way in each direction. But this is not\noften the case. The step size to define the next candidate point xk+1 should not be equal for all\nthe directions, but different directions should have different step sizes; i.e. the space should\nbe searched in an anisotropic way. Corana et al. [4] explored the concept of anisotropic search;\nthey proposed a self-tuning simulated annealing algorithm in which the step size is configured\nin order to maintain a number of accepted solutions. At each iteration k, a single variable of\nxk is modified in order to obtain a new candidate point xk+1, and iterations are subdivided\ninto cycles of n iterations during which each variable is modified. The new candidate point is\nobtained from xk in the following form xk+1 = xk + v \u00b7 \u0394ri \u00b7 ei. Where v is a uniform random\nnumber in [\u22121, 1], and \u0394ri is the step size along direction ei of the i-th axis. The anisotropy is\nobtained by choosing different values of \u0394ri for all the directions. The step size is kept fixed\nfor a certain number of cycles of variables, and the fraction of accepted moves in direction ei\nis calculated. If the fraction of accepted moves generated in the same direction is below 0.4,\nthen the step size \u0394ri along ei is decreased. It is assumed that the algorithm is using too large\nsteps along ei thus causing many moves to be rejected. If the fraction is between 0.4 and 0.6\nthe step size is left unchanged. If the fraction is above 0.6 then \u0394ri is increased. It is assumed\nthat the step size is too small thus causing many moves to be accepted.\nThis procedure may not be the best possible to process the different behavior of the objective\nfunction along different axes. Ingber [7] proposed that the random variable should follow a\nCauchy distribution with different sensitivities at different temperatures. The maximum step\nsize is kept constant during the algorithm and it allows escaping from local minima even at\nlow temperatures. The parameter space can have completely different sensitivities for each\ndimension, therefore the use of different temperatures for each dimension is suggested. This\nmethod is often referred to as very fast simulated re-annealing (VFSR) or adaptive simulated\nannealing (ASA). The sensitivity of each parameter is given by the partial derivative of the\nfunction with relation to the i-th dimension [3].\n4 Simulated Annealing \u2013 Advances, Applications and Hybridizations\nAdaptive Neighborhood Heuristics for Simulated Annealing over Continuous Variables 3\n3. Integer objective function with float parameters\nIrregular packing problems arise in the industry whenever one must place multiple items\ninside a container such that there is no collision between the items, while minimizing the\narea occupied by the items. It can be shown that even restricted versions of this problem (for\ninstance, limiting the polygon shape to rectangles only) are NP complete, which means that\nall algorithms currently known for optimal solutions require a number of computational steps\nthat grow exponentially with the problem size rather than according to a polynomial function\n[5]. Usually probabilistic heuristics relax the original constraints of the problem, allowing the\nsearch to go through points outside the space of valid solutions and applying penalization to\ntheir cost. This technique is known as external penalization. The most adopted penalization\nheuristic for external solutions of packing problems is to apply a penalization based on\nthe overlapping area of colliding items. While this heuristic leads to very computationally\nefficient iterations of the optimization process, the layout with objective function in minimum\nvalue may have overlapped items [6].\nFig. 1 shows an example in which the c...",

Simulated annealing is an optimization technique inspired by the natural annealing process used in metallurgy, whereby a material is carefully heated or cooled to create larger and more uniform crystalline structures. In simulated annealing, a minimum (or maximum) value of some global &quot;energy&quot; function is sought. This model attempts to find a maximal solution in a two-dimensional grid.\nWe use such a simple problem in this model in order to highlight the solution technique only.\n## HOW IT WORKS\nIn this model, the objective function is defined for each patch in our 2D world. The location of each patch (x and y coordinates) can be thought of as the parameter values of the objective function.\nThe optimization works as follows. The system has a &quot;temperature&quot;, which controls how much change is allowed to happen. A random location for an initial solution is defined, and then for each step, a potential move to a new solution (location) is either accepted or rejected. Changes that result in a greater solution value are always accepted (changes that result in no change of solution value will also always be accepted if the ACCEPT-EQUAL-CHANGES? switch is turned on). Changes that result in a lower solution value are only accepted with some probability, which is proportional to the &quot;temperature&quot; of the system using the Boltzmann Distribution. The temperature of the system decreases over time, according to some cooling schedule, which means that initially changes that decrease solution values will often be accepted, but as time goes on they will be accepted less and less frequently. This is similar to cooling a material slowly in natural annealing, to allow the molecules to settle into nice crystalline patterns. Eventually the temperature approaches zero, at which point the simulated annealing method is equivalent to a random mutation hill-climber search, where only beneficial changes are accepted.\n## HOW TO USE IT\nPress the SETUP button to initialize the model and solution space.\nPress the STEP button to go from one temperature to the next lower temperature.\nPress the GO button to have the algorithm run until a solution has been found.\nAdjust the COOLING-RATE slider to change how quickly the temperature drops.\nThe current temperature is shown in the TEMPERATURE monitor.\nThe DELTA-MAX slider controls how far a potential movement can be.\nIf the ACCEPT-EQUAL-CHANGES? switch is ON, then the system will always accept a new solution that yields no change in solution value. If it is OFF, then equal solutions are treated the same as those decrease the solution value, and thus are only accepted probabilistically based on the system temperature.\nThe Solution monitors and plot show how the algorithm is performing and the best solution that has been found.\n## THINGS TO NOTICE\nSlower cooling rates lead to higher optimal solutions (on average).\n## THINGS TO TRY\nIf you turn ACCEPT-EQUAL-CHANGES? to ON, does slow cooling still work better than fast cooling?\nTry varying the DELTA-MAX. Does this help the system to reach more optimal configurations?\n## EXTENDING THE MODEL\nCurrently, the probability of accepting a change that increases the best solution value is always 1, and the probability of accepting a change that decreases the solution value is based on the temperature of the system and the amount by which the solution has changed. Try extending the model to make more alternative acceptance decision criteria.\nSimulated annealing can be used on a wide variety of optimization problems. Experiment with using this technique on different &quot;energy/cost&quot; function, or even entirely different problems.\n## NETLOGO FEATURES\n## RELATED MODELS\nParticle Swarm Optimization, Simple Genetic Algorithm, Crystallization Basic, Ising\n## CREDITS AND REFERENCES\nOriginal papers describing a simulated annealing\nS.

It considers various parameters such as landscape and neighborhood. The need for a better understanding of SA, with the additional goal of implementing the algorithm efficiently, motivated this study. The method selected to conduct that study was to carry out experiments to obtain practical data, which could be utilized to carry out a theoretical study simultaneously. Experiments on such a stochastic algorithm as SA were initiated following the observation that it is possible to calculate the exact probability for SA to reach any point in the landscape, provided that the number of solutions and the number of neighbors per solution are small enough. An efficient development of a SA simulator has enabled us to study the influence of the tuning of all the main parameters of SA as well as theoretical concepts such as thermodynamic equilibrium and optimal temperature decrement rules. Interesting results have been obtained in the field of adaptive cooling schedules that enable us to demonstrate that the classical cooling schedules are all equivalent. Finally a new schedule has been proposed that exhibits some useful properties. The proposed cooling schedule has been successfully implemented in the SA algorithm to solve the well known traveling salesman problem.\n## Introduction\nIn 1953, Metropolis et al. proposed an algorithm for the efficient simulation of the evolution of a solid to thermal equilibrium. Almost 30 years later, Kirkpatrick et al. (1982) realized that there exists a profound analogy between minimizing the cost function of a combinatorial optimization problem and the slow cooling of a solid until it reaches its low energy ground state and that the optimization process can be carried out by applying the Metropolis criterion. By substituting energy for cost and by executing the Metropolis algorithm at a sequence of slowly decreasing temperature values, Kirkpatrick et al. obtained a combinatorial optimization algorithm that they called \u201csimulated annealing\u201d. Twenty years later SA is still of great interest and the research into this algorithm and its applications has evolved into a field of study of its own (Michalewicz et al., 2000; Salamon et al., 2002; Hromkovic, 2003).\nEven if the theoretical basis of the algorithm have been known for almost two decades, still there is a lack of enough practical information about it. As a matter of fact, it is still not simple for a user to design his own algorithm. A lot of tuning, usually, has to be carried out and no theoretical results give clear statement about which temperature decrement rule should be used or what kind of neighborhood should be chosen.\nWe initiated our study of SA while working on loading pattern optimization of nuclear reactors at Electricit\u00e9 de France (EDF). Indeed, thanks to its robustness and flexibility, SA is currently the most widely used combinatorial optimization algorithm in this field. At that time we were particularly interested in using SA in some new multiobjective optimization algorithms (Collette, 2002).\nThe work presented in this paper has evolved out of the results of the experiments carried out employing simulated annealing and of a theoretical study, which was aimed at improving the design of SA algorithms. At the beginning of the work, an important aspect of investigation was the level of performances that could be expected to obtain employing the SA algorithm. We needed to know how SA would perform on a given landscape with a given temperature decrement rule and a given neighborhood. Our interest lied in obtaining satisfactory answers to the age-old questions like how high the temperature should be for the SA algorithm to be able to climb a given hill.\nIn the initial phase of our work we performed some calculations for simple one-dimension cases and then we noticed that, for small problems and for a limited number of neighbors, it was possible to calculate exactly the probability for SA to find a given solution. Taking this into account, we developed a basic SA simulator which enabled us to calculate the distribution of probability over the landscape. The benefit of this simple method is that results of the experiments can be displayed as a probability density that can be easily exploited for further analysis. These experiments helped us to achieve several interesting empirical results that allowed a better understanding of the SA and that were helpful in the subsequent design of improved implementations of the algorithm. We have achieved interesting results in the field of neighborhoods, where it has been demonstrated that the neighborhood structure should have some desirable properties to make it possible for the SA algorithm to explore efficiently the solution space. Then we have studied the theoretical concept of thermal equilibrium and its effect on SA convergence. Finally we have studied cooling schedules. Our experiments enabled us to construct an optimum schedule that could not be used in practice but that showed that there was no clearly better cooling schedule than logarithmic schedule to ensure convergence toward the set of optima with probability one. Then we conducted experiments on adaptive cooling schedules to compare classical proposals. This study led to important theoretical results. First we were able to show that several classical adaptive temperature decrement rules proposed in the literature, that had different theoretical foundations and different mathematical equations, were in fact the same practical rule. Next, we were able to calculate a new adaptive decrement rule that exhibit...",

In the past, very large combinatorial optimization problems have been solved using this technique. It has also been shown that this method is effective in obtaining close-to-optimal solutions for problems known to be NP complete. Further, this technique is applicable to a whole class of problems that satisfy a few requirements.\n\nThe purpose of this paper is to illustrate an efficient version of the simulated annealing method as applied to a variant of the bin-packing problem. The computational complexity of the method is linear in input size similar to various well-known heuristic methods for the problem. The solutions obtained, however, are much better than any of the heuristic methods. The particular variant of the bin-packing problem we consider has several practical applications such as static task allocation in process scheduling and batch processing. At the time of this writing, we have not yet seen a stochastic solution to the bin-packing problem in the literature.\n\nOne of the distinguishing features of our research is the high quality of solutions obtained by our method. Extensive simulation experiments we have carried out show that the solutions obtained by the stochastic method show a significant improvement over those obtained by any of the well-known heuristic methods.\n\n- [Previous article in issue](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0898122194900760)\n- [Next article in issue](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0898122194900787)\n\n## Keywords\n\nBin-Packing\n\nCombinatorial optimization\n\nGlobal minimum\n\nMonte Carlo methods\n\nNP completeness\n\nSimulated annealing\n\nStatistical cooling\n\n[View PDF](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0898122194900779/pdf?md5=30492ae375a8dc570527f689a4f3bffb&pid=1-s2.0-0898122194900779-main.pdf)\n\nRecommended articles\n\n## References\n\n01.

The hybrid simulated annealing algorithm uses the modified penalty algorithm to generate an initial solution and then improves it using simulated annealing. It is tested on single-row layout problems with facilities of unequal area and multi-row layout problems with facilities of equal area. The algorithm produced solutions better than those previously reported in the literature for two of the larger single-row problems and five multi-row layout problems. For all the other single-row problems and eight of ten multi-row layout test problems, it produced the best known solutions. The hybrid simulated annealing algorithm appears to produce better quality solutions than the simulated annealing and tabu navigation algorithms, but requires more computation time than simulated annealing.\n\nSpecial issue articlesRecommended articles\n\n- R.E.

Many heuristic algorithms can apply the 2-opt local search to find better solutions. In complete 2-opt local search, every valid neighboring solutions of swapping mechanism will be compared, which is very time consuming especially when a sequential algorithm is adopted. Nowadays, graphic processing units (GPUs) have evolved into powerful and flexible parallel computation platforms that have been widely used to accelerate the solving of NP-hard problems. Therefore, in this study, we focus on how to use GPUs to solve the single-row facility layout problem (SRFLP) with the 2-opt-based simulated annealing (SA) heuristic algorithm. As far as we know, this study is the first to solve SRFLP by using a GPU. After analyzing the fitness function and the move gains calculation between parent and child solutions, we propose a prefix-sum formula table to eliminate a large amount of replicated computation. To calculate move gains for the 2-opt local search during each iteration, many GPU threads are created and they construct and lookup the table in parallel. According to experimental results, if the prefix-sum formula table is not adopted, the GPU version outperforms the sequential CPU counterpart with the best speedup of 123. However, if the table is used in the GPU version, the best speedup can reach up to 3208. Because the proposed parallelization approach with the prefix-sum formula table is based on the features of the 2-opt local search and the SRFLP fitness function, it can be applied to any 2-opt-based heuristic algorithm for solving SRFLP even though the SA algorithm is used in this study.\n\n- ### [A GRASP algorithm for solving large-scale single row facility layout problems](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305054819300486)\n\n\n\n2019, Computers and Operations Research\n\n\n\nShow abstract\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe single-row facility layout problem (SRFLP) is an NP-hard problem, which consists of arranging facilities along a straight line in order to minimize the weighted sum of distances between all pairs of facilities. In this paper, an implementation of the Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP) meta-heuristic is presented to solve large-scale instances of the problem. The novelty of the proposed implementation is that it is endowed with a diversification phase based on frequency memory. The algorithm was tested on 93 instances with sizes up to one thousand facilities. To date, in the literature, there is only one work, which has considered instances of such magnitude. Computational experiments demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm, which improved the best-known values for 29 out of 93 instances.\n\n- ### [Mathematical modeling and multi-start search simulated annealing for unequal-area facility layout problem](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417417305274)\n\n\n\n2018, Expert Systems with Applications\n\n\n\nShow abstract\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this paper, a mixed integer nonlinear programming model (MINLP) is ...",
