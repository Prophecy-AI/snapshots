    "# Analysis of Loop 2 Results and Strategy Evolution\n",
    "\n",
    "## Current Status\n",
    "- **Best CV**: 121.04 (Heavy Rotation 20k)\n",
    "- **Target**: 68.92\n",
    "- **Gap**: ~52 points\n",
    "- **Approach**: C++ Optimization (SA + BP) + Python Rotation Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "## Findings from Loop 2\n",
    "- The \"Heavy Rotation\" experiment improved the score from 121.43 to 121.04.\n",
    "- The improvement (0.39) is small but consistent.\n",
    "- The `tree_packer` was run for 20k iterations.\n",
    "- The rotation optimization was run once.\n",
    "- The BP step was run once.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Research Insights\n",
    "- **Packing Algorithms**:\n",
    "    - **Heuristic Placement**: Bottom-left, lowest-gravity-center. Fast but modest utilization.\n",
    "    - **Meta-heuristics**: GA, PSO. Good for exploring sequences.\n",
    "    - **Exact Methods**: Branch & Bound. Good for small instances.\n",
    "    - **Raster Methods**: COMPACT. Good for arbitrary rotations but resolution dependent.\n",
    "- **Top Kernels**:\n",
    "    - Use C++ optimization with OpenMP.\n",
    "    - Use `fix_direction` (rotation optimization) as a post-processing step.\n",
    "    - Use **Backward Propagation (BP)** extensively.\n",
    "    - Run for **millions** of iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Critical Gap: Compute & Loop\n",
    "- 20k iterations is still too low. We need 200k+.\n",
    "- The loop `Pack -> Rotate -> BP` was run only once. It should be a continuous loop.\n",
    "- The `tree_packer` code shows it has a \"Phase 2: Aggressive back propagation\" built-in.\n",
    "- The `bp.cpp` is a standalone tool that also does backward propagation.\n",
    "- We have **two** BP implementations: one inside `tree_packer` and one standalone `bp`.\n",
    "- The standalone `bp` iterates from N=200 down to N=2, removing trees to find better N-1 configs.\n",
    "- The `tree_packer`'s internal BP does something similar but might be more integrated with the packer.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hypothesis\n",
    "- The standalone `bp` is fast and deterministic.\n",
    "- The `tree_packer` is stochastic.\n",
    "- Alternating them frequently is the key.\n",
    "- The rotation optimization should be applied **before** BP, so BP can exploit the tighter packings.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Plan\n",
    "1. **Analyze `tree_packer` vs `bp`**: Understand if they are redundant or complementary.\n",
    "2. **Optimize the Loop**: Create a Python script that runs `tree_packer` (short bursts) -> `optimize_rotation` -> `bp` in a loop for a fixed duration.\n",
    "3. **Scale Up**: Run for the full duration of the tool (1 hour).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Analysis\n",
    "I will analyze the `submission.csv` from the last run to see which N values are the bottlenecks.\n"
