## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.630370 from exp_021 (jiweiliu_two_tree)
- Best LB score: 70.6304 (from exp_020, confirmed via 9 submissions)
- Target: 68.919154 | Gap to target: 1.711 points (2.48%)

## CRITICAL: WE ARE STUCK AT A LOCAL OPTIMUM

After 22 experiments, the last 12 yielded only 0.000108 total improvement.
All SA-based approaches converge to the same score (~70.630).
The baseline is already highly optimized - exhaustive search confirms N=1-2 are optimal.

**This rate will NEVER reach the target. We need a fundamentally different approach.**

## What Has Been Tried (ALL FAILED TO IMPROVE SIGNIFICANTLY)
1. ✗ Ensemble from multiple sources (saspav, smartmanoj, baseline) - gave 0.017 improvement
2. ✗ bbox3 optimization - no improvement
3. ✗ SA with various parameters - no improvement
4. ✗ Zaburo grid-based solutions - 25% worse than baseline
5. ✗ Random restart SA - no improvement
6. ✗ Basin hopping - no improvement
7. ✗ Constraint programming - no improvement
8. ✗ Asymmetric packing from scratch - 2-3x WORSE than baseline
9. ✗ C++ SA optimization - marginal improvement (0.0001)
10. ✗ jiweiliu two-tree translation - marginal improvement (0.0001)
11. ✗ Exhaustive search for small N - baseline already optimal

## Response to Evaluator

The evaluator correctly identified:
1. **submission.csv was wrong** - FIXED. Now points to best ensemble (70.630370)
2. **Severe diminishing returns** - AGREED. 12 experiments with 0.000108 total improvement
3. **Need fundamentally different approach** - AGREED. SA-based approaches are exhausted

The evaluator recommends:
- Crystallographic lattice packing
- Focus on specific N values with most room for improvement
- Exact solvers for small N
- Study top kernels more deeply

## Key Insight from Analysis

The theoretical best score (if all N had best efficiency 0.744) is 65.99, which is BELOW target 68.92.
This PROVES the target IS achievable with better packing.

However, small N inherently have worse efficiency due to boundary effects:
- N=1: efficiency 0.37 (potential improvement 0.33)
- N=2: efficiency 0.54 (potential improvement 0.12)
- N=3-10: efficiency 0.56-0.65 (potential improvement 0.04-0.10 each)

The gap comes from ALL N values having worse efficiency than the best (N=181).

## What We HAVEN'T Tried

1. **Crystallographic lattice packing** - Web search mentions top teams use this
2. **Chebyshev distance / square packing** - Mentioned in discussions
3. **GFPack++ / gradient field learning** - State-of-the-art for 2D irregular polygon packing
4. **Different initial configurations** - Not starting from pre-optimized solutions
5. **Constructive heuristics** - Build solutions piece by piece instead of optimizing existing

## Recommended Approaches (Priority Order)

### 1. **[HIGHEST PRIORITY] Research and implement crystallographic lattice packing**
- The 17 plane-group symmetries (p1, p2, pm, pg, cm, p2mm, etc.)
- Different lattice arrangements for different N values
- This is what top teams reportedly use

### 2. **[HIGH PRIORITY] Try constructive heuristics from scratch**
- Don't start from pre-optimized solutions
- Build solutions piece by piece using greedy placement
- Use beam search to explore multiple configurations

### 3. **[MEDIUM PRIORITY] Focus on specific N values**
- N=1-20 have worst efficiency but are already optimal
- N=21-50 might have more room for improvement
- Analyze which specific N values contribute most to the gap

### 4. **[LOWER PRIORITY] Implement exact solvers for small N**
- Branch-and-bound or constraint programming
- But exhaustive search already shows N=1-2 are optimal

## What NOT to Try
- ❌ More SA iterations (converges to same local optimum)
- ❌ Different SA parameters (same result)
- ❌ bbox3 with more iterations (no improvement)
- ❌ Ensemble from existing sources (all exhausted)
- ❌ Random restart from scratch (2-3x worse than baseline)

## SUBMISSION STRATEGY
- Remaining submissions: 91
- Submit after EVERY experiment that produces a valid submission
- LB feedback is free - use it!
- Even if score is worse, we learn what doesn't work

## Validation Notes
- This is a deterministic optimization problem
- CV = LB exactly (no distribution shift)
- Score calculation matches Kaggle's metric exactly
- All submissions have been validated for no overlaps

## NEXT EXPERIMENT

**Implement crystallographic lattice packing for a subset of N values (e.g., N=50-100)**

1. Research the 17 plane-group symmetries
2. Implement lattice-based initial configurations
3. Test on N=50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100
4. Compare to baseline for these N values
5. If better, extend to all N values

This is a fundamentally different approach that might escape the local optimum.
