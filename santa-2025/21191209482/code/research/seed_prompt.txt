## CV-LB Relationship Analysis
- This is a DETERMINISTIC optimization problem - CV = LB exactly
- All submissions with same score will get same LB
- No distribution shift issues - the problem is purely optimization

## Response to Evaluator
The evaluator correctly identified that:
1. **Diminishing returns are severe** - Last 11 experiments yielded only 0.000085 total improvement
2. **SA-based approaches converge to same local optimum** - All approaches hit ~70.63
3. **Score breakdown analysis needed** - We need to identify which N values have room for improvement

**Key insight from my analysis:**
- Theoretical minimum is 65.99 (based on best efficiency 0.7444 at N=181)
- Target (68.92) IS achievable but requires improving efficiency across many N values
- Small N (1-10) have WORST efficiency (0.37-0.65) - most room for improvement
- Large N (>150) have BEST efficiency (0.70-0.74) - already near optimal

## Recommended Approaches (Priority Order)

### 1. **[HIGHEST PRIORITY] Submit current best to verify LB score**
We have 92 submissions remaining. Submit the new baseline (70.6279) to verify our scoring matches Kaggle's.

### 2. **[HIGH PRIORITY] Focus on Small N (1-20)**
Small N values have the worst packing efficiency:
- N=1: efficiency 0.37 (worst!)
- N=2: efficiency 0.54
- N=3-10: efficiency 0.56-0.65

These contribute disproportionately to the total score. For example:
- N=1 contributes 0.661 to total score
- N=2 contributes 0.451
- N=3 contributes 0.435

**Approach:** Try exact solvers (branch-and-bound, constraint programming) for N=1-10.
For N=1, the optimal solution should be a single tree at angle that minimizes bounding box.
For N=2, try all possible angle combinations systematically.

### 3. **[MEDIUM PRIORITY] Ensemble from ALL snapshots**
We found snapshot 21191207951 has better score than our previous best.
Create ensemble by picking best valid solution for each N from ALL available snapshots.

### 4. **[MEDIUM PRIORITY] Try different initial configurations**
The jiweiliu kernel uses specific grid configurations for certain N values.
The egortrushin kernel has hand-tuned configurations for N=72, 100, 110, 144, 156, 196, 200.
Try these specific configurations and see if they beat our baseline.

### 5. **[LOW PRIORITY] Asymmetric solutions**
Discussion "Why winning solutions will be asymmetric" (34 votes) suggests asymmetric layouts may help.
For small N, try non-symmetric arrangements.

## What NOT to Try
- ❌ More SA iterations on the same baseline (diminishing returns)
- ❌ Different SA parameters (all converge to same optimum)
- ❌ bbox3 with more iterations (already tried extensively)
- ❌ Tree deletion cascade (produces worse results)

## SUBMISSION STRATEGY
- Remaining submissions: 92
- Submit after this experiment? **YES** - we have abundant submissions and need LB feedback
- Submit the new baseline (70.6279) to verify our scoring

## Validation Notes
- CV scheme: Deterministic - calculate bounding box for each N, sum S²/N
- No train/test split needed - this is optimization, not ML
- Overlap check: Use Shapely to verify no tree overlaps

## Key Metrics to Track
- Total score: sum of S²/N for N=1-200
- Per-N efficiency: (N * tree_area) / bbox_area
- Improvement rate: score improvement per experiment
