## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.625918 (from eazy optimizer + ensemble)
- Best LB score: 70.6304 (from exp_020)
- Target: 68.919154 | Gap to target: 1.707 (2.48%)

## Public Kernel Status
- Have we implemented the best kernel yet? PARTIALLY - implemented eazy optimizer
- Top kernels identified: saspav (450 votes), smartmanoj (374 votes), bbox3 (369 votes), why-not (308 votes), eazy-optimizer (133 votes)
- Kernels we've implemented: bbox3, sa_v1_parallel, eazy optimizer
- Kernels still to explore: More aggressive eazy optimizer runs, different initial configurations

## Response to Evaluator
The evaluator correctly identified that after 25 experiments, ALL approaches converge to ~70.63. The evaluator recommended:
1. **Exhaustive Snapshot Mining** - DONE: Created ensemble from 72 sources, found 0.000508 improvement
2. **Gradient-Based Optimizer (eazy.cpp)** - DONE: Found 0.001690 improvement using eazy optimizer

The eazy optimizer uses a fundamentally different approach (gradient-based with log-barrier functions) and DID find improvements. However, the improvements are still small (0.001690 total this loop).

## Key Insight: The Gap is Still 2.48%
- Current best: 70.625918
- Target: 68.919154
- Gap: 1.707 points (2.48%)
- At current improvement rate (~0.002 per loop), we'd need ~850 loops to reach target

## What We've Learned
1. **All public approaches converge to ~70.63** - SA, bbox3, tessellation, lattice, ensemble all hit the same wall
2. **Eazy optimizer found small improvements** - Gradient-based approach can escape some local optima
3. **Our score beats public LB** - Top public LB is 71.19, we're at 70.63
4. **The target of 68.919 requires techniques not publicly available**

## Recommended Approaches (Priority Order)

### 1. **[HIGH PRIORITY] Continue Eazy Optimizer with Different Configurations**
The eazy optimizer found improvements. Try:
- Longer runs (10+ minutes per N)
- Different scale parameters
- Multiple restarts from different initial configurations
- Focus on N values with worst efficiency

### 2. **[HIGH PRIORITY] Analyze Per-N Score Breakdown**
Calculate which N values contribute most to the gap. The score formula s²/n means:
- Large N with large s contribute disproportionately
- Focus optimization on worst-performing N values

### 3. **[MEDIUM PRIORITY] Try Different Initial Configurations**
Instead of starting from pre-optimized solutions, try:
- Random initial configurations
- Tessellation-based initial configurations
- Asymmetric initial configurations

### 4. **[RESEARCH] Study What Top Teams Do**
The target of 68.919 suggests someone achieved this score. Research:
- What techniques do scores below 69 use?
- Are there any discussions about sub-69 scores?
- What's special about the winning approaches?

## What NOT to Try
- More SA iterations on pre-optimized solutions (proven ineffective)
- Simple ensemble from existing sources (exhausted)
- Grid-based approaches (proven worse than baseline)

## Validation Notes
- CV scheme: Calculate s²/n for each N=1-200, sum all
- Overlap detection: Use Shapely for accurate polygon intersection
- Score verification: Our metric matches Kaggle's exactly

## SUBMISSION STRATEGY
- Remaining submissions: 99
- Submit after this experiment? YES - we have abundant submissions and found improvement
- The eazy optimizer found real improvements, worth validating on LB
