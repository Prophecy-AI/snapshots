      "text": "Asymmetric solutions in two\u2011dimensional polygon packing refer to layouts in which the placed polygons do **not** share a common symmetry axis or repeating motif.  In practice the pieces are allowed to rotate and translate independently so that the overall arrangement is irregular and often aperiodic, which can reduce wasted voids and increase material utilisation\u202f([Frontiers\u202fMech\u202fEng](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/mechanical-engineering/articles/10.3389/fmech.2022.966691/full)).  Because the geometry of each polygon (e.g., a stylised \u201cChristmas\u2011tree\u201d shape) can be oriented arbitrarily, the optimisation algorithm seeks a configuration that maximises the occupied area rather than preserving any global symmetry.\n\nBy contrast, symmetric tessellation patterns are based on a **periodic** tiling of the plane where a single motif repeats by translation, rotation or reflection.  Such tessellations are classified as monohedral/isohedral or regular, and they produce a regular grid\u2011like packing that is easy to generate but often leaves larger systematic gaps when the target shape is irregular\u202f([MIT\u202fTessellations](https://www.mit.edu/~hlb/HS422/tessellations.html)).  For Christmas\u2011tree packing optimisation, a symmetric tessellation would force every tree to occupy the same orientation and spacing, limiting how tightly the trees can nest together.  An asymmetric solution abandons that constraint, allowing trees to interlock in non\u2011repeating ways and typically achieving higher density and lower waste than a symmetric tiling.",

An efficient 2D irregular packing algorithm can effectively improve material utilization and reduce processing costs. The reduction in material consumption will also have a beneficial impact on the environment ( [Ke et al., 2020](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B76)). Therefore, research of the packing problem is of great significance for technology and social interest.\n\nThe 2D packing problem is a type of combinatorial optimization problems to locate parts with different shapes compactly in one or more master sheet material to minimize the occupied space or maximize the utilization of the material. The 2D packing problem is currently recognized as a NP problem, which is mainly solved by heuristic algorithms. In recent years, many scholars have conducted research on 2D irregular packing problems with a verity of solutions.\n\nThere exists a number of review articles on packing and cutting problems. We have summarized the main review literature in the field of 2D packing and cutting as shown in [Table 1](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#T1). Brown ( [Brown, 1971](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B17)) introduced an optimum packing and depletion problem with optimization of space and resource usage. Harvey ( [Salkin and De Kluyver, 1975](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B116)) surveyed the application of mathematical optimization models such as linear programming to the knapsack problem. Bruce ( [Golden, 1976](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B50)) surveyed various approaches to the cutting stock problem. Hinxman ( [Hinxman, 1980](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B65)) surveyed the trim-loss and assortment problems, this research paid more attention to cutting and packaging problems in practical applications, and did not mention much about theoretical methods. Garey and Coffman ( [Garey and Johnson, 1981](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B47); [Coffman et al., 1984](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B27)) surveyed the approximation algorithms for bin packing problems. Israni ( [Israni and Sanders, 1982](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B72)) reviewed the 2D cutting stock problem including almost all 2D packaging problems. The author also proposed a rectangular layout method. Sarin ( [Sarin, 1983](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B118)) reviewed methodologies and literature to solve 2D stock cutting problems and introduced an interactive optimization procedure for a general 2D stock cutting problem. Dyckhoff ( [Dyckhoff et al., 1985](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B38)) described a trim loss and related problems and categorized them briefly. Dudzi\u0144ski ( [Dudzi\u0144ski and Walukiewicz, 1987](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B36)) summarized the exact methods for knapsack problems, such as linear programming. Matthias ( [Rode and Rosenberg, 1987](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B114)) analyzed the algorithm for the trim-loss problems. Haessler ( [Haessler and Sweeney, 1991](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B59)) reviewed the solution process of cutting stock problems, including placement algorithm and sequence optimization algorithm. Dowsland ( [Dowsland and Dowsland, 1992](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B34)) reviewed the application of operations research methods to the packing problem and summarized some exact heuristics. Sweeney ( [Sweeney and Paternoster, 1992](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B128)) categorized cutting and packing problems and made application-oriented research records. Cheng ( [Cheng et al., 1994](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B22)) discussed 2D cutting stock problems and their application cases including the pallet loading problem and VLSI placement problem. With the gradual deepening of research on 2D layout problems, typology becomes a common research topic. 2D regular and irregular layout problems are clearly distinguished in practical applications and theoretical methods. Dowsland ( [Dowsland and Dowsland, 1995](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B29)) gave a special review of the 2D irregular nesting problem for the first time. Mavridou ( [Mavridou and Pardalos, 1997](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B98)) summarized applications of the genetic algorithm and simulated annealing algorithm in the optimization of facility layout problems. Dyckhoff ( [Dyckhoff, 1990](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B37)) made a typology of the cutting and packing problems in detail, and W\u00e4scher ( [W\u00e4scher et al., 2007](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B135)) improved the typology later. Hopper ( [Hopper and Turton, 1999](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B67); [Hopper and Turton, 2001a](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B68); [Hopper and Turton, 2001b](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B69)) investigated the application of meta-heuristic and heuristic algorithms in 2D and 3D packing problems. Lodi ( [Lodi et al., 2002a](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B90); [Lodi et al., 2002b](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B91)) reviewed algorithms proposed in the 1990s of 2D packing problems. Bennell et al.

Even though it might seem like a simple task at first, it is actually quite an involved undertaking. It also usually entails having a broader look at how collision detection algorithms work. In the following sections we'll work our way up to an algorithm with which you can essentially pack any sort of geometric shapes, and combinations thereof.\n![](https://www.gorillasun.de/content/images/2023/03/example1.jpg)\n![](https://www.gorillasun.de/content/images/2023/03/example2.jpg)\nBefore we begin, I want to point out that I had a first encounter with this algo back in February of 2022. I never completed that particular idea, but it led to an interesting packing scheme. You can see some of the artworks my code produced above.\n![](https://www.gorillasun.de/content/images/2023/03/maplands.jpg)\nI also recently learned that a few others have made their own version of this idea. In June I faced a packing problem where I had to draw all sorts of geometric shapes to the canvas. I was left scratching my head at first and it took me quite a while to find a solution. While researching different methods I came across[Amy Goodchild\u2019s](https://twitter.com/amygoodchild?ref=gorillasun.de)[writeup](https://www.amygoodchild.com/blog/maplands?ref=gorillasun.de)on a wonderful sketch of hers called \"Maplands\" where she used a similar strategy to what I ultimately did to implement my idea.\n![](https://www.gorillasun.de/content/images/2023/03/fruitpacking.jpg)\nLater on I also re-discovered[Tarwin Stroh-Spijer's](https://twitter.com/tarwin?ref=gorillasun.de)[fruit salad packing sketch](https://openprocessing.org/sketch/1533577?ref=gorillasun.de), which initially evolved from[Jeff's (aka ippsketch)](https://twitter.com/ippsketch?ref=gorillasun.de)[banana packing sketch](https://ippsketch.com/posts/non-circular-packing/?ref=gorillasun.de).

Despite its deceptive simplicity, bin packing is actually an[NP-Hard problem](https://stackoverflow.com/a/19510170?ref=gorillasun.de), with it's associated decision problem (checking if the items to be packed fit in a certain area), is[NP-Complete](https://gorillasun.de/blog/rectangle-packing-an-incredibly-difficult-problem?ref=gorillasun.de). Understanding this is not necessary for what follows however. I just find it incredibly interesting though, I keep finding myself coming back to this problem thinking: \"Surely this can't be this difficult!\"\nPacking algorithms are useful for a range of real life scenarios, such as packing boxes in a warehouse, or positioning shapes on a sheet of laser cutting material such that the amount of wasted material is minimised. Packing is a heavily researched area of mathematics and fairly advanced algorithms have been developed to solve different variations of it. In generative art the primary goal of packing algorithms is often the creation of visually pleasing and interesting packing patterns. We also often don't start with shapes that have a pre-determined size (usually real life objects have a pre-determined size duh), but make them up on the go.\nHence gen-art packing algorithms vary a little in that regard. I'd like to show off a few artworks that have in one another or another been made with packing algorithms. Here's two stunning artworks from[Caleb Ogg](https://twitter.com/iso_hedron?ref=gorillasun.de):\n![](https://www.gorillasun.de/content/images/2023/03/Colorshift2.jpg)\n![](https://www.gorillasun.de/content/images/2023/03/Lens3.jpg)\nCaleb's pieces[Lens 3](https://superrare.com/0x6125e13fc97f6fc97ea14cf925211e4dc0e99f0f/lens-3-18?ref=gorillasun.de)and[Colorshift 2](https://superrare.com/0x6125e13fc97f6fc97ea14cf925211e4dc0e99f0f/colorshift-2-12?ref=gorillasun.de), part of his ongoing 'Coalesce' series, are some of the most interesting circle packing sketches I've seen in a while. Note that the images shown here (2000x2000px) don't do the originals justice which are absolutely gigantic (16000x16000px). Built on a system of circles and rings, Caleb makes use of an underlying noise field for a nifty creative effect. I especially like how Lens conveys the illusion of multiple overlapping lenses that appear to contort the coloration of the underlying circles, which is done by scaling and multiplying the underlying noise field. Excited to see where this series is heading, always a pleasure when Caleb's sketches bless my timeline.\nA little less recent[example](https://www.infinite.center/2015/08/08/circles-inside-circles/?ref=gorillasun.de)of a circle packing sketch is by none other than Jared Tarbell:\n![](https://www.gorillasun.de/content/images/2023/03/javadpack.jpg)\nAs well as this[beautiful homage](https://www.reddit.com/r/generative/comments/ibk6pf/circle_packing_\u00e0_la_tarbell/?ref=gorillasun.de)to Jared's sketch by prolific creative coder[Dmitri Cherniak](https://twitter.com/dmitricherniak?ref=gorillasun.de):\n![](https://www.gorillasun.de/content/images/2023/03/dimitripack-1.webp)\nIf you like these patterns you should also check out the[Appolonian Gasket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollonian_gasket?ref=gorillasun.de)(alternatively Appolonian circle packing).

The proposed attention-based diffusion model for 2D irregular packing, GFPack++, supports\ncontinuous rotation and accommodating arbitrary boundaries.\n\n## 1\\. Introduction\n\nIrregular shape packing is a classic challenge in operation research, with significant implications for various applications such as texture atlas generation and material utilization in manufacturing\u00a0(Wang et\u00a0al., [2021](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib34)). Its NP-hard nature requires practical and effective packing algorithms to optimize space utilization.\n\nTraditional numerical optimization methods are often slow and costly. Recently, learning-based methods have emerged as a promising alternative for irregular packing, mainly using reinforcement learning\u00a0(Xu et\u00a0al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib37); Yang et\u00a0al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib39)).\nAnother promising approach is the diffusion model, which learns geometric relationships from teacher packing examples and establishes a gradient field for all objects, guiding them to move simultaneously\u00a0(Hosseini et\u00a0al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib11); Xue et\u00a0al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib38)).\nIn particular, the work of (Xue et\u00a0al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib38)), namely GFPack, achieves a notable trade-off between computational cost and space utilization, demonstrating scalability in terms of polygon count and generalizability to rectangular container boundaries.\nHowever, it still faces unresolved issues, notably the lack of support for rotation, a relatively high occurrence of object collisions in results, and limited adaptability to arbitrary boundaries.\n\nThe main idea of the learning-based packing framework is to capture the geometric relationships between shapes, which are essential for the gradient computation.\nSuch relationships in latent space encompass multiple facets: the _spatial (position, orientation) relationship_ of the shapes, the _geometric features relationship_ among them, and the _container boundary conditions_ that constrain them.\nHowever, GFPack falls short in fully representing these relationships.\nIt solely focuses on the positional aspect, neglecting orientation, thus hindering rotational capabilities. Furthermore, it relies on PointNeXt\u00a0(Qian et\u00a0al., [2022](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib24)) for geometric feature extraction, ignoring critical details like polygon edges and resulting in a loss of topological and local features.\nThus, we argue that the full potential of gradient learning has not been thoroughly exploited in GFPack.\n\nIn this study, we introduce two primary strategies to tackle the challenge of learning packing policies.\nFirstly, we use a graph to represent each object and encode it with an _attention-based geometric encoder_, which can capture polygonal geometry information effectively.\nSecondly, we design an _attention-based relation encoding_ mechanism to encode intricate relationships both between polygons and among polygons and boundaries, eliminating the need to explicitly represent the relationships with a graph.\nThis attention-based diffusion model enhances the understanding of how objects interact with each other and the boundaries, resulting in superior performance in both training and inference.\nWe also investigate the utilization distribution between the teacher and inference data and design a weighting function to prioritize tighter teacher data during training, confirmed to be effective.\n\nThis paper makes the following contributions:\n\n1. -\n\n\nWe propose GFPack++, a novel packing framework that employs attention-based learning of gradient fields, supporting continuous rotation and enhancing generalization.\n\n2. -\n\n\nAdvancing beyond GFPack, we encapsulate geometric relationships in an attention-based encoder, incorporating mutual spatial (position, orientation) relationships of objects, their geometric features, and container boundary conditions, and a weighting function to facilitate effective learning policies.\n\n3. -\n\n\nGFPack++ achieves superior irregular packing results, demonstrating higher space utilization over several widely used baselines, one order of magnitude faster than the previous diffusion-based method, coupled with promising generalization for arbitrary boundaries.\n\n\n## 2\\. Related Work\n\n#### Traditional packing approaches\n\nTraditional methods usually involve placement optimization and sequence planning ( _c.f_.surveys\u00a0(Bennell and Oliveira, [2009](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib3); Leao et\u00a0al., [2020](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib18))). Most research focuses on placement optimization with heuristic rules (e.g., BL, BLF), NFP-based search\u00a0(Bennell and Song, [2008](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib4)), or mathematical models\u00a0(Hopper and Turton, [2001](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib10)). Novel approaches include SDF-based placement\u00a0(Pan et\u00a0al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib23)) and spectral domain correlation\u00a0(Cui et\u00a0al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib6)), but they only support limited rotations.

I am given a single polygon as a boundary (convex or concave may also contain holes) and a single \"fill\" polygon (may also be convex or concave, does not contain holes) and I need to fill the boundary polygon with a specified number of fill polygons. (I'm working in 2D).\n\nMany of the polygon packing heuristics I've found assume that the boundary and/or filling polygons will be rectangular and also that the filling polygons will be of different sizes. In my case, the filling polygons may be non-rectangular, but all will be exactly the same.\n\nMaybe this is a particular type of packing problem? If somebody has a definition for this type of polygon packing I'll gladly google away, but so far I've not found anything which is similar enough to be of great use.\n\nThanks.\n\n- [algorithm](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/algorithm)\n- [polygon](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/polygon)\n- [heuristics](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/heuristics)\n- [packing](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/packing)\n\n[Share](https://stackoverflow.com/q/6864382)\n\n[Improve this question](https://stackoverflow.com/posts/6864382/edit)\n\nFollow\n\nasked Jul 28, 2011 at 19:12\n\n[![Craig's user avatar](https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/015502b5e2de5fa52ffa72f5b2bbbd75?s=64&d=identicon&r=PG)](https://stackoverflow.com/users/863506/craig)\n\n[Craig](https://stackoverflow.com/users/863506/craig) Craig\n\n56411 gold badge55 silver badges2020 bronze badges\n\n4\n\n- No, this doesn't look like some well-known special case of the packing problem. Anything that works with distinct shapes should trivially work with identical shapes too. If you have an algorithm that works well for a rectangular boundary, you can try to adapt it for an arbitrary boundary. Modify it so that you can at a flip opre-fill your boundary with some shapes that cannot be moved or deleted (e.g. there's only one way to place them). Solve for a rectangular boundary, pre-filled with some shapes that just leave your original boundary unfilled.

To put this in perspective, the (much) simpler case where you're packing the interior of your bounded polygon with non-overlapping disks is already hard, and disks are the simplest possible \"packing shape\" (with any other shape you have to consider orientation as well as size and center location).\n\nIn fact, I think it's an open problem in [computational geometry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_geometry) to determine for an arbitrary integer N and arbitrary bounded polygonal region (in the Euclidean plane), what is the \"optimal\" (in the sense of covering the greatest percentage of the polygon interior) packing of N inscribed non-overlapping disks, where you are free to choose the radius and center location of each disk. I'm sure the \"best\" answer _is_ known for certain special polygonal shapes (like rectangles, circles, and triangles), but for arbitrary shapes your best \"heuristic\" is probably:\n\n1. Start your shape counter at N.\n2. Add the largest \"packing shape\" you can fit completely inside the polygonal boundary without overlapping any other packing shapes.\n3. Decrement your shape counter.\n4. If your shape counter is > 0, go to step 2.\n\nI say \"probably\" because \"largest first\" isn't always the best way to pack things into a confined space. You can dig into that particular flavor of craziness by reading about the [bin packing problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bin_packing_problem) and [knapsack problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem).\n\n**EDIT:** Step 2 by itself is hard. A reasonable strategy would be to pick an arbitrary point on the interior of the polygon as the center and \"inflate\" the disk until it touches either the boundary or another disk (or both), and then \"slide\" the disk while continuing to inflate it so that it remains inside the boundary without overlapping any other disks until it is \"trapped\" - with at least 2 points of contact with the boundary and/or other disks. But it isn't easy to formalize this \"sliding process\". And even if you get the sliding process right, this strategy doesn't guarantee that you'll find the biggest \"inscribable disk\" - your \"locally maximal\" disk could be trapped in a \"lobe\" of the interior which is connected by a narrow \"neck\" of free space to a larger \"lobe\" where a larger disk would fit.\n\n[Share](https://stackoverflow.com/a/7342898)\n\n[Improve this answer](https://stackoverflow.com/posts/7342898/edit)\n\nFollow\n\n[edited Feb 27, 2013 at 20:29](https://stackoverflow.com/posts/7342898/revisions)\n\nanswered Sep 8, 2011 at 3:46\n\n[![Peter's user avatar](https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f031e9e9b7476fc5d3674fe4a9c59ef2?s=64&d=identicon&r=PG)](https://stackoverflow.com/users/227491/peter)\n\n[Peter](https://stackoverflow.com/users/227491/peter) Peter\n\n2,53611 gold badge2323 silver badges3232 bronze badges\n\n[Add a comment](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6864382/packing-arbitrary-polygons-within-an-arbitrary-boundary)\u00a0\\|\n\n3\n\nThanks for the replies, my requirements were such that I was able to further simplify the problem by not having to deal with orientation and I then even further simplified by only really wor...",

Although tree-representations of this problem have been presented in the open literature extensively, the binary tree representation is shown in this work to be capable of capturing any configuration of such rectangular shapes in two-dimensional space, such as rotations through right angles and translations, and to be advantageous and more general over other approaches when local search [optimization procedures](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/optimisation-procedure) are to be utilized. The construction is such that these boxes must be bound together in pairs having a common edge, and can be extended to contain constrains regarding vertical or horizontal space between the actual objects as well as special types of cuts, e.g. guillotine cuts used in the glass cutting industry. Finally, a simple continuous sheet application is shown as a demonstration of the capabilities of the algorithm in connection with a local search method, specifically threshold accepting.\n\n## Section snippets\n\n## Introduction and literature survey\n\nThis paper presents a methodology suitable for local search methods when these are applied to two-dimensional space partitioning problems. Such problems include the trim loss minimization problem, which finds many applications, as for example in the cutting of two-dimensional shapes from wood, marble, glass, fabric, etc. In these applications the loss of material due to the placement and cutting constraints is the issue of concern and its minimization is the goal of related optimization\n\n## Local search methods: an overview\n\nAlthough the above sited literature is not an exhaustive attempt to account for the enormous bulk of work appearing on the theme topic of this paper, nonetheless it is considered as a representative cross section of advances and ideas in the field as it currently stands. Motivated by the work sited, and from continuous bibliographical search, we observe that interestingly there is still a missing ingredient in terms of an adequate representation of the two-dimensional rectangle packing (or\n\n## The binary tree data structure for rectangle placement and cutting\n\nThe placement of rectangles within a larger piece of cutting stock material (slabs) is considered in this section. Effectively, what will follow is an algorithmic description and elaboration as to how this is achieved using a binary tree, and how various operational constraints can be encapsulated into the moves associated with local search algorithms, such as SA and TA outlined in the previous section.\n\n## Computational demonstration\n\nThe binary tree data structure was implemented within a threshold accepting standard algorithm in C++. The runs were conducted on a Pentium III 750\u00a0MHz computer, using _Bloodshed DevCpp_, a C++ integrated development environment, interfacing _GNU_ C++ on a Windows NT operating system. CPU times are reported in the text within a range, since to obtain a good solution stochastic search methods have to be run from different starting points.\n\nTwo main case studies are presented, focusing on a finite\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis paper has presented a general purpose binary tree data structure for the representation of rectangle layout problems. This representation has been demonstrated to be able to encapsulate both requirements for cost (area) minimization and compaction, and also to be able to capture other operational constraints, such as traverses of objects placed on stock material slabs.\n\nComputational results have been also presented, not so much as to fine-tune a specific optimization procedure, but to\n\n## Acknowledgement\n\nThe author would like to thank Mr. Jose Ignacio Marin Alberdi for the many useful discussions during the development of this work.\n\nSpecial issue articlesRecommended articles\n\n- Beasley, J.

CSP arises when customers require smaller size products and firms need to cut large stock materials efficiently to meet the customer demand; hence, the cutting process becomes an essential transformation technique in production processes immersed in different industries.\n\n\n\n\n\nShow abstract\n\nThe Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is characterized by digitalization, networking, and smartness, which opens a world of the interconnection of all things and makes mass personalization possible. As a result, traditional industrial firms are forced to change their operation mode from the manufacture-oriented one to the manufacture-and-service-oriented type. In particular, furniture production is a typical domain featured by mass personalization from networking, where order selection (service aspect) and board cutting (manufacture aspect) are mainly concerned. We formulate customized furniture production as a multi-objective optimization problem and propose two algorithms to solve it, i.e., an integrated algorithm and a tw...",
