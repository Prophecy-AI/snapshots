The competition\u2019s discussion pages and the Kaggle competition description focus on fitting tree\u2011shaped items into the smallest square parcel, and the only technical paper linked (a 2022 arXiv pre\u2011print on greedy and local\u2011search heuristics for area\u2011optimal polygons) discusses generic greedy and local\u2011search strategies, not a k\u2011mer\u2011based exploration technique\u202f([export.arxiv.org](https://export.arxiv.org/pdf/2106.14728v1.pdf)). Consequently, there is no concrete information in the current search results about how a k\u2011mer exploration approach is defined or applied within the Santa\u202f2025 competition. If you need details on that specific method, you may have to consult the competition\u2019s private discussion threads, solution notebooks, or the authors\u2019 own code repositories, which are not captured in the available sources.",

      "text": "Lo\u00efc Crombez \nGuilherme D Da Fonseca \nYan Gerard \nGreedy and Local Search Heuristics to Build Area-Optimal Polygons\n\nIn this paper, we present our heuristic solutions to the problems of finding the maximum and minimum area polygons with a given set of vertices. Our solutions are based mostly on two simple algorithmic paradigms: greedy method and local search. The greedy heuristic starts with a simple polygon and adds vertices one by one, according to a weight function. A crucial ingredient to obtain good solutions is the choice of an appropriate weight function that avoids long edges. The local search part consists of moving consecutive vertices to another location in the polygonal chain. We also discuss the different implementation techniques that are necessary to reduce the running time.\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn this paper, we consider the optimal area polygonalization problem, i.e. the problem of finding large and small area simple polygons with a given vertex set. Optimal area polygonalization resembles to the well-known travelling salesman problem, the difference being that the objective function of the former is the area of the computed polygon instead of its perimeter. This problem has been the subject of the 2019 Geometric Optimization Challenge and is known to be NP-hard for both minimization and maximization [2]. Exact algorithms are discussed in [3] and a recent state of the art is given in [1].\n\nIn this paper, we describe the algorithm that we developed during the 2019 Geometric Optimization Challenge. Our results gave us the second place, both for the minimization and maximization contests. Throughout, we refer to the score of a solution as the area of the polygon divided by the area of the convex hull. The score is a real number between 0 and 1, and a lower score is better for the minimization version while a higher score is better for the maximization version. The scores obtained on the instances of the challenge are in the range [0.025, 0.352] for the minimization problem and in the range [0.835, 0.976] for the maximization problem. These two intervals become [0.110, 0.135] and [0.871, 0.924] if we only consider the uniform instances of at least 100 points where the inputs sets have been randomly generated in a square with a uniform density function. More results are presented in Section 4.\n\nOur results have been obtained with a relatively simple and fast heuristic coded in Python and executed with pypy3. The heuristic consists of two phases: a greedy heuristic and a subsequent local search optimization. It is surprising that our results are very competitive when compared to the more complex approaches used by the other teams [1]. The whole source code is available at github.com/gfonsecabr/poLYG and is less than 500 lines long, requiring no external library. While during the challenge we used several different machines, all the running times presented herein have been obtained on a Dell XPS 13-9380 laptop with an Intel i7-10510U CPU and 16GB of RAM running Fedora 32 Linux. The implementation only uses one CPU thread and the other CPU threads were kept mostly idle during the benchmarks.\n\nThe paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the algorithmic approach we used. In Section 3, we present different techniques implemented to make the code run faster and find better solutions. Section 4 presents our results. In Section 5, we discuss some possible improvements.\n\n\nMethods\n\nIn the next two sections, we describe the two phases of our solution. For simplicity, we focus only on the maximum area polygon. The few changes necessary to solve the minimization version are described in Section 2.3.\n\n2.1. Greedy Heuristic. Let S be the input set with n points. Throughout the execution of the algorithm, we work with a simple polygon P whose set of vertices is a subset of S. The set of points in S which are not yet vertices of P is denotedP . The current polygon P is initialized with the convex hull of S.\n\nEach greedy step consists of choosing a point q \u2208 P and inserting q in the current polygon P . We insert q as the intermediary point of an edge p 1 , p 2 \u2208 P so that our current polygon P has two new edges p 1 , q and q, p 2 replacing p 1 , p 2 . We preserve at each step the simplicity of P by verifying that the new edges p 1 , q and q, p 2 do not cross the existing edges of P .\n\nWe repeat our greedy steps until either the set P becomes empty or until no point of P can possibly be inserted anywhere in P (see Figure 2). In the former case the algorithm successfully finds a solution, and in the latter case it fails. Our experiments showed that if the triple q, p 1 , p 2 is chosen carefully at each step, as we explain in the next paragraphs, then the heuristic hardly ever fails. Hence, we simply ignored the extremely rare failures and when it happened we used a different value of the parameter \u03b1 described later on to guide the heuristic.\n\nThe choice of the triple q, p 1 , p 2 at each step is essential to the quality of the solution. A strategy investigated in [5] is to randomly choose the point q in P and then choose the best edge p 1 , p 2 where to insert q. We employ a more exhaustive search. At each step we choose the triple minimizing weight(p 1 , p 2 , q), for a weight function to be described next. Perhaps, the most natural greedy choice is to minimize the area of the triangle p 1 p 2 q (denoted area(p 1 p 2 q)), since the area of P will decrease by exactly area(p 1 p 2 q) when q is inserted between p 1 and p 2 . In this case, we say that the weight function is weight(p 1 , p 2 , q) = area(p 1 p 2 q). This weight function has the property that all points of P lie in the interior of P . However, this function leads to very long edges as shown in    Table 1. Scores before and after local search for different values of \u03b1 and instances with 500 points. The scores above use the formula weight(p 1 , p 2 , q) = area(p 1 p 2 q) + \u03b1( qp 1 + qp 2 \u2212 p 1 p 2 ) while the ones below use weight(p 1 , p 2 , q) = area(p 1 p 2 q) + \u03b1( qp 1 + qp 2 + p 1 p 2 ). Figure 1(a). While long edges may seem like a good choice at short term, they dramatically reduce the search space of potential new triangles, which will hence deteriorate the solution at long term and often make the algorithm fail. We experimented with several different weight functions in order to obtain better solutions. The best function that we found by penalizing long edges is\nweight(p 1 , p 2 , q) = area(p 1 p 2 q) + \u03b1( qp 1 + qp 2 \u2212 p 1 p 2 ),\nwhere \u00b7 denotes the Euclidean distance and \u03b1 is a small parameter. The term qp 1 + qp 2 penalizes the creation of long edges, while the term \u2212 p 1 p 2 favors breaking existing long edges. Another weight function that gives good results is obtained by replacing the minus sign by a plus sign, and numerous other variations exist. Notice that these functions do not guarantee that all points of P lie in the interior of P .\n\nThe value of area(p 1 p 2 q) is a positive number if q is inside P and a negative number otherwise. Using signed areas (negative for clockwise triangles) is important, since some input points in P may possibly lie outside P . We determined that the best values of \u03b1 are generally in the range 1/150 \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 1/50. Unless otherwise specified, the examples in this paper use \u03b1 = 1/90. Figure 1(b) shows the improvement obtained by penalizing long edges, while Table 1 shows some scores achieved through different weight functions (the local search algorithm is discussed in the next section).\n\n\nLocal Search.\n\nAfter obtaining the greedy solution, we perform a second phase to improve the score of the solution, by making local changes to the polygon. The simplest optimization we perform consists of moving one vertex v to another position in the polygonal chain, between the endpoints of an edge u 1 u 2 (Figure 3(a)), adding the edges u 1 v and vu 2 , while removing the edge u 1 u 2 . A more general version of this procedure consists of moving a path V = v 1 ,...",

The final solution is evaluated by an ensemble score that combines all cases.\n**Notebook Link**:[Santa 2025 - Christmas Tree Packing Challenge V1](https://www.kaggle.com/code/adityapawar327/santa-2025-christmas-tree-packing-challenge-v1)\n**Public Score**: 85.92\n## Table of Contents\n[](#table-of-contents)\n* Library Imports and Environment Setup\n* Global Configuration and Precision Settings\n* ChristmasTree Class Definition\n* Utility Functions (Scoring/Collision)\n* Simulated Annealing Algorithm (N &lt; 20)\n* Grid Search Algorithm (N &gt;= 20)\n* Hybrid &amp; Ensemble Solvers\n* Main Computation Loop (N = 1 to 200)\n* Submission Formatting and Export\n## Methodology\n[](#methodology)\n* **Small N (&lt; 20):**Uses Simulated Annealing for efficient search in small configuration spaces.\n* **Large N (&gt;= 20):**Uses a tailored Grid Search for tractable solution space exploration.\n* **Hybrid/Ensemble:**Runs multiple seeds and chooses the best solution for each N.\n* **Collision Detection:**Employs Shapely geometry operations to prevent tree overlap.\n* **Performance:**Code leverages parallelization (`ProcessPoolExecutor`) and high-precision (Decimal) arithmetic.\n## Usage\n[](#usage)\n1. Install dependencies:\n* `shapely`,`numpy`,`pandas`,`matplotlib`,`tqdm`\n* Run the notebook or script sequentially to output results and save a`submission.csv`.\n* Check the score on important N cases (e.g., 1, 10, 25, 50, 100, 150, 200).\n## Output\n[](#output)\n* The notebook prints key logs during computation.\n* A`submission.csv`is generated with columns:`id`,`x`,`y`,`deg`(example row:`001\\_0, s-9.146226, s-0.12832, s-224.999647`).\n## License\n[](#license)\nThis project is released under the[Apache 2.0 License](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).\n## Author\n[](#author)\nAditya Pawar ([Kaggle Profile](https://www.kaggle.com/adityapawar327))\nFor questions or collaboration, feel free to reach out via Kaggle discussions or connect on[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adityapawar327).\n## About\nIn this re-defined optimization problem, help Santa fit Christmas tree toys into the smallest (2-dimension) parcel size possible so that ...",
