An efficient 2D irregular packing algorithm can effectively improve material utilization and reduce processing costs. The reduction in material consumption will also have a beneficial impact on the environment ( [Ke et al., 2020](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B76)). Therefore, research of the packing problem is of great significance for technology and social interest.\n\nThe 2D packing problem is a type of combinatorial optimization problems to locate parts with different shapes compactly in one or more master sheet material to minimize the occupied space or maximize the utilization of the material. The 2D packing problem is currently recognized as a NP problem, which is mainly solved by heuristic algorithms. In recent years, many scholars have conducted research on 2D irregular packing problems with a verity of solutions.\n\nThere exists a number of review articles on packing and cutting problems. We have summarized the main review literature in the field of 2D packing and cutting as shown in [Table 1](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#T1). Brown ( [Brown, 1971](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B17)) introduced an optimum packing and depletion problem with optimization of space and resource usage. Harvey ( [Salkin and De Kluyver, 1975](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B116)) surveyed the application of mathematical optimization models such as linear programming to the knapsack problem. Bruce ( [Golden, 1976](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B50)) surveyed various approaches to the cutting stock problem. Hinxman ( [Hinxman, 1980](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B65)) surveyed the trim-loss and assortment problems, this research paid more attention to cutting and packaging problems in practical applications, and did not mention much about theoretical methods. Garey and Coffman ( [Garey and Johnson, 1981](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B47); [Coffman et al., 1984](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B27)) surveyed the approximation algorithms for bin packing problems. Israni ( [Israni and Sanders, 1982](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B72)) reviewed the 2D cutting stock problem including almost all 2D packaging problems. The author also proposed a rectangular layout method. Sarin ( [Sarin, 1983](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B118)) reviewed methodologies and literature to solve 2D stock cutting problems and introduced an interactive optimization procedure for a general 2D stock cutting problem. Dyckhoff ( [Dyckhoff et al., 1985](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B38)) described a trim loss and related problems and categorized them briefly. Dudzi\u0144ski ( [Dudzi\u0144ski and Walukiewicz, 1987](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B36)) summarized the exact methods for knapsack problems, such as linear programming. Matthias ( [Rode and Rosenberg, 1987](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B114)) analyzed the algorithm for the trim-loss problems. Haessler ( [Haessler and Sweeney, 1991](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B59)) reviewed the solution process of cutting stock problems, including placement algorithm and sequence optimization algorithm. Dowsland ( [Dowsland and Dowsland, 1992](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B34)) reviewed the application of operations research methods to the packing problem and summarized some exact heuristics. Sweeney ( [Sweeney and Paternoster, 1992](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B128)) categorized cutting and packing problems and made application-oriented research records. Cheng ( [Cheng et al., 1994](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B22)) discussed 2D cutting stock problems and their application cases including the pallet loading problem and VLSI placement problem. With the gradual deepening of research on 2D layout problems, typology becomes a common research topic. 2D regular and irregular layout problems are clearly distinguished in practical applications and theoretical methods. Dowsland ( [Dowsland and Dowsland, 1995](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B29)) gave a special review of the 2D irregular nesting problem for the first time. Mavridou ( [Mavridou and Pardalos, 1997](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B98)) summarized applications of the genetic algorithm and simulated annealing algorithm in the optimization of facility layout problems. Dyckhoff ( [Dyckhoff, 1990](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B37)) made a typology of the cutting and packing problems in detail, and W\u00e4scher ( [W\u00e4scher et al., 2007](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B135)) improved the typology later. Hopper ( [Hopper and Turton, 1999](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B67); [Hopper and Turton, 2001a](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B68); [Hopper and Turton, 2001b](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B69)) investigated the application of meta-heuristic and heuristic algorithms in 2D and 3D packing problems. Lodi ( [Lodi et al., 2002a](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B90); [Lodi et al., 2002b](https://www.frontiersin.org/www.frontiersin.org#B91)) reviewed algorithms proposed in the 1990s of 2D packing problems.

The objective of this classical combinatorial NP-hard problem is to pack a set of items (small rectangles) in the minimum number of bins (larger rectangles). The first stage is the key-point of the _Positions and Covering_, where for each item, it is generated in a pseudo-polynomial way a set of valid positions that indicate the possible ways of packing the item into the bin. In the second stage, a new set-covering formulation, strengthen with three sets of valid inequalities, is used to select the optimal non-overlapping configuration of items for each bin. Experimental results for the P&C method are presented and compared with some of the best algorithms in the literature for small and medium size instances. Furthermore, we are considering both cases of the 2D-BPP, with and without rotations of the items by 90\u00b0. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first exact approaches to obtain optimal solutions for the rotation case.\n\n**Citation:** Cid-Garcia NM, Rios-Solis YA (2020) Positions and covering: A two-stage methodology to obtain optimal solutions for the 2d-bin packing problem.

All the bins are identical with width _W_ and height _H_, and each item _i_ \u2208 _I_ has a specific width _w_ _i_ and height _h_ _i_. In several works of the literature, the authors consider the demand of each item independently, i.e., items with the same size are seen as different elements. In this study, we group the items with the same size and compute the demand for each one, represented by _d_ _i_ for _i_ = 1, \u2026, _n_. We assume that all input data are positive integers and that _w_ _i_ \u2264 _W_ and _h_ _i_ \u2264 _H_, for _i_ = 1, \u2026, _n_.

The goal of this optimization problem is to place a set of irregular\npolygons onto a material sheet without overlapping and in a way that minimizes wasted\nmaterial.\nIn this thesis, we delve into a fast 2D packing algorithm that automatically arranges\nparts of a user\u2019s design onto their available material sheets to provide live feedback on\nhow much material they have left. To do this, we make use of the concept of the no fit\npolygon to generate candidate placements, and we utilize custom heuristics and performance\noptimization to improve packing quality and runtime .\nOur technical evaluation shows that the implementation is fast enough to work at\ninteractive speeds and produce solutions of similar quality to other tools and algorithms that\nperform automated packing.\nThesis Supervisor: Stefanie Mueller\nTitle: Assistant Professor\n3\n4\nAcknowledgments\nFirst of all, I would like to extend my deepest gratitude to my advisor, Professor Stefanie\nMueller.

The proposed approach is different from two-dimensional bin packing (2Dbp) methods:\nRather than starting with fixed size items of the 3D structure (with widths or heights smaller than\nthose of the bin), as is done in 2Dbp algorithms, combined items (with widths or heights that can be\ngreater than those of the bin) are utilized. These items are obtained by combining the neighboring\nitems. A method of generating combined items from a 3D structure is first explained. The packing\napproach for the combined items obtained is then described. Four operators are introduced for com\u0002bined items\u2019 packing. Packing positions (Pp) on bins are computed by Pp finder. Following this, the\norientations of combined items are changed via orientation modifier to find better packing orien\u0002tations for combined items. Split operator splits combined items during packing if they exceed the\nbin boundary. Placement decision-maker (Pd-maker) determines which combined item is placed on\nwhich packing position via a cost function attaining lower values if packing produces less waste. A\nshipbuilding problem is utilized throughout the paper to explain the proposed method. A given ship\nhull is packed into bins, and experiments show that the proposed approach is advantageous in terms\nof minimizing bin waste.\nKEYWORDS\nComputational geometry;\nTwo-dimensional bin\npacking; Optimization\n1. Introduction\nThis study investigates an extended version of the two\u0002dimensional bin packing (2Dbp) problem, which can\nbe employed for packing large three-dimensional (3D)\nstructures into bins. 2Dbp methods pack items into iden\u0002tical bins, each with length L and width W. Each item j\nis defined by a length lj and width wj, where lj \u2264 L and\nWj \u2264 W (i.e., item size constraint), for 1, ... , n. Here, the\noverall goal is to minimize the total waste of bins, with\nno items overlapping with other items and all items con\u0002tained in the bins. Here, rather than starting with fixed\u0002size items (with lengths or widths that are smaller than\nthose of the bin), as is done in 2Dbp algorithms, we argue\nthat it is advantageous to utilize larger items (obtained by\ncombining neighboring items) whose lengths or widths\ncan be greater than those of the bin. These large items can\nbe dynamically split into smaller items while packing.\nFigure 1 illustrates the basics of the proposed\napproach. Let us consider a two-dimensional (2D) struc\u0002ture (Fig. 1(a)) that has to be produced using 2D flat bins\n(Fig. 1(b)). One way to accomplish this is to decompose\nthis structure into small items manually while consider\u0002ing shape of the given 2D flat bins. These items can then\nbe packed into the bins. The gray items shown in Fig. 1(c)\nCONTACT Erkan Gunpinar gunpinar@itu.edu.tr\nand (d) are packed into the bins without producing any\nbin waste. In contrast, the items in pink are packed into\nthe bins with some amount of bin waste (Fig. 1(e)). When\nthe proposed approach in this study is applied, the items\nfrom (1) to (12) are combined while considering their\nneighboring relationships; thus, three combined plates\n(in blue) are obtained (Fig. 1(d)). These combined plates\nare split at the required location during packing, which\ncan decrease bin waste production. The items (2) and (3)\nare split wherever required, and no bin waste is produced\n(Fig. 1(f)).\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows.\nSection 2 reviews relevant literature, while Section 3 illus\u0002trates a shipbuilding application and details the genera\u0002tion of combined items. Section 4 describes the Split-and\u0002Pack approach, and numerical results of the proposed\nmethod are given in Section 5. Concluding remarks and\nopportunities for future work are presented in Section 6.\n2. Related literature\n2Dbp techniques pack a given set of 2D rectangles io\nrectangular bins while minimizing the number of bins\nused. Gilmore et al. [12] proposed the first model for\n\u00a9 2017 CAD Solutions, LLC, http://www.cadanda.com\n12 E. GUNPINAR\nFigure 1. A two-dimensional (2D) structure (a) is produced using 2D flat bins (b). Items shown in gray and pink (c) are packed into bins\nwith some bin waste (e). Once combined items (in blue) obtained by merging neighboring items (d) are utilized, no bin waste is produced,\nas the items can be split at the required location (see dashed yellow line in (f)).\n2Dbp problems. Beasley [3] considered the cutting stock\nproblem, which is a variant of the 2Dbp problem, and\nformulated it based on an integer linear programming\nformulation. Other studies [2, 17] proposed a method for\n2Dbp problems where guillotine cuts are utilized. Guil\u0002lotine cuts are edge-to-edge cuts parallel to the edges\nof bins.\nThere are off-line and on-line 2Dbp algorithms: Off\u0002line algorithms have full knowledge of the input item\nset, as in the present work; in contrast, on-line algo\u0002rithms [9] pack items as soon as they are encountered\nwithout knowledge of the subsequent items. In the litera\u0002ture, on-line algorithms are classified into two categories,\nnamely one-phase and two-phase algorithms. One-phase\nalgorithms (i.e., 2Dbp) pack the items into finite bins,\nwhereas two-phase algorithms [2, 8, 11] (i.e., strip pack\u0002ing) pack items into a single strip (i.e., bin with a specific\nwidth and infinite height). The problem of the present\nstudy requires a one-phase algorithm. Level algorithms\nare generally used for bin or strip packing; here pack\u0002ing is achieved by placing items, from left to right, in\nrows forming levels. Three methods for level packing\nhave been proposed for the one-dimensional (1D) case.\nNext-fit Decreasing Height (NFDH) packs items in a left\u0002justified manner if they fit. Otherwise, a new level is\nformed and a new item is packed left justified to that. In\nthe First-fit Decreasing Height (FFDH) approach, items\nare left justified on the first level where they fit. If there\nis no fit, a new level is initialized, as in NFDH. Best\u0002fit Decreasing Height (BFDH) packs items left justified\non the current level, among those that fit, for which the\nunused horizontal space is minimized. If there is no level\nwhere the items fit, a new level is initialized, as in NFDH.\nFrenk et al. [11] proposed the Hybrid Next-fit (HNF)\nalgorithm, where NFDH is utilized in the first phase. The\n1D bin-packing problem is then solved by the Next-fit\nDecreasing (NFD) algorithm in the second phase, which\npacks an item to the current bin if it fits and starts a\nnew bin otherwise.

One particular category of these packing problems is\ntwo-dimensional packing, which is encountered in everyday scenarios like arranging items\non a shelf and in industrial applications such as cutting cookies from rolled-out dough\nor manufacturing sets of tiles from standard-sized panels made of wood, glass, or metal.\nAnother intriguing example involves cutting fabric pieces for clothing production. In this\ncase, the pieces often cannot be rotated freely, as they must adhere to a desired pattern\nin the final product, which is tailored of multiple elements. The widespread applicability\nof two-dimensional packing problems has led to a surge of interest in designing efficient\nalgorithms to address them. In this paper, we follow the line of research and study the\nproblem of packing convex polygons without rotations in various settings depending on the\ntype of containers used.\nPast research focusing on theoretical considerations of two-dimensional packings mainly\nconcentrates on the scenario when all objects are axis-parallel rectangles. In this paper, we\nwill discuss packing without rotations, in which only translations are permitted. There are\ntwo main classes of the problem depending on whether the size of the container is fixed and\nwe want to minimize the number of containers used or whether we want to minimize the\ncontainer\u2019s size with respect to some objective function.\nA seminal example of the first class is the Geometric Bin Packing problem in which\na number of unit size squared bins to pack is to be minimized. The problem is arguably\nthe most natural generalization of the regular (1D) Bin Packing to two dimensions, and\nits absolute approximability has been fully understood. Unless P = N P, the best possible\nefficient constant factor approximation is 2 [15], and such an algorithm is known [10].\nIn the second class, there are several variants to be considered. An example is the\nStrip Packing Problem which is concerned with packing objects into a strip of width\n1 and infinite height in such a way that the maximum of all the heights of the placed\nobjects is minimized. Like Geometric Bin Packing, Strip Packing generalizes (1D)\nBin Packing. The best known efficient constant factor approximation for Strip Packing\nhas approximation factor (5/3 + \u03f5) [9]. It is known that there can not exist a polynomial\ntime algorithm with an approximation ratio of (3/2 \u2212 \u03f5) for any \u03f5 > 0 unless P = N P, which\nfollows directly from the approximation hardness of (1D) Bin Packing. Both classes of\nproblems have been also considered in the asymptotic setting, see e.g. [11, 5, 12].\nIn younger time, there was also an increase of interest in cases where the objects in\nquestion are general convex polygons. Alt, de Berg and Knauer [2, 3] considered the problem\nof packing an instance consisting of a number of convex polygons of the form p \u2282 [0, 1]2into\na minimum area axis-parallel rectangular container. We refer to this problem as Polygon\nArea Minimization throughout this paper. In the special case where the instance consists\nof rectangles only, the problem is known to admit a PTAS [4]. They proved the existence of\nthe following efficient algorithm:\nA 23.78-approximation for Polygon Area Minimization.\nRecently, Aamand, Abrahamsen, Beretta and Kleist [1] showed that the algorithm of Alt,\nde Berg and Knauer can be leveraged to obtain also efficient approximation algorithms of\nfurther problems:\nA 7-approximation for Polygon Perimeter Minimization.\nA 51-approximation for Polygon Strip Packing.\nAn 11-approximation for Polygon Bin Packing for polygons with diameter at most 1\n10 .\nA. Kurpisz and S. Suter 3\n1.1 Our results\nThe results of Alt, de Berg and Knauer [2, 3] and Aamand et al. [1] are heavily based on\nso-called shelf packing algorithms. In shelf packing algorithms, the objects are first placed\non the shelves, possibly ordered by height, which are later stacked on one another to build\na final solution. Compared to axis-parallel rectangles, the main challenge in designing an\napproximation algorithm for polygon packing problems is that objects cannot be sorted by\nheight and orientation simultaneously. As a result, the algorithm and its analysis in [2, 3]\nhave such a large approximation guarantee. In this paper, we provide new insight into how\nshelf packing algorithms should be applied to polygon packing problems. We introduce a\nsequence of transformations of the objects that allow us first to sort them by height and later\nby orientation to build a solution of a much better approximation guarantee. More precisely,\nwe design polynomial-time algorithms with the following factors:\nA 9.45-approximation for Polygon Area Minimization.\nUsing this algorithm as a subroutine, we build upon the methods from Aamand et al. [1] to\nobtain the following efficient approximation algorithms:\nA (3.75 + \u03f5)-approximation for Polygon Perimeter Minimization.\nA 21.89-approximation for Polygon Strip Packing.\nA 5.09-approximation for Polygon Bin Packing for polygons which have their diameter\nbounded by 1\n10 .\nThe results are proved in Sections 4, 5, 6, and 7 respectively. Furthermore, in Section 8\nwe show the following results, which make progress towards solving an open question of a\nO(1)-approximation algorithm for Polygon Bin Packing for arbitrary polygons.\nThere is an efficient O(\n1\n\u03b4\n)-approximation algorithm for Polygon Bin Packing for\ninstances where each polygon has width or height at most 1 \u2212 \u03b4.\nThere is an efficient O(1)-approximation algorithm for Polygon Bin Packing for\ninstances with the property that all polygons share a spine (up to translation) with height\nat least 3\n4\n.\n2 Preliminaries\nWe start out considerations by recalling a classical and well-known problem in theoretical\ncomputer science, the Bin Packing problem: Given a list of numbers s1, . . . , sn \u2208 (0, 1] \u2229 Q,\nrepresenting the sizes of n objects, the goal is to find the minimum number of bins of size 1,\nso that we can pac...",

We also want to thank Dominik Krupke for providing a\nhelpful official validator for solutions.\n1 Introduction\nThe recent CG:SHOP 2024 Challenge introduced a variant of irregular packing problems\nknown as the Maximum Polygon Packing (MPP) problem. The MPP problem involves a\nconvex polygonal container C and a polygon set P = {p1, p2, ..., pN }, where polygon piis\nassociated with a value vi. It seeks for a non-overlapping packing with the maximum total\nvalue. The challenge presents a total of 180 instances whose number of polygons ranges from\n28 to 50,000. The official document [4] gives a detailed description of the challenge.\nOur proposed algorithm employs a general process to solve these instances indiscriminately,\nand the overall framework is presented in Figure 1. We first partition a large-scale problem\ninto multiple small-scale subproblems (Section 2) and then solve each subproblem using\nupper-level polygon ordering (Section 3.1) and lower-level packing optimization techniques\n(Section 3.2). Section 4 presents our experimental results, followed by conclusions.\n1 Corresponding author: Zhouxing Su\n\u00a9 Canhui Luo, Zhouxing Su, and Zhipeng L\u00fc;\nlicensed under Creative Commons License CC-BY 4.0\n40th International Symposium on Computational Geometry (SoCG 2024).\nEditors: Wolfgang Mulzer and Jeff M.

It involves two components: partitioning the container C into\nmultiple regions and assigning polygons to each region.\n2.1 Container Partitioning\nThe container partitioning process consists of two steps, as shown in Figure 2. Initially, we\narrange two-dimensional square grids starting from the bottom-left corner of the bounding\nbox until the entire container is covered. The subregions formed by the intersection of the\ncontainer with all the grids constitute its partition C = C1 \u222a C2 \u222a ... \u222a Cm. Subsequently,\nwe merge the small subregions with adjacent grids, which are difficult to be used effectively.\nThe grid is dimensioned to keep the scale of each subproblem at approximately 300 polygons,\nmaking a trade-off between effectiveness and efficiency of lower-level packing optimization.\n2.2 Polygon Assignment\nWe adopt a simple approach of randomly assigning polygons to each subregion. Specifically, for\neach subregion Ci, we randomly select a polygon pj from P until\nP\nj\narea(pj )\narea(Ci) \u2265\nPN\ni=0\narea(pi)\narea(C)\n.\nThe advantage of random assignment lies in ensuring that the overall characteristics of each\nsubproblem align with the original problem.\nC.

We repeatedly select one remaining polygon with the\nhighest priority (ties are broken by value) and try to insert it into the current solution. If the\ninsertion with lower-level packing optimization fails, we skip the current polygon and turn to\nthe next one. For the majority of instances, the priority is defined as the value-to-area ratio\nof a polygon (we also call it unit value). Polygons with higher unit values are prioritized\nfor putting in the container, which is called the Unit Value First (UVF) strategy. For\nsmall-scale instances (N < 100), we employ the \u03b1\u03b2-random strategy. It randomly selects\n\u03b1% and \u03b2% of the polygons and reassigns their UVF-based priority to the highest and the\nlowest, respectively. These instances are run for multiple times to ensure comprehensive\noptimization, with \u03b1 and \u03b2 set to 10 in our implementation.\n3.2 Lower-Level Packing Optimization\nThe position of a polygon can be represented by the coordinates l = (x, y) of a reference point,\nsuch as the bottom-left corner of the boundary. Then, the translation of a polygon can be\nrepresented by a vector pointing from its original position to its new position. Given a feasible\npacking S and a polygon p to be placed, it is impossible to find a non-overlapping position\nfor p without moving other polygons in most cases. This section introduces the algorithm for\neliminating overlaps for an invalid packing, which involves solving an unconstrained nonlinear\nproblem and heuristic polygon movement.\nS o C G 2 0 2 4\n86:4 A General Heuristic Approach for Maximum Polygon Packing\n3.2.1 Overlap Minimization\nTo determine the appropriate translation for the polygons, we utilized the no-fit polygon\n(NFP) and inner-fit polygon (IFP), which are fundamental in algorithmic approaches to\ngeometric design and optimization challenges. For a fixed polygon pi and a movable polygon\npj , NFP(pi, pj ) describes their non-overlapping positions with boundaries in contact precisely,\nwhich can be utilized to determine the minimum translation for pj to avoid overlap. Similarly,\nIFP(pi, pj ) is employed to determine the minimum translation to place pj inside pi. Figure 3\nillustrates the polygon translations determined using NFP (left) and IFP (right). The readers\nmay refer to Burke et al. [2] for a more detailed description.\nFor a packing S, based on NFP and IFP, we define the overlap between polygons pi\nand pj as fij (S), representing the minimum translation to separate them, and f0i(S) as the\nminimum translation for moving pi to fit into the container. Subsequently, we employ the\nseparation algorithm proposed by Imamichi et al. [7] to minimize the overlap, which involves\nsolving an unconstrained nonlinear programming problem as follows:\nmin\nS\nF(S) = X\n0\u2264i<j\u2264N\nf\n2\nij (S) (1)\nThe model relaxes the non-overlapping constraint but introduces repulsion forces between\nany two overlapped polygons. We use the classic L-BFGS (limited memory BFGS) method\nto solve this problem. It makes the packing S converge to a local optimum but strongly\ndepends on the initial layout. ...",
