## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.627582 from exp_021 (snapshot 21191211160)
- Best LB score: 70.6276 (confirmed via 9 submissions)
- Target: 68.919154 | Gap to target: 1.708 points (2.42%)
- Submissions used: 9/100 (91 remaining)

## CV-LB Relationship Analysis
- **PERFECT ALIGNMENT**: CV = LB exactly (deterministic optimization problem)
- No distribution shift - the gap is purely due to being at a local optimum
- All 9 submissions confirm CV-LB match to 6 decimal places

## Response to Evaluator
The evaluator correctly identifies that:
1. **All approaches converge to ~70.627** - This is a STRUCTURAL BARRIER
2. **Diminishing returns** - 23 experiments with improvement rate declining to ~0.0001/experiment
3. **Target may require unpublished techniques** - The winning approach is not in public kernels

I AGREE with the evaluator's assessment that we need a FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT approach.
The evaluator recommends:
1. Identify worst-performing N values → DONE (N=1-10 are worst, but likely optimal)
2. Study symmetric solutions discussion → BLOCKED (discussions not accessible)
3. MIP formulation for small N → Worth trying
4. Manual inspection → Worth trying

## Key Insights from 23 Experiments

### What We Know:
1. **Small N (1-10) have WORST scores** but are likely already optimal:
   - N=1: 45° angle is provably optimal (minimizes bounding box)
   - N=2-10: Baseline appears optimal based on exhaustive search
   
2. **Large N (100-200) have BEST scores** due to tessellation:
   - Dominant angles: ~68° and ~248° (180° apart)
   - This is a known-good tessellation pattern

3. **Invalid snapshots achieve better scores ONLY by allowing overlaps**:
   - 59 N values have better scores in invalid snapshot
   - ALL improvements require overlapping trees
   - ZERO valid improvements extractable

4. **All optimization methods converge to same optimum**:
   - SA, GA, gradient-based, exhaustive search → all ~70.627
   - This is a STRONG LOCAL OPTIMUM

### What We DON'T Know:
1. **Are there better tessellation patterns for medium N (20-80)?**
   - Current solution uses ~68°/248° angles for large N
   - Different angle pairs might work better for medium N

2. **Can asymmetric layouts beat symmetric for specific N values?**
   - Research shows asymmetric can improve by several percent
   - But we haven't systematically tested this

3. **What do top teams actually do to reach sub-69 scores?**
   - Web research says "heavy individual refinement" and "hand-crafted tweaks"
   - Specific techniques are not publicly documented

## Recommended Approaches (Priority Order)

### 1. **[HIGH PRIORITY] Test Different Tessellation Angles for Medium N**
The current solution uses ~68°/248° angles for large N. Try:
- Different angle pairs: 60°/240°, 70°/250°, 75°/255°
- Test on N=50, N=72, N=100 first
- If any angle pair beats baseline, apply to all medium/large N

```python
# Test different tessellation angles
for angle_pair in [(60, 240), (65, 245), (70, 250), (75, 255)]:
    for n in [50, 72, 100]:
        score = test_tessellation(n, angle_pair)
        if score < baseline_score[n]:
            print(f"IMPROVEMENT: N={n}, angles={angle_pair}")
```

### 2. **[HIGH PRIORITY] Implement Asymmetric Local Search**
Instead of forcing all trees to use the same angle pattern:
- Start from baseline
- For each tree, try small perturbations (±5° rotation, ±0.01 translation)
- Accept if it reduces bounding box WITHOUT creating overlaps
- This is "asymmetric" because each tree can have different adjustments

```python
def asymmetric_local_search(n, max_iter=1000):
    positions = get_baseline_positions(n)
    for _ in range(max_iter):
        i = random.randint(0, n-1)  # Pick random tree
        # Try small perturbation
        new_pos = perturb(positions[i])
        if no_overlap(positions, i, new_pos) and improves_score(positions, i, new_pos):
            positions[i] = new_pos
    return positions
```

### 3. **[MEDIUM PRIORITY] MIP/CP for Small N Optimality Proof**
Use OR-Tools to prove whether current small N solutions are optimal:
- If optimal → focus effort elsewhere
- If not optimal → find the optimal solution

### 4. **[EXPERIMENTAL] Constructive Heuristic from Scratch**
Instead of optimizing from baseline, try building solutions from scratch:
- Greedy placement: Add trees one at a time, minimizing bounding box
- Beam search: Keep top-k partial solutions
- This might find a different basin than the current optimum

## What NOT to Try (Exhausted Approaches)
- ❌ bbox3/SA with more iterations (converges to same optimum)
- ❌ Different SA parameters (same result)
- ❌ Ensemble from public sources (all at same optimum)
- ❌ Repairing invalid snapshots (all improvements require overlaps)
- ❌ Exhaustive search for small N (baseline is optimal)

## Validation Notes
- CV = LB exactly (deterministic problem)
- Use Shapely for overlap detection (matches Kaggle validation)
- Score = Σ(S²/N) for N=1 to 200

## SUBMISSION STRATEGY
- **SUBMIT EVERY EXPERIMENT** - We have 91 submissions remaining
- LB feedback is free and confirms our CV calculations
- Even if score doesn't improve, we learn what doesn't work

## Success Criteria
To beat target (68.919154), we need:
- ~2.4% improvement across ALL N values, OR
- ~5% improvement on worst-performing N values (1-50)

The target IS achievable. The winning technique exists - we just haven't found it yet.
Focus on ASYMMETRIC approaches and DIFFERENT TESSELLATION PATTERNS.
