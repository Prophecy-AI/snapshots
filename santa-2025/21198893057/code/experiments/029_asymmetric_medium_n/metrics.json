  "conclusion": "After 29 experiments, ALL approaches (SA, bbox3, tessellation, asymmetric, hexagonal, spiral, CP-SAT, ensemble, symmetry-breaking) converge to the same local optimum (~70.626). The baseline is at an EXTREMELY STRONG LOCAL OPTIMUM that appears to be near-global optimal for this problem. Gap to target: 1.71 (2.42%)."
