    "key_insight": "Large N uses sophisticated tessellation with ~68°/248° angles. Small N are already optimal. Medium N (21-50) has diverse angles - not simple tessellation."
  },
  "conclusion": "The baseline uses a sophisticated asymmetric configuration that is already near-optimal. Small N (1-10) are provably optimal. Large N (100+) use efficient tessellation. The gap to target (1.708) cannot be closed by optimizing within this structure."
