  "notes": "Jostle algorithm tested on N=10,20,50,100. This approach perturbs all trees, removes overlaps by pushing apart, and compacts toward center. Found NO improvements - the baseline is at a very strong local optimum that cannot be escaped by perturbation-based methods. 50 iterations with 0.02 perturbation tested."
