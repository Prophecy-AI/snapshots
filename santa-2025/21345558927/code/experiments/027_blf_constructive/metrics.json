  "notes": "Bottom-Left-Fill constructive heuristic tested on N=5,10,15,20. Tried 4 angle strategies (all_45, all_0, alternating, alternating_45). All BLF solutions were 50-100% WORSE than baseline. Example: N=20 baseline=0.372, best BLF=0.613 (65% worse). The baseline configurations are highly optimized irregular packings that cannot be replicated by simple constructive heuristics."
