    "### 1. Top Kernels Use bbox3 C++ Optimizer\n",
    "The \"Why Not\" kernel (376 votes) uses bbox3.cpp with:\n",
    "- Complex number vector coordination\n",
    "- Fluid dynamics simulation\n",
    "- Hinge pivot mechanics\n",
    "- Density gradient flow\n",
    "- Global boundary tension\n",
    "- Multi-restart with random parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Manual Tree Shifter Shows Key Insight\n",
    "The manual tree shifter kernel shows that:\n",
    "- Interactive placement can find improvements\n",
    "- Simulated annealing with bbox3 is the standard approach\n",
    "- The key is running bbox3 with MANY iterations and restarts\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Our Problem\n",
    "We've been trying to ENSEMBLE existing solutions, but:\n",
    "- All available improvements are < 0.001 (too small, risky)\n",
    "- External data is NOT significantly better than our snapshots\n",
    "- The ensemble approach has hit a ceiling at 70.365\n",

    "**We need to GENERATE better solutions, not just filter existing ones.**\n",

    "The top kernels achieve sub-69 scores by:\n",
    "1. Running bbox3 with 50-100 restarts per N\n",
    "2. Using 10,000-20,000 iterations per restart\n",
    "3. Keeping the best solution across all restarts\n",
