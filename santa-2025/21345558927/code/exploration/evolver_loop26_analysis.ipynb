    "- Best CV: 70.316492 (exp_022)\n",
    "- Best LB: 70.3165 (exp_022)\n",
    "- Target: 68.876781\n",

    "## Key Findings from Research\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Top Kernel Analysis (jonathanchan)\n",
    "The top kernel uses:\n",
    "- **15+ external data sources** including Telegram shared solutions\n",
    "- **C++ SA with fractional translation** (step sizes 0.001 to 0.00001)\n",
    "- **80 restarts per N** with 20,000 SA iterations\n",
    "- **Multiple generations** of optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Experiment History Analysis\n",
    "- 26 experiments run, last 7+ found ZERO improvement\n",
    "- All optimization approaches (SA, B&B, lattice, interlock) hit ceiling\n",
    "- The baseline is at an extremely strong local optimum\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Critical Gap Analysis\n",
    "The gap of 1.44 points likely requires:\n",
    "1. **Extended C++ optimization** (days, not hours)\n",
    "2. **Access to better external data sources** (Telegram, private solutions)\n",
    "3. **900+ submissions** to iterate (top team has 953 submissions)\n",
    "4. **Fundamentally different algorithms** we haven't discovered"

    "### Option A: Extended C++ Optimization (RECOMMENDED)\n",
    "- Run bbox3/sa_fast overnight (8+ hours)\n",
    "- Focus on N=2-50 (highest individual scores)\n",
    "- Use all CPU cores with OpenMP\n",
    "- **Expected gain**: 0.1-0.5 points (if lucky)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option B: External Data Mining\n",
    "- Search Kaggle discussions for shared solutions\n",
    "- Look for Telegram/Discord shared CSVs\n",
    "- **Expected gain**: Unknown, depends on what's available\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option C: Novel Algorithm Implementation\n",
    "- Implement constraint programming solver\n",
    "- Try reinforcement learning approach\n",
    "- **Expected gain**: Unknown, high risk\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option D: Accept Current Score\n",
    "- Current score (70.316492) is at public kernel ceiling\n",
    "- Further improvement requires resources we don't have\n",
    "- **Expected gain**: 0\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recommendation\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the constraints:\n",
    "1. We've exhausted local optimization approaches\n",
    "2. We don't have access to Telegram/private solutions\n",
    "3. Extended C++ runs haven't helped\n",
    "\n",
    "**The most promising path is to try a fundamentally different algorithm that hasn't been explored:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Constraint Programming (CP)**: Model the problem as constraints, let CP solver find feasible regions\n",
    "2. **Reinforcement Learning**: Train an agent to place trees sequentially\n",
    "3. **Asymmetric Solutions**: The discussion mentions winning solutions are asymmetric - explore this\n",
    "\n",
    "However, these require significant implementation effort and may not yield results."
