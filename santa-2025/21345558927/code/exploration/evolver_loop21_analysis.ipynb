    "## Situation\n",
    "- exp_020 submission FAILED due to overlapping trees in N=2 (tiny overlap 7e-13)\n",
    "- Fixed by replacing N=2 and N=105 with valid baseline configurations\n",
    "- Score unchanged at 70.316579\n",
    "- Gap to target: 1.44 points (2.09%)\n",

    "## Key Insights\n",
    "1. Precision is CRITICAL - tiny overlaps (1e-13) fail Kaggle validation\n",
    "2. The valid baseline (21337107511) has higher precision and passes Kaggle\n",
    "3. Current ensemble approach is at ceiling - all available data sources exhausted"
