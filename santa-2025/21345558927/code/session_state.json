      "finding": "Santa 2025 is a 2D polygon packing problem: pack Christmas tree shapes (15-vertex polygons) into smallest square bounding box. Score = \u03a3(s\u00b2/n) for n=1-200. Target: 68.882921, current best: ~70.647. Key approaches: (1) Tessellation/lattice for large N - start with 2 base trees, translate in grid pattern, (2) Exhaustive search for small N (1-15), (3) Backward propagation - remove trees from larger N to improve smaller N, (4) Simulated annealing with fractional translation fine-tuning.",

The target of 68.88 requires fundamentally different approaches: (1) Implement tessellation algorithm from scratch in Python, (2) Focus on small N values which contribute most to score (N=1 contributes 0.66 alone), (3) Use Numba for acceleration. Binaries are at local optima and cannot escape.",
