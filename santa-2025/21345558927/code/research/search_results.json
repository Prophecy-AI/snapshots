We present a history of this problem, and give the best known upper and lower bounds for s(n) for n&le;100, including the best known packings. We also give relatively simple proofs for the values of s(n) when n = 2,\r3, 5, 8, 15, 24, and 35, and more complicated proofs for n=7 and 14. We also prove many\rother lower bounds for various s(n).\nTable of Contents\n[1. Introduction](#introduction)\n[2. Previous Results](#previousresults)\n[3. New Packings](#newpackings)\n[4.

Lower Bounds](#lowerbounds)\n[Appendix](#appendix)\n[References](#references)\n1 Introduction\nThe problem of packing equal circles in a square has been around for some 40 years and has seen\rmuch recent progress[[2]](#references). The problem\rof packing equal squares in a square is only recently becoming well known. Results were less plentiful, as\rthe computer-aided methods available for circles did not generalize for squares, until recently when an\neffective algorithm was found[[20]](#references). We give a few packings which improve upon those in the literature, illustrate a technique for\robtaining lower bounds, and exhibit the best known packings for less than one hundred squares.\nLet s(n) be the side of the smallest square into which we can pack n unit squares. It is\rclear that &radic;n &le; s(n) &le;![](pic/lceil.gif)&radic;n![](pic/rceil.gif), the first\rinequality coming from area considerations, and the second coming from the facts that s(n) is\rnon-decreasing and s(n2)=n. It is not hard to show that s(2)=s(3)=2. It is a little\rharder to show that s(5)=2+1/&radic;2[[7]](#references).\nThe number of claims far outweighs the number of published results in this area. G&ouml;bel says\rthat Schrijver claims that Bajm&#243;oczy proved s(7)=s(8)=3[[7]](#references). Walter Stromquist claimed to have proved s(6)=3 and\rs(10)=3+1/&radic;2, and claimed to know how to prove s(14)=s(15)=4 and s(24)=5[[13]](#references). Trevor Green sent me a proof for s(6)=3. None of these proofs were published. Said El Moumni evidently proved s(7)=s(8)=3 and s(15)=4[[12]](#references)but no one was aware of this until recently. Finally, in 2002, Kearney and Shiu published a proof of s(6)=3[[9]](#references).\nIn 2003, Stromquist proved s(10)=3+1/&radic;2[[18]](#references).\nIn 2005, Nagamochi proved that s(n2-2)=s(n2-1)=n[[19]](#references). Also in 2005, Thierry Gensane and Philippe Ryckelynck published an inflation algorithm for finding good packings and found the first computer packing that might be optimal.[[20]](#references). There are many other good packings thought to be optimal, but as of yet no proofs.\rHere we prove the values of s(n) for square n and n=2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 14, 15, 24, and 35.\nPrevious results can be found in[Section 2](#previousresults). Reccent packings appear in[Section 3](#newpackings). In[Section 4](#technicallemmas)we prove some technical lemmas that we use in[Section 5](#lowerbounds)to prove the values of s(n) mentioned above. Lists of the best\rknown upper and lower bounds for s(n) are given in the[Appendix](#appendix). Many of the results given are\rtaken from unpublished letters and manuscripts, and private communications.\n2 Previous Results\nG&ouml;bel was the first to publish on the subject[[7]](#references). He found that a2+a+3+![](pic/lfloor.gif)(a-1)&radic;2![](pic/rfloor.gif)squares can be packed in a square of side\ra+1+1/&radic;2 by placing a diagonal strip of squares at a 45oangle. This gives the best known packings for all values of a except for a=3 and a=6 (see Figure 1).\n![](pic/s5.gif)\ns(5)=2+1/&radic;2||![](pic/s10.gif)\ns(10)=3+1/&radic;2|\n![](pic/s27.gif)\ns(27)&le;5+1/&radic;2||![](pic/s38.gif)\ns(38)&le;6+1/&radic;2|\n![](pic/s52.gif)\ns(52)&le;7+1/&radic;2||![](pic/s67.gif)\ns(67)&le;8+1/&radic;2|\n![](pic/s84.gif)\ns(84)&le;9+1/&radic;2|\nFigure 1.|\nBy unrotating some rotated squares in the corner, we get some alternate packings for n=10, 67,\rand 84. (see Figure 2). David Cantell noticed in 2005 that alternative packings exist for n=27, 38, 52, and 84 using a minimum number of rotated squares (see Figure 2)[[17]](#references).\n![](pic/s10b.gif)\ns(10)=3+1/&radic;2||![](pic/s67b.gif)\ns(67)&le;8+1/&radic;2|\n![](pic/s84b.gif)\ns(84)&le;9+1/&radic;2||![](pic/s84c.gif)\ns(84)&le;9+1/&radic;2|\n![](pic/s27b.gif)\ns(27)&le;5+1/&radic;2||![](pic/s38b.gif)\ns(38)&le;6+1/&radic;2|\n![](pic/s52b.gif)\ns(52)&le;7+1/&radic;2||![](pic/s84d.gif)\ns(84)&le;9+1/&radic;2|\nFigure 2.|\nIt is clear that n+2![](pic/lfloor.gif)s(n)![](pic/rfloor.gif)+1 squares can be packed in a square of side s(n)+1 by packing n squares inside\ra square of side s(n) and putting the other squares in an \"L\" around it. The first four packings in\rFigure 2 are of this form. Packings not containing an \"L\" of squares we will call*primitive*packings. From now on, we will only illustrate primitive packings.\nG&ouml;bel also found that if integers a and\rb satisfied a-1&lt;b/&radic;2&lt;a+1, then 2a2+2a+b2squares\rcan be packed inside a square of side a+1+b/&radic;2. This is accomplished by\rplacing a b &times; b square of squares at a 45oangle in the center. This gives the best\rknown packings for 28, 40, 65, and 89 squares (see Figure 3). Adding an \"L\" around the packing of 65\nsquares gives the best known packing of 82 squares. The packing for n=40 is rigid.\n![](pic/s28.gif)\ns(28)&le;3+2&radic;2||![](pic/s40.gif)\ns(40)&le;4+2&radic;2|\n![](pic/s65.gif)\ns(65)&le;5+5/&radic;2||![](pic/s89.gif)\ns(89)&le;5+7/&radic;2|\nFigure 3.|\nCharles Cottingham, who improved some of G&ouml;bel's packings for n&le;49, was\rthe first to use diagonal strips of width 2[[6]](#references). Soon after he produced a packing of 19 squares with a diagonal strip of width 2, Robert\rWainwright improved Cottingham's packing slightly (see Figure 4)[[4]](#references). In 2002, David Cantrell found some alternative packings for 19 squares[[14]](#references).\n![](pic/s19.gif)\ns(19)&le;3+4&radic;2/3\nFigure 4.|\nIn 1980, Evert Stenlund improved many of Cottingham's packings, and provided packings for n&le;100[[6]](#references). His packing of 66\rsquares uses a diagonal strip of width 3 (see Figure 5). In this packing, the diagonal squares\rtouch only the squares in the upper right and lower left corners. Adding an \"L\" to this packing\rgives the best known packing of 83 squares.\n![](pic/s66.gif)\ns(66)&le;3+4&radic;2\nFigure 5.|\nThe best known packings for many values of n are more complicated. Many seem to require\rpacking with squares at angles other than 0oand 45o. In 1979, Walter\rTrump improved G&ouml;bel's packing of 11 squares (see Figure 6). Many people have\rindependently discovered this packing. The original discovery has been incorrectly attributed\rto Gustafson and Thule[[11]](#references). The middle\rsquares are tilted about 40.182o, and there is a small gap between these squares. This packing is also rigid.\n![](pic/s11.gif)\ns(11)&lt;3.8771\nFigure 6.|\nIn 1980, H&auml;m&auml;l&auml;inen improved on G&ouml;bel's packing of 18 squares\r(see Figure 7)[[6]](#references). In 1981, Mats\rGustafson found an alternative optimal packing of 18 squares (see Figure 7). The middle squares\rin these packings are tilted by an angle of arcsin((&radic;7-1)/4)&asymp;24.295o. In 2002, David Cantrell\nfound another alternative packing (see Figure 7)[[14]](#references)that is useful in building the best known packing for n=68 (see[Figure 11](#figure11)). In 2004, the computer program of Gensane and Ryckelynck found yet another alternative packing (see Figure 7)[[20]](#references).\n![](pic/s18.gif)\ns(18)&le;(7+&radic;7)/2||![](pic/s18b.gif)\ns(18)&le;(7+&radic;7)/2|\n![](pic/s18c.gif)\ns(18)&le;(7+&radic;7)/2||![](pic/s18d.gif...",

This result was improved in [4,7,8]. Other problems related to this subject\nwere outlined in the sixties of the last century by L. Moser [9]. He asked, for example, \u201cCan\nevery set of rectangles of total area 1 and maximal side 1 be accommodated in a square of\narea 2?\u201d (the answer is positive [5]) or \u201cWhat is the smallest number A such that any set of\nsquares of total area 1 can be packed into some rectangle of area A?\u201d (some bounds are given\nin [3,10,11]). The question of packing of equal squares into a square as small as possible\nwas posed in [2].\nLet Ix be a square of side length x. We say that a collection R1, R2,... of rectangles can\nbe packed into Ix , if it is possible to apply translations and rotations to the sets Ri so that\nthe resulting translated and rotated rectangles are contained in Ix and have mutually disjoint\ninteriors. Denote by s(x) the greatest number such that any collection of rectangles of sides\nof length not greater than 1 with total area smaller than s(x) can be packed into Ix .\nJ.

Denote by wi the width and by hi the height of Ri . Furthermore, assume that wi \u2264 hi\nfor any i = 1,...,z and that h1 \u2265 h2 \u2265\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u2265 hz.\nLet S be a rectangle of width a \u2265 1 and height d \u2265 1. Denote by p a vertex of S.\nMoreover, let S1,..., Sr be a collection of rectangles Si of width vi < a and height\nsmaller than d such that p \u2208 Si and Si \u2282 S for i = 1,...,r. Then S \\\n\u0004r\ni=1 Si is called\na \u03c3 \u2212 polygon of base a, top a \u2212 max(v1,...,vr) and height d (see Fig. 1). The rectangle\nS is also called a \u03c3-polygon.\nLemma 2.1 Let a \u2265 1, d \u2265 1 and assume that the total area of rectangles in R is not\nsmaller than (a + 1)(d + 1).

The area of the uncovered part in each Li does not\nexceed bi(h ji\u22121 \u2212 h ji\u22121).

Assume that the total area\nof rectangles in R is not smaller than n(a + 1)(d + 1).

This paper investigates the two-dimensional packing of convex polygons without\nrotations, where only translations are allowed. We study different settings depending on the type of\ncontainers used, including minimizing the number of containers or the size of the container based on\nan objective function.\nBuilding on prior research in the field, we develop polynomial-time algorithms with improved\napproximation guarantees upon the best-known results by Alt, de Berg and Knauer, as well as\nAamand, Abrahamsen, Beretta and Kleist, for problems such as Polygon Area Minimization, Polygon\nPerimeter Minimization, Polygon Strip Packing, and Polygon Bin Packing. Our approach utilizes a\nsequence of object transformations that allows sorting by height and orientation, thus enhancing\nthe effectiveness of shelf packing algorithms for polygon packing problems. In addition, we present\nefficient approximation algorithms for special cases of the Polygon Bin Packing problem, progressing\ntoward solving an open question concerning an O(1)-approximation algorithm for arbitrary polygons.\n2012 ACM Subject Classification Theory of computation \u2192 Packing and covering problems\nKeywords and phrases Approximation algorithms, Packing problems, Convex polygons, Bin packing,\nStrip packing, Area minimization\nRelated Version This is the full version of the same-named ESA 2023 paper.

One particular category of these packing problems is\ntwo-dimensional packing, which is encountered in everyday scenarios like arranging items\non a shelf and in industrial applications such as cutting cookies from rolled-out dough\nor manufacturing sets of tiles from standard-sized panels made of wood, glass, or metal.\nAnother intriguing example involves cutting fabric pieces for clothing production. In this\ncase, the pieces often cannot be rotated freely, as they must adhere to a desired pattern\nin the final product, which is tailored of multiple elements. The widespread applicability\nof two-dimensional packing problems has led to a surge of interest in designing efficient\nalgorithms to address them. In this paper, we follow the line of research and study the\nproblem of packing convex polygons without rotations in various settings depending on the\ntype of containers used.\nPast research focusing on theoretical considerations of two-dimensional packings mainly\nconcentrates on the scenario when all objects are axis-parallel rectangles. In this paper, we\nwill discuss packing without rotations, in which only translations are permitted. There are\ntwo main classes of the problem depending on whether the size of the container is fixed and\nwe want to minimize the number of containers used or whether we want to minimize the\ncontainer\u2019s size with respect to some objective function.\nA seminal example of the first class is the Geometric Bin Packing problem in which\na number of unit size squared bins to pack is to be minimized. The problem is arguably\nthe most natural generalization of the regular (1D) Bin Packing to two dimensions, and\nits absolute approximability has been fully understood. Unless P = N P, the best possible\nefficient constant factor approximation is 2 [15], and such an algorithm is known [10].\nIn the second class, there are several variants to be considered. An example is the\nStrip Packing Problem which is concerned with packing objects into a strip of width\n1 and infinite height in such a way that the maximum of all the heights of the placed\nobjects is minimized. Like Geometric Bin Packing, Strip Packing generalizes (1D)\nBin Packing. The best known efficient constant factor approximation for Strip Packing\nhas approximation factor (5/3 + \u03f5) [9]. It is known that there can not exist a polynomial\ntime algorithm with an approximation ratio of (3/2 \u2212 \u03f5) for any \u03f5 > 0 unless P = N P, which\nfollows directly from the approximation hardness of (1D) Bin Packing. Both classes of\nproblems have been also considered in the asymptotic setting, see e.g. [11, 5, 12].\nIn younger time, there was also an increase of interest in cases where the objects in\nquestion are general convex polygons. Alt, de Berg and Knauer [2, 3] considered the problem\nof packing an instance consisting of a number of convex polygons of the form p \u2282 [0, 1]2into\na minimum area axis-parallel rectangular container. We refer to this problem as Polygon\nArea Minimization throughout this paper. In the special case where the instance consists\nof rectangles only, the problem is known to admit a PTAS [4]. They proved the existence of\nthe following efficient algorithm:\nA 23.78-approximation for Polygon Area Minimization.\nRecently, Aamand, Abrahamsen, Beretta and Kleist [1] showed that the algorithm of Alt,\nde Berg and Knauer can be leveraged to obtain also efficient approximation algorithms of\nfurther problems:\nA 7-approximation for Polygon Perimeter Minimization.\nA 51-approximation for Polygon Strip Packing.\nAn 11-approximation for Polygon Bin Packing for polygons with diameter at most 1\n10 .\nA. Kurpisz and S. Suter 3\n1.1 Our results\nThe results of Alt, de Berg and Knauer [2, 3] and Aamand et al. [1] are heavily based on\nso-called shelf packing algorithms. In shelf packing algorithms, the objects are first placed\non the shelves, possibly ordered by height, which are later stacked on one another to build\na final solution. Compared to axis-parallel rectangles, the main challenge in designing an\napproximation algorithm for polygon packing problems is that objects cannot be sorted by\nheight and orientation simultaneously. As a result, the algorithm and its analysis in [2, 3]\nhave such a large approximation guarantee. In this paper, we provide new insight into how\nshelf packing algorithms should be applied to polygon packing problems. We introduce a\nsequence of transformations of the objects that allow us first to sort them by height and later\nby orientation to build a solution of a much better approximation guarantee. More precisely,\nwe design polynomial-time algorithms with the following factors:\nA 9.45-approximation for Polygon Area Minimization.\nUsing this algorithm as a subroutine, we build upon the methods from Aamand et al. [1] to\nobtain the following efficient approximation algorithms:\nA (3.75 + \u03f5)-approximation for Polygon Perimeter Minimization.\nA 21.89-approximation for Polygon Strip Packing.\nA 5.09-approximation for Polygon Bin Packing for polygons which have their diameter\nbounded by 1\n10 .\nThe results are proved in Sections 4, 5, 6, and 7 respectively. Furthermore, in Section 8\nwe show the following results, which make progress towards solving an open question of a\nO(1)-approximation algorithm for Polygon Bin Packing for arbitrary polygons.\nThere is an efficient O(\n1\n\u03b4\n)-approximation algorithm for Polygon Bin Packing for\ninstances where each polygon has width or height at most 1 \u2212 \u03b4.\nThere is an efficient O(1)-approximation algorithm for Polygon Bin Packing for\ninstances with the property that all polygons share a spine (up to translation) with height\nat least 3\n4\n.\n2 Preliminaries\nWe start out considerations by recalling a classical and well-known problem in theoretical\ncomputer science, the Bin Packing problem: Given a list of numbers s1, . . . , sn \u2208 (0, 1] \u2229 Q,\nrepresenting the sizes of n objects, the goal is to find the minimum number of bins of size 1,\nso that we can pac...",

Introduction\n\nIn 1966 Moser [\\[15\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925772111000319#br0150), [\\[16\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925772111000319#br0160) posed the following problem:\n\n> What is the smallest number _A_ such that every set of squares of total area 1 can be accommodated in some rectangle of area _A_?\n\nHere, \u201caccommodated\u201d means that the rectangle and squares must be axis-parallel and no two squares [intersect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/mathematics/intersects) in their interiors.

A packing of 12 squares into a rectangle.\n\nMoon and Moser [\\[14\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925772111000319#br0140) proved that 1.2\u2a7dA\u2a7d2. Kleitman and Krieger [\\[7\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925772111000319#br0070) improved this, showing that A\u2a7d3<1.733 and then later that A\u2a7d4/6<1.633 [\\[8\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925772111000319#br0080). The previously best bounds are due to Novotn\u00fd, who showed that A\u2a7e(2+3)/3>1.244 [\\[17\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925772111000319#br0170) \u2014 which is easily seen by considering a square with area 1/2 and three squares each with area 1/6 \u2014 and later that A<1.53 [\\[18\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925772111000319#br0180). In this paper we improve on these results by showing that A\u2a7d2867/2048=1.39990\u2026\u2009.\n\n**Theorem 1**\n\n_Any set of squares with total area_ 1 _can be packed into a rectangle of area_ 2867/2048 _._\n\n[Table 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925772111000319#tl0010) summarizes the progress on upper bounds for Moser\u02bcs problem.

Outline of our proof\n\nIn this paper we consider the _rectangle_ [packing problem](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/mathematics/packing-problem). The input is a rectangle _R_ with width _W_ and height _H_, and a list of _n_ rectangles r1,r2,\u2026,ri each with a given width wi and height hi. The question is whether the _n_ rectangles can be packed into _R_ so that no two rectangles [intersect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/mathematics/intersects) in their interiors. We do not allow rotations of the rectangles, i.e., all edges corresponding to the widths of the rectangles have to be parallel.\n\nOur main idea is to reduce the proof of [Theorem 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925772111000319#en0010) to a [finite number](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/mathematics/finite-number) of rectangle packing problems.
