      "title": "ANSWER",
      "text": "The interlock pattern or unit cell approach for Christmas tree polygon packing optimization involves designing patterns that allow individual units, such as Christmas trees, to interlock efficiently within a given space. This approach is often used to maximize packing density while ensuring that the units fit together securely without overlapping or interlocking in a way that prevents easy assembly or disassembly. For example, one design uses an interlocking pattern that involves multiple sheets or components fitting into each other, such as the octagonal curved tree that uses eight sheets to interlock into a stable structure ([modprint](https://www.modprint.com/33-christmas-tree-designs-you-should-know)).\n\nThis pattern approach can be viewed as a form of polygon packing where the goal is to optimize the arrangement of complex shapes\u2014like Christmas trees\u2014by employing a unit cell or pattern that facilitates interlocking. Such patterns often leverage geometric properties, symmetry, and tessellation principles to create stable, interlocking configurations. In the context of optimization, these patterns help reduce wasted space and improve packing efficiency, which is crucial in applications like manufacturing, storage, or festive decorations ([Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/santa-2025/discussion/637382)). While specific technical details about the mathematical or algorithmic implementation of the interlock pattern are not explicitly provided in the search results, the concept generally involves designing shape-specific unit cells that enable dense, interlocking arrangements, often using geometric and combinatorial optimization techniques.",

      "text": "[iframe](about:blank)\n\nTable of Contents\n\nExpand\n\nTable of Contents\n\n- [The Christmas Tree Options Strategy](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/christmastree.asp#toc-what-is-a-christmas-tree-options-strategy)\n\n- [How Christmas Trees Work](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/christmastree.asp#toc-how-christmas-trees-work)\n\n- [Examples](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/christmastree.asp#toc-examples)\n\n\nClose\n\n## What Is a Christmas Tree Options Strategy?\n\nA Christmas tree is an [options trading](https://www.investopedia.com/options-basics-tutorial-4583012) spread strategy achieved by buying and selling six call (or six put) options with different strikes but the same expiration dates for a neutral to bullish forecast. When using calls, the strategy is termed a long call Christmas tree. It is a put Christmas tree when the trader uses put options.\n\nThe strategy is available long (bullish) or short (bearish).\n\nThis spread is essentially the combination of a long vertical spread and two short vertical spreads.\n\n### Key Takeaways\n\n- A Christmas tree is an options spread strategy that involves 6 call (or put) options: buying one ATM call (put) selling 3x calls (puts) two strikes out of the money and then buy 2x more call (put) three strikes out of the money.\n- This strategy pays off with a neutral to slightly bullish outcome in the underlying security.\n- Christmas trees can be constructed with either all calls or all puts and may be structured as either long or short.\n\n## How Christmas Trees Work\n\nThe Christmas tree name comes from the strategy's very loose resemblance to a tree when viewed on an options chain display. The connection is tenuous at best.\n\nChristmas trees are similar to [butterfly spreads](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/butterflyspread.asp) in that they use multiple [vertical spreads](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/verticalspread.asp) to box in a desired potential return. The difference is that one of the strike prices is skipped, which introduces a directional bias.\n\nFor instance, if a condor spread involved the 50-55-60-65 strikes, the corresponding Christmas tree would involve just the 50-55-65 strikes (skipping the 60 strike).\n\nThe regular, or long Christmas tree with calls (sometimes referred to simply as a \"call tree\"), involves buying one call option with an [at-the-money](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/atthemoney.asp) strike, skipping the next strike, and then selling three options with the following strike. Finally, buy two more calls with the next higher strike. The 1-3-2 structure supposedly appears as a tree.\n\nThe strategy profits from a small increase in the price of the underlying asset and maxes when the underlying closes at the middle option strike price at options expiration.\n\n- Maximum profit equals middle [strike](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/strikeprice.asp) minus lower strike minus the premium.\n- Maximum loss is the net debit paid for the strategy.\n- Breakeven occurs at the lowest strike plus the premium paid or the highest strike minus half the premium.\n\nTime decay is on the holder's side as the holder wants all options except the lowest to expire worthless.\n\n## Examples\n\n### Long Christmas Tree With Calls\n\nFor example, with the underlying asset at $50.00:\n\n- Buy 1 call strike price 50.00\n- Sell 3 calls strike price 54.00\n- Buy 2 calls strike price 56.00\n\n### Long Christmas Tree With Puts\n\nWith this strategy, the holder is neutral to bearish. Sometimes referred to simply as a \"put tree.\"\n\n- Buy 1 put strike price 50.00\n- Sell 3 puts strike price 46.00\n- Buy 2 puts strike price 44.00\n\nMaximum profit is at an underlying asset price of 48.00 at expiration.\n\n- Maximum profit equals middle strike minus higher strike minus the premium.\n- Maximum loss is the net debit paid for the strategy.\n- Breakeven occurs at the lower strike plus half the premium paid or the highest strike minus the premium.\n\nMaximum loss is the premium paid to initiate the strategy.\n\n### Short Christmas Tree With Calls\n\nShort strategies should result in a net credit to the account when initiated. This strategy profits when the underlying asset moves by a minimum direction in either direction but it is capped. The bias is bearish because it does not take much of a move lower in the underlying asset to make the strategy profitable. However, a larger move higher may also result in a profit.\n\n- Sell 1 call strike price 50.00\n- Buy 3 calls strike price 54.00\n- Sell 2 calls strike price 56.00\n\nThe maximum profit is the net credit received.\n\n### Short Christmas Tree With Puts\n\nThis strategy results in a net credit to the account and profits when the underlying moves by a minimum in either direction. Profits come quicker with a smaller upside move although a larger downside move would also be profitable. Therefore, this strategy leans bullish.\n\n- Sell 1 put strike price 50.00\n- Buy 3 puts strike price 46.00\n- Sell 2 puts strike price 44.00\n\nThe maximum profit is the net credit received.\n\nTake the Next Step to Invest\n\nAdvertiser Disclosure\n\n\u00d7\n\nThe offers that appear in this table are from partnerships from which Investopedia receives compensation.

      "text": "Christmas wrapping paper is sold in thousands of different variations, including plain, coloured, patterned, foiled and even flock, but one thing it\u2019ll have in common is that it will repeat whatever pattern it has, regularly across the design.\n\nI\u2019m interested in symmetry, and was intrigued to find a curious fact about the symmetries of such repeating patterns \u2013 their symmetries are quite limited.\n\nIf a shape is finite, like a square, it\u2019ll have a group of symmetries including rotations and reflections; if it\u2019s a hexagon, it might have rotations by multiples of 60 degrees alongside the usual ones, plus some reflections in different axes. Some shapes, like the circle, can be reflected at any angle you like, and still get the same shape back.\n\nWhen a pattern repeats forever, we can still apply symmetries to it \u2013 if the whole pattern has a line of reflection symmetry, we can reflect it; it might also have rotations around certain points, and due to the repeating pattern there\u2019s a new type too, called a glide reflection, which includes a reflection combined with a shift along, so the whole design lines up with the next copy along.\n\nBut if you study these symmetries, and work out all the possible ones, it turns out we\u2019re limited to rotations by multiples of 60 and 90 degrees, reflections in axes at the same angles, and glide reflections in those axes. While there\u2019s a little freedom (in whether the axes of different reflections are parallel, and how far apart they are), it\u2019s actually quite a restricted set, and in fact results in only 17 different possible symmetry groups.\n\nHere\u2019s an example of each symmetry group, with an idea of what the symmetries are in each case. Any repeated pattern you find should boil down to one of these options:\n\n[![](https://aperiodical.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/p1-200x200.png)](https://aperiodical.com/p1/)p1: Only translations (no rotations or reflections)[![](https://aperiodical.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/p2-200x200.png)](https://aperiodical.com/p2/)p2: Four distinct rotations by 180 \u030a but no reflections[![](https://aperiodical.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/cmm-200x200.png)](https://aperiodical.com/cmm/)c2mm: reflections and three rotations by 180 \u030a, but one of the rotations is not centered on a reflection axis\n\n[![](https://aperiodical.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/cm-200x200.png)](https://aperiodical.com/cm/)cm: Parallel reflections and glide reflections[![](https://aperiodical.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/p4m.png)](https://aperiodical.com/p4m/)p4mm: horizontal, vertical and diagonal reflections, along with two rotations by 90 \u030a and one by 180 \u030a.[![](https://aperiodical.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/p4g.png)](https://aperiodical.com/p4g/)p4mg: A rotation of 90 \u030a without a reflection, and a rotation of 180 \u030a with a reflection through it.\n\n[![](https://aperiodical.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/p4.png)](https://aperiodical.com/p4/)p4: Two rotation centres by 90 \u030a, and one by 180 \u030a[![](https://aperiodical.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/pg-200x200.png)](https://aperiodical.com/pg/)pg: Two distinct glide reflections with parallel axes.[![](https://aperiodical.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/pmm-200x200.png)](https://aperiodical.com/pmm/)p2mm: Two perpendicular reflections and four distinct families of rotations\n\n[![](https://aperiodical.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/pmg-200x200.png)](https://aperiodical.com/pmg/)p2mg: Two rotations by 180 \u030a and one independent reflection[![](https://aperiodical.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/pm-200x200.png)](https://aperiodical.com/pm/)pm: Only reflections with parallel axes[![](https://aperiodical.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/pgg-200x200.png)](https://aperiodical.com/pgg/)p2gg: A bit like p2mg, but with a glide reflection instead of a reflection\n\n[![](https://aperiodical.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/p3-200x200.png)](https://aperiodical.com/2015/12/christmas-symme-tree/p3-2/)p3: Three centres of rotation by 120 \u030a and no reflections.[![](https://aperiodical.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/p3m1-200x200.png)](https://aperiodical.com/2015/12/christmas-symme-tree/p3m1-2/)p3m1: Three centres of rotation by 120 \u030a and several reflections[![](https://aperiodical.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/p6-200x200.png)](https://aperiodical.com/2015/12/christmas-symme-tree/p6-2/)p6: distinct rotations by 60 \u030a, 120 \u030a and 180 \u030a!\n\n[![](https://aperiodical.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/p6mm-200x200.png)](https://aperiodical.com/2015/12/christmas-symme-tree/p6mm-2/)p6mm: all the rotations of p6, with reflections added everywhere.[![](https://aperiodical.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/p31m-1-200x200.png)](https://aperiodical.com/2015/12/christmas-symme-tree/p31m-3/)p31m: a rotation by 120 \u030a without a reflection, and another rotation with a reflection.\n\nThere\u2019s also an excellent [Wikipedia page on Wallpaper groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallpaper_group), with some [helpful diagrams](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wallpaper_group_diagrams) that really make sense of it all.\n\nOn discovering this, I rushed out to buy a pack of festive wrapping paper. Surely, in a selection pack of multiple designs, I\u2019d find all 17 different combinations? Well, no. Disappointingly, makers of Christmas wrapping paper, along with most people in the world, are less obsessed with symmetry than I am, so they\u2019ve not seen the need to vary the symmetry groups much \u2013 and in fact most of the patterns have no symmetries at all beyond the translation symmetry of shifting it across \u2013 the trivial symmetry group.\n\n[![](https://aperiodical.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/np_xmaswordcloud-200x200.jpg)](https://aperiodical.com/np_xmaswordcloud/)I call this one \u2018Christmas Wordcloud\u2019[![](https://aperiodical.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/np_elno-200x200.jpg)](https://aperiodical.com/np_elno/)Possibly a nice underlying structure, but that colour scheme?

A variety of interlocking configurations have been proposed for convex pieces that are arranged in a planar space. Published algorithms for creating a topological interlocking configuration start from a tessellation of the plane (e.g. squares colored as a checkerboard). For each square _S_ of one color, a plane _P_ through each edge _E_ is considered, tilted by a given angle \u03b8 against the tessellated plane. This induces a face _F_ supported by _P_ and limited by other such planes nearby. Note that _E_ is interior to the face. By adjacency, the squares of the other color have similarly delimiting faces. This algorithm generates a topological interlocking configuration of tetrahedra or antiprisms. When checked for correctness (i.e. for no overlap), it rests on the tessellation to be of squares. If the tessellation consists of rectangles, then the algorithm fails. If the tessellation is irregular, then the tilting angle is not uniform for each edge and must be determined, in the worst case, by trial and error. In this article, we propose a method for generating topological interlocking configurations in one single iteration over the tessellation or mesh using a height value and a center point type for each tile as parameters. The required angles are a function of the given height and selected center; therefore, angle choices are not required as an initial input. The configurations generated using our method are compared against the configurations generated using the angle-choice approach. The results show that the proposed method maintains the alignment of the pieces and preserves the co-planarity of the equatorial sections of the pieces. Furthermore, the proposed method opens a path of geometric analysis for topological interlocking configurations based on non-planar tessellations.\n\n## Introduction\n\nA topological interlocking configuration (TIC) is an assembly of building blocks with interfaces relying on shape and alignment. Such blocks are connected solely by face contact, disregarding the use of adhesives, connectors, or any other binding mechanism for keeping pieces together. The structure holds itself by the kinematic constraints imposed by both a peripheral support structure and the neighborhood surrounding every piece in the configuration. The principles behind TICs were discovered during the Renaissance in a time when both designs and construction techniques for floors and flat vaults were a signal of architectural innovation. The name was coined in the early 2000s when the material properties of TICs as well as their applications started to be formally approached.\n\nThe kinematic constraints on TICs imply two different considerations while designing a configuration: each piece individually and the entire configuration. At the individual level, each piece prevents motion on the pieces in its vicinity. That is, the shape of an individual piece must be designed in such a way that both push and pull motions of the piece are blocked by the wedging actions of the neighboring pieces. However, when the configuration is taken as a single entity, it is required to place a peripheral support frame that guarantees the configuration does not collapse. Such frame is required for both planar and curvilinear surfaces in order to prevent lateral motions and provide support for the pieces at the boundary of the configuration.\n\nGenerating a TIC starts with the tessellation of a surface. For every tile in the tessellation, there is a correspondent piece generated such that its shape prev...",

It has been studied for\nhundreds of years due to its practical importance. For example, the\nfamous Kepler conjecture was inspired by tightly stacking cannon\u0002balls in the 17th century. Since then, packing of regular objects\nsuch as boxes [Martello et al. 2000], ellipses [Stoyan et al. 2016],\nand tetrahedra [Chen et al. 2010] has been extensively studied, as\nwell as packing of irregular 2D objects [Leao et al. 2020]. However,\npacking of generic 3D objects has received less attention despite\nACM Trans. Graph., Vol. 42, No. 4, Article 1. Publication date: August 2023.\n1:2 \u2022 Cui et al.\nits practical importance, such as in robotic packaging [Wang and\nHauser 2019], 3D printing [Chen et al. 2015; Yao et al. 2015], trans\u0002portation [Egeblad et al. 2010], and layout and pattern generation\n[Fanni et al. 2022; Reinert et al. 2013].\nWe focus on the problem of maximum density packing given\na fixed container and a list of 3D objects. Packing density is the\ntotal volume of all packed objects divided by container volume. In\nthis scenario, there may be more objects than what can fit into a\nsingle container. We later extend our base algorithm to multi-tray\npacking where the goal is to pack all objects using as few containers\nas possible. We also require the packing to be interlocking-free: parts\nmust be physically disassembled without breaking or deforming\nthem. The disassembly is allowed to move a part or a group of parts\nthrough one or more steps along possibly different directions. We\ngear our algorithm toward 3D printing [Sitthi-Amorn et al. 2015;\nVanek et al. 2014]. In this case, the container is virtual and only\nserves to specify the printing volume. Objects can be disassembled\nin any direction after printing. This is different from packing in\nrobotics such as Hu et al. [2020], where the objects are inserted\nthrough a physical opening.\nThe first challenge of packing generic 3D objects is addressing\nthe complicated collision constraints that stem from arbitrary ge\u0002ometries. Many algorithms have been proposed previously [Lamas\u0002Fernandez et al. 2022; Liu et al. 2015; Ma et al. 2018; Romanova\net al. 2018], but it remains difficult to scale these algorithms to pack\nmore than a few dozen complex objects. Inspired by works in pro\u0002tein docking [Katchalski-Katzir et al. 1992], we formulate collision\nconstraints as correlations between discretized objects, which are\ncomputed in the spectral domain with FFT. This is efficient because\na single convolution using FFT computes collision detection results\nfor an object at all voxel locations. This algorithm is scalable to\nthousands of complex 3D objects. We then introduce a proximity\nmetric at every voxel location, also computed using FFT. The result\u0002ing algorithm is extremely efficient at finding object placements for\ntight packing.\nAnother challenge is to avoid interlocking because objects must\nfollow a non-colliding path when they are assembled or disassem\u0002bled. Checking for disassembly is known to be difficult [Goldwasser\net al. 1996]. We show that the same spectral framework comes to\nthe rescue yet again, allowing interlocks to be both detected and\nresolved. The key insight is that interlocking-free locations can be\ncomputed efficiently with a flood-fill on the collision metric.\nExpanding on the base algorithm, we employ a continuous search\nto refine placements at sub-voxel locations. We also propose a ray\ncasting disassembly method to efficiently handle easy-to-disassemble\nparts. Lastly, we extend the algorithm to multi-tray packing. To\nevaluate our algorithm, we generate a set of diverse benchmarks\nconsisting of thousands of generic 3D objects. In summary, our\ncontributions are:\n\u2022 An efficient placement search based on FFT\n\u2022 A disassembly algorithm in the same unified framework\n\u2022 A continuous placement refinement method\n\u2022 A broad-phase ray casting disassembly\n\u2022 An extension to multi-tray packing\n\u2022 A set of challenging benchmarks for future evaluations\n2 RELATED WORK\nPacking problems have been studied many times in the context\nof computational geometry and optimization [Wang et al. 2021].\nPrevious approaches often use expensive geometric queries [Hang\n2015; Liu et al. 2015; Ma et al. 2018] to enforce collision constraints.\nOur algorithm only uses a minimal amount of geometry processing\nby working with a voxel representation computed at a rate of 10 ms\nper million triangles on a GPU [Schwarz and Seidel 2010].

Previously, the no-fit polygon (NFP) has not been widely applied\nbecause of the perception that it is difficult to implement and because of the lack of generic approaches that can cope with\nall problem cases without specific case-by-case handling.

Introduction\nThe irregular two-dimensional variant of the cutting and packing problem impacts upon several important\nmanufacturing industries such as textiles, plastics, metal cutting and others. These problems usually consist of\na number of irregular pieces that are to be placed onto one or more sheets of material in the most efficient\nlayout possible, so that all pieces are assigned and do not overlap. Additionally, there are usually rotational\nconstraints enforced on the pieces due to the physical properties of the problem such as grain on the material,\npatterns on textiles and the cutting technology being employed. Sometimes rotational constraints may be used\nfor non-physical reasons such as to restrict pieces to a finite set of rotations thus simplifying layout construc\u0002tion procedures and allowing for faster solutions to be obtained. The two-dimensional stock cutting problem\n0377-2217/$ - see front matter \u0002 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\ndoi:10.1016/j.ejor.2006.03.011\n* Corresponding author.

Whitwell).\nEuropean Journal of Operational Research 179 (2007) 27\u201349\nwww.elsevier.com/locate/ejor\nhas been shown to be NP hard and is therefore intrinsically difficult to solve (Garey and Johnson, 1979). There\nhave been many different strategies for producing solutions to the irregular stock cutting problem. These\ninclude linear programming approaches, heuristic placement methods, metaheuristic guided search techniques\nand other novel approaches such as the iterative jostling of pieces (Dowsland et al., 1998). Survey papers can\nbe found in (Dowsland and Dowsland, 1992; Sweeney and Paternoster, 1992; Dyckhoff, 1990). However, the\nfeature that connects all of the approaches is that they are all required to cope with the geometry of the prob\u0002lem. This can be especially complicated when highly irregular shapes are used which may include holes or con\u0002cavities. The implementation of robust and efficient geometry routines can be laborious and can often take\nconsiderably longer than the packing strategies themselves. In particular, the geometry must handle all of\nthe interactions between shapes such as detecting whether two shapes are overlapping and calculating the\ntranslation distance required in a given direction so that the overlap is resolved. As we show in the following\nsection, although these tests can be implemented using trigonometric techniques, the no-fit polygon represents\na considerably more efficient solution.\nWhilst the generation of the no-fit polygon is academically challenging, it is a \u2018tool\u2019 and not a \u2018solution\u2019 and\nthis is perhaps one of the reasons why there are many publications in the literature which state that the no-fit\npolygon is used but which provide relatively little or no details on its implementation. In this paper we con\u0002centrate specifically on the no-fit polygon and provide an overview of the previous techniques that have been\nused for its creation. Furthermore, we describe and provide full implementation details for a new robust orbi\u0002tal approach that can cope with the traditional problem cases that many other approaches cannot handle.\nHopefully this will help in the further dissemination of the benefits of using the no-fit polygon (as opposed\nto traditional trigonometry based approaches) within both the industrial and the academic communities.\n2. The no-fit polygon \u2013 an overview\nIn this section we describe the functionality of the no-fit polygon and we compare it to the more traditional\ntrigonometric based overlap and intersection tests. We also give brief overviews of the many techniques that\nhave been used to generate no-fit polygons within the previous literature.\n2.1. The no-fit polygon\nThe first application of no-fit polygon techniques within the field of cutting and packing was presented by\nArt (1966), although the term \u2018\u2018shape envelop\u2019\u2019 was used. It was ten years later that the term \u2018\u2018no-fit polygon\u2019\u2019\nwas introduced by Adamowicz and Albano who approached the irregular stock cutting problem by using no\u0002fit polygons to pack shapes together using their minimum enclosing rectangles (Adamowicz and Albano,\n1976). The term \u2018\u2018configuration space obstacle\u2019\u2019 is often used to denote the NFP within the field of engineering\nand robot motion planning but the term has also been used with respect to cutting and packing in (Cuningh\u0002ame-Green, 1989). The \u2018\u2018hodograph\u2019\u2019 is often used to describe the no-fit polygon within the mathematics com\u0002munity (Stoyan and Ponomarenko, 1977; Scheithauer and Terno, 1993; Bennell et al., 2001). The main\nfunction of the no-fit polygon is to describe the region in which two polygons intersect. The following example\ngives an overview of the NFP construct.\nGiven two polygons, A and B, the no-fit polygon can be found by tracing one shape around the boundary\nof another. One of the polygons remains fixed in position and the other traverses around the fixed polygon\u2019s\nedges whilst ensuring that the polygons always touch but never intersect. Throughout this paper we adopt the\nconvention of the first polygon being fixed and the second being the traversing/orbiting polygon. Therefore,\nwhen polygon B traces around the fixed polygon A, the resulting no-fit polygon is denoted by NFPAB. In order\nto create the NFPAB object we must choose a reference point from B which will be traced as B moves around\nA. In our implementations we use the first vertex, within the shape vertex list, as the reference point (see\nFig. 1). The reference point can be any arbitrary point providing it follows the movements of the orbiting poly\u0002gon. It is also important to maintain the relative position of the reference point with respect to polygon B as\nthis is required when using the NFP to test for overlap.\nIn order to test whether polygon B overlaps polygon A we use NFPAB and B\u2019s reference point. If polygon B\nis positioned so that its reference point is inside the polygon NFPAB then it overlaps with polygon A. If the\n28 E.K. Burke et al. / European Journal of Operational Research 179 (2007) 27\u201349\nreference point is on the boundary of NFPAB then polygon B touches polygon A. Finally, if the reference point\nis outside of NFPAB then polygons A and B do not overlap or touch (see Fig. 2). The no-fit polygon is used\nwithin the following papers from the literature (Grinde and Cavalier, 1995; Ramkumar, 1996; Cheng and Rao,...",
