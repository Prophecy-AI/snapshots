According to recent research, one effective approach is to utilize algorithms that incorporate object transformations, including rotation, to improve space utilization. For instance, the paper \"Improved Approximations for Translational Packing of Convex Polygons\" develops polynomial-time algorithms that enhance shelf packing methods by sorting polygons based on height and orientation, allowing for better packing arrangements when rotations are considered ([arXiv:2308.08523](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.08523v1.pdf)). \n\nAnother promising technique involves using raster-based methods that approximate objects with pixelated representations, enabling the exploration of arbitrary rotation angles for the polygons.

One group of approaches is the raster methods, which rely on approximating the objects \nwith pixelated representations. Although they are versatile in treating irregular geometries, the raster methods \nreceived limited attention in solving problems involving rotatable objects, where available studies generally \nanalyze only right-angled rotations. In addition, raster approximation allows the use of unique performance \nmetrics and indirect consideration of constraints, which have not been exploited in the literature. This study \npresents the new Concurrent or Ordered Matrix-based Packing Arrangement Computation Technique\n(COMPACT). The method relies on raster representations of the objects that can be rotated by arbitrary angles, \nunlike the right-angled rotation restrictions imposed in many existing packing optimization studies based on \nraster methods. The raster approximations are obtained through loop-free operations that improve efficiency.\nBesides, a novel performance metric is introduced, which favors efficient filling of the available space by\nmaximizing the internal contact between the objects as well as the contact between the objects and domain \nboundaries. Moreover, the objective functions are exploited to discard overlap and overflow constraints and \nenable the use of unconstrained optimization methods. Several test problems involving concurrent and \nordered packing of multiple rectangular and circular objects into square bins are investigated. The results show \nthat the proposed technique performs effectively in determining the packing arrangements.\nKeywords: Packing; heuristics; raster representation; concurrent optimization; rotatable objects.\n1. Introduction\nPacking optimization is an important problem class that concerns various disciplines including warehouse \nmanagement, shipping, and design of engineering products. The widespread nature of this problem requires\nrobust and efficient algorithms that are easy to utilize.\nVarious techniques have been developed to solve different packing optimization problems. A large amount \nof available studies addresses the problem of packing two-dimensional rectangular objects into rectangular \nbins while keeping the object edges orthogonal to the domain boundaries. For instance, Chen and Huang (2007) \ncomputed solutions for two-dimensional rectangle packing problems by introducing a search algorithm that \nplaces the rectangles into the container one by one using a corner occupation strategy. Later, Leung, Zhang, \nZhou, and Wu (2012) proposed a hybrid heuristic algorithm that combines greedy strategy and simulated \nannealing methods to solve the rectangular knapsack packing problem. Recently, Chen et al. (2019) developed \na deterministic heuristic algorithm for solving the two-dimensional rectangular packing problems that require \nmaximizing the filled portion of the rectangular domain.\nPacking problems concerning nonrectangular objects and domains were also prevalently investigated. For \nexample, Del Valle, Queiroz, Miyazawa, and Xavier (2012) developed heuristic approaches for solving 2D \ncutting/packing problems involving irregular objects. Later, Chen et al. (2018) proposed a heuristic algorithm \nfor solving circle packing problems for placing multiple identical circles into the smallest circular container.\nLately, Bouzid and Salhi (2020) investigated orthogonal packing of rectangular objects into a circular space of \nfixed radius.\n \n* Email address: serhat@is.mpg.de (Gokhan Serhat)\nPreprint submitted to Elsevier\n2\nThe complexity of the packing problems notably increases when the nonorthogonal rotation of the objects \nis allowed in addition to the translation (Cherri et al., 2016). These problems received relatively lesser attention\ncompared to the problems involving fixed object orientations or orthogonal rotations. In one study, Zhang and \nZhang (2009) introduced a 2D packing optimization technique called finite-circle method, which approximates \npolygons with a set of circles and converts the non-overlapping constraints into simple constraints between \ncircles. Martins and Tsuzuki (2010) used a heuristic approach to minimize the waste space during the rotational\nplacement of two-dimensional polygons into irregular containers. In another study by Martinez-Sykora et al. \n(2017), a strategy was proposed to solve bin packing problems with irregular pieces that can be freely rotated.\nThe difficulties in the formulations for packing problems involving irregular objects have led to the \ndevelopment of raster point methods, which rely on approximating the objects on a discretized grid. With \nthese methods, packing configurations can be represented by assigning zeroes to the free domain cells and \ndifferent values to the cells where a single object is present or multiple objects overlap. The key advantage of \nraster techniques is their applicability to the problems involving objects with complex shapes, where the main \ndrawback is their resolution-dependent precision (Leao et al., 2019). In the literature, the research on packing \noptimization with raster methods is limited compared to the available work based on other techniques. In a\nparticular study, Toledo et al. (2013) proposed a discrete modeling approach called the Dotted-Board Model, \nwhich relies on representing the bin with a two-dimensional grid and using the plausible grid points for the\nplacement of arbitrary polygons. Later, Mundim, Andretta, and de Queiroz (2017) extended the Dotted-Board \nModel for packing non-polygonal objects with curved edges and used it within a heuristic approach based on\ngenetic algorithms. Recently, Sato, Martins, Gomes, and Tsuzuki (2019) developed the raster overlap \nminimization algorithm to solve the irregular strip packing problem using a raster method that limits the \nsolution space.\nThis study presents the new Concurrent or Ordered Matrix-based Packing Arrangement Computation \nTechnique (COMPACT). In this framework, the object shapes are approximated by matrix-based (raster)\nrepresentations. The objects can be rotated by angles that are not necessarily restricted to be right-angle \nmultiples, unlike the conditions imposed in many existing packing optimization studies relying on raster \nmethods. The raster approximations are obtained through loop-free operations that improve efficiency.\nBesides, a novel performance metric is introduced, which aids efficient filling of the available space by \nmaximizing the internal contact between the objects as well as the contact between the objects and domain \nboundaries. Moreover, the possibility of exploiting the objective functions for discarding overlap and overflow\nconstraints is explored to enable the use of unconstrained optimization methods. As case studies, the \ndeveloped technique is utilized to pack multiple rectangular and circular objects in square domains using \nconcurrent and ordered placement strategies. The results show that the proposed technique performs\neffectively in determining the packing arrangements. The organization of the study is as follows: The matrix\u0002based object representation that forms the backbone of the developed technique is described in the following \nsection. Section 3 covers the details regarding the formulation of the optimization problem. Section 4 covers \nthe results from various case studies. In Section 5, the conclusions are stated and the directions for future \nstudies are outlined.\n2.

A version of the algorithm and implementation also solves _rotational minimum enclosure_: given a class C of container polygons, find a container C\u2208C of minimum area for which containment has a solution. The minimum enclosure is approximate: it bounds the minimum area between (1\u2212 _\u03b5_) _A_ and A. Experiments indicate that finding the minimum enclosure is practical for _k_ =2,3 but not larger unless optimality is sacrificed or angles ranges are limited (although these solutions can still be useful). Important applications for these algorithm to industrial problems are discussed. The paper also gives practical algorithms and numerical techniques for robustly calculating polygon set intersection, Minkowski sum, and _range intersection_: the intersection of a polygon with itself as it rotates through a range of angles. In particular, it introduces _nearest pair rounding_, which allows all these calculations to be carried out in rounded floating point arithmetic.\n\n- [Previous article in issue](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925772199000139)\n- [Next article in issue](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092577219900005X)\n\n## Keywords\n\nLayout\n\nPacking or nesting of irregular polygons\n\nContainment\n\nMinimum enclosure\n\nRobust geometry\n\nGeometric rounding\n\nRecommended articles\n\n- ### [3D mesh cutting for high quality atlas packing](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167839622000851)\n\n\n\n2022, Computer Aided Geometric Design\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitation Excerpt :\n\n\n\nScaffold mesh structures (Jiang et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2005) are also proposed to compute globally bijective parameterization. Atlas packing The problem of maximizing the packing efficiency for a given set of charts is NP-hard Garey (1979); Milenkovic (1999). Early attempts (L\u00e9vy et al., 2002; N\u00f6ll and Strieker, 2011; Sander et al., 2003) design schemes to balance packing efficiency against computational cost while leaving the chart geometry unchanged.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow abstract\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn efficiently packed, low-distortion parameterization with a short boundary can save a great amount of memory and improve both quality and efficiency of rendering. Existing packing methods begin with an input atlas (or parameterization), but the cuts in the input atlas may be not suitable for a high quality result. We propose a simple yet effective approach to cut an input surface and generate an atlas that comprehensively considers the packing efficiency, the mapping distortion and the boundary length. Viewing the desired cuts on the input mesh as the pullback of a low-distortion mapping from a polysquare boundary, we notice that the above three objectives actually imply a small number of cone singularities with angle deficit of \u03c02k,k\u2208Z, and orthogonally intersected short cuts passing through all singularities. Therefore, we first leverage a cross frame-field to identify a set of singularities and cancel some of them to balance their amount and atlas distortion. Then, the singularities remained are heuristically connected by short cuts which intersect with each other nearly orthogonally. Results show that our method produces a low-distortion and polysquare-like atlas with controllable number of singularities. Comparing with other atlas generation methods only focusing on distortion, taking our atlas as the input for the subsequent packing algorithm ( [Liu et al., 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925772199000061#br0010)) is better than using previous cutting strategies on a benchmark containing 5519 cases, because the conflicts among those desired objectives for packing are alleviated at an early stage.\n\n- ### [Robust atlas generation via angle-based segmentation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167839620300418)\n\n\n\n2020, Computer Aided Geometric Design\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitation Excerpt :\n\n\n\nWe use Jiang et al.

To seek a desired tradeoff between computational cost and packing efficiency, some heuristic algorithms are proposed (N\u00f6ll and Strieker, 2011; Sander et al., 2003; L\u00e9vy et al., 2002).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow abstract\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe present a robust method to generate atlases with low isometric distortion and high packing efficiency.

Since there have been elegant and robust solutions for the first, third, and fourth steps, we focus on the second step. Central to the second step is a novel and robust segmentation technique. To improve the robustness of the segmentation, we first deform the parameterized charts to straighten their boundaries while aligning with the axes as much as possible, bounding the deformation distortion, and not introducing intersecting boundaries. Since rectangle-like patches are preferred for the third and fourth steps, we segment the deformed charts by decomposing concave interior angles into several interior angles close to \u03c02 or _\u03c0_.

A link will be provided\nin a future version of this document.\narXiv:2308.08523v1 [cs.CG] 16 Aug 2023\n2 Improved Approximations for Translational Packing of Convex Polygons\n1 Introduction\nMany real-life situations require us to make decisions about optimally packing a collection\nof objects into a specific container. One particular category of these packing problems is\ntwo-dimensional packing, which is encountered in everyday scenarios like arranging items\non a shelf and in industrial applications such as cutting cookies from rolled-out dough\nor manufacturing sets of tiles from standard-sized panels made of wood, glass, or metal.\nAnother intriguing example involves cutting fabric pieces for clothing production. In this\ncase, the pieces often cannot be rotated freely, as they must adhere to a desired pattern\nin the final product, which is tailored of multiple elements. The widespread applicability\nof two-dimensional packing problems has led to a surge of interest in designing efficient\nalgorithms to address them. In this paper, we follow the line of research and study the\nproblem of packing convex polygons without rotations in various settings depending on the\ntype of containers used.\nPast research focusing on theoretical considerations of two-dimensional packings mainly\nconcentrates on the scenario when all objects are axis-parallel rectangles. In this paper, we\nwill discuss packing without rotations, in which only translations are permitted. There are\ntwo main classes of the problem depending on whether the size of the container is fixed and\nwe want to minimize the number of containers used or whether we want to minimize the\ncontainer\u2019s size with respect to some objective function.\nA seminal example of the first class is the Geometric Bin Packing problem in which\na number of unit size squared bins to pack is to be minimized. The problem is arguably\nthe most natural generalization of the regular (1D) Bin Packing to two dimensions, and\nits absolute approximability has been fully understood. Unless P = N P, the best possible\nefficient constant factor approximation is 2 [15], and such an algorithm is known [10].\nIn the second class, there are several variants to be considered. An example is the\nStrip Packing Problem which is concerned with packing objects into a strip of width\n1 and infinite height in such a way that the maximum of all the heights of the placed\nobjects is minimized. Like Geometric Bin Packing, Strip Packing generalizes (1D)\nBin Packing. The best known efficient constant factor approximation for Strip Packing\nhas approximation factor (5/3 + \u03f5) [9]. It is known that there can not exist a polynomial\ntime algorithm with an approximation ratio of (3/2 \u2212 \u03f5) for any \u03f5 > 0 unless P = N P, which\nfollows directly from the approximation hardness of (1D) Bin Packing. Both classes of\nproblems have been also considered in the asymptotic setting, see e.g. [11, 5, 12].\nIn younger time, there was also an increase of interest in cases where the objects in\nquestion are general convex polygons. Alt, de Berg and Knauer [2, 3] considered the problem\nof packing an instance consisting of a number of convex polygons of the form p \u2282 [0, 1]2into\na minimum area axis-parallel rectangular container. We refer to this problem as Polygon\nArea Minimization throughout this paper. In the special case where the instance consists\nof rectangles only, the problem is known to admit a PTAS [4]. They proved the existence of\nthe following efficient algorithm:\nA 23.78-approximation for Polygon Area Minimization.\nRecently, Aamand, Abrahamsen, Beretta and Kleist [1] showed that the algorithm of Alt,\nde Berg and Knauer can be leveraged to obtain also efficient approximation algorithms of\nfurther problems:\nA 7-approximation for Polygon Perimeter Minimization.\nA 51-approximation for Polygon Strip Packing.\nAn 11-approximation for Polygon Bin Packing for polygons with diameter at most 1\n10 .\nA. Kurpisz and S. Suter 3\n1.1 Our results\nThe results of Alt, de Berg and Knauer [2, 3] and Aamand et al. [1] are heavily based on\nso-called shelf packing algorithms. In shelf packing algorithms, the objects are first placed\non the shelves, possibly ordered by height, which are later stacked on one another to build\na final solution. Compared to axis-parallel rectangles, the main challenge in designing an\napproximation algorithm for polygon packing problems is that objects cannot be sorted by\nheight and orientation simultaneously. As a result, the algorithm and its analysis in [2, 3]\nhave such a large approximation guarantee. In this paper, we provide new insight into how\nshelf packing algorithms should be applied to polygon packing problems. We introduce a\nsequence of transformations of the objects that allow us first to sort them by height and later\nby orientation to build a solution of a much better approximation guarantee. More precisely,\nwe design polynomial-time algorithms with the following factors:\nA 9.45-approximation for Polygon Area Minimization.\nUsing this algorithm as a subroutine, we build upon the methods from Aamand et al. [1] to\nobtain the following efficient approximation algorithms:\nA (3.75 + \u03f5)-approximation for Polygon Perimeter Minimization.\nA 21.89-approximation for Polygon Strip Packing.\nA 5.09-approximation for Polygon Bin Packing for polygons which have their diameter\nbounded by 1\n10 .\nThe results are proved in Sections 4, 5, 6, and 7 respectively. Furthermore, in Section 8\nwe show the following results, which make progress towards solving an open question of a\nO(1)-approximation algorithm for Polygon Bin Packing for arbitrary polygons.\nThere is an efficient O(\n1\n\u03b4\n)-approximation algorithm for Polygon Bin Packing for\ninstances where each polygon has width or height at most 1 \u2212 \u03b4.\nThere is an efficient O(1)-approximation algorithm for Polygon Bin Packing for\ninstances with the property that all polygons share a spine (up to translation) with height\nat least 3\n4\n.\n2 Preliminaries\nWe start out considerations by recalling a classical and well-known problem in theoretical\ncomputer science, the Bin Packing problem: Given a list of numbers s1, . . . , sn \u2208 (0, 1] \u2229 Q,\nrepresenting the sizes of n objects, the goal is to find the minimum number of bins of size 1,\nso that we can pac...",

In addition, we present efficient approximation algorithms for special cases of the Polygon Bin Packing problem, progressing toward solving an open question concerning an O(1)-approximation algorithm for arbitrary polygons.\n Comments: This is the full version of the same-named paper which will be presented at ESA 2023 conference\n Subjects: Computational Geometry (cs.CG)  \n MSC classes: 68Q25  \n ACM classes: F.2.2  \n Cite as: arXiv:2308.08523 [cs.CG]  \n (or arXiv:2308.08523v1 [cs.CG] for this version) \n https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2308.08523 \n Focus to learn more  \n arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite \n \n\n Submission history\n\n From: Silvan Suter [view email]\n [v1] Wed, 16 Aug 2023 17:20:46 UTC (2,689 KB)\n Full-text links:\n\n Access Paper:\n\n Download a PDF of the paper titled Improved Approximations for Translational Packing of Convex Polygons, by Adam Kurpisz and Silvan Suter\n * Download PDF\n * PostScript\n * Other Formats\n (view license)\n Current browse context:\n cs.CG\n < prev | next >\n new | recent | 2308\n Change to browse by:\n cs\n\n References & Citations\n\n * NASA ADS\n * Google Scholar\n * Semantic Scholar\n a export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n BibTeX formatted citation\n\n \u00d7\n loading...\n Data provided by:\n\n Bookmark\n\n Bibliographic Tools\n\n Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\n Bibliographic Explorer Toggle\n Bibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n Litmaps Toggle\n Litmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n scite.ai Toggle\n scite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n Code, Data, Media\n\n Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\n Links to Code Toggle\n CatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n DagsHub Toggle\n DagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n Links to Code Toggle\n Papers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n ScienceCast Toggle\n ScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n Demos\n\n Demos\n\n Replicate Toggle\n Replicate (What is Replicate?)\n Spaces Toggle\n Hugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n Related Papers\n\n Recommenders and Search Tools\n\n Link to Influence Flower\n Influence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n Connected Papers Toggle\n Connected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n Core recommender toggle\n CORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n About arXivLabs\n\n arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\n arXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\n Both individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\n Have an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

We investigate the problem of \u001cnding a minimum-area container for the disjoint\npacking of a set of convex polygons by translations. In particular, we consider axis-parallel\nrectangles or arbitrary convex sets as containers. For both optimization problems which are\nNP-hard we develop e\u001ecient constant factor approximation algorithms.\n1 Introduction\nAlgorithms for e\u001eciently packing objects into containers have important applications: In\ntwo dimensions, the problem occurs, e.g., in the context of cutting out a given set of patterns\nfrom a given large piece of material minimizing waste, typically in apparel fabrication or\nsheet metal processing. In three dimensions the problem occurs naturally in minimizing\nstorage space or container space for transportation.\nThe problem has numerous variants. The most basic one is the decision problem\nwhether a set of given objects can be packed into a given container. In sheet metal and\napparel processing, mostly the problem of strip packing [12, 13, 5] occurs, i.e., a given set of\nobjects needs to be packed inside a strip of a given \u001cxed width using as short a piece of the\nstrip as possible. Here, we will consider the problem of minimizing the area of the container.\nMoreover, the shape of the objects to be packed is signi\u001ccant, e.g., in two dimensions\narbitrary rectangles, axis-parallel rectangles, convex polygons, or simple polygons. Further\u0002more, the allowable transformations for placing the objects play an important role: Is it\nallowed to rotate them, i.e., apply rigid motions, or are only translations allowed? We will\nconsider packing by translations, which is an important variant in practice. For example, in\napparel production there are usually patterns of weaving or texture on the material so that\nthe position where a piece should be cut out cannot be rotated arbitrarily.\nAlready the most simple versions of the problem are NP-hard, e.g., packing a given\nset of axis-parallel rectangles into a given axis-parallel container by translation, as can easily\n\u2217Research was partially carried out at the International INRIA-McGill-Victoria Workshop on Problems in\nComputational Geometry, Barbados 2015.

So, only for a constant number of\nobjects polynomial-time algorithms are known, see [1, 2, 14, 3, 8, 9, 10, 7]. Therefore,\nnumerous approximation algorithms and heuristics have been investigated, mostly in the\noperations research and combinatorial optimization communities and mostly on axis-parallel\nrectangles under translation for a given container or strip. For a survey see [11].\nNot much work has been done so far on approximation algorithms for the problem of\n\u001cnding minimum area containers, either convex ones or axis-parallel boxes. For objects that\nare axis-parallel, rectangles under translation, and arbitrary rectangles or convex polygons\nunder rigid motion, approximation algorithms can be developed from the known ones for\nstrip packing [13]. In fact, in [15] it is shown that packing axis-parallel rectangles under\ntranslation with an approximation factor of 2, and packing convex polygons under rigid\nmotions with an approximation factor of 4 is possible e\u001eciently.\nThus the status of the packing problem in the translational case can be summarized\nas follows: All known algorithms that produce optimal results or have provable approxi\u0002mation ratios fall into one of two categories: They either pack only a very special kind of\nobjects like line-segments or axis-parallel boxes, or they pack a constant number of poly\u0002gons. Since the problem for a non-constant number of objects is NP-hard, this leaves the\nfollowing question: can the packing problem for n objects that are not axis-parallel be e\u001e-\nciently approximated? We answer this question a\u001ermatively for packing a set P of convex\npolygons into a minimum-area rectangular container. Using this result, we also show how to\napproximate the minimum-area convex container for P. Our algorithms run in O(n log n)\ntime.\nWe remark that the restriction to translational packing makes the problem harder.\nIndeed, if we allow rotations then we can compute a minimum-area oriented bounding box\nfor each input polygon, rotate those boxes so that they become axis-parallel, and then pack\nthe boxes using a known algorithm for axis-parallel boxes. Since the minimum-area oriented\nbounding box has area at most twice the area of the polygon itself, this can give a good\napproximation ratio. When we are not allowed to rotate the polygons this approach fails,\nsince the area of the axis-parallel bounding box of a polygon can be arbitrarily much larger\nthan the area of the polygon itself. Our result shows that we can still get a constant\u0002factor approximation in the translational case. The approximation factors we obtain are\nfairly large, but to the best of our knowledge this is the \u001crst proof that these NP-hard\noptimization problems can be approximated at all.\n2 Rectangular Containers\nLet P := {p1, . . . , pk} be a set of convex polygons with n vertices in total. We call an axis\u0002aligned box into which we can pack all polygons (without rotating them) a container for P.\nOur goal is to \u001cnd a container for P of minimum area. Let bopt be a minimum-area container\nfor P, and let opt be its area. Below we present an algorithm that \u001cnds a container of area\nat most 17.45 \u00b7 opt.\nDe\u001cne the height of a polygon p, denoted height(p), to be the di\u001berence between\nits maximum and minimum y-coordinates, and let hmax := maxp\u2208P height(p). Furthermore,\n2\nJournal of Computational Geometry jocg.org\nJoCG 8(1), 1\u201310, 2017 3\nhi\nFig. 1: Example of a packing produced by our algorithm for a single height class.\nde\u001cne the width of a polygon p, denoted width(p), to be the di\u001berence between its maximum\nand minimum x-coordinates, and let wmax := maxp\u2208P width(p). We partition P into height\nclasses using a parameter \u03b1, with 0 < \u03b1 < 1 which is determined later to give the optimal\napproximation factor. More precisely, P is partitioned into subsets P0, P1, . . . according\nto the height: Polygons with height between hmax and \u03b1hmax go into P0, polygons with\nheight between \u03b1hmax and \u03b1\n2hmax go into P1, and so on. More precisely, Pi contains all\npolygons p \u2208 P such that hi+1 < height(p) 6 hi, where hi = \u03b1\nihmax. Our general strategy\nis now as follows:\n1. Pack each height class Pi separately into a container Bi of height hi.\n2. Replace each nonempty container Bi by a collection of axis-aligned mini-containers\nthat are not too wide. Pack all mini-containers into a single container B.\nNext we explain each of these steps in detail.\nStep 1: Packing polygons from one height class. Consider the height class Pi, which\ncontains all polygons whose height lies in the range (\u03b1hi, hi]. Let \u03c3 := [0, \u221e) \u00d7 [0, hi] be a\nsemi-in\u001cnite strip of height hi. We place the polygons from Piinto \u03c3 in a greedy manner,\nas follows: For a polygon p, let s(p) be the segment connecting the lowest vertex of p to the\nhighest vertex of p. If p has horizontal edges, then s(p) connects the bottom-left vertex to\nthe top-right vertex. We call s(p) the spine of p. We sort the polygons in Pi according to\nthe slopes of their spines and then we p...",

For this purpose the purpose the polygons may be moved either by translation only, or by combinations of translations and rotations. We investigates both cases, that the polygons may overlap when being packed or that they must be disjoint. The _size_ of a rectangle to be minimized can either be its area or its perimeter. In the case of overlapping packing very efficient algorithms whose runtime is close to linear or _O_ ( _n_ log _n_) can be found even for an arbitrary number of polygons. Disjoint optimal packing is known to be NP-hard for arbitrary numbers of polygons. Here, efficient algorithms are given for disjoint packing of two polygons with a runtime close to linear for translations and _O_ ( _n_ 3) for general isometries.\n\nPartially supported by the German Research Association (DFG), projects A1 253/4-2 and A1 253/4-3.\n\nPartially supported by CUR Gen.

Korf\nComputer Science Department\nUniversity of California, Los Angeles\nLos Angeles, CA 90095\nehuang@cs.ucla.edu, korf@cs.ucla.edu\nAbstract\nThe rectangle packing problem consists of find\u0002ing an enclosing rectangle of smallest area that can\ncontain a given set of rectangles without overlap.\nOur algorithm picks the x-coordinates of all the\nrectangles before picking any of the y-coordinates.\nFor the x-coordinates, we present a dynamic vari\u0002able ordering heuristic and an adaptation of a prun\u0002ing algorithm used in previous solvers. We then\ntransform the rectangle packing problem into a per\u0002fect packing problem that has no empty space, and\npresent inference rules to reduce the instance size.\nFor the y-coordinates we search a space that models\nempty positions as variables and rectangles as val\u0002ues. Our solver is over 19 times faster than the pre\u0002vious state-of-the-art on the largest problem solved\nto date, allowing us to extend the known solutions\nfor a consecutive-square packing benchmark from\nN=27 to N=32.\n1 Introduction\nGiven a set of rectangles, our problem is to find all enclosing\nrectangles of minimum area that will contain them without\noverlap. We refer to an enclosing rectangle as a bounding\nbox. The optimization problem is NP-hard, while the prob\u0002lem of deciding whether a set of rectangles can be packed in\na given bounding box is NP-complete, via a reduction from\nbin-packing [Korf, 2003]. The consecutive-square packing\nbenchmark is a simple set of increasingly difficult bench\u0002marks for this problem, where the task is to find the bounding\nboxes of minimum area that contain a set of squares of sizes\n1x1, 2x2, ..., up to NxN [Korf, 2003]. For example, Figure 1\nis an optimal solution for N=32. We use this benchmark here\nbut none of the techniques introduced in this paper are spe\u0002cific to packing squares as opposed to rectangles.\nRectangle packing has many practical applications. It ap\u0002pears when loading a set of rectangular objects on a pallet\nwithout stacking them, and also in VLSI design where rect\u0002angular circuit components must be packed onto a rectangu\u0002lar chip. Various other cutting stock and layout problems also\nhave rectangle packing at their core.\nFigure 1: An optimal solution for N=32 with a bounding box\nof 85x135.\n511\n(a) Compulsory part of a 5x2 at\nx=[0,2]\n(b) Assigning a 4x2 to [0,2].\nFigure 2: Examples of compulsory parts and intervals.\n2 Previous Work\nKorf [2003] divided the rectangle packing problem into two\nsubproblems: the minimal bounding box problem and the\ncontainment problem. The former finds a bounding box of\nleast area that can contain a given set of rectangles, while the\nlatter tries to pack the given rectangles in a given bounding\nbox. The algorithm that solves the minimal bounding box\nproblem calls the algorithm that solves the containment prob\u0002lem as a subroutine.\n2.1 Minimal Bounding Box Problem\nA simple way to solve the minimal bounding box problem\nis to find the minimum and maximum areas that describe\nthe set of feasible and potentially optimal bounding boxes.\nBounding boxes of all dimensions can be generated with ar\u0002eas within this range, and then tested in non-decreasing order\nof area until all feasible solutions of smallest area are found.\nThe minimum area is the sum of the areas of the given rectan\u0002gles. The maximum area is determined by the bounding box\nof a greedy solution found by setting the bounding box height\nto that of the tallest rectangle, and then placing the rectangles\nin the first available position when scanning from left to right,\nand for each column scanning from bottom to top.\n2.2 Containment Problem\nKorf\u2019s [2003] absolute placement approach modeled rectan\u0002gles as variables and empty locations in the bounding box\nas values. Moffitt and Pollack\u2019s [2006] relative placement ap\u0002proach used a variable for every pair of rectangles to represent\nthe relations above, below, left, and right. Absolute place\u0002ment was faster than relative placement [Korf et al., 2009],\nwhich in turn was faster than the methods of Clautiaux et al.\n[2007] and Beldiceanu et al. [2008].\nSimonis and O\u2019Sullivan [2008] used Clautiaux et al.\u2019s\n[2007] variable order with additional constraints from\nBeldiceanu et al. [2008] to greatly outperform Korf et al.\u2019s\nsolver [2009]. They used Prolog\u2019s backtracking engine to\nsolve a set of constraints which they specified prior to the\nsearch effort. They first assigned the x-coordinates of all\nthe rectangles before any of the y-coordinates. Since we use\nsome of these ideas, we review them here.\nSimonis and O\u2019Sullivan [2008] used two sets of redundant\nvariables for the x-coordinates. The first set of N variables\ncorrespond to \u201cintervals\u201d where a rectangle is assigned an\ninterval of x-coordinates. Interval sizes are hand-picked for\neach rectangle prior to search, and they induce a smaller rect\u0002angle representing the common intersecting area of placing\nthe rectangle in any location in the interval [Beldiceanu et\nal., 2008]. Larger intervals result in weaker constraint prop\u0002agation (less pruning) but a smaller branching factor, while\nsmaller intervals result in stronger constraint propagation but\na larger branching factor.\nAs shown in Figure 2b, a 4x2 rectangle assigned an x\u0002interval of [0,2] consumes 2 units of area at each x-coordinate\nin [2,3], represented by the doubly-hatched area. This \u201ccom\u0002pulsory profile\u201d [Beldiceanu et al., 2008] is a constraint com\u0002mon to all positions x \u2208 [0, 2] of the original 4x2 rectan\u0002gle. If there were no feasible set of interval assignments, then\nthe constraint would save us from having to try individual x\u0002values. However, if we do find a set of interval assignments,\nthen we must search for a set of single x-coordinate val\u0002ues. Simonis and O\u2019Sullivan [2008] used a total of 4N vari\u0002ables, assigning (in order) x-intervals, single x-coordinates,\ny-intervals, and finally single y-coordinates.\n3 Overall Search Strategy\nWe separate the containment problem from the minimal\nbounding box problem, and use Korf et al.\u2019s [2009] al\u0002gorithm to solve the latter problem. Like Simonis and\nO\u2019Sullivan [2008], we assign all x-coordinates prior to any y\u0002coordinates, and use interval variables for the x-coordinates.\nWe set a rectangle\u2019s interval size to 0.35 times its width,\nwhich gave us the best performance. Finally, we do not use\ninterval variables for the y-coordinates. All of the remaining\nideas presented in this paper are our contributions.\nAlthough we use some ideas used by Simonis and\nO\u2019Sullivan [2008], we do not take a constraint programming\napproach in which all constraints are specified to a general\npurpose solver like Prolog, prior to the search effort. Instead,\nwe have implemented our program from scratch in C++, al\u0002lowing us to easily choose which constraints and inferences to\nuse at what time, and giving us more flexibility during search.\nFor example, as we will explain later, we make different in\u0002ferences depending on the partial solution.\nWe implemented a chronological backtracking algorithm\nwith dynamic variable ordering and forward checking. Our\nalgorithm works in three stages as it goes from the root of the\nsearch tree down to the leaves:\n1. It first works on the x-coordinates in a model where\nvariables are rectangles and values are x-coordinate lo\u0002cations, using dynamic variable ordering by area and a\nconstraint that detects infeasible subtrees.\n2. For each x-coordinate solution found, it conducts a per\u0002fect packing transformation, applies inference rules to\nreduce the transformed problem size, and derives conti\u0002guity constraints between rectangles.\n3. It then searches for a set of y-coordinates in a model\nwhere variables are empty corners and values are rect\u0002angles.\n4 Assigning X-Coordinates\nFor the x-coordinates, we propose a dynamic variable order\nand a constraint adapted from Korf\u2019s [2003] wasted-space\npruning heuristic. For a bounding box of size WxH we use\n512\nan array of size W representing the...",
