      "text": "The No-Fit Polygon (NFP) algorithm is a computational method used in 2D irregular polygon packing optimization, particularly for solving nesting problems where irregular shapes need to be placed efficiently without overlap. The core concept of the NFP is to represent the feasible relative positions of two polygons such that they do not intersect, effectively capturing all possible placements of one shape relative to another ([Burke et al., 2006](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0377221706001639); [Bennell, 2007](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1057/palgrave.jors.2602255)). The NFP is typically generated through geometric operations like Minkowski sums or other algorithms that account for the shapes' outlines, including concavities and holes, to accurately model the non-overlapping regions ([Dean et al., 2006](https://www.elsevier.com/locate/cor); [Rao, 2022](https://www.mdpi.com/2227-7390/10/16/2941)).\n\nIn practical applications, the NFP is used to streamline the placement process by quickly verifying whether a shape can be positioned at a certain location without overlap, thus optimizing the packing layout. Several algorithms have been developed to generate the NFP efficiently, handling complex and degenerate cases such as interlocking concavities or holes within polygons ([Burke et al., 2006](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0377221706001639); [Bennell, 2007](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1057/palgrave.jors.2602255)). Advances include robust geometric approaches that simplify the shape while maintaining accuracy, as well as algorithms that improve computational speed for industrial-scale problems ([Rao, 2022](https://www.mdpi.com/2227-7390/10/16/2941)). Overall, the NFP is a fundamental tool in irregular polygon packing, enabling more efficient and automated nesting solutions.",

Previously, the no-fit polygon (NFP) has not been widely applied because of the perception that it is difficult to implement and because of the lack of generic approaches that can cope with all problem cases without specific case-by-case handling. This paper introduces a robust orbital method for the creation of no-fit polygons which does not suffer from the typical problem cases found in the other approaches from the literature. Furthermore, the algorithm only involves two simple geometric stages so it is easily understood and implemented. We demonstrate how the approach handles known degenerate cases such as holes, interlocking concavities and jigsaw type pieces and we give generation times for 32 irregular packing benchmark problems from the literature, including real world datasets, to allow further comparison with existing and future approaches.\n## Introduction\nThe irregular two-dimensional variant of the cutting and packing problem impacts upon several important manufacturing industries such as textiles, plastics, metal cutting and others. These problems usually consist of a number of irregular pieces that are to be placed onto one or more sheets of material in the most efficient layout possible, so that all pieces are assigned and do not overlap. Additionally, there are usually rotational constraints enforced on the pieces due to the physical properties of the problem such as grain on the material, patterns on textiles and the cutting technology being employed. Sometimes rotational constraints may be used for non-physical reasons such as to restrict pieces to a finite set of rotations thus simplifying layout construction procedures and allowing for faster solutions to be obtained. The two-dimensional stock cutting problem has been shown to be NP hard and is therefore intrinsically difficult to solve (Garey and Johnson, 1979). There have been many different strategies for producing solutions to the irregular stock cutting problem. These include linear programming approaches, heuristic placement methods, metaheuristic guided search techniques and other novel approaches such as the iterative jostling of pieces (Dowsland et al., 1998). Survey papers can be found in (Dowsland and Dowsland, 1992, Sweeney and Paternoster, 1992, Dyckhoff, 1990). However, the feature that connects all of the approaches is that they are all required to cope with the geometry of the problem. This can be especially complicated when highly irregular shapes are used which may include holes or concavities. The implementation of robust and efficient geometry routines can be laborious and can often take considerably longer than the packing strategies themselves. In particular, the geometry must handle all of the interactions between shapes such as detecting whether two shapes are overlapping and calculating the translation distance required in a given direction so that the overlap is resolved. As we show in the following section, although these tests can be implemented using trigonometric techniques, the no-fit polygon represents a considerably more efficient solution.\nWhilst the generation of the no-fit polygon is academically challenging, it is a \u2018tool\u2019 and not a \u2018solution\u2019 and this is perhaps one of the reasons why there are many publications in the literature which state that the no-fit polygon is used but which provide relatively little or no details on its implementation. In this paper we concentrate specifically on the no-fit polygon and provide an overview of the previous techniques that have been used for its creation. Furthermore, we describe and provide full implementation details for a new robust orbital approach that can cope with the traditional problem cases that many other approaches cannot handle. Hopefully this will help in the further dissemination of the benefits of using the no-fit polygon (as opposed to traditional trigonometry based approaches) within both the industrial and the academic communities.\n## Section snippets\n## The no-fit polygon \u2013an overview\nIn this section we describe the functionality of the no-fit polygon and we compare it to the more traditional trigonometric based overlap and intersection tests. We also give brief overviews of the many techniques that have been used to generate no-fit polygons within the previous literature.\n## The new no-fit polygon construction algorithm\nWe now describe our new approach for robust no-fit polygon generation through the use of orbital methods utilising standard trigonometrical techniques. For the intersection calculations within our presented implementation, it is important to use a robust geometry library. It is also beneficial to implement routines that are as fast and as close to optimal as possible in order to promote fast no-fit polygon generation and packing algorithms. We have implemented such a library. Although this can\n## Problem cases\nIn this section we discuss each of the problem cases that cause difficulties with other methods and show why our approach is able to handle them without specific case-by-case implementations. In each figure of this section we identify the stationary and orbiting polygons in dark and light grey shading respectively and we show the reference point of the orbiting polygon by a black dot. This is used to trace the loops of the no-fit polygon (which we number).

The improved algorithm can cope with complex cases and is given an implementation in detail. The proposed concept of a touching group can simplify the judging process when recognizing the potential translation vector for an orbital polygon. In addition, the generation of the no-fit polygon only involves three main steps based on the proposed concept. The proposed algorithm has a mechanism that searches other start positions to generate a complete no-fit polygon for handling complex cases. To improve the efficiency, many acceleration strategies have been proposed, such as point exclusion strategy and point inclusion test. The robust and efficient performance of the algorithm is tested by well-known benchmark instances and degenerate and complex cases, such as holes, interlocking concavities and jigsaw-type pieces. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can produce complete no-fit polygons for complex cases, and acceleration strategies can reduce the creation time of no-fit polygon on benchmark instances by more than sixteen percent on average.\nKeywords:\n[no-fit polygon](https://www.mdpi.com/search?q=no-fit+polygon);[irregular packing problem](https://www.mdpi.com/search?q=irregular+packing+problem);[sliding algorithm](https://www.mdpi.com/search?q=sliding+algorithm);[cutting](https://www.mdpi.com/search?q=cutting);[configuration space obstacle](https://www.mdpi.com/search?q=configuration+space+obstacle)\nMSC:\n90; 68; 51\n## 1. Introduction\nIn the field of cutting and packing problems, there is a kind of problem known as the two-dimensional (2D) irregular packing problem or the nesting problem. It is commonly encountered in many industries and applications, such as metal sheet cutting [1,2], leather [3], clothing [4], paper [5] and spatial arrangement [6]. Through excellent algorithms to optimize the packing, even a one percent increase in the material utilization rate will save lots of resource costs for enterprises and generate huge economic benefits for the whole society. Despite the many practical applications and benefits, the problem has received relatively little attention in the literature when compared to the regular packing problem [7,8,9]. One of the main reasons is that researchers have to deal with the geometry problem, which is the first obstacle they encounter. This means that satisfying the constraint of having all irregular pieces without overlapping is much harder than regular pieces.\nDirect trigonometry involving line intersection and point inclusion testing is the classic method to identify the positional relationship between two polygons. However, the optimization algorithms will become inefficient when it adopts this method, which results in the slightly poor performance of the algorithms. The alternative used in irregular packing problems is the no-fit polygon (NFP), which is also used in the field of engineering and robot motion planning and the aircraft parking stand allocation problem [10]. The no-fit polygon facilitates the research of irregular packing problems [11,12,13,14]. It is an increasingly popular option since it is more efficient than direct trigonometry, particularly when using an iterative search. Determining whether polygons overlap, touch, or are separated only needs to conduct a simple test to identify whether the reference point is inside the NFP. Essentially, the no-fit polygon describes the region in which two polygons intersect. The computational efficiency gained by utilizing this method is very attractive. Hence, it is important to develop an algorithm for creating NFP for the research of irregular packing problems. The algorithm can enrich the application in 2D geometrical computer software.\nHowever, there are few published works on algorithms for generating NFP. Note the fact that developing a robust geometry library is still needed, and this task is very time-consuming and difficult. Furthermore, it is difficult to develop a robust NFP generator because of the complexity of irregular piece shapes. Thus, we propose an improved sliding algorithm for the generation of NFP and give an implementation in detail of our algorithm. Such an algorithm can become good preparation for applying more strategies to solve the irregular packing problem. For instance, in the work published by Costa et al. [15], if the NFP algorithm is efficient, it can directly calculate the new merged piece instead of approximating by one already computed because of this time-consuming operation. In other words, the more efficient the algorithm is, the better.\nThe proposed algorithm only involves two simple geometric stages. The first is generating the external NFP between two polygons, which includes three main steps: finding the touching group, determining the translation vector from all touching groups and computing the translation distance. The second stage is searching on the unvisited edges to determine whether there is a feasible starting point that can be found. If the starting point is available, then return to the first stage to generate the NFP.\nThe contributions of this study are:\n* To address the problem of the efficient and robust creation of the no-fit polygon;\n* To propose an improved sliding algorithm and provide a detailed implementation;\n* To present the concept of touching group, resulting in the number of cases to consider being reduced by half when determining the feasible translation vector;\n* To develop many acceleration strategies to improve the algorithm\u2019s efficiency, such as the point exclusion strategy, the right side test, and the point inclusion test;\n* To assess the performance of the proposed alg...",

The NFP has in recent years become an important tool for handling the geometric calculations for two-dimensional irregular shape nesting problems. Its value lies in reducing the computational complexity of detecting whether two polygons overlap. The proposed NFP generator is based on the novel concept of trace line segments that are derived from the interaction of the two-component polygons. The complete set of the trace line segments contain all the boundary edges of the NFP and some internal points that need to be discarded. Algorithms for deriving the trace line segments, efficiently determining those segments that form the boundary of the NFP and the identification of holes and degenerate cases are described.\n\nKeywords:\n\n- [cutting stock problem](https://www.tandfonline.com/keyword/cutting+stock+problem)\n- [nesting](https://www.tandfonline.com/keyword/nesting)\n- [nofit polygon](https://www.tandfonline.com/keyword/nofit+polygon)\n- [trace line segment](https://www.tandfonline.com/keyword/trace+line+segment)\n- [index algorithm](https://www.tandfonline.com/keyword/index+algorithm)\n\n## Log in via your institution\n\n[Access through your institution](https://www.tandfonline.com/action/ssostart?redirectUri=%2Fdoi%2Ffull%2F10.1057%2Fpalgrave.jors.2602255)\n\n## Log in to Taylor & Francis Online\n\n[Log in](javascript:void(0);)\n\n[Shibboleth](https://www.tandfonline.com/action/ssostart?redirectUri=%2Fdoi%2Ffull%2F10.1057%2Fpalgrave.jors.2602255)\n\n## Log in to Taylor & Francis Online\n\nUsernamePassword\n\n[Forgot password?](https://www.tandfonline.com/action/requestResetPassword?redirectUri=%2Fdoi%2Ffull%2F10.1057%2Fpalgrave.jors.2602255)\n\nKeep me logged in (not suitable for shared devices).\n\n_You will otherwise be logged out automatically, after a limited period, and will need to log in again._\n\n[Log in](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1057/palgrave.jors.2602255)\n\n## Restore content access\n\n[Restore content access for purchases made as guest](https://www.tandfonline.com/action/showRestoreContentAccess)\n\n[Purchase options \\*](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1057/palgrave.jors.2602255#purchasePanel) [Save for later](https://www.tandfonline.com/action/saveItem?doi=10.1057/palgrave.jors.2602255) [Item saved, go to cart](https://www.tandfonline.com/action/showCart)\n\nPDF download + Online access\n\n- 48 hours access to article PDF & online version\n- Article PDF can be downloaded\n- Article PDF can be printed\n\nUSD 61.00\n[Add to cart](https://www.tandfonline.com/action/addToCart?id=S&TAP_N_2014-S&T ARTICLE PURCHASE USD 2024-ELECTRONIC-USD-10.1057/PALGRAVE.JORS.2602255-619657)\n\nPDF download + Online access -

The detection of intersections is a critical operation within the irregular two-dimensional stock-cutting problem (also known as \u201cnesting\u201d), which aims to place shapes onto sheets of material so that the material is utilised as efficiently as possible and the waste (or trim loss) is reduced. The problem forms an important process within many real-world manufacturing industries such as metalworking, automotive production, aerospace, clothing and conservatory manufacture, and others. If manufacturers can reduce their costs by utilising raw materials more effectively, this can directly translate into increased profit margins or greater competitiveness within the marketplace. Moreover, there are significant environmental benefits to be gained. Several methods have been proposed to calculate no-fit polygons, but most, if not all, can only operate on geometry that consists of line segments. This paper extends the orbital sliding method of calculating no-fit polygons to enable it to handle arcs and then shows the resultant no-fit polygons being utilised successfully on the two-dimensional irregular packing problem. As far as the authors are aware, this is the first time that a no-fit polygon algorithm has been able to handle arcs robustly without decomposing to their line approximations. The modification of the authors' previously published packing algorithm to utilise the proposed no-fit polygon approach yields solutions of excellent quality (including several best-known) on well-established literature benchmark problems after only a few minutes. The authors believe that the success of the packing strategy and the line and arc no-fit polygon algorithm make this approach a serious candidate for use in real-world production environments.\n## Suggested Citation\n* E.

When\nthe pieces or the containers have irregular outline, the problem is classified as a Nesting problem. The\ngeometrical challenges of the Nesting problem are addressed by focusing on the geometric aspect of the\n2D pieces and containers involved. The challenges of the geometrical component are mainly derived\nfrom the complexity of the pieces, due to high number of vertices, which is common when dealing with\nreal world scenarios. This complexity is challenging for current algorithms to process efficiently and\neffectively, leading to high computational cost and less satisfactory results, particularly when dealing\nwith overlap verification operations. Usually, when tackling Nesting problems, the overlap verification\nprocess between two objects is done through the use of a structure known as No-Fit-Polygon (NFP).\nIn this work, the generation of the NFP is achieved through a simple algorithm which produces\na simplified shape while reducing numerical precision errors and fully representing the region that\nforms the NFP including positions with perfect fits.\n1 Introduction\nMany problems that arise in several real world scenarios require the placement of pieces inside a container\n(or cutting pieces from a large object) without overlap and while aiming to minimize wasted space by\nachieving a compact configuration. If one of these problems deals with irregular pieces or containers\nit is classified as Nesting problem, which is also known as an Irregular Piece Packing problem. This\nproblem requires an adequate geometric representation of its objects with great accuracy, which usually\ngenerates a significant amount of geometric information (vertices, pixels, etc), creating difficulties for\ncurrent algorithms. One of the main challenges in the geometrical component of the Nesting problem is\nensuring the non-overlap and correct containment of the pieces, while maintaining an acceptable level of\ncomputational efficiency.\nThe overlap verification in Nesting problems is usually achieved by using a geometrical structure\nknown as No-Fit-Polygon (NFP). This structure is a set of feasible placement locations of one polygon\nrelative to another, that allows specifying the regions and placement locations where pieces do not overlap.\nIn this paper, an algorithm is presented that generates the NFP with a reduced number of geometrical\ncomponents that define it, while using a simplified process that deals with numerical precision problems.\nThis improves the quality of the NFP while also reducing the overhead cost of overlap verification.\nThis paper is organized in several sections, being this one the introduction. The remainder of this\nsection contains the motivation for this work and main contributions. The following section, the second,\npresent a literature review, making reference to some approaches used generate the NFP focusing on\nNesting requirements. The third section contains a description of our approach, while the fourth presents\nalternative applications for the proposed algorithm followed by fifth section with the conclusions and\nfuture work.\n\u2217This research was partially supported by Project TEC4Growth - RL iMAN - Intelligence for Advanced Manufacturing\nSystems (NORTE-01-0145-FEDER-000020)\n\u2020Electronic address: pedro.f.rocha@inesctec.pt; pfr@isep.ipp.pt\n1\narXiv:1903.11139v1 [cs.CG] 26 Mar 2019\n1.1 Motivation\nThe proposed approach addresses the challenges of NFP generation, dealing with numerical precision\nproblems and generating a NFP with a reduced amount of geometric components while maintaining its\nrepresentation quality. Since the NFP is extensively used in approaches addressing Nesting problems,\nimproving it leads to computational efficiency gains and possible improvements in solution quality in\ncases where a complete NFP representation was not previously used.\nImproving the efficiency of the geometrical component leads to more resources being devoted to\naddressing the combinatorial component of the Nesting problem, which can enable the use of new ap\u0002proaches, and reaching higher quality solutions.\nThe improvement of current geometric overlap verification methods has a relevant impact on many\nscientific fields where similar problems arise, considering both economic and environmental aspects.\n1.2 Contribution\nIn many real world scenarios, such as industrial applications that deal with leather, furniture, metallurgy,\nshipbuilding, sheet metal cutting, plastics, and others, arise problems that require placing a set of pieces\ninto a container, in the most efficient non-overlapping configuration that minimizes wasted space. These\nproblems require dealing with geometrical aspects derived from the structure of the pieces and their\nrelative position inside the container, which must dealt with effectiveness and efficiently, while managing\nthe trade off between solution quality and computational cost.\nThis work has a relevant impact in several industries and scientific fields, at various levels, wher\u0002ever similar problems arise, producing benefits of economic (such as cost reduction) and environmental\n(less waste, energy and raw material consumption) importance. It provides an algorithm that is simple\nto implement, and generates overlap verification structures based on No-Fit-Polygons that are very ro\u0002bust. This has a significant impact by improving current approaches and opening new research paths in\npreviously underdeveloped areas such as 3D irregular packing.\n2 Literature Review\nThe placement of irregular items in the most efficient placement positions inside a container is heavily\ndependent on the geometrical structures that are used. The items cannot overlap and must completely\nfit inside the container. In the literature one can find approaches that are based on distinct geometric\nrepresentations such as grids, circles, direct trigonometry, phi-functions and No-Fit-Polygons (NFP). In\n[Bennell and Oliveira, 2008] can be found an introduction to these different representations focusing\nspecifically on Nesting problems.\nThe NFP has been a commonly used approach due to its increased efficiency compared to direct\ntrigonometry, having the benefit of being built directly from the edges of the polygons that represent the\nreal objects ([Bennell and Oliveira, 2008]).\n2.1 The No-Fit-Polygon\nThe NFP is a collection of all feasible placement locations of a polygon relative to another. It transforms\nthe overlap verification process between two polygons into the overlap verification between a polygon\nand a vertex, which is more computationally efficient. Another benefit is that the NFP can be generated\nat a pre-processing phase, but only for a reduced set of possible piece orientations. In situations where\ncontinuous rotations are advantageous, this approach is not adequate due to its significant computational\ncost generating the NFP for every new orientation of the pieces. One drawback of this approach is also the\ndifficulty in developing a robust approach to generating the NFP from pairs of generic irregular shapes,\ndue to emergence of degenerate cases. When the NFP is generated between a piece and the container, or\nhole, it is known as the Inner-Fit-Polygon (IFP). An example of a NFP and IFP generated by a sliding\nalgorithm can be seen in Fig. 1 and an example of its degenerate cases can be seen in Fig. 2.\n2.2 No-Fit-Polygon Generation\nIn the literature, there are three main approaches dedicated to generate the NFP. They are based on\na Sliding Algorithm, Slope Diagrams or Minkowsky Sum and Polygonal Decomposition. There is also\nanother approach that specifies ...",

Previously, the no-fit polygon (NFP) has not been widely applied\nbecause of the perception that it is difficult to implement and because of the lack of generic approaches that can cope with\nall problem cases without specific case-by-case handling. This paper introduces a robust orbital method for the creation of\nno-fit polygons which does not suffer from the typical problem cases found in the other approaches from the literature.\nFurthermore, the algorithm only involves two simple geometric stages so it is easily understood and implemented. We\ndemonstrate how the approach handles known degenerate cases such as holes, interlocking concavities and jigsaw type\npieces and we give generation times for 32 irregular packing benchmark problems from the literature, including real world\ndatasets, to allow further comparison with existing and future approaches.\n\u0002 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Introduction\nThe irregular two-dimensional variant of the cutting and packing problem impacts upon several important\nmanufacturing industries such as textiles, plastics, metal cutting and others. These problems usually consist of\na number of irregular pieces that are to be placed onto one or more sheets of material in the most efficient\nlayout possible, so that all pieces are assigned and do not overlap. Additionally, there are usually rotational\nconstraints enforced on the pieces due to the physical properties of the problem such as grain on the material,\npatterns on textiles and the cutting technology being employed. Sometimes rotational constraints may be used\nfor non-physical reasons such as to restrict pieces to a finite set of rotations thus simplifying layout construc\u0002tion procedures and allowing for faster solutions to be obtained.

Whitwell).\nEuropean Journal of Operational Research 179 (2007) 27\u201349\nwww.elsevier.com/locate/ejor\nhas been shown to be NP hard and is therefore intrinsically difficult to solve (Garey and Johnson, 1979). There\nhave been many different strategies for producing solutions to the irregular stock cutting problem. These\ninclude linear programming approaches, heuristic placement methods, metaheuristic guided search techniques\nand other novel approaches such as the iterative jostling of pieces (Dowsland et al., 1998). Survey papers can\nbe found in (Dowsland and Dowsland, 1992; Sweeney and Paternoster, 1992; Dyckhoff, 1990). However, the\nfeature that connects all of the approaches is that they are all required to cope with the geometry of the prob\u0002lem. This can be especially complicated when highly irregular shapes are used which may include holes or con\u0002cavities. The implementation of robust and efficient geometry routines can be laborious and can often take\nconsiderably longer than the packing strategies themselves. In particular, the geometry must handle all of\nthe interactions between shapes such as detecting whether two shapes are overlapping and calculating the\ntranslation distance required in a given direction so that the overlap is resolved. As we show in the following\nsection, although these tests can be implemented using trigonometric techniques, the no-fit polygon represents\na considerably more efficient solution.\nWhilst the generation of the no-fit polygon is academically challenging, it is a \u2018tool\u2019 and not a \u2018solution\u2019 and\nthis is perhaps one of the reasons why there are many publications in the literature which state that the no-fit\npolygon is used but which provide relatively little or no details on its implementation. In this paper we con\u0002centrate specifically on the no-fit polygon and provide an overview of the previous techniques that have been\nused for its creation. Furthermore, we describe and provide full implementation details for a new robust orbi\u0002tal approach that can cope with the traditional problem cases that many other approaches cannot handle.\nHopefully this will help in the further dissemination of the benefits of using the no-fit polygon (as opposed\nto traditional trigonometry based approaches) within both the industrial and the academic communities.\n2. The no-fit polygon \u2013 an overview\nIn this section we describe the functionality of the no-fit polygon and we compare it to the more traditional\ntrigonometric based overlap and intersection tests. We also give brief overviews of the many techniques that\nhave been used to generate no-fit polygons within the previous literature.\n2.1. The no-fit polygon\nThe first application of no-fit polygon techniques within the field of cutting and packing was presented by\nArt (1966), although the term \u2018\u2018shape envelop\u2019\u2019 was used. It was ten years later that the term \u2018\u2018no-fit polygon\u2019\u2019\nwas introduced by Adamowicz and Albano who approached the irregular stock cutting problem by using no\u0002fit polygons to pack shapes together using their minimum enclosing rectangles (Adamowicz and Albano,\n1976). The term \u2018\u2018configuration space obstacle\u2019\u2019 is often used to denote the NFP within the field of engineering\nand robot motion planning but the term has also been used with respect to cutting and packing in (Cuningh\u0002ame-Green, 1989). The \u2018\u2018hodograph\u2019\u2019 is often used to describe the no-fit polygon within the mathematics com\u0002munity (Stoyan and Ponomarenko, 1977; Scheithauer and Terno, 1993; Bennell et al., 2001). The main\nfunction of the no-fit polygon is to describe the region in which two polygons intersect. The following example\ngives an overview of the NFP construct.\nGiven two polygons, A and B, the no-fit polygon can be found by tracing one shape around the boundary\nof another. One of the polygons remains fixed in position and the other traverses around the fixed polygon\u2019s\nedges whilst ensuring that the polygons always touch but never intersect. Throughout this paper we adopt the\nconvention of the first polygon being fixed and the second being the traversing/orbiting polygon. Therefore,\nwhen polygon B traces around the fixed polygon A, the resulting no-fit polygon is denoted by NFPAB. In order\nto create the NFPAB object we must choose a reference point from B which will be traced as B moves around\nA. In our implementations we use the first vertex, within the shape vertex list, as the reference point (see\nFig. 1). The reference point can be any arbitrary point providing it follows the movements of the orbiting poly\u0002gon. It is also important to maintain the relative position of the reference point with respect to polygon B as\nthis is required when using the NFP to test for overlap.\nIn order to test whether polygon B overlaps polygon A we use NFPAB and B\u2019s reference point. If polygon B\nis positioned so that its reference point is inside the polygon NFPAB then it overlaps with polygon A. If the\n28 E.K. Burke et al. / European Journal of Operational Research 179 (2007) 27\u201349\nreference point is on the boundary of NFPAB then polygon B touches polygon A. Finally, if the reference point\nis outside of NFPAB then polygons A and B do not overlap or touch (see Fig. 2). The no-fit polygon is used\nwithin the following papers from the literature (Grinde and Cavalier, 1995; Ramkumar, 1996; Cheng and Rao,...",

The NFP has in recent years become an important tool for handling the geometric calculations for two-dimensional irregular shape nesting problems. Its value lies in reducing the computational complexity of detecting whether two polygons overlap.

The NFP has in recent years become an important tool for handling the geometric calculations for two-dimensional irregular shape nesting problems. Its value lies in reducing the computational complexity of detecting whether two polygons overlap. The proposed NFP generator is based on the novel concept of trace line segments that are derived from the interaction of the two-component polygons. The complete set of the trace line segments contain all the boundary edges of the NFP and some internal points that need to be discarded. Algorithms for deriving the trace line segments, efficiently determining those segments that form the boundary of the NFP and the identification of holes and degenerate cases are described\nThis record has no associated files available for download.\n## More information\nPublished date:September 2007\n[Learn more about Management research](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/business-school/research/index.page)\n## Identifiers\nLocal EPrints ID:56836\nURI:http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/id/eprint/56836\nDOI:[doi:10.1057/palgrave.jors.2602255](http://dx.doi.org/10.1057/palgrave.jors.2602255)\nISSN:0160-5682\nPURE UUID:60eee1e7-868d-443f-a446-ff8429c708f3\n## Catalogue record\nDate deposited:06 Aug 2008\nLast modified:15 Mar 2024 11:03\n## Export record\nASCII CitationAtomBibTeXData Cite XMLDublin CoreDublin CoreEP3 XMLEndNoteHTML CitationHTML CitationHTML ListJSONMETSMODSMPEG-21 DIDLOpenURL ContextObjectOpenURL ContextObject in SpanRDF+N-TriplesRDF+N3RDF+XMLRIOXX2 XMLReferReference ManagerSimple Metadata## Altmetrics\n## Share this record\n[Share this on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/56836/)[Share this on Twitter](<https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=The irregular nesting problem - a new approach for nofit polygon calculation+https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/56836/>)[Share this on Weibo](<http://service.weibo.com/share/share.php?url=The irregular nesting problem - a new approach for nofit polygon calculation+https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/56836/>)\n## Contributors\nAuthor:H.Y.
