      "text": "Asymmetric solutions are often considered better than symmetric solutions in polygon packing optimization because they can lead to more efficient use of space and higher packing densities. Symmetric solutions tend to impose regular, uniform arrangements that may leave unused gaps and underutilized areas within the container. In contrast, asymmetric arrangements allow for more flexible placement of polygons, accommodating irregular shapes and exploiting available space more effectively ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.08523v1); [ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0377221715007304)). This flexibility can result in packing solutions that minimize wasted space, which is crucial in applications requiring optimal utilization of limited or costly resources.\n\nFurthermore, the literature indicates that asymmetric polygons with maximum area are studied to understand how irregular shapes can be optimally packed, often achieving better space utilization than symmetric configurations ([ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0377221715007304)). Asymmetric solutions tend to avoid the constraints of uniformity, allowing for arrangements that adapt to the specific geometry of the polygons and the container, thus improving the overall efficiency of the packing process ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.08523v1)). This advantage is especially relevant in industrial and logistical contexts where maximizing the number of items or minimizing container size directly impacts cost and operational efficiency.",

Given _n_ diameters of a circle and a positive integer _k_ < _n_, this paper addresses the problem of computing a maximum area asymmetric _k_-gon having as vertices _k_ < _n_ endpoints of the given diameters. The study of this type of polygons is motivated by ethnomusiciological applications.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThere exist a number of significant links between music and Operations Research (OR) (Chew and Raphael, 2010). In fact, due its versatility in the mathematical modeling of optimization problems, operations researchers have tackled problems from many fields. Music (representation, analysis, composition, expressive performance, etc.) also presents rich application areas for OR techniques1. This article is an example of the opportunities that abound for operations researchers to make significant contributions in musicology.\n\nImagine that we are at a concert of salsa and we want to retain the intrinsic rhythmic pattern to dance appropriately. Then we should know the clave Son. The clave Son rhythm might be represented as the 16-bit binary sequence 1001001000101000 or, as usual for cyclic rhythms, by onsets represented as points on a circle as in Fig.\u00a01(c). In this geometric setting, the clave Son is associated to a pentagon whose vertices are selected on a circular lattice of 16 points. So, the clave Son is represented by a special selection of _k_ points on the circular lattice. This pattern has conquered our planet during the last half of the 20th century. But, what properties does this particular selection have? Notice that the polygon that represents the clave Son does not contain two antipodal points on the circle and moreover, it is easy to prove that this configuration is just the pentagon of maximum area without antipodal vertices (this later property produces a certain kind of asymmetry). Musicians have showed interest in finding similar patterns. Ethnomusicology is the discipline encompassing various approaches to the study of music that emphasize its cultural context. More specifically, Ethnomathematics is a domain consisting of the study of mathematical ideas shared by orally transmitted cultures. Such ideas are related to numeric, logic and spatial configurations (Ascher, 1998, Chemillier, 2002). Related to spacial configurations, the area is a useful measure of evenness of scales and rhythms in music theory (Arom, Thom, Tuckett, Boyd, Ligeti, 1991, Rappaport, 2007). Moreover, many musical traditions all over the world have asymmetric rhythmic patterns. For instance, the Aka Pygmies rhythmic pattern in Fig.\u00a01(b) has the so-called rhythmic oddity property discovered by (Arom et\u00a0al., 1991). A rhythm has the _rhythmic oddity_ property if when represented on a circle it does not contain two onsets (the black points in the Fig. (1) that lie diametrically opposite to each other. Thus, the property asserts that one cannot break the circle into two parts of equal length, whatever the chosen breaking point, as there is always one unit lacking on one side. This property produces a kind of perceptual asymmetry. The asymmetry of the pattern is to some extent intrinsic, in the sense that there exists no breaking point giving two parts of equal length. Note that the oddity property requires that the circle is divided into an even number of units. The notion of rhythmic oddity has received different mathematical treatments; see (Toussaint, 2010) for more details.\n\nAn algorithm for enumerating all the patterns satisfying the rhythmic oddity property has been proposed in (Chemillier and Truchet, 2003). Asymmetric rhythmics can also be found in the flamenco music of Spain (Fig.\u00a01(a)) and the clave Son in Cuba (Fig.\u00a01(c)). See (D\u00edaz-B\u00e1\u00f1ez, 2013, D\u00edaz-B\u00e1\u00f1ez, Farigu, G\u00f3mez, Rappaport, Toussaint, 2004), and (Toussaint, 2005), for a detailed study on the preference of these rhythms in their cultural contexts.\n\nInspired by these ideas, we introduce the following geometric problem:\n\n**Problem 1.1**\n\nGiven _n_ diameters (not necessarily equally spaced) in a circle and a positive integer _k_ < _n_, select _k_ endpoints of these diameters, no two of the same diameter, in such a way that their convex hull defines a _k_-gon of maximum area.\n\nLet us introduce some notation and related work. Let (p0,p0\u2032),\u2026,(pn\u22121,pn\u22121\u2032) be _n_ diameters of a given circle. Let S:={p0,p0\u2032,p1,p1\u2032,\u22ef,pn\u22121,pn\u22121\u2032} be an _antipodal set_ containing the 2 _n_ endpoints of the given diameters. A _sub-polygon_ (of _S_) is a convex polygon whose vertex set is a subset of _S_. An _antipodal polygon_ (on _S_) is a sub-polygon whose vertex set contains exactly one endpoint from each diameter (pi,pi\u2032) of _S_ (Aichholzer et\u00a0al., 2015). An _asymmetric polygon_ is a sub-polygon that...",

encrypting a message to secure it so that it\u2019s not readable to anyone and everyone.\u00a0This familiarity is not surprising given the multitude of use cases for encryption, which span everything from digital signatures and SSL certificates that secure websites to cryptocurrency like Bitcoin and[public key infrastructures (PKI)](https://www.keyfactor.com/resources/what-is-pki/).\nHowever, there\u2019s a lot more to cryptography that meets the eye. Cryptographic algorithms are defined, highly complex mathematical formulas that range in complexity, and the earliest ones pre-date modern technology.\nToday, there are two types of cryptography that get used often: symmetric and asymmetric cryptography. This article will explore the differences between these two types of cryptography,\u00a0 the pros and cons of each and common use cases for each approach.\n### What is Symmetric Cryptography?\nSymmetric cryptography uses mathematical permutations to encrypt a plain text message. It also uses the same mathematical permutation, known as a key, to decrypt messages.\nImportantly, the same plain text letter does not always come out the same in the encrypted message (e.g. \u201cSSS\u201d would not encrypt to three of the same characters), which makes it difficult to decode the encrypted message without the key.\nEven though it\u2019s difficult to decrypt messages without the key, the fact that this approach uses the same ke...",

That is the question.\n\nThere are two main forms of data encryption in use today: symmetric encryption and asymmetric encryption. Every day, when you're using your web browser, responding to emails, submitting website forms, and other activities, symmetric and asymmetric encryption processes are happening, sometimes unbeknownst to you. You may also be familiar with symmetric and asymmetric encryption because you have experience with OpenSSL, key management services, or maybe you've sent an encrypted email or encrypted a Microsoft Word or Adobe PDF file with a password before.\n\nIt's important to understand the differences between symmetric and asymmetric encryption and how these [security technologies](https://www.trentonsystems.com/blog/cybersecurity-technologies?hsLang=en-us) work in the everyday secure transfer of communications. You'll know what these terms mean when you see them, and you'll also be knowledgeable of how they work, their various iterations, aware of their capabilities, and know which is more advisable to implement with regard to securing and authenticating the origin of sensitive information.\n\nIn this blog post, we'll discuss the differences between symmetric and asymmetric encryption. At the end, we'll summarize these differences and discuss related encryption options for securing your sensitive data.\n\nGraphic: Symmetric encryption uses a single key to encrypt and decrypt information.\n\n### **What is symmetric encryption?**\n\nSymmetric encryption is a widely used data encryption technique whereby data is encrypted and decrypted using a single, secret cryptographic key.\n\nSpecifically, the key is used to encrypt plaintext - the data\u2019s pre-encryption or post-decryption state - and decrypt ciphertext - the data\u2019s post-encryption or pre-decryption state.\n\nSymmetric encryption is one of the most widely used encryption techniques and also one of the oldest, dating back to the days of the Roman Empire. Caesar\u2019s cipher, named after none other than Julius Caesar, who used it to encrypt his military correspondence, is a famous historical example of symmetric encryption in action.\n\nThe goal of symmetric encryption is to [secure sensitive information](https://www.trentonsystems.com/cybersecurity?hsLang=en-us). It\u2019s used daily in many major industries, including defense, aerospace, banking, health care, and other industries in which securing a person\u2019s, business\u2019, or organization\u2019s sensitive data is of the utmost importance.\n\nGraphic: This is an illustration of the symmetric encryption process.\n\n### **How does symmetric encryption work?**\n\nSymmetric encryption works by using either a stream cipher or block cipher to encrypt and decrypt data. A stream cipher converts plaintext into ciphertext one byte at a time, and a block cipher converts entire units, or blocks, of plaintext using a predetermined key length, such as 128, 192, or 256 bits.\n\nSenders and recipients using symmetric encryption to transfer data to each other must know the secret key to, in the case of senders, encrypt the data they intend to share with recipients, and in the case of recipients, decrypt and read the encrypted data the senders share with them, as well as encrypt any necessary responses.\n\nHere\u2019s a simplified example of symmetric encryption: if Claire, the sender, wants to send Jacqueline, the recipient, a confidential document, Claire would use the secret key to encrypt the file and send it to Jacqueline, who would be unable to read its contents until she entered the same key that Claire just used to encrypt the file. Conversely, if Jacqueline makes changes to the document and wishes to share them with Claire, she\u2019d use the same key to re-encrypt the file and send it back to Claire, who will use the same key to decrypt the file and access its contents, and the process repeats itself.\n\nNote that this is just an example used to simplify how symmetric encryption works. Symmetric encryption may be carried out manually or automatically.\n\nSymmetric encryption is not limited to the sharing of data between one sender and one recipient, however. Symmetrically encrypted information can be accessed by anyone \u2013 Claire, Jacqueline, their co-worker Frank, their boss, Jennifer, et al. \u2013 who knows the secret key. Therein lies the reason why concealing the shared cryptographic key from unauthorized parties is vital to the success of symmetric encryption and the integrity of symmetrically encrypted data.\n\nGraphic: Examples of symmetric encryption include the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and TLS/SSL protocol.\n\n### **What are some examples of symmetric encryption?**\n\nPopular examples of symmetric encryption include the:\n\n- Data Encryption Standard (DES)\n- Triple Data Encryption Standard (Triple DES)\n- Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)\n- International Data Encryption Algorithm (IDEA)\n- TLS/SSL protocol\n\nAES encryption, which uses block ciphers of 128, 192, or 256 bits to encrypt and decrypt data, is one of the most well-known and effective symmetric encryption techniques in use today. It would take billions of years to crack, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s used to secure sensitive information in government, healthcare, banking, and other industries. It is more secure than DES, Triple DES, and IDEA.\n\nDES encryption is now considered by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to be a legacy symmetric encryption algorithm because it has long been ineffective at safeguarding sensitive information from brute-force attacks. In fact, the NIST has withdrawn the standard entirely, and its more secure big brother, Triple DES encryption, will have the same fate. Although still in use today, Triple DES encryption is being withdrawn and disallowed by the NIST in 2023 because of mounting security concerns.\n\nIDEA encryption was developed as a replacement for DES in the 1990s, but AES was ultimately deemed more secure. The IDEA is now an open and free block-cipher algorithm, so anyone can use it, but it\u2019s generally considered to be obsolete and ineffective at securing sensitive information today. AES encryption is the gold standard for both purposes.\n\nTransport Layer Security (TLS), as well as its predecessor, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), uses symmetric encryption. Basically, when a client accesses a server, unique symmetric keys, called session keys, are generated. These session keys are used to encrypt and decrypt the data shared between the client and the server in that specific client-server session at that specific point in time. A new client-server session would generate new, unique session keys.\n\nTLS/SSL uses not only symmetric encryption but both symmetric and asymmetric encryption, to ensure the security of client-server sessions and the information exchanged within them.\n\nGraphic: Advantages of symmetric encryption include...",

As cybercrime continues to rise, it is more important than ever to protect sensitive data. Encryption is a vital tool in achieving this goal, transforming data into cipher text through a set of mathematical procedures known as an encryption algorithm. There are two main types of encryption: symmetric and asymmetric encryption.\nSymmetric encryption involves using a single secret key to encrypt and decrypt data, while asymmetric encryption uses a pair of keys \u2013a public key and a private key \u2013to encrypt and decrypt data. Although both methods are effective, there are significant differences between them. This article will provide a clear explanation of these differences and help readers understand which encryption technique is best suited for different use cases. Whether a beginner or an expert in cryptography, this guide will provide a comprehensive understanding of the key differences between symmetric and asymmetric encryption.\n### Key Takeaways\n* Encryption is essential for keeping data secure in the digital age.\n* Symmetric encryption uses a single secret key, while asymmetric encryption uses a pair of keys \u2013a public key and a private key.\n* Understanding the differences between symmetric and asymmetric encryption is crucial for choosing the right encryption technique for different use cases.## What is Symmetric Key Encryption?\nSymmetric key encryption, also known as symmetric cryptography, is a type of cryptography that uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt a message. This means that both the sender and the receiver of a message must have access to the same secret key to encode and decode it.\n### Benefits of Symmetric Encryption\nSymmetric encryption provides several benefits, including:\n* Security: Symmetric encryption provides strong security for data, as the same key is used for both encryption and decryption. Common symmetric encryption algorithms include Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), Data Encryption Standard (DES), and International Data Encryption Algorithm (IDEA). This makes it difficult for unauthorised users to access the data.\n* Speed: Symmetric encryption is generally faster than other types of encryption, as the same key is used for both encryption and decryption. This makes it a good choice for applications that require fast data encryption and decryption.\n* Efficiency: Symmetric encryption requires less processing power and resources to encrypt and decrypt data, which can save time and money.\n* Simplicity: Symmetric encryption is easy to implement and use, as it only requires a single key for both encryption and decryption. This makes it a popular choice for applications that require simple and straightforward encryption.\n* Compatibility: Symmetric encryption is widely used and supported by most software and hardware platforms, making it compatible with a wide range of systems and devices. This means that it can be easily integrated into existing applications and systems without requiring major modifications.\nHowever, the downside of symmetric encryption is that it can be less secure than asymmetric encryption. If the key falls into the wrong hands, the data can be compromised. Therefore, it is important to ensure that the key is kept secure and only shared with authorised users.\n## What is Public Key Cryptography?\nAsymmetric encryption, also known as asymmetric cryptography or public-key encryption, is a type of cryptography that uses a pair of encryption keys to encrypt and decrypt data. This encryption technique is more secure than symmetric encryption, as it makes it impossible for someone who does not have the private key to decrypt the data, even if they have the public key, a concept known as public key cryptography. Asymmetric encryption uses a pair of keys \u2013a public key and a private key \u2013to encrypt and decrypt data, enhancing data protection through the use of both public and private keys.\n### Benefits of Asymmetric Encryption\nAsymmetric encryption offers several benefits over other encryption techniques, including:\n* Security: Asymmetric encryption provides strong security for data, as the private key used for decryption is kept secret and not shared with anyone. This makes it difficult for unauthorized users to access the data encrypted with asymmetric keys.\n* Authentication: Asymmetric encryption can also be used for authentication, as the public key can be used to verify the identity of the sender of the message, and only the corresponding private key can decrypt it. This helps to prevent fraud and protect against malicious attacks.\n* Key distribution: Asymmetric encryption eliminates the need for a secure channel to distribute keys, as each user has a unique public-private key pair, and only the private key can decrypt messages encrypted with the public key. This makes it easier to distribute keys and manage access to encrypted data.\n* Non-repudiation: Asymmetric encryption provides non-repudiation, meaning that the sender of a message cannot deny having sent it, as the message can be traced back to their unique private key, and only the intended recipient&#8217;s public key can decrypt it.\n* Flexibility: Asymmetric encryption is flexible and can be used for a wide range of applications, including secure email communication, online banking transactions, and secure access to networks and systems, as long as the private key secret is maintained.\nOverall, asymmetric encryption provides strong security and authentication for data, and offers greater flexibility and key distribution options than symmetric encryption, as long as private keys are kept secure. As more applications make use of asymmetric encryption, it is likely that this powerful tool will become even more widely used.\n## The Differences Between Symmetric and Asymmetric Encryption\nSymmetric encryption uses the same key to both encrypt and decrypt data, while asymmetric encryption, also known as public key cryptography, uses two different keys for the same purpose. The encryption process for symmetric encryption involves a single key, whereas asymmetric encryption utilizes a pair of keys, enhancing data protection through the use of both a public and a private key. Symmetric encryption is faster and easier to use than asymmetric encryption, but it is less secure. If the key is compromised, the data can be easily decrypted. Asymmetric encryption, on the other hand, is more secure because even if one key is compromised, the data remains safe.\nAsymmetric encryption is slower and more complex to implement than symmetric encryption. Symmetric encryption is commonly used for encrypting large amounts of data, while asymmetric encryption is used for smaller amounts of data like email messages and digital signatures.\nIn summary, symmetric encryption is faster and easier to use, but less secure than asymmetric encryption. Asymmetric encryption is more secure, but slower and more complex to implement.\n## How is Each Type of Encryption Used?\nSymmetric and asymmetric encryption are two different types of encryption that are used in various applications.

      "text": "[Skip to main content](https://www.identifix.com/blogs/symmetric-vs-asymmetric-lift-which-is-right-for-your-shop/#main)\n\n# Symmetric vs Asymmetric Lift: Which Is Right for Your Shop?\n\n![](https://www.identifix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/shutterstock_1937673079-2048x1365.jpg)\n\nA lift is an invaluable tool your shop will use daily to help you scale your business. Yet, investing in a lift represents a significant investment. Therefore, it\u2019s important to review your options and determine which setup best suits your goals and ambitions.\n\nThe guide below explores the differences between the most popular two-post-style lifts: symmetric and asymmetric. This comprehensive review compares basic features, advantages and disadvantages, installation considerations, safety factors, maintenance tips, and common issues you may encounter with each design. As you review each style of lift, you\u2019ll discover what you need to know to make a more informed buying decision and what additional tools \u2013 like Identifix\u2019s suite of auto shop management products \u2013 prepare your shop for the challenges and success ahead.\n\n**The Benefits of Two-Post Car Lifts**\n\nSymmetric and asymmetric lifts are the most common two-post-style car lifts you\u2019ll find. As the name suggests, a two-post car lift has half the posts of a four-post lift and features a smaller footprint. However, both two-post and four-post car lifts are frame-engaging lifts, meaning they contact the vehicle\u2019s frame to lift it into the air.\n\nTwo-post lifts are common in shops with less space, like a [30\u00d740 shop two-post lift layout](https://www.identifix.com/blogs/30x40-shop-2-post-lift-layout-6-build-considerations/), for example. Unlike four-post lifts, they offer unobstructed access to the vehicle\u2019s wheels, which makes services like tire rotations, brake jobs, and suspension work much simpler. Although lifting a car with a two-post lift requires more attention to detail in placing the arms securely for a safe lift, those same arms offer adjustability in placing the lifting points where they\u2019re the safest and most beneficial, depending on what services you perform.\n\n**What is a Symmetric Lift?**\n\nThe dual posts of a symmetric two-post lift are directly opposite one another. From these posts extend four support arms of equal length, which angle inward toward the space between the two posts. The vehicle\u2019s weight is suspended between these two sets of arms, with each side holding about half the overall weight.\n\nSymmetric car lifts can hoist 10,000\u201320,000 pounds, depending on the specific model and the manufacturer\u2019s recommended lift weight. These two-post lifts are designed to handle heavier, longer-wheelbase vehicles, like SUVs and light-duty pickups. They\u2019re also ideal for rear-engine cars\u2014such as Porsches and older Volkswagens\u2014utility vans full of equipment, and crew-cab trucks.\n\nThe beauty of symmetric two-post is the ability to park a vehicle on the lift \u201cbackward.\u201d Symmetric lifts also have better drive-through clearance as long as the vehicle fits through the space between the posts. Most symmetric car lifts are also available with an overhead beam or floor plate, so you can tailor the design to fit your space.\n\n**Symmetric Lift: Pros and Cons**\n\nEquivalent to the standard two-post lift layout, symmetric lifts offer several advantages and disadvantages. Explore the pros and cons of symmetric car lifts below to help you decide which style is best for your application.\n\n**Pros**\n\n- Even weight distribution\n- Greater distance between pillars than asymmetric lifts\n- Identical-length arms allow for precise lift-point placement\n- Lifts a variety of vehicles, from small hatchbacks to light-duty pickups and cargo vans\n- Vehicle orientation is irrelevant (can be driven or backed onto the lift)\n- Higher weight capacity than an asymmetric lift\n\n**Cons**\n\n- It is harder to access the interior when the car is lifted\n- The design makes it more challenging to lift longer and/or unbalanced vehicles\n- Slightly more space is necessary for the lift itself compared to an asymmetric lift\n\n**What is an Asymmetric Lift?**\n\nAsymmetric two-post lifts feature dual columns offset at a 30-degree angle, which shrinks its overall footprint. The center of gravity shifts from halfway between the two posts horizontally to the intersection of the angle posts, slightly further back. An asymmetric lift also features four arms, but they\u2019re of unequal length, with the front two measuring shorter than the rear two.\n\nInstead of 50/50, the weight distribution on any asymmetric lift is roughly 30/70, with more weight held by the rear arms than the front. The weight capacity of asymmetric lifts varies from 7,000 to 10,000 pounds. Best of all, asymmetric car lifts provide greater clearance in accessing the interior, even when the vehicle is on the lift.\n\n**The Pros and Cons of Asymmetric Lifts**\n\nAs you review the advantages and disadvantages of symmetric and asymmetric car lifts, which style better aligns with your shop layout? Consider which lift features enable you to streamline daily operations and maximize productivity while enhancing efficiency.\n\n**Pros**\n\n- Ideal for longer, front-heavy, and unbalanced vehicles\n- Offers better access to car interior, even while it\u2019s raised in the air\n- The smaller overall footprint maximizes shop space\n\n**Cons**\n\n- Not ideal for cars with short wheelbases\n- Complicates balancing heavier vehicles with unequal weight distribution\n- Lower weight capacity than a symmetric lift\n- Greater chance for improper positioning\n\n**Which is Right for Your Shop?**\n\nNow that you\u2019ve explored the similarities and differences between symmetric and asymmetric car lifts, it\u2019s time to break down which type best suits your shop. Think about the types of vehicles you\u2019ll be servicing using the lift you\u2019ll purchase, specifically their overall length, wheelbase, and weight. Consider your available shop space and if angled lift towers will increase your rate of return.\n\nSymmetric lifts excel in lifting everything from large, heavy vehicles to those with a shorter wheelbase. Unless you\u2019re consistently working on light-duty pickups and laden-down utility vans, it\u2019s unlikely you\u2019ll max out the weight capacity of this style of two-post lift. However, symmetric lifts do create a pinch point if you need to access the driver\u2019s seat while in the air.\n\nAlternatively, asymmetric lifts create clearance to enable quick access to the interior. These offset two-post lifts also take up slightly less space and better accommodate unbalanced vehicles. Yet the asymmetric lift\u2019s lower weight capacity and increased chances of getting the weight distribution wrong can be a hurdle for technicians who lack experience with this type of lift.\n\n**Invest in Your Shop\u2019s Success with the Identifix Product Suite**\n\nThe best lift for your auto shop setup helps you safeguard against accidents, optimize the available space, and enhance your productivity.

      "text": "# Difference Between Symmetric and Asymmetric Cryptography\n\n## What is the Difference Between Asymmetric and Symmetric Cryptography?\n\nCryptography plays a crucial role in [Public Key Infrastructure](https://www.nexusgroup.com/what-is-public-key-infrastructure/) (PKI) by ensuring secure communication and data protection. In PKI, cryptographic techniques are used to encrypt data, authenticate users, and verify the integrity of information.\n\nThere are two main types of cryptography: symmetric and asymmetric. Understanding what is the difference between symmetric and asymmetric cryptography is essential for choosing the right security approach for your needs.\n\nIn this blog, we will explore these two cryptographic methods, their pros and cons, and their key differences. Nexus [Smart ID](https://www.nexusgroup.com/smart-id/nexus-smart-id-pki/) PKI provides a comprehensive solution for managing digital identities and securing communications through robust cryptographic techniques.\n\n## What is symmetric cryptography?\n\nSymmetric cryptography, also known as private key cryptography, involves the use of a single key for both encryption and decryption. The same key is used to turn plaintext into ciphertext and revert it into plaintext. The private key must be shared between the sender and the receiver, which requires a secure method of key exchange.\n\n## Pros and cons of symmetric cryptography\n\nSymmetric cryptography has both strengths and weaknesses. Understanding these can help in deciding when and where to use this method.\n\n### Pros of symmetric cryptography\n\nOne of the significant advantages of symmetric cryptography is its speed. Because the same key is used for both encryption and decryption, the process is much faster compared to asymmetric cryptography. This makes it suitable for encrypting large volumes of data.\n\nThe algorithms used in symmetric cryptography are straightforward, making them easier to implement and understand. This simplicity also contributes to its efficiency and reliability.\n\nSymmetric cryptography is secure, but only when the key is kept secret. With proper key management and secure key exchange methods, it can protect sensitive data.\n\n### Cons of symmetric cryptography\n\nThe main drawback of symmetric cryptography is the need for a shared secret key. Both the sender and receiver must have the same key, which can be challenging to manage and exchange securely. If the key is intercepted during exchange, the data can be compromised.\n\nScalability is another issue with symmetric cryptography. As the number of users increases, the number of keys needed also grows exponentially. This can make key management complex and increase the risks of data breaches.\n\n## What is asymmetric cryptography?\n\nAsymmetric cryptography, also called [public key cryptography](https://www.nexusgroup.com/how-does-public-key-cryptography-work/), uses a mathematically connected public and private key. The public key is shared openly and is used to encrypt the message or data. Data encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted with the corresponding private key, which needs to be kept confidential.\n\n## Pros and cons of asymmetric cryptography\n\nAsymmetric cryptography offers a few advantages over symmetric cryptography, but it also comes with its own set of challenges.\n\n### Pros of asymmetric cryptography\n\nHere are some of the benefits of public key cryptography:\n\n#### Security\n\nAsymmetric cryptography offers enhanced security. Since the private key does not need to be shared, you reduce the risk of key compromise during the exchange. This makes asymmetric cryptography ideal for secure communication over untrusted networks.\n\n#### Scalability\n\nAsymmetric cryptography allows for easy scalability. As your business grows, you can manage more devices and users without the need for complex key exchanges to [secure IoT infrastructure](https://www.nexusgroup.com/how-to-build-a-secure-iot-infrastructure/). This flexibility makes it well-suited for expanding operations.\n\n#### Non-repudiation\n\nAsymmetric cryptography also provides non-repudiation. Since the private key is unique to the owner, data signed with a private key can be verified by anyone with the corresponding public key, proving the origin of the data. This ensures accountability and trust in your communications.\n\n### Cons of asymmetric cryptography\n\nThe speed of asymmetric cryptography can be challenging. The process of encryption and decryption is much slower compared to symmetric cryptography, making it less suitable for encrypting large amounts of data.\n\nThe complexity of the algorithms used in asymmetric cryptography also makes it more resource-intensive. It requires more computational power, which can be a limitation if your business has limited resources.\n\n## What are the differences between symmetric and asymmetric cryptography?\n\nThe main differences between symmetric and asymmetric cryptography lie in their key usage and algorithms.\n\n### Cryptographic key usage\n\nThe core difference in cryptography methods lies in key usage. Symmetric cryptography uses the same key for both encryption and decryption, making it faster but dependent on secure key exchange. Asymmetric cryptography uses a public and private key pair, enhancing security by eliminating the need for a shared secret key.\n\n### Algorithms\n\nSymmetric cryptography uses algorithms like AES, DES, 3DES, and RC4, which are efficient and fast. These algorithms rely on a single key for both encryption and decryption.\n\n- **AES:** The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is newer and widely used for securing sensitive data. It is efficient and can handle large amounts of data quickly. You can rely on AES for strong and fast encryption.\n\n- **DES:** The Data Encryption Standard (DES) was one of the earliest symmetric algorithms. While it\u2019s now considered less secure due to its shorter key length, it laid the foundation for modern encryption techniques. DES is simple but not recommended for high-security applications.\n\n- **3DES:** Triple DES (3DES) is an improvement over DES, applying the DES algorithm three times to each data block. This enhances security but makes the process slower. It\u2019s more secure than DES but less efficient than AES.\n\n- **RC4:** RC4 is a stream cipher known for its simplicity and speed. It is commonly used in applications where quick encryption and decryption are needed, such as the encryption of traffic to and from SSL websites.\n\nAsymmetric cryptography uses algorithms like RSA, Diffie-Hellman, and ECC, which rely on a pair of keys. These algorithms are more complex and slower but provide enhanced security and non-repudiation.\n\n- **RSA:** The RSA algorithm (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) is widely used for secure data transmission. RSA works by generating two large prime numbers and using them to create the key pair.\u00a0 RSA provides strong security, making it suitable for sensitive data.\n\n- **Diffie-Hellman:** The Diffie-Hellman algorithm allows two parties to establish a shared secret key over an untrusted network. It is used for secure key exchange, ensuring that the key is not exposed during transmission.\n\n- **ECC:** Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) offers strong security with smaller key sizes, making it efficient and powerful. ECC works by using the mathematical properties of elliptic curves to create a secure and efficient cryptographic system.\n\n## FAQs about symmetric and asymmetric cryptography\n\n### Is symmetric cryptography faster than asymmetric cryptography?\n\nYes, symmetric cryptography is generally faster than asymmetric cryptography. This is because it uses simpler algorithms and a single key for both encryption and decryption, resulting in quicker processing times.\n\n### What are some common algorithms used in symmetric cryptography?\n\nCommon algorithms used in symmetric cryptography include Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), Data Encryption Standard (DES), and Triple DES (3DES). These algorithms are known for their speed and efficie...",

One particular category of these packing problems is\ntwo-dimensional packing, which is encountered in everyday scenarios like arranging items\non a shelf and in industrial applications such as cutting cookies from rolled-out dough\nor manufacturing sets of tiles from standard-sized panels made of wood, glass, or metal.\nAnother intriguing example involves cutting fabric pieces for clothing production. In this\ncase, the pieces often cannot be rotated freely, as they must adhere to a desired pattern\nin the final product, which is tailored of multiple elements. The widespread applicability\nof two-dimensional packing problems has led to a surge of interest in designing efficient\nalgorithms to address them. In this paper, we follow the line of research and study the\nproblem of packing convex polygons without rotations in various settings depending on the\ntype of containers used.\nPast research focusing on theoretical considerations of two-dimensional packings mainly\nconcentrates on the scenario when all objects are axis-parallel rectangles. In this paper, we\nwill discuss packing without rotations, in which only translations are permitted. There are\ntwo main classes of the problem depending on whether the size of the container is fixed and\nwe want to minimize the number of containers used or whether we want to minimize the\ncontainer\u2019s size with respect to some objective function.\nA seminal example of the first class is the Geometric Bin Packing problem in which\na number of unit size squared bins to pack is to be minimized. The problem is arguably\nthe most natural generalization of the regular (1D) Bin Packing to two dimensions, and\nits absolute approximability has been fully understood. Unless P = N P, the best possible\nefficient constant factor approximation is 2 [15], and such an algorithm is known [10].\nIn the second class, there are several variants to be considered. An example is the\nStrip Packing Problem which is concerned with packing objects into a strip of width\n1 and infinite height in such a way that the maximum of all the heights of the placed\nobjects is minimized. Like Geometric Bin Packing, Strip Packing generalizes (1D)\nBin Packing. The best known efficient constant factor approximation for Strip Packing\nhas approximation factor (5/3 + \u03f5) [9]. It is known that there can not exist a polynomial\ntime algorithm with an approximation ratio of (3/2 \u2212 \u03f5) for any \u03f5 > 0 unless P = N P, which\nfollows directly from the approximation hardness of (1D) Bin Packing. Both classes of\nproblems have been also considered in the asymptotic setting, see e.g. [11, 5, 12].\nIn younger time, there was also an increase of interest in cases where the objects in\nquestion are general convex polygons. Alt, de Berg and Knauer [2, 3] considered the problem\nof packing an instance consisting of a number of convex polygons of the form p \u2282 [0, 1]2into\na minimum area axis-parallel rectangular container. We refer to this problem as Polygon\nArea Minimization throughout this paper. In the special case where the instance consists\nof rectangles only, the problem is known to admit a PTAS [4]. They proved the existence of\nthe following efficient algorithm:\nA 23.78-approximation for Polygon Area Minimization.\nRecently, Aamand, Abrahamsen, Beretta and Kleist [1] showed that the algorithm of Alt,\nde Berg and Knauer can be leveraged to obtain also efficient approximation algorithms of\nfurther problems:\nA 7-approximation for Polygon Perimeter Minimization.\nA 51-approximation for Polygon Strip Packing.\nAn 11-approximation for Polygon Bin Packing for polygons with diameter at most 1\n10 .\nA. Kurpisz and S. Suter 3\n1.1 Our results\nThe results of Alt, de Berg and Knauer [2, 3] and Aamand et al. [1] are heavily based on\nso-called shelf packing algorithms. In shelf packing algorithms, the objects are first placed\non the shelves, possibly ordered by height, which are later stacked on one another to build\na final solution. Compared to axis-parallel rectangles, the main challenge in designing an\napproximation algorithm for polygon packing problems is that objects cannot be sorted by\nheight and orientation simultaneously. As a result, the algorithm and its analysis in [2, 3]\nhave such a large approximation guarantee. In this paper, we provide new insight into how\nshelf packing algorithms should be applied to polygon packing problems. We introduce a\nsequence of transformations of the objects that allow us first to sort them by height and later\nby orientation to build a solution of a much better approximation guarantee. More precisely,\nwe design polynomial-time algorithms with the following factors:\nA 9.45-approximation for Polygon Area Minimization.\nUsing this algorithm as a subroutine, we build upon the methods from Aamand et al. [1] to\nobtain the following efficient approximation algorithms:\nA (3.75 + \u03f5)-approximation for Polygon Perimeter Minimization.\nA 21.89-approximation for Polygon Strip Packing.\nA 5.09-approximation for Polygon Bin Packing for polygons which have their diameter\nbounded by 1\n10 .\nThe results are proved in Sections 4, 5, 6, and 7 respectively. Furthermore, in Section 8\nwe show the following results, which make progress towards solving an open question of a\nO(1)-approximation algorithm for Polygon Bin Packing for arbitrary polygons.\nThere is an efficient O(\n1\n\u03b4\n)-approximation algorithm for Polygon Bin Packing for\ninstances where each polygon has width or height at most 1 \u2212 \u03b4.\nThere is an efficient O(1)-approximation algorithm for Polygon Bin Packing for\ninstances with the property that all polygons share a spine (up to translation) with height\nat least 3\n4\n.\n2 Preliminaries\nWe start out considerations by recalling a classical and well-known problem in theoretical\ncomputer science, the Bin Packing problem: Given a list of numbers s1, . . . , sn \u2208 (0, 1] \u2229 Q,\nrepresenting the sizes of n objects, the goal is to find the minimum number of bins of size 1,\nso that we can pac...",
