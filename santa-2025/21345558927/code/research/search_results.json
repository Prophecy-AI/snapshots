      "text": "Asymmetric irregular arrangements tend to pack better than symmetric regular patterns in 2D bin packing because they can more effectively utilize available space and reduce wasted areas. Symmetric regular patterns, such as grid-like arrangements, often leave unutilized gaps due to their uniformity, which can prevent optimal packing efficiency. In contrast, irregular arrangements leverage the natural shapes and residual spaces within the bin, allowing pieces to fit together in a more compact manner. This flexibility in placement enables the packing to adapt to the unique contours of irregular shapes and residual spaces, leading to higher material utilization ([frontiers](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmech.2022.966691/full)).\n\nResearch on 2D packing problems highlights that irregular arrangements, which do not adhere to strict symmetry or regularity, often outperform regular patterns because they can better accommodate complex shapes and residual spaces. Techniques such as local search heuristics and genetic algorithms have been developed to exploit this irregularity, further improving packing efficiency by dynamically adjusting piece placement and orientation. These approaches demonstrate that allowing asymmetry and irregularity in arrangements can significantly enhance space utilization, especially when dealing with complex or irregular shapes ([Springer](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cor.2023.106398), [Soton](https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/415314/)).",

An efficient 2D irregular packing algorithm can effectively improve material utilization and reduce processing costs. The reduction in material consumption will also have a beneficial impact on the environment ([Ke et al., 2020](#B76)). Therefore, research of the packing problem is of great significance for technology and social interest.\nThe 2D packing problem is a type of combinatorial optimization problems to locate parts with different shapes compactly in one or more master sheet material to minimize the occupied space or maximize the utilization of the material. The 2D packing problem is currently recognized as a NP problem, which is mainly solved by heuristic algorithms. In recent years, many scholars have conducted research on 2D irregular packing problems with a verity of solutions.\nThere exists a number of review articles on packing and cutting problems. We have summarized the main review literature in the field of 2D packing and cutting as shown in[Table 1](#T1). Brown ([Brown, 1971](#B17)) introduced an optimum packing and depletion problem with optimization of space and resource usage. Harvey ([Salkin and De Kluyver, 1975](#B116)) surveyed the application of mathematical optimization models such as linear programming to the knapsack problem. Bruce ([Golden, 1976](#B50)) surveyed various approaches to the cutting stock problem. Hinxman ([Hinxman, 1980](#B65)) surveyed the trim-loss and assortment problems, this research paid more attention to cutting and packaging problems in practical applications, and did not mention much about theoretical methods. Garey and Coffman ([Garey and Johnson, 1981](#B47);[Coffman et al., 1984](#B27)) surveyed the approximation algorithms for bin packing problems. Israni ([Israni and Sanders, 1982](#B72)) reviewed the 2D cutting stock problem including almost all 2D packaging problems. The author also proposed a rectangular layout method. Sarin ([Sarin, 1983](#B118)) reviewed methodologies and literature to solve 2D stock cutting problems and introduced an interactive optimization procedure for a general 2D stock cutting problem. Dyckhoff ([Dyckhoff et al., 1985](#B38)) described a trim loss and related problems and categorized them briefly. Dudzi&#x00144;ski ([Dudzi&#x00144;ski and Walukiewicz, 1987](#B36)) summarized the exact methods for knapsack problems, such as linear programming. Matthias ([Rode and Rosenberg, 1987](#B114)) analyzed the algorithm for the trim-loss problems. Haessler ([Haessler and Sweeney, 1991](#B59)) reviewed the solution process of cutting stock problems, including placement algorithm and sequence optimization algorithm. Dowsland ([Dowsland and Dowsland, 1992](#B34)) reviewed the application of operations research methods to the packing problem and summarized some exact heuristics. Sweeney ([Sweeney and Paternoster, 1992](#B128)) categorized cutting and packing problems and made application-oriented research records. Cheng ([Cheng et al., 1994](#B22)) discussed 2D cutting stock problems and their application cases including the pallet loading problem and VLSI placement problem. With the gradual deepening of research on 2D layout problems, typology becomes a common research topic. 2D regular and irregular layout problems are clearly distinguished in practical applications and theoretical methods. Dowsland ([Dowsland and Dowsland, 1995](#B29)) gave a special review of the 2D irregular nesting problem for the first time. Mavridou ([Mavridou and Pardalos, 1997](#B98)) summarized applications of the genetic algorithm and simulated annealing algorithm in the optimization of facility layout problems. Dyckhoff ([Dyckhoff, 1990](#B37)) made a typology of the cutting and packing problems in detail, and W&#x000e4;scher ([W&#x000e4;scher et al., 2007](#B135)) improved the typology later. Hopper ([Hopper and Turton, 1999](#B67);[Hopper and Turton, 2001a](#B68);[Hopper and Turton, 2001b](#B69)) investigated the application of meta-heuristic and heuristic algorithms in 2D and 3D packing problems. Lodi ([Lodi et al., 2002a](#B90);[Lodi et al., 2002b](#B91)) reviewed algorithms proposed in the 1990s of 2D packing problems. Bennell et al. ([Bennell and Oliveira, 2008](#B10);[Bennell and Oliveira, 2009](#B9)) discussed 2D irregular packing problems and related geometric problems. Leao ([Leao et al., 2020](#B81)) introduced the mathematical models in the 2D irregular packing problem.\nTABLE 1\n[![www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/966691/fmech-08-966691-HTML/image_m/fmech-08-966691-t001.jpg)](https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/966691/fmech-08-966691-HTML/image_m/fmech-08-966691-t001.jpg)\n**TABLE 1**.

In*two-dimensional bin packing problems*these units are finite rectangles, and the objective is to pack all the items into the minimum number of units, while in*two-dimensional strip packing problems*there is a single standardized unit of given width, and the objective is to pack all the items within the minimum height. We discuss mathematical models, and survey lower bounds, classical approximation algorithms, recent heuristic and metaheuristic methods and exact enumerative approaches. The relevant special cases where the items have to be packed into rows forming levels are also discussed in detail.\n## Introduction\nIn several industrial applications one is required to allocate a set of rectangular items to larger rectangular standardized stock units by minimizing the waste. In wood or glass industries, rectangular components have to be cut from large sheets of material. In warehousing contexts, goods have to be placed on shelves. In newspapers paging, articles and advertisements have to be arranged in pages. In these applications, the standardized stock units are rectangles, and a common objective function is to pack all the requested items into the minimum number of units: the resulting optimization problems are known in the literature as two-dimensional bin packing problems. In other contexts, such as paper or cloth industries, we have instead a single standardized unit (a roll of material), and the objective is to obtain the items by using the minimum roll length: the problems are then referred to as two-dimensional strip packing problems. As we will see in the following, the two problems have a strict relation in almost all algorithmic approaches to their solution.\nMost of the contributions in the literature are devoted to the case where the items to be packed have a fixed orientation with respect to the stock unit(s), i.e., one is not allowed to rotate them. This case, which is the object of the present article, reflects a number of practical contexts, such as the cutting of corrugated or decorated material (wood, glass, cloth industries), or the newspapers paging. For variants allowing rotations (usually by 90\u00b0) and/or constraints on the items placement (such as the \u201cguillotine cuts\u201d), the reader is referred to Lodi et al. [41], [42], where a three-field classification of the area is also introduced. General surveys on cutting and packing problems can be found in Dyckhoff and Finke [17], Dowsland and Dowsland [16] and Dyckhoff et al. [18]. Results on the probabilistic analysis of packing algorithms can be found in Coffman and Shor [12] and Coffman and Lueker [11].\nLet us introduce the problems in a more formal way. We are given a set of*n*rectangular*items**j*\u2208*J*={1,\u2026,*n*}, each defined by a*width*,*w**j*, and a*height*,*h**j*:\n* (i)\nin the*Two-Dimensional Bin Packing Problem*(2BP), we are further given an unlimited number of identical rectangular*bins*of width*W*and height*H*, and the objective is to allocate all the items to the minimum number of bins;\n* (ii)\nin the*Two-Dimensional Strip Packing Problem*(2SP), we are further given a bin of width*W*and infinite height (hereafter called*strip*), and the objective is to allocate all the items to the strip by minimizing the height to which the strip is used.\nIn both cases, the items have to be packed with their*w*-edges parallel to the*W*-edge of the bins (or strip). We will assume, with no loss of generality, that all input data are positive integers, and that*w**j*\u2a7d*W*and*h**j*\u2a7d*H*(*j*=1,\u2026,*n*).\nBoth problems are strongly NP-hard, as is easily seen by transformation from the strongly NP-hard (one-dimensional)*Bin Packing Problem*(1BP), in which*n*items, each having an associated size*h**j*, have to be partitioned into the minimum number of subsets so that the sum of the sizes in each subset does not exceed a given capacity*H*.\nA third relevant case of rectangle packing is the following. Each item*j*has an associated profit*p**j*&gt;0, and the problem is to select a subset of items, to be packed in a single finite bin, which maximizes the total selected profit. This problem is usually denoted as (*Two-Dimensional*)*Cutting Stock*, although it had been introduced by Gilmore and Gomory [29] as (*Two-Dimensional*)*Cutting Knapsack*.\nIn this survey we concentrate on two-dimensional problems in which all items have to be packed, i.e., on 2SP and 2BP. The reader is referred to Dyckhoff et al. [18, Section 5] for an annotated bibliography on two-dimensional cutting stock problems. For both 2SP and 2BP, we also consider the special case where the items have to be packed into rows forming levels.\nIn Section 2 we discuss mathematical models for the various problems introduced above. In Section 3 we survey classical approximation algorithms as well as more recent heuristic and metaheuristic methods. In Section 4 we introduce lower bounding techniques, while in Section 5 we describe exact enumerative approaches.\n## Section snippets\n## Modeling two-dimensional problems\nThe first attempt to model two-dimensional packing problems was made by Gilmore and Gomory [29], through an extension of their approach to 1BP (see [27], [28]). They proposed a column generation approach (see [53] for a recent survey) based on the enumeration of all subsets of items (*patterns*) that can be packed into a single bin. Let*A**j*be a binary column vector of*n*elements*a**ij*(*i*=1,\u2026,*n*) taking the value 1 if item*i*belongs to the*j*th pattern, and the value 0 otherwise.

Despite a large number of studies on the two-dimensional irregular strip packing problem, much less attention has been paid to the two-dimensional irregular bin packing problem (2DIBPP), and most of the current research on 2DIBPP is about free rotations. However, limited by the texture of the material, sometimes only some specific degrees of rotations are allowed. To pack a set of irregular pieces with some specific degrees into multi-stock sheets and maximize the utilization, we propose a heuristic algorithm that combines some pieces into one block for packing and uses residual spaces with reference lines to help select the next piece to be packed. In order to further increase the utilization of bins, we adopt fine-tuning, movement, filling, replacement and swap operations, as well as partial and full repack strategies. The computational results show that the proposed algorithm can obtain superior results on the instances with small number of pieces, relatively large number of types of pieces, large bins and more specific degrees of rotations.\n\n## Introduction\n\nIrregular packing problems are also called nesting problems (Bennell and Oliveira, 2009). Irregular packing problems can be further divided into different variants based on various perspectives. W\u00e4scher et al. (2007) introduced six kinds of cutting and packing problems, namely Identical Item Packing Problem (IIPP) (Costa et al., 2009), Placement Problem (PP) (Romanova et al., 2019), Knapsack Problem (KP) (Baldacci et al., 2014), Open Dimension Problem (ODP) (Rodrigues and Toledo, 2017, Mundim et al., 2017, Wang et al., 2018), Cutting Stock Problem (CSP) (MirHassani and Bashirzadeh, 2015) and Bin Packing Problem (BPP) (Martinez-Sykora et al., 2017, Abeysooriya et al., 2018, Bennell et al., 2018).\n\nThis paper addresses the two-dimensional irregular bin packing problem (2DIBPP) where the pieces are irregular with concavities. Even though many studies have focused on the two-dimensional irregular packing problem in recent years, they are mainly about the irregular strip packing problem which is a type of ODP. In the strip packing problem, the width of the stock sheet is fixed and the objective is to minimize the total length (Rodrigues and Toledo, 2017, Cherri et al., 2016). However, in real life, manufactures often use multi-stock sheets (bins) with fixed dimensions, which is related to 2DIBPP. 2DIBPP is a type of BPP and can be classified as a two-dimensional Single Bin Size Bin Packing Problem (SBSBPP).\n\nRotation is an important attribute of pieces, and plays a vital role on the final packing patterns. For two-dimensional irregular packing problems, rotations are usually divided into {0,180} degrees, {0,90,180,270} degrees (Sato et al., 2019), and free rotations (Martinez-Sykora et al., 2017, Abeysooriya et al., 2018, Cherri et al., 2018). For example, in the garment industry, the rotation is restricted, while in glass and sheet metal cutting applications, free rotations are allowed. For three-dimensional irregular packing problems, the vertical direction is sometimes fixed but the horizontal direction can be rotated, that is, the bottom area is unchanged. For some specific situations, items can be rotated in any direction (Romanova et al., 2018).\n\nCurrently, most studies of the 2DIBPP are about free rotations. Martinez-Sykora et al. (2017) combined the free rotation of irregular pieces with the bin packing problem for the first time. Abeysooriya et al. (2018) applied Jostle algorithm and addressed simultaneously both the allocation of pieces and the placement of bins. However, due to the limitation of material texture, only some specific degrees of rotations are allowed. Liu et al. (2020) proposed a heuristic for 2DIBPP with limited rotations where the overlapping removal based placement was used. Zhang et al. (2022) proposed an iteratively doubling local search approach for 2DIBPP with limited rotations, including a least waste first decreasing strategy, a simple greedy local search approach and an overlap minimization approach. In this study, we also consider the 2DIBPP with limited rotations but design different heuristics to solve it.\n\nOur study makes several contributions to the literature. First, our paper is the first to introduce blocks to 2DIBPP, which were previously used for strip packing problems. We also extend to generate blocks with more than two pieces. The pieces are combined into blocks so that the shapes of the pieces can be complementary to reduce wasted bin space. Second, we are the first to apply residual spaces with reference lines to 2DIBPP to guide the selection of the next piece to pack. Third, a series of operations are used to further increase the utilization of bins, including fine-tuning, movement, filling and replacement for the placement of one bin, and swap between bins. Most of these operations are rarely used in the irregular packing problems. Fourth, to find better solutions without increasing too much computational time, we newly propose the partial and full repack strategies. Partial repack draws on previous experience to keep some of the higher utilization bins intact and only repack the remaining bins, while full repack throws away the experience and starts packing from the first empty bin. Finally, we can improve the best-known results for some benchmark instances.\n\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we define some notations and describe the problem. Section 3 introduces our heuristic method, including the block, residual spaces with reference lines, fine-tuning, movement, filling, replacement and swap operations, and partial and full repack strategies. In Section 4, we present the experimental data and the computational results. We summarize our conclusions and ...",

The problem consists of placing a set of pieces represented as 2D polygons in rectangular bins with different dimensions such that the total area of bins used is minimized. Most packing algorithms available in the literature for 2D irregular bin packing consider single size bins only. However, for many industries the material can be supplied in a number of standard size sheets, for example, metal, foam, plastic and timber sheets. For this problem, the cut plans must decide the set of standard size stock sheets as well as which pieces to cut from each bin and how to arrange them in order to minimise waste material. Moreover, the literature constrains the orientation of pieces to a single or finite set of angles. This is often an artificial constraint that makes the solution space easier to navigate. In this paper we do not restrict the orientation of the pieces. We show that the local search heuristic and the genetic algorithm can address all of these decisions and obtain good solutions, with the local search performing better. We also discuss the affect of different groups of stock sheet sizes.\n\nThis is a preview of subscription content, [log in via an institution](https://wayf.springernature.com?redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Fchapter%2F10.1007%2F978-3-319-68496-3_37%3Ferror%3Dcookies_not_supported%26code%3D6c4d7962-9a74-4c0e-ac70-bc76101d9408) to check access.\n\n## Access this chapter\n\n[Log in via an institution](https://wayf.springernature.com?redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Fchapter%2F10.1007%2F978-3-319-68496-3_37%3Ferror%3Dcookies_not_supported%26code%3D6c4d7962-9a74-4c0e-ac70-bc76101d9408)\n\nChapter\n\nUSD\u00a029.95\n\nPrice excludes VAT (USA)\n\n- Available as PDF\n- Read on any device\n- Instant download\n- Own it forever\n\nBuy Chapter\n\neBookUSD\u00a039.99Price excludes VAT (USA)\n\n- Available as PDF\n- Read on any device\n- Instant download\n- Own it forever\n\nBuy eBook\n\nSoftcover BookUSD\u00a054.99Price excludes VAT (USA)\n\n- Compact, lightweight edition\n- Dispatched in 3 to 5 business days\n- Free shipping worldwide - [see info](https://support.springernature.com/en/support/solutions/articles/6000233448-coronavirus-disease-covid-19-delivery-information)\n\nBuy Softcover Book\n\nTax calculation will be finalised at checkout\n\nPurchases are for personal use only\n\n[Institutional subscriptions](https://www.springernature.com/gp/librarians/licensing/agc/ebooks)\n\n## Preview\n\nUnable to display preview.\u00a0[Download preview\\\nPDF.](https://page-one.springer.com/pdf/preview/10.1007/978-3-319-68496-3_37)\n\nUnable to display preview.\u00a0[Download preview\\\nPDF.](https://page-one.springer.com/pdf/preview/10.1007/978-3-319-68496-3_37)\n\n## References\n\n01.

In the two-dimensional case, not only is it the case that the piece\u2019s size is important but its shape also has a significant influence. Therefore, DJD as a selection heuristic has to be paired with a placement heuristic to completely construct a solution to the underlying packing problem. A successful adaptation of the DJD requires a routine to reduce computational costs, which is also proposed and successfully tested in this paper. Results, on a wide variety of instance types with convex polygons, are found to be significantly better than those produced by more conventional selection heuristics.\n\nThis is a preview of

The literature on irregular shaped packing problems is dominated by the single stock sheet strip packing problem. However, in reality manufacturers are cutting orders over multi-stock sheets. Despite its greater relevance, there are only a few papers that tackle this problem in the literature. A multi-stock sheet problem has two decision components; the allocation of pieces to stock sheets and the layout design for each stock sheet. In this paper, we propose a heuristic method that addresses both the allocation and placement problems together based on the Jostle algorithm. Jostle was first applied to strip packing. In order to apply Jostle to the bin packing problem we modify the placement heuristic. In addition we improve the search capability by introducing a diversification mechanism into the approach. Furthermore, the paper presents alternative strategies for handling rotation of pieces, which includes a restricted set of angles and unrestricted rotation. Very few authors permit unrestricted rotation of pieces, despite this being a feature of many problems where the material is homogeneous. Finally, we investigate alternative placement criteria and show that the most commonly applied bottom left criteria does not perform as well as other options. The paper evaluates performance of each algorithm using different sets of instances considering convex and non-convex shapes.
