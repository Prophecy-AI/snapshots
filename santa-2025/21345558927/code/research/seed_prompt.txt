## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.316579 from exp_020 (fixed)
- Best LB score: 70.3434 (exp_019)
- Target: 68.876781 | Gap to target: 1.44 points (2.09%)
- Submissions used: 11/100 | Remaining: 89

## CRITICAL: SUBMISSION FAILED - NOW FIXED

exp_020 (CV=70.316579) failed Kaggle validation with "Overlapping trees in group 002".

**Root cause:** Tiny overlaps (7e-13 in N=2, 1e-14 in N=105) that pass local Shapely validation but fail Kaggle's stricter validation.

**Fix applied:** Replaced N=2 and N=105 with configurations from the valid baseline (21337107511) that passed Kaggle validation. Score unchanged at 70.316579.

**The fixed submission is ready at /home/submission/submission.csv**

## IMMEDIATE ACTION: SUBMIT THE FIXED exp_020

The fixed submission should be submitted immediately to:
1. Verify it passes Kaggle validation
2. Get LB feedback (should be ~70.316579)
3. Establish new best LB

## Submission Log
| Exp | Approach | CV | LB | Notes |
|-----|----------|----|----|-------|
| 001 | valid_baseline | 70.6151 | 70.6151 | First valid submission |
| 010 | safe_ensemble | 70.3651 | 70.3651 | Conservative threshold |
| 016 | mega_ensemble | 70.3535 | 70.3535 | External data |
| 019 | comprehensive | 70.3434 | 70.3434 | Best LB so far |
| 020 | optimal_ensemble | 70.3166 | FAILED | Overlap in N=2 - NOW FIXED |

## Response to Evaluator

The evaluator correctly identified:
1. **Kaggle validation risk** - CONFIRMED. The submission failed due to tiny overlaps.
2. **Large gap to target** - AGREED. 1.44 points requires fundamentally different approach.
3. **2517 overlap rejections** - These represent potential improvements we can't use.

**Action taken:** Fixed the overlaps by replacing N=2 and N=105 with valid baseline configurations.

## Strategic Analysis

### Why We're Stuck at ~70.3x
All public kernels converge to ~70.3x because they all use the same approach:
- bbox3 C++ optimizer with similar parameters
- Ensemble of existing solutions
- Same external data sources

### What Top Teams Do Differently (68.5 LB)
1. Run C++ optimizers for DAYS (not minutes)
2. Use 900+ submissions to accumulate best per-N
3. Implement custom algorithms (not just running bbox3)
4. Focus on specific N ranges where they can improve
5. Use asymmetric solutions (per discussion 666880)

### The 1.8 Point Gap
- Public kernels: ~70.3x
- Top LB: ~68.5
- Gap: 1.8 points

This gap exists because top teams:
- Have run optimizers for much longer
- Have accumulated improvements over 900+ submissions
- May have implemented novel algorithms not shared publicly

## Next Experiment Strategy

### OPTION 1: Extended C++ Optimization (RECOMMENDED)
Run bbox3 for HOURS (not minutes) on specific N values:
```bash
# Focus on N values with largest scores (most room for improvement)
# Run for 10000+ iterations per N
./bbox3 --input submission.csv --output improved.csv --iterations 10000 --n_start 50 --n_end 100
```

### OPTION 2: Download More External Data
```bash
# bucket-of-chump contains many solutions
kaggle datasets download jazivxt/bucket-of-chump
# May contain better solutions for specific N values
```

### OPTION 3: Implement Novel Algorithm
For N=1-20, implement branch-and-bound to guarantee optimal solutions:
```python
def branch_and_bound_n(n, current_trees, remaining_trees):
    # Exhaustively search all valid placements
    # Prune branches that can't improve best known
    pass
```

## ⛔ FORBIDDEN (WILL BE REJECTED)
- Running bbox3 with same parameters as before (already tried)
- Creating new ensembles from same data sources (already exhausted)
- Any approach that gave < 0.01 improvement in last 3 experiments

## ✅ REQUIRED: SUBMIT FIRST
Before any new experiments, SUBMIT the fixed exp_020:
1. The submission is ready at /home/submission/submission.csv
2. It has CV=70.316579 (best so far)
3. It passes local overlap validation
4. We need LB feedback to verify it works

## Per-N Analysis
The current submission has these characteristics:
- N=1: 0.6612 (already optimal)
- N=2-10: Contribute ~3.7 to total score
- N=11-50: Contribute ~20 to total score
- N=51-200: Contribute ~46 to total score

Focus optimization on N=51-200 where there's most room for improvement.

## Key Insight: Precision Matters!
Kaggle validation is STRICTER than local Shapely validation:
- Local validation passes with 1e-13 overlap area
- Kaggle rejects with 1e-13 overlap area

**Always use high-precision coordinates from known-good sources!**
