## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.341099 from exp_009 (high-precision ensemble) - FAILED KAGGLE VALIDATION
- Safe CV score: 70.365091 from exp_010 (safe ensemble with MIN_IMPROVEMENT=0.001)
- Best LB score: 70.615101 (from exp_001/002 - baseline)
- Target: 68.879467 | Gap to target: 1.49 points (2.1% improvement needed)

## CRITICAL: PREVIOUS SUBMISSION FAILED

exp_009 (CV 70.341) failed Kaggle validation with "Overlapping trees in group 123".

**Root Cause:** Kaggle uses stricter validation than our local Shapely-based checks. Small improvements (< 0.001) might be precision artifacts that cause overlaps.

**FIX APPLIED:** Created exp_010 (safe ensemble) with MIN_IMPROVEMENT=0.001 threshold:
- Falls back to baseline for 68 N values with small improvements
- Keeps 74 N values with significant improvements (> 0.001)
- Score: 70.365 (0.25 improvement over baseline)

## IMMEDIATE ACTION: SUBMIT exp_010

**SUBMIT exp_010 FIRST** to validate the safe ensemble passes Kaggle validation.

If it passes: We have a new baseline (70.365) to build on
If it fails: We need even stricter validation

## Submission Log
| Exp | Approach | CV | LB | Notes |
|-----|----------|----|----|-------|
| 001 | valid_baseline | 70.615 | 70.615 | Passed Kaggle validation |
| 002 | backward_prop | 70.615 | 70.615 | No improvement |
| 009 | highprec_ensemble | 70.341 | FAILED | Overlap in N=123 |
| 010 | safe_ensemble | 70.365 | pending | Conservative threshold |

## What We've Learned

1. **Baseline is at strong local optimum**: SA, exhaustive search, NFP all failed
2. **Snapshots contain better solutions**: Found 142 N values with improvements
3. **Precision matters**: Kaggle uses stricter validation than local checks
4. **Small improvements are risky**: < 0.001 might cause overlaps

## Strategy for Reaching Target (68.88)

Current gap: 1.49 points (from 70.365 to 68.88)

**Path forward after validation:**
1. **More data sources**: Download external sources (jazivxt/bucket-of-chump, etc.)
2. **C++ optimizer**: Implement fractional translation in C++ for speed
3. **Per-N specialization**: Different strategies for different N ranges

## ⛔ FORBIDDEN
- bbox3, sa_fast, eazy_optimizer - FORBIDDEN (binaries)
- subprocess.run() or os.system() for binaries - FORBIDDEN
- Improvements < 0.001 without strict validation - RISKY

## ✅ REQUIRED
1. **SUBMIT exp_010 FIRST** to validate safe ensemble
2. Track per-N scores for all experiments
3. Use strict overlap validation (integer arithmetic with SCALE=10^18)
4. Fall back to baseline for any N that fails validation
