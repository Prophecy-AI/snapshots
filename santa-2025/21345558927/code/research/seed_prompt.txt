## Submission Log
| Exp | Approach | CV | LB | Notes |

| 001 | valid_baseline | 70.6151 | 70.6151 | First valid submission |

| 020 | optimal_ensemble | 70.3166 | PENDING | **SUBMIT THIS** |

## Response to Evaluator
The evaluator correctly identified that:
1. MIN_IMPROVEMENT=0.001 was too conservative - lowering to 1e-10 captured 140+ additional improvements
2. team-blend (70.331635) is better than current_best (70.343408)
3. bbox3-ensemble-update (70.319731) is the best single kernel output

I've built the optimal ensemble using bbox3-ensemble-update as base + all other sources:
- Final score: 70.316579 (improvement of 0.027 over exp_019)
- 2517 potential improvements rejected due to overlaps
- This is the BEST achievable from all available data sources

## Critical Analysis
The gap to target (1.44 points) is still LARGE. The current ensemble approach has reached its limit:
- All public kernels score 70.3+ 
- Best ensemble achieves 70.316579
- Target is 68.876781

**To reach the target, we need fundamentally different approaches:**

1. **Run bbox3 for extended periods** - The top teams run bbox3 for hours/days
2. **Implement novel algorithms** - NFP, branch-and-bound, genetic algorithms
3. **Find private/unpublished solutions** - Top teams have private optimizations

## ⚠️ IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

**SUBMIT exp_020 (CV=70.316579) IMMEDIATELY**
- This is 0.027 better than current best LB (70.3434)
- Passes all overlap validation
- We have 90 submissions remaining - USE THEM!

## Next Experiment Strategy

After submitting exp_020, the executor should:

### Option 1: Run bbox3 for Extended Periods (RECOMMENDED)
```bash
# Run bbox3 on specific N values that have room for improvement
./bbox3 -n 1000 -r 100 -i submission.csv -o improved.csv
```
Focus on N values where current score is far from theoretical minimum.

### Option 2: Implement Small N Optimization
For N=2-10, implement exhaustive search:
```python
# For N=2: Search all angle combinations
for angle1 in range(0, 36000, 1):  # 0.01° steps
    for angle2 in range(0, 36000, 1):
        # Find optimal positions for these angles
        score = optimize_positions(angle1/100, angle2/100)
```

### Option 3: Download More External Data
```python
# Search for more datasets
kaggle datasets list -s "santa 2025" --sort-by votes
# Look for private team datasets that might have better solutions
```

## What NOT to Try
- ❌ More ensemble variations with same data (already optimal)
- ❌ SA/GA on current solutions (baseline is at strong local optimum)
- ❌ Backward propagation (already tried, no improvement)

## Key Insight from Discussions
The discussion "Why the winning solutions will be Asymmetric" (40 votes) suggests:
- Asymmetric solutions can be better than symmetric ones
- Top teams run optimizers for extended periods (24+ CPUs)
- The winning solutions likely come from novel algorithms, not just ensemble

## Summary
1. **SUBMIT exp_020 NOW** (CV=70.316579)
2. After submission, run bbox3 for extended periods on specific N values
3. Consider implementing novel algorithms for small N
4. The gap (1.44 points) requires breakthrough approaches, not incremental improvements
