## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.316492 from exp_021 (fixed in exp_022)
- Best LB score: 70.3434 (exp_019)
- Target: 68.876781 | Gap to target: 1.44 points (2.0%)

## CRITICAL: SUBMISSION FAILED - NOW FIXED
exp_021 failed Kaggle validation with "Overlapping trees in group 002".
**FIXED**: Replaced N=2 and N=105 with high-precision valid baseline configurations.
The fixed submission (exp_022) passes local overlap validation and should be submitted.

| 019 | comprehensive_ensemble | 70.343 | 70.343 | Passed Kaggle |
| 021 | comprehensive_v2 | 70.316 | FAILED | Overlaps in N=2 |
| 022 | fixed_overlap | 70.316 | PENDING | Fixed overlaps, ready to submit |

## Response to Evaluator
The evaluator correctly identified:
1. **Ensemble ceiling reached**: Scanning 3496 files found only 0.000087 improvement
2. **Large gap remains**: 1.44 points (2.0%) to target
3. **Need fundamentally different approach**: Not more ensembling

I agree with all points. The fixed submission (exp_022) should be submitted immediately to:
1. Verify it passes Kaggle validation
2. Establish new best LB score (~70.316)
3. Get feedback before pivoting strategy

## Strategic Analysis

### Per-N Score Analysis
- N=1 contributes 0.66 to total (highest single N)
- N=1-10 contribute 6.2% of total score
- Average per-N: 0.352 (need 0.344 for target)
- Need 2% reduction on average across all N

### What's Been Exhausted
1. **Local search (SA)**: Tested on all N values, no improvements
2. **Ensemble approach**: Scanned 3496 files, found only 0.000087 improvement
3. **External data**: All available datasets downloaded and scanned
4. **Backward propagation**: Removing trees doesn't help

### What Top Teams Likely Do
1. **Extended C++ optimization**: Run for DAYS, not hours
2. **Novel algorithms**: Tessellation, branch-and-bound
3. **Per-N specialization**: Different approaches for different N ranges
4. **900+ submissions**: Iterate and accumulate improvements

## Next Experiment: SUBMIT FIXED SUBMISSION

**IMMEDIATE ACTION**: Submit exp_022 (fixed_overlap) to get LB feedback.

The submission:
- Score: 70.316492
- Overlaps: NONE (fixed N=2 and N=105)
- Ready: YES

After submission, pivot to:
1. **Extended C++ optimization**: Run bbox3 for hours with many restarts
2. **Novel algorithm implementation**: Tessellation or branch-and-bound
3. **Per-N specialization**: Focus on high-score N values (N=1-20)

## What NOT to Try
- ❌ More ensemble scanning (exhausted)
- ❌ Local search variations (exhausted)
- ❌ Downloading more external data (all scanned)
- ❌ Backward propagation (doesn't help)

## Technical Notes
- Kaggle validation is STRICTER than local Shapely
- Use high-precision coordinates from known-good sources
- Valid baseline: snapshot 21337107511
- Overlap threshold: 1e-15 (very strict)
