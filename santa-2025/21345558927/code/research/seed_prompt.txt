## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.316718 from exp_020 (whynot_ensemble)
- Best LB score: 70.3535 (exp_016) - exp_020 NOT YET SUBMITTED
- Target: 68.877877 | Gap to target: 1.44 points (2.09%)

## CRITICAL: SUBMIT exp_020 IMMEDIATELY!
We have a new best CV score (70.316718 vs previous 70.343408) but it hasn't been submitted yet!
This is a 0.027 improvement - SUBMIT IT to get LB feedback!

## Submission Log
| Exp | Approach | CV | LB | Notes |
|-----|----------|----|----|-------|
| 001 | valid_baseline | 70.615 | 70.615 | First valid submission |
| 010 | safe_ensemble | 70.365 | 70.365 | MIN_IMPROVEMENT=0.001 |
| 016 | mega_ensemble | 70.354 | 70.354 | Current best LB |
| 019 | comprehensive_external | 70.343 | pending | Downloaded 12+ external sources |
| 020 | whynot_ensemble | 70.317 | **SUBMIT** | Best CV! Uses why-not + team-blend as base |

## What We've Learned
1. **External data is the key lever** - why-not (70.332) and team-blend (70.331) are better than our previous baseline
2. **MIN_IMPROVEMENT threshold was too conservative** - lowering from 0.001 to 1e-8 found 69 additional improvements
3. **2551 potential improvements rejected due to overlaps** - many external sources have invalid data
4. **Best external sources**: team-blend (70.331635), why-not (70.332155), decent-starting-solution (70.348816)

## Response to Evaluator
The evaluator correctly identified that:
1. ✅ The MIN_IMPROVEMENT=0.001 threshold was leaving gains on the table
2. ✅ The why-not submission should be used as the new baseline
3. ✅ Building ensemble with NO threshold would find more improvements

I implemented their recommendations:
- Used team-blend (70.331) as base (slightly better than why-not)
- Lowered threshold to 1e-8
- Found 69 improvements totaling 0.015 points
- Final score: 70.316718 (improvement of 0.027 from previous 70.343)

## Gap Analysis
- Current: 70.316718
- Target: 68.877877
- Gap: 1.44 points (2.09%)

At current rate of ~0.01 improvement per experiment, would need 144 more experiments.
This is NOT sustainable - need a breakthrough approach.

## Next Experiment: SUBMIT AND CONTINUE SEARCHING

### STEP 1: SUBMIT exp_020 (MANDATORY)
```
Submit(experiment_id="exp_020", reason="New best CV score 70.316718, improvement of 0.027 over previous")
```

### STEP 2: Search for more external data sources
The top kernels use 17-19 data sources. We have:
- bucket-of-chump ✅
- santa25-public ✅
- santa-2025-try3 ✅
- telegram solutions ✅
- why-not ✅
- team-optimization-blend ✅
- decent-starting-solution ✅

Still missing:
- jwt/other/csv/19 (private dataset?)
- santa25-improved-sa-with-translations
- santa-2025-fix-direction
- 72-71-santa-2025-jit-parallel-sa-c
- blending-multiple-oplimisation
- santa2025-just-keep-on-trying

Try to download these additional sources.

### STEP 3: Analyze per-N scores to find weak spots
```python
# Find N values where we're furthest from theoretical optimum
for n in range(1, 201):
    current_score = get_score(n)
    # Theoretical lower bound: area of n trees / n = constant
    # For n=1, optimal is 0.6612 (we have this)
    # For large n, optimal approaches ~0.33 (dense packing)
    gap = current_score - theoretical_min(n)
    if gap > 0.01:
        print(f"N={n}: potential improvement of {gap:.4f}")
```

### STEP 4: Try running bbox3 for extended periods
The top kernels run bbox3 for 3+ hours with multiple restarts.
We haven't tried this yet because bbox3 binary was incompatible.
Try compiling bbox3 from source (we have bbox3.cpp from why-not kernel).

## What NOT to Try
- ❌ Python SA/GA optimization (already tried, no improvements)
- ❌ Exhaustive search for small N (already optimal)
- ❌ Fractional translation (already tried, no improvements)
- ❌ Backward propagation (already tried, no improvements)

## Key Insight
The gap of 1.44 points is HUGE. The only way to close it is:
1. Find more external data sources with better solutions
2. Run bbox3/similar optimizer for extended periods
3. Implement a fundamentally different algorithm (NFP, branch-and-bound)

The ensemble approach has reached its limit with current data sources.
Need either more data or a novel optimization approach.
