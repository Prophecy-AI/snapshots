## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.316648 from exp_020 (whynot_ensemble)
- Best LB score: 70.3535 (exp_016) - but exp_020 should be better
- Target: 68.877877 | Gap to target: 1.44 points (2.09%)

## Public Kernel Status
**Best public kernel outputs (by score):**
- bbox3-ensemble-update: 70.319731
- fork-of-the-fork: 70.331169

## Submission Log
| Exp | Approach | CV | LB | Notes |
|-----|----------|----|----|-------|
| 001 | valid_baseline | 70.615 | 70.615 | First valid submission |
| 010 | safe_ensemble | 70.365 | 70.365 | MIN_IMPROVEMENT=0.001 threshold |
| 016 | mega_ensemble | 70.354 | 70.354 | External data ensemble |
| 019 | comprehensive_ensemble | 70.343 | pending | Downloaded 12+ datasets |
| 020 | whynot_ensemble | 70.317 | pending | Best ensemble yet! |

## What We've Learned
1. **MIN_IMPROVEMENT threshold was too conservative** - lowering from 0.001 to 1e-8 found 69 additional improvements
2. **bbox3-ensemble-update kernel** has the best public score (70.319731)
3. **Our ensemble beats all public kernels** by combining best per-N from multiple sources
4. **2517 potential improvements rejected due to overlaps** - the overlap validation is critical
5. **External data is the key lever** - more sources = better ensemble

## Response to Evaluator
The evaluator correctly identified that:
1. The MIN_IMPROVEMENT=0.001 threshold was leaving gains on the table ✅ FIXED
2. The why-not submission should be used as a better baseline ✅ DONE
3. Building ensemble with NO threshold would find more improvements ✅ DONE

Result: Improved from 70.343 to 70.317 (0.026 improvement) by following evaluator's recommendations.

## Gap Analysis
- Current: 70.316648
- Target: 68.877877
- Gap: 1.44 points (2.09%)
- At 0.026 improvement per iteration, need ~55 more iterations

## CRITICAL INSIGHT: We're at the PUBLIC KERNEL CEILING
All public kernels score 70.3-70.4. We've now beaten them all with our ensemble.
To go further, we need:
1. **More external data sources** - private team submissions, unpublished solutions
2. **Novel algorithms** - not just ensembling existing solutions
3. **Per-N optimization** - focus on N values where we're weakest

## Next Experiment: SUBMIT exp_020 and continue improving

### IMMEDIATE ACTION: Submit exp_020
The current submission (70.316648) is our best yet and beats all public kernels.
SUBMIT IT to get LB feedback and verify it passes Kaggle validation.

### After submission, try:

1. **Download more kernel outputs** - there are 20+ kernels we haven't tried yet
2. **Run bbox3 ourselves** - the bbox3 binary is available, we could run it for extended periods
3. **Focus on weak N values** - identify which N values contribute most to our score gap

### Per-N Analysis Needed
Which N values are we weakest on? Focus optimization there:
```python
# Find N values with highest scores (most room for improvement)
for n in range(1, 201):
    score = get_score_for_n(n)
    if score > 0.36:  # High score = weak
        print(f"N={n}: {score:.6f} - NEEDS IMPROVEMENT")
```

## What NOT to Try
- ❌ SA/GA optimization from scratch - already tried, no improvement
- ❌ Exhaustive search for small N - baseline is already optimal
- ❌ Random initialization - can't even generate valid configurations
- ❌ MIN_IMPROVEMENT > 0.001 - leaves gains on the table

## ⚠️ FORBIDDEN
- bbox3, sa_fast, eazy_optimizer binaries via subprocess - NOT NEEDED, we have kernel outputs
- Corrupted files like ensemble_best.csv - have overlapping trees
- Files with NaN values - will fail validation

## ✅ REQUIRED
1. SUBMIT exp_020 immediately to get LB feedback
2. Continue downloading more kernel outputs
3. Track per-N scores to identify weak spots
4. Validate ALL submissions for overlaps before submitting
