## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.316579 (optimal_whynot_ensemble - in /home/submission/)
- Best LB score: 70.3434 (exp_019)
- Target: 68.876781 | Gap to target: 1.44 points (2.09%)
- Submissions remaining: 99

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: SUBMIT THE CURRENT BEST IMMEDIATELY!

The current submission in `/home/submission/submission.csv` has score **70.316579** which is:
- 0.027 BETTER than exp_019 (70.3434)
- Passes local overlap validation (verified)
- Has NOT been submitted to Kaggle yet!

**FIRST ACTION: Create exp_020 and submit it!**

```python
# Log the experiment
experiment_id = "exp_020"
experiment_name = "020_optimal_ensemble_final"
cv_score = 70.316579
notes = "Optimal ensemble using why-not as base with NO threshold (1e-10). Captures 156 improvements that were previously rejected by MIN_IMPROVEMENT=0.001 threshold. Sources: why-not (115 N), submission_ensemble.csv (40 N), submission.csv (39 N), submission2.csv (4 N), submission_v2.csv (2 N). All configurations validated for overlaps."
```

## Submission Log
| Exp | Approach | CV | LB | Notes |
|-----|----------|----|----|-------|
| 001 | valid_baseline | 70.615 | 70.615 | Baseline - passed validation |
| 010 | safe_ensemble | 70.365 | 70.365 | First ensemble - passed |
| 016 | mega_ensemble_external | 70.354 | 70.354 | External data ensemble |
| 019 | comprehensive_external | 70.343 | 70.343 | More external data |
| 020 | optimal_ensemble_final | 70.317 | **SUBMIT NOW** | Best CV - needs LB feedback |

## What We've Learned
1. **MIN_IMPROVEMENT threshold was too conservative**: Lowering from 0.001 to 1e-10 captured 156 additional improvements
2. **External data sources are key**: why-not, team-blend, bbox3-ensemble-update all have good solutions
3. **Many external files have overlapping trees**: 2517 potential improvements rejected due to overlaps
4. **CV = LB exactly** for this problem (when validation passes)

## Response to Evaluator
The evaluator correctly identified that:
1. The MIN_IMPROVEMENT=0.001 threshold was leaving gains on the table ✅
2. The why-not submission (70.332) should be used as base ✅
3. Building ensemble with NO threshold captured 156 improvements ✅

**IMPLEMENTED**: The current submission (70.316579) follows this advice. It should be submitted immediately.

## Gap Analysis
- Current best CV: 70.316579
- Target: 68.876781
- Gap: 1.44 points (2.09%)
- To reach target: Need average improvement of 0.0072 per N, or 144 N values improving by 0.01 each

## Next Experiment Strategy

### STEP 1: Log and Submit exp_020 (70.316579)
The current submission is our best and hasn't been submitted. Log it and submit NOW.

### STEP 2: Analyze per-N scores to find weak points
After submitting, analyze which N values have the most room for improvement:
- N=1 is already optimal (0.6612)
- Small N (2-10) contribute ~4.3 to total score
- Large N (150-200) contribute ~25 to total score

### STEP 3: Run bbox3 on weak N values
- The top kernels run bbox3 for hours/days
- Focus on N values where we're furthest from optimal
- Use the bbox3 binary in /home/code/experiments/

### STEP 4: Search for more external data
- Check for new kernel outputs
- Look for private datasets that might be shared
- Download any new submissions from top teams

## ⛔ FORBIDDEN
- Running bbox3/sa_fast with "more iterations" expecting different results without targeting specific N values
- Ensembling outputs from same optimizer
- "Optimizing" existing CSV files without new data

## ✅ REQUIRED
1. **LOG exp_020**: Create experiment entry for the current best submission
2. **SUBMIT exp_020**: Get LB feedback on 70.316579
3. **Track per-N scores**: Know which N values are weak
4. **Validate for overlaps**: Before any submission

## Per-N Analysis Needed
After submitting, create a notebook to analyze:
```python
# For each N, compare our score to theoretical minimum
# Identify N values with largest gaps
# Focus optimization on those N values
```

## Expected Outcome
- Submit exp_020: LB should be ~70.317 (CV=LB for this problem)
- This would be our best LB score yet (improvement of 0.026 over exp_019)
- Then continue searching for improvements in weak N values
