## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.316579 from exp_022 (optimal ensemble with bbox3-ensemble-update base)
- Best LB score: 70.353516 (exp_016)
- Target: 68.876781 | Gap to target: 1.44 points (2.1%)

## Response to Evaluator
The evaluator correctly identified that the MIN_IMPROVEMENT=0.001 threshold was too conservative. I have:
1. ✅ Lowered the threshold to 1e-10 (essentially no threshold)
2. ✅ Used bbox3-ensemble-update (70.319731) as the base instead of why-not (70.332155)
3. ✅ Built a comprehensive ensemble achieving 70.316579 - BEST SCORE YET!
4. ✅ Verified no overlaps in the final submission

The evaluator's analysis was spot-on. The why-not submission is clean but bbox3-ensemble-update is even better.

## Submission Log (TRACK EVERYTHING!)
| Exp | Approach | CV | LB | Notes |
|-----|----------|----|----|-------|
| 001 | valid_baseline | 70.615 | 70.615 | First valid submission |
| 002 | backward_prop | 70.615 | 70.615 | No improvement |
| 007 | ensemble_fractional | 70.266 | pending | N=24 breakthrough |
| 010 | safe_ensemble | 70.365 | 70.365 | Conservative threshold |
| 016 | mega_ensemble | 70.354 | 70.354 | Best LB so far |
| 019 | comprehensive_external | 70.343 | pending | Downloaded 12+ datasets |
| 022 | optimal_whynot_ensemble | 70.317 | pending | BEST CV - needs submission! |

## What We've Learned
1. **External data is the key lever** - All improvements came from ensembling external sources
2. **MIN_IMPROVEMENT threshold was too conservative** - Lowering from 0.001 to 1e-10 found 154 more improvements
3. **Best external sources**: bbox3-ensemble-update (70.319731), team-blend (70.331635), why-not (70.332155)
4. **2517 potential improvements rejected due to overlaps** - Many external files have corrupted solutions
5. **All Python optimization approaches failed** - SA, GA, NFP, exhaustive search, backward propagation

## Next Experiment: SUBMIT exp_022!
**CRITICAL**: exp_022 achieved CV=70.316579 but has NOT been submitted yet!
This is 0.037 better than the current best LB (70.353516).

**IMMEDIATE ACTION**: Submit exp_022 to get LB feedback.

## After Submission: Strategy for Reaching Target

### Gap Analysis
- Current best: 70.316579
- Target: 68.876781
- Gap: 1.44 points (2.1%)
- Need: ~144 N values with 0.01 improvement each, OR ~14 N values with 0.1 improvement each

### Approaches That HAVEN'T Been Tried Yet
1. **Run bbox3 for extended periods** - The bbox3-ensemble-update kernel runs bbox3 with specific parameters. We could run it longer.
2. **Asymmetric solutions** - Discussion "Why the winning solutions will be Asymmetric" suggests asymmetric layouts beat symmetric ones
3. **Per-N specialization** - Different algorithms for different N ranges (small N: exhaustive, large N: heuristics)
4. **Constructive heuristics** - Build solutions from scratch instead of optimizing existing ones

### What NOT to Try (Dead Ends)
- ❌ Python SA/GA on existing solutions - Already at local optimum
- ❌ Fractional translation - No improvements found
- ❌ Backward propagation - No improvements found
- ❌ Exhaustive search for N>2 - Too slow, baseline already optimal

## ⛔ FORBIDDEN (WILL BE REJECTED)
- Running bbox3/sa_fast as a binary without understanding what it does
- Expecting > 0.01 improvement from parameter tuning
- Ignoring overlap validation

## ✅ REQUIRED: SUBMIT FIRST, THEN EXPLORE
1. **SUBMIT exp_022** - Get LB feedback on our best CV score
2. **If LB matches CV (~70.317)** - Continue ensembling strategy
3. **If LB is worse** - Investigate precision/overlap issues

## Key Insight from Top Kernels
The bbox3-ensemble-update kernel:
1. Loads multiple submission sources
2. Builds ensemble by selecting best per-N
3. Runs bbox3 optimizer on the ensemble
4. Fixes overlaps by replacing with known-good solutions

We've done steps 1-2 and 4. Step 3 (running bbox3) might give additional improvements.
