## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.316648 from exp_020 (whynot_ensemble)
- Best LB score: 70.3535 (exp_016)
- Target: 68.877877 | Gap to target: 1.44 points (2.09%)

## Response to Evaluator
The evaluator correctly identified that:
1. The MIN_IMPROVEMENT=0.001 threshold was too conservative
2. The why-not submission should be used as the new baseline
3. A proper ensemble of why-not + team-blend + current achieves better scores

I implemented this recommendation in exp_020:
- Used why-not as base (70.332)
- Lowered threshold to 1e-10
- Found 125 improvements (vs 2 with old threshold)
- Achieved 70.316648 (improvement of 0.027 over exp_019's 70.343)

## Submission Log
| Exp | Approach | CV | LB | Notes |
|-----|----------|----|----|-------|
| 001 | valid_baseline | 70.615 | 70.615 | First valid submission |
| 010 | safe_ensemble | 70.365 | 70.365 | MIN_IMPROVEMENT=0.001 |
| 016 | mega_ensemble | 70.354 | 70.354 | Best LB so far |
| 019 | comprehensive_external | 70.343 | pending | Too conservative threshold |
| 020 | whynot_ensemble | 70.317 | pending | **SUBMIT THIS** |

## What We've Learned
1. **External data is the key lever** - why-not (70.332) and team-blend (70.331) are better than our baseline
2. **Overlap validation is critical** - 2517 potential improvements rejected due to overlaps
3. **Small N values dominate** - N=1-10 contribute ~4.3 points (6% of total)
4. **The baseline is at a strong local optimum** - SA, GA, exhaustive search all failed

## Gap Analysis
- Current: 70.316648
- Target: 68.877877
- Gap: 1.44 points (2.09%)

**Top N values by score (most room for improvement):**
- N=1: 0.661 (already optimal at 45°)
- N=2: 0.451
- N=3: 0.435
- N=4-10: 0.38-0.42 each

**The gap is too large for incremental improvements!**
At 0.01 improvement per experiment, we need 144 more experiments.
We need a BREAKTHROUGH approach.

## ⛔ WHAT HAS FAILED (DO NOT REPEAT)
- Simulated Annealing (exp_003) - NO improvements
- Exhaustive search for N=2 (exp_004) - baseline is optimal
- NFP placement (exp_005) - NO improvements
- Multi-start random (exp_006) - 73% WORSE than baseline
- Genetic Algorithm (exp_018) - NO improvements
- Backward propagation (exp_002) - NO improvements
- Fractional translation (exp_011) - NO improvements

## ✅ WHAT WORKS
- Ensemble from external sources (exp_007-020)
- Using validated kernel outputs (why-not, team-blend)
- Overlap validation with Shapely

## NEXT EXPERIMENT: SUBMIT exp_020 AND ANALYZE

**IMMEDIATE ACTION: Submit exp_020 to get LB feedback**

The CV score of 70.316648 is our best yet. We need to verify it passes Kaggle validation.

## AFTER SUBMISSION: Research Breakthrough Approaches

The gap of 1.44 points is too large for incremental improvements. We need to research:

1. **What do top teams do differently?**
   - Top score is 68.89 - they found 1.44 points of improvement somewhere
   - Read discussions about asymmetric solutions, tessellations, etc.

2. **Theoretical lower bounds**
   - What's the minimum possible score?
   - Are there mathematical insights we're missing?

3. **Novel algorithms not yet tried:**
   - Branch-and-bound for small N (guarantee optimal)
   - Constraint programming
   - Tessellation patterns for large N

## CRITICAL: The Path to 68.89

The top teams achieved 68.89 through:
1. **900+ submissions** - accumulating best per-N over time
2. **Novel algorithms** - not just running bbox3 repeatedly
3. **Per-N specialization** - different approaches for different N ranges

We have 91 submissions remaining. We need to:
1. Submit every experiment to get LB feedback
2. Track which N values each approach does well on
3. Build ensemble of best per-N from all sources

## Forbidden Actions
- ❌ Running bbox3/sa_fast binaries (GLIBC incompatible)
- ❌ Micro-optimizations (< 0.01 improvement)
- ❌ Repeating failed approaches (SA, GA, exhaustive)

## Required Actions
1. **SUBMIT exp_020** - get LB feedback
2. **Research top discussions** - what do winners say?
3. **Implement novel algorithm** - branch-and-bound for N≤20
4. **Track per-N improvements** - build ensemble over time
