## What We've Learned
1. **Public data is exhausted**: We've downloaded ALL available external datasets and kernel outputs
2. **Our ensemble beats all public kernels**: 70.316600 vs best public 70.319731
3. **Many snapshot files have overlaps**: 2517 improvements rejected due to overlaps
4. **MIN_IMPROVEMENT threshold was too conservative**: Lowering to 1e-10 found more improvements
5. **The gap is still 1.44 points**: Need fundamentally different approach

## Response to Evaluator
The evaluator correctly identified that:
1. The MIN_IMPROVEMENT=0.001 threshold was leaving gains on the table - FIXED by lowering to 1e-10
2. The why-not submission should be used as baseline - DONE, it's now part of our ensemble
3. We need to build ensemble with NO threshold - DONE

However, even with all these fixes, we're still 1.44 points from target. The evaluator's analysis was correct but the gains were smaller than expected (0.027 improvement, not 0.021).

## Critical Analysis
**We've hit the ceiling of public data sources.**

The best public kernel scores 70.319731. Our ensemble of ALL sources scores 70.316600.
This is only 0.003 better than the best public kernel.

**The top teams (68.89) must have:**
1. Run bbox3/SA for MUCH longer (hours/days instead of minutes)
2. Implemented novel algorithms that aren't public
3. Access to private data sources

## Next Experiment: EXTENDED BBOX3 OPTIMIZATION

Since we've exhausted public data, we need to GENERATE new solutions.

### APPROACH: Run bbox3 for extended periods on specific N values

**Step 1: Identify N values with most room for improvement**
```python
# N values where our score is furthest from theoretical minimum
# Focus on N=30-100 where bbox3 can make biggest impact
```

**Step 2: Run bbox3 with high iteration counts**
```bash
# Run bbox3 for 30+ minutes per N value
./bbox3 -n 5000 -r 100 -i input.csv -o output.csv
```

**Step 3: Validate and ensemble**
- Check for overlaps before accepting
- Keep best per-N from all runs
- Build new ensemble

### ALTERNATIVE: Implement novel algorithm

If bbox3 doesn't work (GLIBC issues), implement from scratch:

1. **Simulated Annealing with better moves**:
   - Swap two trees
   - Rotate cluster of trees together
   - Translate entire configuration

2. **Genetic Algorithm**:
   - Crossover: combine partial solutions
   - Mutation: perturb positions/angles
   - Selection: keep best per-N

3. **Constructive heuristic**:
   - Bottom-left placement
   - NFP-guided placement
   - Greedy angle optimization

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: SUBMIT exp_020!

We have 91 submissions remaining. exp_020 (70.316600) is our best CV score.
**SUBMIT IT** to get LB feedback before trying new approaches.

## What NOT to Try
- ❌ Downloading more external data (we have ALL of it)
- ❌ Lowering MIN_IMPROVEMENT further (already at 1e-10)
- ❌ Re-running the same ensemble code (no new data to add)
- ❌ Small parameter tweaks (need fundamentally different approach)

## Priority Order
1. **SUBMIT exp_020** to get LB feedback
2. **Try running bbox3** for extended periods (if GLIBC works)
3. **Implement novel algorithm** if bbox3 doesn't work
4. **Focus on specific N values** where we're furthest from optimal
