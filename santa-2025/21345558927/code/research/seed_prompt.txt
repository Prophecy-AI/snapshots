## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.316648 from exp_020 (why-not ensemble)
- Best LB score: 70.3535 from exp_016
- Target: 68.877877 | Gap to target: 1.44 points (2.1%)
- Submissions used: 9/100 (91 remaining!)

## Response to Evaluator

The evaluator correctly identified that:
1. **MIN_IMPROVEMENT=0.001 was too conservative** - We were leaving 0.02+ points on the table
2. **why-not submission is validated and has no overlaps** - It should be used as the base
3. **Building ensemble with NO threshold** found 142 N improvements totaling 0.027 points

I've implemented the evaluator's recommendation and achieved CV=70.316648, an improvement of 0.027 over exp_019 (70.343408). This is now our best CV score.

## Submission Log
| Exp | Approach | CV | LB | Notes |
|-----|----------|----|----|-------|
| 001 | baseline | 70.615 | 70.615 | First valid submission |
| 010 | safe_ensemble | 70.365 | 70.365 | MIN_IMPROVEMENT=0.001 |
| 016 | mega_ensemble | 70.354 | 70.354 | Best LB so far |
| 019 | comprehensive_external | 70.343 | pending | Downloaded 12+ datasets |
| 020 | whynot_ensemble | 70.317 | pending | **BEST CV - SUBMIT THIS!** |

## What We've Learned
1. **External data is the key lever** - All improvements come from ensembling external sources
2. **why-not and team-blend are the best sources** - Score 70.332 and 70.331 respectively
3. **2517 potential improvements rejected due to overlaps** - Many external files have invalid data
4. **MIN_IMPROVEMENT threshold was hurting us** - Lowering to 1e-8 found 142 additional improvements

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: SUBMIT exp_020 IMMEDIATELY!

exp_020 has CV=70.316648 which is:
- 0.037 better than best LB (70.3535)
- 0.027 better than exp_019
- Validated with no overlaps

**SUBMIT THIS NOW** to get LB feedback. With 91 submissions remaining, we can afford to submit every experiment.

## Next Experiment Strategy

After submitting exp_020, the next priority is to find MORE external data sources. The jonathanchan kernel uses 19 sources - we're missing several:

### Missing Sources to Download:
1. `santa25-improved-sa-with-translations` - Not in our collection
2. `santa-2025-fix-direction` - Not in our collection
3. `72-71-santa-2025-jit-parallel-sa-c` - Not in our collection
4. `blending-multiple-oplimisation` - Not in our collection
5. `santa2025-just-keep-on-trying` - Not in our collection
6. `jwt/other/csv/19` - Private dataset, may not be accessible

### Experiment 021: Download Missing Sources + Rebuild Ensemble

```python
# Download missing datasets
kaggle datasets download -d egortrushin/santa25-improved-sa-with-translations
kaggle datasets download -d chistyakov/santa-2025-fix-direction
kaggle datasets download -d seshurajup/72-71-santa-2025-jit-parallel-sa-c
kaggle datasets download -d jazivxt/blending-multiple-oplimisation
kaggle datasets download -d seowoohyeon/santa2025-just-keep-on-trying

# Download more kernel outputs
kaggle kernels output egortrushin/santa25-simulated-annealing-with-translations
kaggle kernels output chistyakov/santa-2025-simple-optimization-new-slow-version
kaggle kernels output chistyakov/santa-2025-fix-direction
```

### After Getting More Data:
1. Rebuild ensemble with ALL sources
2. Use why-not as base (validated, no overlaps)
3. NO threshold - accept any improvement
4. Validate entire submission before submitting

## What NOT to Try
- ❌ Running bbox3/sa_fast binaries (GLIBC incompatible)
- ❌ Python SA/GA optimization (baseline is at strong local optimum)
- ❌ MIN_IMPROVEMENT > 0.0001 (too conservative)
- ❌ Files with "ensemble_best.csv" or "candidate_" (have overlaps)

## Gap Analysis

Current gap: 1.44 points (2.1%)
- At 0.027 improvement per experiment, need ~53 more experiments
- BUT: We're running out of unique external sources
- Need to find fundamentally different approaches OR more data

## Potential Breakthrough Approaches

If external data is exhausted, consider:
1. **Compile bbox3 from source** - The C++ code is available in kernels
2. **Run jonathanchan's C++ optimizer** - It has parallel SA with 150k iterations
3. **Implement fix_direction optimization** - Rotate entire configuration to minimize bbox
4. **Back-propagation from large N** - Use N=200 solutions to improve smaller N

## IMMEDIATE ACTION

1. **SUBMIT exp_020** - Get LB feedback on our best CV score
2. Download missing external sources
3. Rebuild ensemble with all sources
4. Submit again

With 91 submissions remaining, we should submit EVERY experiment to get LB feedback!
