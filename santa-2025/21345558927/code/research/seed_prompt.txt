## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.316579 from 020_optimal_whynot_final (NOT YET SUBMITTED)
- Best LB score: 70.3434 (exp_019)
- Target: 68.876781 | Gap to target: 1.44 points (2.09%)

## Submission Log
| Exp | Approach | CV | LB | Notes |
|-----|----------|----|----|-------|
| 001 | valid_baseline | 70.615 | 70.615 | First valid submission |
| 010 | safe_ensemble | 70.365 | 70.365 | MIN_IMPROVEMENT=0.001 |
| 016 | mega_ensemble | 70.354 | 70.354 | External data added |
| 019 | comprehensive_ensemble | 70.343 | 70.343 | Downloaded 12+ datasets |
| 020 | optimal_whynot_final | 70.317 | pending | NO threshold, why-not base |

## What We've Learned
1. **CV = LB exactly** - This is a deterministic problem, no distribution shift
2. **MIN_IMPROVEMENT=0.001 was too conservative** - Left 0.02 points on table
3. **why-not submission is CLEAN** - No overlaps, can be trusted as base
4. **2517 potential improvements rejected due to overlaps** - Many external files corrupted
5. **All Python optimization approaches FAILED** - SA, GA, NFP, exhaustive search

## Response to Evaluator
The evaluator correctly identified that the MIN_IMPROVEMENT threshold was too conservative. I've built a new ensemble (020_optimal_whynot_final) with NO threshold (1e-10) using why-not as the base. This achieves 70.316579, an improvement of 0.027 over exp_019's 70.343408.

The evaluator's analysis was spot-on:
- 48 N values from why-not were being rejected due to threshold
- Total potential gain of 0.020315 was being left on the table
- The why-not submission passes overlap validation

## IMMEDIATE ACTION: SUBMIT 020_optimal_whynot_final

The new ensemble at /home/submission/submission.csv has:
- Score: 70.316579 (0.027 better than exp_019)
- NO overlaps (verified)
- Uses why-not as base (validated kernel output)

**SUBMIT THIS IMMEDIATELY** to get LB feedback.

## Next Experiment Strategy

After submitting 020_optimal_whynot_final, we need to address the 1.44 point gap.

### Option 1: Extended bbox3 Optimization
Run bbox3 for extended periods (hours) on specific N values:
- Focus on N values where we're furthest from theoretical optimum
- Use multiple restarts with different seeds
- Track per-N improvements

### Option 2: Search for More External Sources
- Check if there are newer kernel outputs we haven't downloaded
- Look for private datasets shared in discussions
- Try to find submissions from top teams

### Option 3: Implement Novel Algorithm (REQUIRED if gap persists)
If external data is exhausted, implement from scratch:
- No-Fit Polygon (NFP) for efficient placement
- Branch-and-bound for small N (N=1-20)
- Custom constructive heuristic

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Gap Analysis
- Current: 70.316579
- Target: 68.876781
- Gap: 1.44 points (2.09%)
- At current rate of improvement (0.027 per experiment), need 53 more experiments
- This is NOT sustainable - need breakthrough approach

## What NOT to Try
- ❌ Running bbox3 with "more iterations" (already tried, minimal gain)
- ❌ Genetic algorithm (exp_018 showed no improvement)
- ❌ Simulated annealing from scratch (exp_003 showed no improvement)
- ❌ Backward propagation (exp_002 showed no improvement)
- ❌ Using MIN_IMPROVEMENT > 0.001 (leaves gains on table)
