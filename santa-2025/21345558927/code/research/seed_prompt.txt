## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.615102 from exp_001 (valid baseline)
- Best LB score: 70.615102 (confirmed match)
- Target: 68.880887 | Gap to target: 1.73 points (2.5%)

## CRITICAL ISSUE: exp_007 FAILED DUE TO NaN VALUES

The previous submission (exp_007_ensemble_fractional) failed with "Evaluation metric raised an unexpected error" because:
- N=24 solution had `snan` (NaN) values in the x column
- The "experiments" source that contributed N=24 had corrupted data
- This caused Kaggle to reject the entire submission

**FIX APPLIED:** The baseline (70.615102) has been restored as the current submission.

## Submission Log
| Exp | Approach | CV | LB | Notes |
|-----|----------|----|----|-------|
| 000 | baseline ensemble | 70.523 | FAILED | Overlapping trees in group 002 |
| 001 | valid baseline | 70.615 | 70.615 | ✅ PASSED - this is our reference |
| 002 | backward propagation | 70.615 | 70.615 | No improvement |
| 007 | ensemble fractional | 70.266 | FAILED | NaN values in N=24 |

## What We've Learned

### 1. Ensemble Scanning Results (CRITICAL)
- Scanned 2,347 CSV files from snapshots
- Found only 66 valid improvements (total 0.002 points)
- **2,955 potential improvements REJECTED due to overlapping trees**
- The baseline is at an EXTREMELY strong local optimum

### 2. Why Improvements Are So Small
- Most "better" solutions in snapshots have overlapping trees
- Solutions that pass overlap validation are nearly identical to baseline
- The top improvements are tiny: N=36 improved by 0.00033, N=65 by 0.00033

### 3. Top Kernels Use C++ Optimizers
- jazivxt/why-not uses bbox3.cpp with OpenMP
- These achieve sub-70 scores through intensive parallel optimization
- Python implementations cannot match this speed

## Response to Evaluator

The evaluator correctly identified that:
1. The N=24 anomaly was suspicious (it was corrupted data)
2. External public datasets should be explored
3. Fractional translation should be implemented

However, the core issue is that **the baseline is already highly optimized**. Scanning 2,347 files yielded only 0.002 improvement. The path to 68.88 requires fundamentally different approaches.

## Strategic Analysis

### The Gap Problem
- Current: 70.615
- Target: 68.881
- Gap: 1.73 points (2.5%)

To close this gap, we need either:
1. **Many small improvements** - But ensemble scanning shows only 0.002 available
2. **One big breakthrough** - Requires novel algorithm implementation

### Why Ensemble Approach Has Limited Upside
- 2,955 "better" solutions were rejected due to overlaps
- This means the optimization landscape has many invalid local optima
- Valid solutions cluster around the same score (~70.6)

## Next Experiment: IMPLEMENT FRACTIONAL TRANSLATION

The evaluator suggested fractional translation. This is a technique that:
1. Makes tiny position adjustments (0.001 down to 0.00001)
2. Finds improvements that SA misses
3. Is used by top kernels AFTER ensembling

**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN:**
```python
# Fractional translation for each tree
frac_steps = [0.001, 0.0005, 0.0002, 0.0001, 0.00005, 0.00002, 0.00001]
directions = [(0,1), (0,-1), (1,0), (-1,0), (1,1), (1,-1), (-1,1), (-1,-1)]

for n in range(1, 201):
    trees = load_solution(n)
    for tree_idx in range(n):
        for step in frac_steps:
            for dx, dy in directions:
                # Try moving tree by (dx*step, dy*step)
                new_trees = move_tree(trees, tree_idx, dx*step, dy*step)
                if no_overlaps(new_trees) and score(new_trees) < score(trees):
                    trees = new_trees
                    print(f"N={n}: Improved by moving tree {tree_idx}")
```

**Expected outcome:** Small but valid improvements that accumulate across all N values.

## What NOT to Try
- ❌ More ensemble scanning (already exhausted with 2,347 files)
- ❌ Running bbox3/sa_fast binaries (we cannot use C++ optimizers)
- ❌ Random restarts (baseline is too strong)
- ❌ Backward propagation (already tried, no improvement)

## SUBMIT STRATEGY

With 97 submissions remaining, we should:
1. Submit the baseline (70.615) to confirm it still works
2. Implement fractional translation
3. Submit any improvement, no matter how small
4. Track per-N improvements for future ensembling

The path to 68.88 is through accumulating many small improvements over many submissions, just like the top teams did with 900+ submissions.
