## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.316600 (from 020_proper_ensemble using why-not as base)
- Best LB score: 70.3535 (exp_016) - NOT YET SUBMITTED the 70.316600
- Target: 68.876781 | Gap to target: 1.44 points (2.0%)

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: SUBMIT THE NEW ENSEMBLE IMMEDIATELY!

The current submission at /home/submission/submission.csv scores 70.316600.
This is BETTER than our best LB (70.3535) by 0.037 points!
**SUBMIT THIS FIRST** before any other work.

## Submission Log (TRACK EVERYTHING!)
| Exp | Approach | CV | LB | Notes |
|-----|----------|----|----|-------|
| 001 | valid_baseline | 70.615 | 70.615 | First valid submission |
| 002 | backward_propagation | 70.615 | 70.615 | No improvement |
| 010 | safe_ensemble | 70.365 | 70.365 | MIN_IMPROVEMENT=0.001 |
| 016 | mega_ensemble | 70.354 | 70.354 | Best LB so far |
| 019 | comprehensive_ensemble | 70.343 | pending | Evaluator found issues |
| 020 | proper_ensemble | 70.317 | **SUBMIT!** | why-not base + team-blend |

## Response to Evaluator

The evaluator correctly identified that:
1. **MIN_IMPROVEMENT threshold was too conservative** - lowering it found 157 improvements
2. **why-not submission should be the base** - it's validated and scores 70.332
3. **Proper ensemble achieves 70.316600** - 0.027 better than exp_019

I've built the proper ensemble as recommended. The submission is ready at /home/submission/submission.csv.

## What We've Learned

1. **External data is the key lever** - why-not (70.332) + team-blend (70.331) are best sources
2. **Overlap validation is critical** - 2517 potential improvements rejected due to overlaps
3. **All Python optimization failed** - SA, GA, exhaustive, NFP, backward propagation all stuck
4. **The baseline is at extremely strong local optimum** - can't improve with local search

## Gap Analysis

- Current: 70.316600
- Target: 68.876781
- Gap: 1.44 points (2.0%)

**This gap is TOO LARGE for micro-optimizations!**
- At 0.01 improvement per experiment, would need 144 experiments
- We've done 20 experiments with total improvement of ~0.3 points
- Need a BREAKTHROUGH approach

## Next Experiment Strategy

### IMMEDIATE: Submit exp_020 (70.316600)
The submission is ready. Submit it to get LB feedback.

### THEN: Research Asymmetric Solutions
The discussion "Why the winning solutions will be Asymmetric" (40 votes) suggests:
- Symmetric solutions are local optima
- Asymmetric configurations can achieve better packing
- Top teams use 24 CPUs to search asymmetric space

### THEN: Run bbox3 for Extended Periods
The bbox3 binary is available at /home/code/experiments/bbox3
- Top kernels run it for hours/days
- Each run can find small improvements
- Accumulate improvements over many runs

### THEN: Implement Novel Algorithms
If bbox3 doesn't help, implement from scratch:
1. **Branch-and-bound for small N** - guarantee optimal for N=1-20
2. **Genetic algorithm with asymmetric crossover** - explore asymmetric space
3. **Constraint programming** - model as constraints, let solver find solutions

## ⛔ FORBIDDEN (WILL BE REJECTED)
- Running bbox3 with same parameters repeatedly (diminishing returns)
- "Optimizing" existing CSV files with SA (already at local optimum)
- Ensemble approaches without new data sources (exhausted)
- MIN_IMPROVEMENT > 0.0001 (too conservative)

## ✅ REQUIRED ACTIONS

1. **SUBMIT** the current submission (70.316600)
2. **RESEARCH** asymmetric solutions discussion
3. **RUN** bbox3 for extended period (1+ hours) on specific N values
4. **TRACK** per-N improvements from each run
5. **ACCUMULATE** best per-N across all experiments

## Key Insight: Accumulation Strategy

Top teams have 900+ submissions because they:
1. Run many experiments
2. Keep best per-N from EACH experiment
3. Final submission = ensemble of all best per-N
4. Even small improvements (0.0001) accumulate

**We should do the same:**
- Submit after EVERY experiment
- Track per-N scores
- Build ensemble of best per-N across all experiments
- Even if total score is worse, individual N improvements are valuable
