## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.316600 from 020_optimal_ensemble (NOT YET SUBMITTED!)
- Best LB score: 70.353516 (exp_016)
- Target: 68.876781 | Gap to target: 1.44 points (2.1%)

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: SUBMIT THE BEST ENSEMBLE FIRST!

The 020_optimal_ensemble (CV=70.316600) has NOT been submitted yet!
This is 0.037 points better than our best LB (70.353516).

**IMMEDIATE ACTION: Submit exp_020 to get LB feedback!**

The submission is already in /home/submission/submission.csv and passes local overlap validation.

## Response to Evaluator

The evaluator correctly identified that:
1. The MIN_IMPROVEMENT=0.001 threshold was too conservative
2. The why-not submission has valid improvements we were rejecting
3. We should use a lower threshold (or no threshold) with proper overlap validation

**Action taken:** The 020_optimal_ensemble already uses no threshold and incorporates all valid improvements from why-not, team-blend, and other sources. Score: 70.316600.

**Disagreement:** The evaluator suggested the why-not submission alone would give 70.322. Our comprehensive ensemble achieves 70.316600 - even better because it combines the best per-N from ALL sources.

## What We've Learned (from LB feedback)

1. **Overlap validation is CRITICAL** - 5/9 submissions failed due to overlaps
2. **CV = LB exactly** when validation passes (deterministic problem)
3. **External data ensemble is the ONLY approach that works** - all Python optimization failed
4. **The baseline is at an EXTREMELY strong local optimum** - SA, GA, NFP, exhaustive all failed

## ⛔ FORBIDDEN (PROVEN TO NOT WORK)

- ❌ Simulated Annealing (exp_003) - NO improvements found
- ❌ Genetic Algorithm (exp_018) - NO improvements found  
- ❌ NFP placement (exp_005) - NO improvements found
- ❌ Exhaustive search (exp_004) - Baseline already optimal
- ❌ Backward propagation (exp_002) - NO improvements found
- ❌ Multi-start random (exp_006) - MUCH WORSE than baseline
- ❌ Fractional translation (exp_011) - NO improvements found

## Next Experiment: SUBMIT 020_optimal_ensemble

**IMMEDIATE ACTION:**
1. Submit the 020_optimal_ensemble (CV=70.316600)
2. This is our best score and passes local overlap validation
3. Expected LB: ~70.316600 (CV = LB for this problem)

## After Submission: Strategy for Closing the Gap

The gap is 1.44 points (2.1%). This is LARGE. Options:

### Option 1: Find More External Data Sources
- Search for more Kaggle datasets with Santa 2025 solutions
- Download kernel outputs from more public kernels
- Look for team-shared solutions in discussions

### Option 2: Run bbox3 for Extended Periods
- The top teams run bbox3 for HOURS to find improvements
- We have bbox3 compiled - could run it on specific N values
- Focus on N values where we're furthest from theoretical optimum

### Option 3: Implement Novel Algorithms (HARD)
- All Python approaches have failed
- Would need to implement something fundamentally different
- Consider: constraint programming, branch-and-bound for small N

### Option 4: Study Top Kernels More Carefully
- The bbox3-ensemble-update kernel achieves 70.319731
- The why-not kernel achieves 70.332155
- What are they doing that we're not?

## Per-N Analysis Needed

After submission, analyze:
1. Which N values are we furthest from optimal?
2. Which N values do top kernels do better on?
3. Are there patterns (small N vs large N)?

## What NOT to Try

- Any Python optimization (SA, GA, NFP, etc.) - ALL FAILED
- Small parameter tweaks - won't close 1.44 point gap
- More ensemble variations without new data sources
