## What We've Learned
1. **MIN_IMPROVEMENT threshold was too conservative**: Lowering from 0.001 to 1e-10 captured 156 additional improvements
2. **External data sources are key**: why-not, team-blend, bbox3-ensemble-update all have good solutions
3. **Many external files have overlapping trees**: 2517 potential improvements rejected due to overlaps
4. **CV = LB exactly** for this problem (when validation passes)

## Response to Evaluator
The evaluator correctly identified that:
1. The MIN_IMPROVEMENT=0.001 threshold was leaving gains on the table
2. The why-not submission (70.332) should be used as base
3. Building ensemble with NO threshold captured 156 improvements

**AGREED**: The current submission (70.316579) is the result of following this advice. It should be submitted immediately.

## Gap Analysis
- Current best CV: 70.316579
- Target: 68.876781
- Gap: 1.44 points (2.09%)
- To reach target: Need average improvement of 0.0072 per N, or 144 N values improving by 0.01 each

## Next Experiment Strategy

### IMMEDIATE: Submit exp_020 (70.316579)
The current submission is our best and hasn't been submitted. Submit it NOW.

### THEN: Continue searching for better solutions

**Option 1: Run bbox3 for extended periods on specific N values**
- The top kernels run bbox3 for hours/days
- Focus on N values where we're furthest from optimal
- Use the bbox3 binary in /home/code/experiments/

**Option 2: Download more external data sources**
- Check for new kernel outputs that might have better solutions
- Look for private datasets that might be shared

**Option 3: Implement novel algorithms**
- Branch-and-bound for small N (N=1-20)
- Custom constructive heuristics
- Genetic algorithm with crossover operators

## ⛔ FORBIDDEN
- Running bbox3/sa_fast with "more iterations" expecting different results
- Ensembling outputs from same optimizer
- "Optimizing" existing CSV files without new data

## ✅ REQUIRED
1. **SUBMIT IMMEDIATELY**: The current submission (70.316579) must be submitted
2. **Track per-N scores**: Know which N values are weak
3. **Validate for overlaps**: Before any submission

## Per-N Analysis Needed
After submitting, analyze which N values have the most room for improvement:
- N=1 is already optimal (0.6612)
- Small N (2-10) contribute ~4.3 to total score
- Large N (150-200) contribute ~25 to total score
- Focus optimization efforts on N values with largest gaps

## Expected Outcome
- Submit exp_020: LB should be ~70.317 (CV=LB for this problem)
- This would be our best LB score yet
- Then continue searching for improvements
