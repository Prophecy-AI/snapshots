The santa-2025.csv is at a tight local optimum - short optimization runs find NO improvements. Need: 1) Much longer optimization runs (hours), 2) Lattice-based approach for large N, 3) Focus on small N values (1-10) which have highest score contribution.",

      "finding": "Two\u2011dimensional irregular\u2011polygon nesting is usually tackled by a combination of **exact optimisation** and **high\u2011performance heuristics**, each of which is designed to shrink the axis\u2011aligned bounding rectangle (the \u201cbounding box\u201d) as much as possible.\n\n*Exact approaches* model the placement of non\u2011convex pieces as a global non\u2011linear programme.  Jones (2013) introduced a fully general exact algorithm that replaces the non\u2011overlap constraints between polygons with constraints between a small set of **inscribed circles**; the resulting quadratic\u2011programming sub\u2011problems give tight lower bounds, while a local\u2011search phase supplies feasible upper bounds\u202f([springer](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10898-013-0129-z)).  A related \u201cphi\u2011function\u201d technique solves small instances of convex polygons to optimality with the global NLP solver BARON, directly minimising the perimeter (and thus the area) of the enclosing rectangle\u202f([semanticscholar](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/bf98/",
