The improved algorithm can cope with complex cases and is given an implementation in detail. The proposed concept of a touching group can simplify the judging process when recognizing the potential translation vector for an orbital polygon. In addition, the generation of the no-fit polygon only involves three main steps based on the proposed concept. The proposed algorithm has a mechanism that searches other start positions to generate a complete no-fit polygon for handling complex cases. To improve the efficiency, many acceleration strategies have been proposed, such as point exclusion strategy and point inclusion test. The robust and efficient performance of the algorithm is tested by well-known benchmark instances and degenerate and complex cases, such as holes, interlocking concavities and jigsaw-type pieces. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can produce complete no-fit polygons for complex cases, and acceleration strategies can reduce the creation time of no-fit polygon on benchmark instances by more than sixteen percent on average.\nKeywords:\n[no-fit polygon](https://www.mdpi.com/search?q=no-fit+polygon);[irregular packing problem](https://www.mdpi.com/search?q=irregular+packing+problem);[sliding algorithm](https://www.mdpi.com/search?q=sliding+algorithm);[cutting](https://www.mdpi.com/search?q=cutting);[configuration space obstacle](https://www.mdpi.com/search?q=configuration+space+obstacle)\nMSC:\n90; 68; 51\n## 1. Introduction\nIn the field of cutting and packing problems, there is a kind of problem known as the two-dimensional (2D) irregular packing problem or the nesting problem. It is commonly encountered in many industries and applications, such as metal sheet cutting [1,2], leather [3], clothing [4], paper [5] and spatial arrangement [6]. Through excellent algorithms to optimize the packing, even a one percent increase in the material utilization rate will save lots of resource costs for enterprises and generate huge economic benefits for the whole society. Despite the many practical applications and benefits, the problem has received relatively little attention in the literature when compared to the regular packing problem [7,8,9]. One of the main reasons is that researchers have to deal with the geometry problem, which is the first obstacle they encounter. This means that satisfying the constraint of having all irregular pieces without overlapping is much harder than regular pieces.\nDirect trigonometry involving line intersection and point inclusion testing is the classic method to identify the positional relationship between two polygons. However, the optimization algorithms will become inefficient when it adopts this method, which results in the slightly poor performance of the algorithms. The alternative used in irregular packing problems is the no-fit polygon (NFP), which is also used in the field of engineering and robot motion planning and the aircraft parking stand allocation problem [10]. The no-fit polygon facilitates the research of irregular packing problems [11,12,13,14]. It is an increasingly popular option since it is more efficient than direct trigonometry, particularly when using an iterative search. Determining whether polygons overlap, touch, or are separated only needs to conduct a simple test to identify whether the reference point is inside the NFP. Essentially, the no-fit polygon describes the region in which two polygons intersect. The computational efficiency gained by utilizing this method is very attractive. Hence, it is important to develop an algorithm for creating NFP for the research of irregular packing problems. The algorithm can enrich the application in 2D geometrical computer software.\nHowever, there are few published works on algorithms for generating NFP. Note the fact that developing a robust geometry library is still needed, and this task is very time-consuming and difficult. Furthermore, it is difficult to develop a robust NFP generator because of the complexity of irregular piece shapes. Thus, we propose an improved sliding algorithm for the generation of NFP and give an implementation in detail of our algorithm. Such an algorithm can become good preparation for applying more strategies to solve the irregular packing problem. For instance, in the work published by Costa et al. [15], if the NFP algorithm is efficient, it can directly calculate the new merged piece instead of approximating by one already computed because of this time-consuming operation. In other words, the more efficient the algorithm is, the better.\nThe proposed algorithm only involves two simple geometric stages. The first is generating the external NFP between two polygons, which includes three main steps: finding the touching group, determining the translation vector from all touching groups and computing the translation distance. The second stage is searching on the unvisited edges to determine whether there is a feasible starting point that can be found. If the starting point is available, then return to the first stage to generate the NFP.\nThe contributions of this study are:\n* To address the problem of the efficient and robust creation of the no-fit polygon;\n* To propose an improved sliding algorithm and provide a detailed implementation;\n* To present the concept of touching group, resulting in the number of cases to consider being reduced by half when determining the feasible translation vector;\n* To develop many acceleration strategies to improve the algorithm\u2019s efficiency, such as the point exclusion strategy, the right side test, and the point inclusion test;\n* To assess the performance of the proposed alg...",

Introduction\nThe irregular two-dimensional variant of the cutting and packing problem impacts upon several important\nmanufacturing industries such as textiles, plastics, metal cutting and others. These problems usually consist of\na number of irregular pieces that are to be placed onto one or more sheets of material in the most efficient\nlayout possible, so that all pieces are assigned and do not overlap. Additionally, there are usually rotational\nconstraints enforced on the pieces due to the physical properties of the problem such as grain on the material,\npatterns on textiles and the cutting technology being employed.

There\nhave been many different strategies for producing solutions to the irregular stock cutting problem. These\ninclude linear programming approaches, heuristic placement methods, metaheuristic guided search techniques\nand other novel approaches such as the iterative jostling of pieces (Dowsland et al., 1998). Survey papers can\nbe found in (Dowsland and Dowsland, 1992; Sweeney and Paternoster, 1992; Dyckhoff, 1990). However, the\nfeature that connects all of the approaches is that they are all required to cope with the geometry of the prob\u0002lem. This can be especially complicated when highly irregular shapes are used which may include holes or con\u0002cavities. The implementation of robust and efficient geometry routines can be laborious and can often take\nconsiderably longer than the packing strategies themselves. In particular, the geometry must handle all of\nthe interactions between shapes such as detecting whether two shapes are overlapping and calculating the\ntranslation distance required in a given direction so that the overlap is resolved. As we show in the following\nsection, although these tests can be implemented using trigonometric techniques, the no-fit polygon represents\na considerably more efficient solution.\nWhilst the generation of the no-fit polygon is academically challenging, it is a \u2018tool\u2019 and not a \u2018solution\u2019 and\nthis is perhaps one of the reasons why there are many publications in the literature which state that the no-fit\npolygon is used but which provide relatively little or no details on its implementation. In this paper we con\u0002centrate specifically on the no-fit polygon and provide an overview of the previous techniques that have been\nused for its creation. Furthermore, we describe and provide full implementation details for a new robust orbi\u0002tal approach that can cope with the traditional problem cases that many other approaches cannot handle.\nHopefully this will help in the further dissemination of the benefits of using the no-fit polygon (as opposed\nto traditional trigonometry based approaches) within both the industrial and the academic communities.\n2. The no-fit polygon \u2013 an overview\nIn this section we describe the functionality of the no-fit polygon and we compare it to the more traditional\ntrigonometric based overlap and intersection tests. We also give brief overviews of the many techniques that\nhave been used to generate no-fit polygons within the previous literature.\n2.1. The no-fit polygon\nThe first application of no-fit polygon techniques within the field of cutting and packing was presented by\nArt (1966), although the term \u2018\u2018shape envelop\u2019\u2019 was used. It was ten years later that the term \u2018\u2018no-fit polygon\u2019\u2019\nwas introduced by Adamowicz and Albano who approached the irregular stock cutting problem by using no\u0002fit polygons to pack shapes together using their minimum enclosing rectangles (Adamowicz and Albano,\n1976). The term \u2018\u2018configuration space obstacle\u2019\u2019 is often used to denote the NFP within the field of engineering\nand robot motion planning but the term has also been used with respect to cutting and packing in (Cuningh\u0002ame-Green, 1989). The \u2018\u2018hodograph\u2019\u2019 is often used to describe the no-fit polygon within the mathematics com\u0002munity (Stoyan and Ponomarenko, 1977; Scheithauer and Terno, 1993; Bennell et al., 2001). The main\nfunction of the no-fit polygon is to describe the region in which two polygons intersect. The following example\ngives an overview of the NFP construct.\nGiven two polygons, A and B, the no-fit polygon can be found by tracing one shape around the boundary\nof another. One of the polygons remains fixed in position and the other traverses around the fixed polygon\u2019s\nedges whilst ensuring that the polygons always touch but never intersect. Throughout this paper we adopt the\nconvention of the first polygon being fixed and the second being the traversing/orbiting polygon. Therefore,\nwhen polygon B traces around the fixed polygon A, the resulting no-fit polygon is denoted by NFPAB. In order\nto create the NFPAB object we must choose a reference point from B which will be traced as B moves around\nA. In our implementations we use the first vertex, within the shape vertex list, as the reference point (see\nFig. 1). The reference point can be any arbitrary point providing it follows the movements of the orbiting poly\u0002gon. It is also important to maintain the relative position of the reference point with respect to polygon B as\nthis is required when using the NFP to test for overlap.\nIn order to test whether polygon B overlaps polygon A we use NFPAB and B\u2019s reference point. If polygon B\nis positioned so that its reference point is inside the polygon NFPAB then it overlaps with polygon A. If the\n28 E.K. Burke et al. / European Journal of Operational Research 179 (2007) 27\u201349\nreference point is on the boundary of NFPAB then polygon B touches polygon A. Finally, if the reference point\nis outside of NFPAB then polygons A and B do not overlap or touch (see Fig. 2). The no-fit polygon is used\nwithin the following papers from the literature (Grinde and Cavalier, 1995; Ramkumar, 1996; Cheng and Rao,...",

The goal is to arrange these shapes in a way that minimizes wastage. This is known as the 2D packing problem. In this article, we will study at how to solve this problem using genetic algorithm.\n\ncovers a sub-problem of no-fit polygon required to solve the 2d packing problem. describes the genetic algorithm approach to solving the 2d packing problem. covers an industry-grade, opensource nesting software, Deepnest, built using the approach described in this article.\n\n## No-fit polygon\n\nSolving the 2D packing problem involves trying different placements of shapes on the sheet, adjusting their positions, and selecting the arrangement with the least unused space. A key challenge is ensuring that no shapes overlap during placement. To simplify, assume one shape is fixed at a certain location. The question then becomes: where can the next shape be placed so it does not overlap with the first? This is known as the no-fit polygon problem.\n\n### No-fit polygon for convex shapes\n\nThe paper [shoemaking and the milk tray problem](https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg12316773-700/) proved a result for the case of two convex polygons A and B. Let the two shapes be represented by their edges and a reference point. To obtain a no-fit polygon for two convex polygons, arrange the edges of A and -B in order of their slope.Deomonstration of no-fit polygon algorithm for convex shapes by CunninghameIn , shape A's edges are labelled as A0, A1, ..., A4; shape -B's edges are labelled as B0, B1 and B2.

      "text": "The no-fit polygon is a geometric construct that can offer faster and more efficient handling of geometry between pairs of shapes than traditional line-by-line intersection. The detection of intersections is a critical operation within the irregular two-dimensional stock-cutting problem (also known as \u201cnesting\u201d), which aims to place shapes onto sheets of material so that the material is utilised as efficiently as possible and the waste (or trim loss) is reduced. The problem forms an important process within many real-world manufacturing industries such as metalworking, automotive production, aerospace, clothing and conservatory manufacture, and others. If manufacturers can reduce their costs by utilising raw materials more effectively, this can directly translate into increased profit margins or greater competitiveness within the marketplace. Moreover, there are significant environmental benefits to be gained. Several methods have been proposed to calculate no-fit polygons, but most, if not all, can only operate on geometry that consists of line segments. This paper extends the orbital sliding method of calculating no-fit polygons to enable it to handle arcs and then shows the resultant no-fit polygons being utilised successfully on the two-dimensional irregular packing problem. As far as the authors are aware, this is the first time that a no-fit polygon algorithm has been able to handle arcs robustly without decomposing to their line approximations. The modification of the authors' previously published packing algorithm to utilise the proposed no-fit polygon approach yields solutions of excellent quality (including several best-known) on well-established literature benchmark problems after only a few minutes. The authors believe that the success of the packing strategy and the line and arc no-fit polygon algorithm make this approach a serious candidate for use in real-world production environments.",

Anything that works with distinct shapes should trivially work with identical shapes too. If you have an algorithm that works well for a rectangular boundary, you can try to adapt it for an arbitrary boundary. Modify it so that you can at a flip opre-fill your boundary with some shapes that cannot be moved or deleted (e.g. there's only one way to place them). Solve for a rectangular boundary, pre-filled with some shapes that just leave your original boundary unfilled. Not all algorithms can be adapted like this.\n\n\u2013\u00a0[n. m. could be an AI](https://stackoverflow.com/users/775806/n-m-could-be-an-ai)\n\nCommentedJul 28, 2011 at 20:22\n\n- The case with only one kind of filling polygon is definitely a special case of the general situation with different filling polys.

To put this in perspective, the (much) simpler case where you're packing the interior of your bounded polygon with non-overlapping disks is already hard, and disks are the simplest possible \"packing shape\" (with any other shape you have to consider orientation as well as size and center location).\n\nIn fact, I think it's an open problem in [computational geometry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_geometry) to determine for an arbitrary integer N and arbitrary bounded polygonal region (in the Euclidean plane), what is the \"optimal\" (in the sense of covering the greatest percentage of the polygon interior) packing of N inscribed non-overlapping disks, where you are free to choose the radius and center location of each disk. I'm sure the \"best\" answer _is_ known for certain special polygonal shapes (like rectangles, circles, and triangles), but for arbitrary shapes your best \"heuristic\" is probably:\n\n1. Start your shape counter at N.\n2. Add the largest \"packing shape\" you can fit completely inside the polygonal boundary without overlapping any other packing shapes.\n3. Decrement your shape counter.\n4. If your shape counter is > 0, go to step 2.\n\nI say \"probably\" because \"largest first\" isn't always the best way to pack things into a confined space. You can dig into that particular flavor of craziness by reading about the [bin packing problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bin_packing_problem) and [knapsack problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem).\n\n**EDIT:** Step 2 by itself is hard. A reasonable strategy would be to pick an arbitrary point on the interior of the polygon as the center and \"inflate\" the disk until it touches either the boundary or another disk (or both), and then \"slide\" the disk while continuing to inflate it so that it remains inside the boundary without overlapping any other disks until it is \"trapped\" - with at least 2 points of contact with the boundary and/or other disks. But it isn't easy to formalize this \"sliding process\". And even if you get the sliding process right, this strategy doesn't guarantee that you'll find the biggest \"inscribable disk\" - your \"locally maximal\" disk could be trapped in a \"lobe\" of the interior which is connected by a narrow \"neck\" of free space to a larger \"lobe\" where a larger disk would fit.\n\n[Share](https://stackoverflow.com/a/7342898)\n\n[Improve this answer](https://stackoverflow.com/posts/7342898/edit)\n\nFollow\n\n[edited Feb 27, 2013 at 20:29](https://stackoverflow.com/posts/7342898/revisions)\n\nanswered Sep 8, 2011 at 3:46\n\n[![Peter's user avatar](https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f031e9e9b7476fc5d3674fe4a9c59ef2?s=64&d=identicon&r=PG)](https://stackoverflow.com/users/227491/peter)\n\n[Peter](https://stackoverflow.com/users/227491/peter) Peter\n\n2,53611 gold badge2323 silver badges3232 bronze badges\n\n[Add a comment](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6864382/packing-arbitrary-polygons-within-an-arbitrary-boundary)\u00a0\\|\n\n3\n\nThanks for the replies, my requirements were such that I was able to further simplify the problem by not having to deal with orientation and I then even further simplified by only really wor...",

Raffensperger\n200 Armagh Street, P.O. Box 13-761, Christchurch, New Zealand\nAbstract\nThe no-fit polygon (NFP) is the set of feasible locations that one polygon may take with respect to another polygon,\nsuch that the polygons do not overlap. Feasible locations are required for most of the solutions to two-dimensional\npacking problems, and also for other problems such as robot motion planning.\nEfficient methods to calculate the NFP of two convex polygons, or one convex and one non-convex polygon\nhave been developed by other researchers. However, when both polygons are non-convex, the current methods of\ncalculation are inefficient or difficult to implement. This paper presents an extension of Ghosh\u2019s (CVGIP: Image\nUnderstanding 54(1991)119) NFP algorithm, and uses manipulation of sorted lists of polygon edges to find the NFP\nefficiently.\n2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Introduction\nAn issue in two-dimensional packing is determining the set of feasible locations that one polygon\nmay take with respect to another polygon, such that the polygons do not overlap. This set of locations is\nknown as a no-fit polygon (NFP). The terms Minkowski sum, -function, hodograph, dilation, envelope\nand configuration space obstacle have also been used by other researchers.\nLet each polygon be represented by an ordered list of edges. The location of each polygon i in the\ntwo-dimensional plane is represented by a reference point, . The reference point is located at point (0,\n0) of a polygon\u2019s local coordinate system (see Fig. 1).\nCorresponding author.

Polygon edge slope order is equivalent to NFP edge order.\nCunninghame-Green [2] showed that for the case when polygons A and B are convex, NFP[A, B] can\nbe created by ordering the edges of A and in increasing slope order. NFP[A, B]\u2019s edges correspond\nexactly to this slope order (see Fig. 4).\nWhen one or more of the polygons are non-convex, an obvious way of calculating the relevant NFP\nis to decompose each polygon i into a set of convex sub-polygons CSP 1 CSP . Overlap\nwill occur between the two polygons if any sub-polygon of A overlaps any sub-polygon of B. NFP[A, B]\nis the union of NFP CSP CSP , where 1 and 1 . There are two drawbacks to the polygon subdivision approach. Firstly, efficient algorithms are required\nfor polygon decomposition and polygon composition. Secondly, it is possible that a non-convex polygon\nthat has N edges in cavities (see Fig. 5) can be decomposed into no less than N CSPs. The NFP of two\nof these polygons would require the composition of 2 sub-NFPs. Polygons used in industries such as\ngarment manufacturing often have large numbers of edges in their curve-like cavities, and the sub-division\nH.T.

[7] states that a polygon is convex if and only if it does not contain any turning points.\nOtherwise it is non-convex. The initial stage of Ghosh\u2019s approach is to sort all the edges of polygon A and polygon B by slope into\none list which we will call MergeList. If both polygon A and B are convex, then MergeList gives the edge\norder for NFP[A, B], and the method is equivalent to that of Cunninghame-Green [2]. Assuming polygon A is non-convex, and polygon B is convex, the method proceeds as follows:\nStarting in MergeList at the first edge of polygon A, visit the edges of A in order, and add them to\nthe list of edges (NFPList) which make up NFP[A, B]. If edge A is a turning point, then the direction of\ntravel along MergeList is reversed. Any edges of B which are passed are added to NFPList. B edges are\npositive if the direction of travel forward, and negative if the direction is backward. This continues until\nthe first edge of polygon A has been returned to. The resulting NFPList we will call GhoshList. The above\nalgorithm is given in Pseudocode 2.1.\nPosition in MergeList which corresponds to 0\n0\nDir 1\nLoop{\nIf MergeList PolygonType Then\nIf MergeList PolygonIndex Then\nGhoshList GhoshList MergeList\nIf MergeList IsTurningPoint True Then Dir Dir 1\n1 If Size Then 0)\nEnd If\nElse\nGhoshList GhoshList MergeList Dir\nEnd If\nDir\n}While( 0)\nPseudocode 2.1: Algorithm to find GhoshList\nThe process of finding GhoshList is seen easily with what Ghosh calls a slope diagram (see Fig. 6).\nThe points on the diagram are at the slope of the edges of polygons A and B. Following around the slope diagram, starting and finishing at 0, mimics the process of traversing\nover MergeList. The outer envelope of NFPList gives NFP[A, B] (see Fig. 7).\nGhosh\u2019s method works for all simple polygons (no holes) when polygon A is non-convex and polygon\nB is convex. The method also works when both polygons are non-convex, as long as no two cavities from\neither polygon interfere which each other. This occurs when an interval of MergeList has wrongly ordered\nedges from both polygons. When this does occur, this interval must be traversed in two or more parallel\npaths. Although the theory of traversal by parallel paths holds true for complex non-convex cases, there\nare considerable implementation problems in sorting out the paths. These difficulties led Bennell et al.\n[7] to seek a different approach.\nH.T. Dean et al. / Computers & Operations Research 33 (2006) 1521 \u2013 1539 1527\nThe calculation difficulties of Bennell\u2019s method has motivated development of a more robust and\nefficient method of calculating NFPs. Like Bennell\u2019s method, it exploits the fact that the NFP of a non\u0002convex polygon and a convex polygon can be easily and efficiently found by Ghosh\u2019s method. However,\nthe new method does not use dummy edges to replace cavities of B.\n3. A new method\nIntuitively, it would seem a good idea to modify Bennell\u2019s method to start \u201clooking\u201d for the next B\nedge of a cavity once an occurrence of the current B edge has been found, instead of continuing to look\nfor the furthest occurrence of that B edge. However, if there is more than one occurrence of a B edge in\nany given segment then this approach will run into difficulties.\nA solution to this is to make sure that each traversal segment contains only positive or negative occur\u0002rences of each B edge of a particular cavity. Replacing a B cavity with a dummy edge D will not guarantee\nthis (see Fig. 8).\nFig. 8 shows a dummy edge D, whose cavity is composed of edges 1 and 2. In this example, Bennell\u2019s\nmethod would require only one segment which would contain a single occurrence of D. However, this\nsegment contains both positive and negative occurrences of 1.\nTo guarantee that there is only positive or negative occurrences of a given cavity B edge, we split the\ntraversal of GhoshList using the algorithm given in Pseudo-code 3.1:\nThe position in GhoshList which corresponds to 0.\nTravelDir 1\nCurrentSign 1\nTravelSign 1\n1\nLoop1{\nTravelDir\nIf GhoshList PolygonType Then\nIf GhoshList PolygonIndex 0 And TravelDir 1 Then\nSeg i End\nExit Algorithm\nElse If GhoshList IsTurningPoint True Then\nTravelSign TravelSign 1\nSeg Start\nEnd If\nElse If GhoshList IsInCavity True And CurrentSign TravelSign\nThen\nTravelDir TravelDir 1\nSeg Start\nTravelSign TravelSign 1\nExit Loop1\nEnd If\n}\nH.T.
