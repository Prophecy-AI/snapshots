      "text": "The most advanced techniques for escaping local optima in 2D polygon packing optimization problems often involve hybrid metaheuristic approaches that incorporate local search heuristics with global search strategies. One prominent method is the use of **self-adaptive evolutionary algorithms** combined with specialized heuristics such as the four corners\u2019 heuristic, which enhances exploration capabilities by adaptively adjusting the search process to avoid stagnation in local optima ([ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0377221706003018)). Additionally, **simulated annealing** with adaptive neighborhoods has been effectively applied to irregular packing problems, leveraging probabilistic acceptance of worse solutions to escape local minima ([ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S147466701535549X)). \n\nAnother sophisticated approach involves **local search algorithms based on nonlinear programming**, which refine solutions through iterative improvements while incorporating perturbation moves, such as basin hopping or perturbation schemes, to traverse different regions of the solution space ([ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0305054811001596); [Optimization Online](https://optimization-online.org/2010/06/2637)). Techniques like **tabu search** and **variable neighborhood search** are also notable for their ability to systematically explore neighborhoods and escape local optima by preventing cycling back to recently visited solutions ([ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S037722170600302X); [ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S037722170600302X)). \n\nFurthermore, recent developments include **discrete placement strategies** combined with iterative local search, which improve the solution density and help avoid local traps by partitioning the problem into smaller subproblems and employing perturbation moves within these partitions ([ACM Digital Library](https://drops.dagstuhl.de/storage/00lipics/lipics-vol293-socg2024/LIPIcs.SoCG.2024.86/LIPIcs.SoCG.2024.86.pdf)).

The four corners\u2019 (FC) heuristic is specifically designed to increase the search efficiency of EAs. Experiments with the FC heuristic are conducted on 31 problems from the literature both with rotations permitted and without rotations permitted, using two different EA algorithms: a self-adaptive parallel recombinative simulated annealing (PRSA) algorithm, and a self-adaptive genetic algorithm (GA). Results on bin packing problems yield the smallest trim losses we have seen in the published literature; with the FC heuristic, zero trim loss was achieved on problems of up to 97 rectangles. A comparison of the self-adaptive GA to fixed-parameter GAs is presented and the benefits of self-adaption are highlighted.\n\n## Introduction\n\nTwo-dimensional (2D) packing problems occur in a wide range of industries. The goal is simply the optimal utilization of space or material available. In the garment and paper industries the problem is often to cut smaller pieces from a large roll of cloth or paper while reducing the scrap. In the wood, glass, and metal industries the task is not to cut from a roll, but to cut from a fixed size sheet or plate. In the semiconductor industry the task is VLSI floor planning with the goal being to optimize the use of space on the chip.\n\nThere are two major variants of the 2D packing problem: bin packing and strip packing. In the 2D bin packing variant, rectangles are to be packed in bins of given width and height, the goal being to minimize the number of bins used. In the 2D strip packing variant, rectangles must be packed in a fixed width, infinite height strip, the goal being to minimize the height. The bin packing variant is most suitable for the wood, glass, metal, and semiconductor industries, while the strip packing variant will generally apply to the paper and garment industries.\n\nAn important consideration is whether or not the rectangles can be rotated as they are placed. In the wood and garment industries one may care about the grain of the material and rotations may not be permitted. While in the paper, glass, and semiconductor industries there may be no particular restrictions. Allowing rotations adds flexibility and can result in a better packing, while at the same time apparently complicating the task.\n\nGiven the many permutations of 2D packing problems, most research focuses on a particular type of the packing problem: either bin packing or strip packing, with or without rotations. A recent survey of 2D packing problems is given by Lodi et al. (2002). A typology of cutting and packing problems is defined in W\u00e4scher et al. (2006).\n\nBeing NP-hard, the 2D packing problems are an attractive challenge for evolutionary algorithms (EA). For application to strip packing problems, Jakobs (1996) developed a genetic algorithm (GA) using the bottom-left (BL) packing method with support for rotation of rectangles. Hopper and Turton (2001) provide a comprehensive comparison of GA, simulated annealing (SA), na\u00efve evolution, and simple hill-climbing for the strip packing problem with rotations and for various BL methods. A recent paper by Lesh et al. (2004) gives a method to find strip packing solutions using an exact branch and bounds exhaustive search. They successfully find perfect packings (zero trim loss) for problem sizes up to 30 rectangles. In regards to bin packing problems, Babu and Babu (1999) use a GA and a BL packing heuristic. Recently, Leung et al. (2003) developed a mixed simulated annealing-genetic algorithm.\n\nIn this paper, we design the four corners\u2019 (FC) packing heuristic with the aim to increase the search efficiency of EAs when applied to bin packing problems. By the nature of the FC heuristic, the packings produced are non-guillotineable and bottom-left stability is not preserved. In this research we study only orthogonal packing problems, consisting of one bin with the goal to seek minimum trim loss. In the typology of cutting and packing problems as defined by W\u00e4scher et al. (2006), we deal with a two-dimensional, output maximization problem: we have one large rectangle of fixed dimensions, into which the value of the placed smaller rectangles (assumed proportional to area of the rectangle) must be maximized. The smaller rectangles are strongly heterogeneous and must be laid out orthogonally. Specifically, we study the two-dimensional single orthogonal knapsack problem.\n\nThe FC heuristic is tested with two different self-adapting EAs: a self-adapting parallel recombinative simulated annealing (PRSA) algorithm and a self-adapting GA. The results are presented both with and without support for rotations. The FC heuristic combined with the self-adapting PRSA algorithm is found to produce tighter packings than any of the methods we have seen published in the literature.\n\nThis paper is outlined as follows. In Section 2, an analysis on how EAs work on packing problems is performed and the EA-friendly four corners\u2019 packing heuristic is introduced. In Section 3, a detailed description of the EA components developed in this study is given. Section 4 describes details of the PRSA implementation. Section 5 describes the GA implementation. The remaining sections cover the experimental settings, results, and conclusions.\n\n## Section snippets\n\n## Designing the four corners\u2019 heuristic\n\nIn this section, we analyze how EAs commonly function on packing problems and propose a four corners\u2019 heuristic designed specifically for EAs. GAs are chosen as the representative EA for this discussion, however most of the principles apply in general to the many types of EAs. For example, SA can be implemented using the genome encoding and the mutation operators of a GA. An implementation of PRSA (see Section 4) could use both the mutation and crossover operators of a GA as is done in this\n\n## Common components of a self-adapting evolutionary algorithm\n\nThe PRSA and GA algorithms implemented in this paper share the genome structure, the crossover operators, mutation operators, and the fitness function.\n\n## Self-adaptive parallel recombinative simulate...",

We also want to thank Dominik Krupke for providing a\nhelpful official validator for solutions.\n1 Introduction\nThe recent CG:SHOP 2024 Challenge introduced a variant of irregular packing problems\nknown as the Maximum Polygon Packing (MPP) problem. The MPP problem involves a\nconvex polygonal container C and a polygon set P = {p1, p2, ..., pN }, where polygon piis\nassociated with a value vi. It seeks for a non-overlapping packing with the maximum total\nvalue. The challenge presents a total of 180 instances whose number of polygons ranges from\n28 to 50,000. The official document [4] gives a detailed description of the challenge.\nOur proposed algorithm employs a general process to solve these instances indiscriminately,\nand the overall framework is presented in Figure 1. We first partition a large-scale problem\ninto multiple small-scale subproblems (Section 2) and then solve each subproblem using\nupper-level polygon ordering (Section 3.1) and lower-level packing optimization techniques\n(Section 3.2). Section 4 presents our experimental results, followed by conclusions.\n1 Corresponding author: Zhouxing Su\n\u00a9 Canhui Luo, Zhouxing Su, and Zhipeng L\u00fc;\nlicensed under Creative Commons License CC-BY 4.0\n40th International Symposium on Computational Geometry (SoCG 2024).\nEditors: Wolfgang Mulzer and Jeff M.

It involves two components: partitioning the container C into\nmultiple regions and assigning polygons to each region.\n2.1 Container Partitioning\nThe container partitioning process consists of two steps, as shown in Figure 2. Initially, we\narrange two-dimensional square grids starting from the bottom-left corner of the bounding\nbox until the entire container is covered. The subregions formed by the intersection of the\ncontainer with all the grids constitute its partition C = C1 \u222a C2 \u222a ... \u222a Cm. Subsequently,\nwe merge the small subregions with adjacent grids, which are difficult to be used effectively.\nThe grid is dimensioned to keep the scale of each subproblem at approximately 300 polygons,\nmaking a trade-off between effectiveness and efficiency of lower-level packing optimization.\n2.2 Polygon Assignment\nWe adopt a simple approach of randomly assigning polygons to each subregion. Specifically, for\neach subregion Ci, we randomly select a polygon pj from P until\nP\nj\narea(pj )\narea(Ci) \u2265\nPN\ni=0\narea(pi)\narea(C)\n.\nThe advantage of random assignment lies in ensuring that the overall characteristics of each\nsubproblem align with the original problem.\nC.

We repeatedly select one remaining polygon with the\nhighest priority (ties are broken by value) and try to insert it into the current solution. If the\ninsertion with lower-level packing optimization fails, we skip the current polygon and turn to\nthe next one. For the majority of instances, the priority is defined as the value-to-area ratio\nof a polygon (we also call it unit value). Polygons with higher unit values are prioritized\nfor putting in the container, which is called the Unit Value First (UVF) strategy. For\nsmall-scale instances (N < 100), we employ the \u03b1\u03b2-random strategy. It randomly selects\n\u03b1% and \u03b2% of the polygons and reassigns their UVF-based priority to the highest and the\nlowest, respectively. These instances are run for multiple times to ensure comprehensive\noptimization, with \u03b1 and \u03b2 set to 10 in our implementation.\n3.2 Lower-Level Packing Optimization\nThe position of a polygon can be represented by the coordinates l = (x, y) of a reference point,\nsuch as the bottom-left corner of the boundary. Then, the translation of a polygon can be\nrepresented by a vector pointing from its original position to its new position. Given a feasible\npacking S and a polygon p to be placed, it is impossible to find a non-overlapping position\nfor p without moving other polygons in most cases. This section introduces the algorithm for\neliminating overlaps for an invalid packing, which involves solving an unconstrained nonlinear\nproblem and heuristic polygon movement.\nS o C G 2 0 2 4\n86:4 A General Heuristic Approach for Maximum Polygon Packing\n3.2.1 Overlap Minimization\nTo determine the appropriate translation for the polygons, we utilized the no-fit polygon\n(NFP) and inner-fit polygon (IFP), which are fundamental in algorithmic approaches to\ngeometric design and optimization challenges. For a fixed polygon pi and a movable polygon\npj , NFP(pi, pj ) describes their non-overlapping positions with boundaries in contact precisely,\nwhich can be utilized to determine the minimum translation for pj to avoid overlap. Similarly,\nIFP(pi, pj ) is employed to determine the minimum translation to place pj inside pi. Figure 3\nillustrates the polygon translations determined using NFP (left) and IFP (right). The readers\nmay refer to Burke et al. [2] for a more detailed description.\nFor a packing S, based on NFP and IFP, we define the overlap between polygons pi\nand pj as fij (S), representing the minimum translation to separate them, and f0i(S) as the\nminimum translation for moving pi to fit into the container. Subsequently, we employ the\nseparation algorithm proposed by Imamichi et al. [7] to minimize the overlap, which involves\nsolving an unconstrained nonlinear programming problem as follows:\nmin\nS\nF(S) = X\n0\u2264i<j\u2264N\nf\n2\nij (S) (1)\nThe model relaxes the non-overlapping constraint but introduces repulsion forces between\nany two overlapped polygons. We use the classic L-BFGS (limited memory BFGS) method\nto solve this problem. It makes the packing S converge to a local optimum but strongly\ndepends on the initial layout. ...",

The results of standard test instances indicate that when compared with other existing algorithms, the presented algorithm does not only show some signs of competitive power but also updates several best known results.\n## Introduction\nThe irregular strip packing problem, also known as the nesting problem, has a wide area of applications. Given a set of irregular shapes and a rectangular strip with a fixed width and an arbitrary length, the target of the two-dimensional irregular strip packing problem is to place all shapes within the strip such that the length of the strip is minimized and the irregular shapes do not overlap. A classic example application is clothing industry. Several pieces of clothes will be cut from a roll of fabric and the objective is to minimize the waste of fabric. The fabric has a fixed width and its length can be generally assumed infinite; so the problem is to minimize the length required for producing the specified number of irregular shapes.\nThe irregular strip packing problem is a NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem [1]. Numerous papers on nesting problem have been published since the first paper by Art [2]. Meta-heuristics are often used to solve this problem. Hopper and Turton [3] reviewed these methods, and a summary of geometric methods was published by Bennell and Oliveira [4]. As research progressed, further breakthroughs in algorithms for this problem have achieved in recent years. When compared with the previous years, these solutions have markedly improved the effect and speed of nesting results. The typical methods include Burke et al. [5], Gomes and Oliveira [6], Egeblad et al. [7], Imamichi et al. [8], etc.\nAlbano and Sapuppo [9] proposed an algorithm that places each shape at the bottom-left position, and the sequence of places is obtained by tree search. Jakobs [10] proposed a two-stage solution which first generates the rectangular enclosure of each irregular shape, and then finds the placement for these enclosures through a genetic algorithm. Secondly, a shrinking algorithm moves the shapes to another one as close as possible using the idea of the bottom-left heuristic. Gomes and Oliveira [11] based on bottom-left heuristic and find a good placement by exchanging two shapes in the layout. Dowsland et al. [12] developed a compact algorithm to improve the bottom-left heuristic algorithm. The algorithm first gets the initial placement by the bottom-left heuristic, and then uses a shaking process to compact the placement. Burke et al. [5] presented a new bottom-left heuristic algorithm based on discretization, and combination with hill climbing or tabu search to get a high quality solution. This algorithm can also pack the shapes with circular arcs and holes. Egeblad et al. [7] proposed an efficient fast local search method whose neighborhood is any horizontal or vertical translation of a given shape. They also formulated a polynomial time algorithm to find a translation with minimum overlap area between the given polygon and the other polygons in the current placement. Gomes and Oliveira [6] presented a separation algorithm to locally optimize the placement based on linear programming models, and used simulated annealing to guide the search. A new separation algorithm based on unconstrained nonlinear programming is proposed by Imamichi et al. [8]. They also designed an algorithm that swaps two polygons in a placement, and then the algorithms are combined as a component into an iterated local search algorithm for the overlap minimization problem. This method yielded several best known results on the standard test instances. Our algorithm is based on a separation algorithm presented by Imamichi et al. [8], and local search is adopted to guide the search. Moreover, a tabu search algorithm is used to avoid local minima and a compacted algorithm is used to improve the packing results.\n## Section snippets\n## Formulation\nIn this section, some fundamental elements of geometry are first defined, before formulation of the irregular strip packing problem algorithm is given.\n**Definition 1 (point)**\nA point*p*in two-dimensional space is represented by a pair:p=(px,py)\u2208R2.\n**Definition 2 (line segment)**\nA line segment*s*is a point set defined by two endpoints*p**a*and*p**b*:s={p\u2208R2,t\u2208[0,1]|p=pa+t(pb\u2212pa)}.\n**Definition 3 (polygon)**\nA polygon is a plane figure bounded by a closed path composes of a finite sequence of line segments denoted by*S*.

To escape local minima we apply the meta-heuristic method*Guided Local Search*.\nThe strength of our solution method comes from a new algorithm which is capable of searching the neighborhood in polynomial time. More precisely, given a single polygon with*m*edges and a set of polygons with*n*edges the algorithm can find a translation with minimum overlap in time O(*mn*log(*mn*)). Solutions for standard test instances are generated by an implementation and a comparison is done with recent results from the literature. The solution method is very robust and most of the best solutions found are also the currently best results published.\nOur approach to the problem is*very*flexible regarding problem variations and special constraints, and as an example we describe how it can handle materials with quality regions.\nFinally, we generalize the algorithm for the fast neighborhood search and present a solution method for three-dimensional nesting problems.\n## Introduction\nNesting is a term used for many related problems. The most common problem is strip-packing where a number of irregular shapes must be placed within a rectangular strip such that the strip-length is minimized and no shapes overlap. The clothing industry is a classical example of an application for this problem. Normally, pieces of clothes are cut from a roll of fabric. A high utilization is desirable and it requires that as little of the roll is used as possible. The width of the roll is fixed, hence the problem is to minimize the length of the fabric. Other nesting problem variations exist, but in the following the focus is on the strip-packing variant. Using the typology of W\u00e4scher et al. (2006) this is a two-dimensional irregular open dimension problem (ODP).\nIn the textile industry the shapes of the pieces of clothes are usually referred to as*markers*or*stencils*. In the following we will use the latter term except when the pieces need to be defined more precisely e.g. as polygons.\nIn order to state the problem formally we first define the associated decision problem:\n**Nesting Decision Problem**\nGiven a set of stencilsSand a piece of material, position the stencilsSsuch that\n* \u2022No pair of stencils overlap.\n* \u2022All stencils are contained within the boundaries of the material.\nThe strip-packing variant can now be stated as\n**Strip Nesting Problem**\nGiven a set of stencilsSand a strip (the material) with width*w*find the minimal length*l*for which the Nesting Decision Problem can be solved (Fig. 1).\nThe Strip Nesting Problem is NP-hard (e.g. Nielsen and Odgaard, 2003).\nIn this paper we present a new solution method for the Strip Nesting Problem. After a short analysis of some of the existing approaches to the problem (Section 2) we present a short outline of the new solution method in Section 3. In short, the approach is a local search method (Section 4) using the meta-heuristic*Guided Local Search*(Section 5) to escape local minima. A very efficient search of the neighborhood in the local search is the subject of Section 6.\nIn the definitions above we have ignored the additional constraints which are often given for a nesting problem e.g. whether rotating and/or flipping the stencils is allowed. In Section 7 a discussion on how we handle such problem variations emphasizes the flexibility of our solution method.\nExperiments show that our solution method is very efficient compared with other published methods. Results are presented in Section 8. Finally, in Section 9, it is shown that our solution method is quite easily generalized to three-dimensional nesting problems.\n## Section snippets\n## Existing approaches to nesting problems\nThere exists numerous solution methods for nesting problems. A thorough survey by Dowsland and Dowsland (1995) exists, but a more recent survey has also been done by Nielsen and Odgaard (2003). Meta-heuristics are one of the most popular tools for solving nesting problems. A detailed discussion of these can be found in the introductory sections of Bennell and Dowsland (1999).\nThe following is a brief discussion of some of the most interesting approaches to nesting problems previously presented\n## Solution method outline\nIn this section we will give a brief outline of our solution method. Our method is a relaxed placement method and it can handle irregular polygons with holes. A new geometric approach is utilized and the*Guided Local Search*meta-heuristic is used to escape local minima. This approach is inspired by a paper by Faroe et al. (2003) which presented a similar approach for the two-dimensional Bin Packing Problem for rectangles.\nThe following describes the basic algorithm for the Strip Nesting Problem.\n* (1)\n## Placement\nFirst we define a*placement*formally. LetS={s1,\u2026,sn}be a set of polygons. A placement ofs\u2208Scan be described by the tuple(sx,sy,s\u03b8,sf)\u2208R\u00d7R\u00d7[0,2\u03c0)\u00d7{false,true}where (*s**x*,*s**y*) is the position,*s**\u03b8*is the rotation angle and*s**f*states whether*s*is flipped. Now the mapp:S\u2192R\u00d7R\u00d7[0,2\u03c0)\u00d7{false,true}is a placement of the polygonsS.\n## Objective function\nGiven a set of polygonsS={s1,\u2026,sn}and a fixed-length strip with length*l*and width*w*, letPbe the space of possible placements. We now wish to minimize the objective\n## Guided local search\nTo escape local minima encountered during local search we apply the meta-heuristic*Guided Local Search*(*GLS*). GLS was introduced by Voudouris and Tsang (1995) and has previously been successfully applied to e.g. the*Traveling Salesman Problem*(Voudouris and Tsang, 1999) and two- and thre...",

This problem is approached with an heuristic based on Simulated Annealing (SA) with adaptive neighborhood. Traditional \u201cexternal penalization\u201d techniques are avoided through the application of the no\u2013fit polygon, that determinates the collision-free area for each polygon before its placement. The SA controls continuous and discrete parameters. The rotation applied and the translation of the polygon are continuous parameters, and the sequence of placement is represented as a set of discrete parameters. For each non\u2013placed item, a limited depth binary search is performed to find a scale factor that when applied to the item, would allow it to be fitted in the container.\n\n- [Previous article in issue](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1474667015355488)\n- [Next article in issue](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1474667015355506)\n\n## Keywords\n\nSimulated Annealing\n\nPlacement Problems\n\nOptimization\n\nProbabilistic Heuristics\n\n[View PDF](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S147466701535549X/pdf?md5=7bca88c33d2daef044751913b4156e2b&pid=1-s2.0-S147466701535549X-main.pdf)\n\nSpecial issue articlesRecommended articles\n\n## References\n\n01.

The approach is based on an Iterated Local Search scheme (or, using a terminology employed for continuous problems, a Monotonic Basin Hopping), in which the key step is the perturbation move. Different perturbation moves, both combinatorial and continuous ones, are proposed and compared through extensive computational experiments on a set of test instances.

      "text": "Efficient Local Search Heuristics for Packing\nIrregular Shapes in Two-Dimensional\nHeterogeneous Bins\nRanga P. Abeysooriya1, Julia A. Bennell1, and Antonio Martinez-Sykora1\nBusiness School, University of Southampton, SO17 1BJ, Southampton, UK\nAbstract. In this paper we proposed a local search heuristic and a ge\u0002netic algorithm to solve the two-dimensional irregular multiple bin-size\nbin packing problem. The problem consists of placing a set of pieces rep\u0002resented as 2D polygons in rectangular bins with different dimensions\nsuch that the total area of bins used is minimized. Most packing algo\u0002rithms available in the literature for 2D irregular bin packing consider\nsingle size bins only. However, for many industries the material can be\nsupplied in a number of standard size sheets, for example, metal, foam,\nplastic and timber sheets. For this problem, the cut plans must decide\nthe set of standard size stock sheets as well as which pieces to cut from\neach bin and how to arrange them in order to minimise waste material.\nMoreover, the literature constrains the orientation of pieces to a single\nor finite set of angles. This is often an artificial constraint that makes\nthe solution space easier to navigate. In this paper we do not restrict\nthe orientation of the pieces. We show that the local search heuristic and\nthe genetic algorithm can address all of these decisions and obtain good\nsolutions, with the local search performing better. We also discuss the\naffect of different groups of stock sheet sizes.\nKeywords: Irregular shapes, Multiple bin size bin packing, Jostle Al\u0002gorithm\n1 Introduction\nThe two dimensional bin packing problem consists of placing a set of pieces,\nusually represented as rectangles or polygons, in one or several stock sheets\n(bins) in such a way the total waste generated is minimized. This problem arises\nin several industries where metal, foam, wood, plastic, paper or leather need to\nbe cut. Depending on the industrial application this problem has several variants\ndescribed by the properties of both the pieces to be placed and the bins. In this\npaper we address the problem where the pieces to be cut are irregular and may\nhave concavities. Pieces can be placed in any orientation within rectangular bins\nthat have a variety of different dimensions (heterogeneous bin sizes). We assume\nthat there are a limited number of bin types and there are enough bins of each\ntype to place all the demanded pieces in any set of bins. In this paper we denote\nthis problem as the two-dimensional irregular shape multiple bin size bin packing\nproblem (2D-IMBSBPP) and propose a local search heuristic, called jostle, and\na genetic algorithm to find efficient solutions.\nMost of the publications in the literature that consider heterogeneous bins\nare focused on packing rectangular pieces. Pisinger and Sigurad [19] consider a\nvariable bin cost when solving this problem. They propose a MILP model which\nis then solved by column generation. The model is intractable for large instances\nand difficult to solve even for small instances. Ortmann et al. [18] propose a\ntwo-phase approach. During the first phase they use first-fit decreasing with the\nlargest bins first. A second phase repacks bins into smaller bins. The two phase\nalgorithm is implemented with different bin sizes and aims to minimise the total\narea of the occupied bins. Wei et al. [21] propose a tabu search that uses a\nsequential packing heuristic, a local search, and a post-improvement procedure\nto reduce the total area of used bins in a feasible solution. Alvarez-Valdes et\nal. [2] implement meta-heuristic algorithms with variable bin costs which are\nnot proportional to the size of the bin. The objective is to minimize the cost of\nthe occupied bins, and the authors employ a greedy randomized adaptive search\nprocedure with path re-linking strategies to combine the best solutions obtained\nin the iterative process. In order to compare their results with Ortmann et al.\n[18]\u2019s, they modify the objective function to maximize the overall utilization of\nthe occupied bins.\nThe vast majority of research publications considering the packing of 2D\nirregular shapes address the 2D strip packing problem, also known as the nesting\nproblem. Instead of placing pieces into bins the aim is to place all the pieces into\na strip with fixed width and infinite length in such a way the total required length\nis minimized. However, recent publications of packing algorithms for irregular\npieces consider the bin packing problem with homogeneous bins, see [14], [20],\n[16] and [1]. However, in many situations bins are readily available to purchase\nas rectangular sheets in different standard sizes. In these industries companies\nusually handle several bin sizes in order to satisfy customer demand. The aim of\nthe companies is not only to reduce the waste generated in the cutting process,\nbut also charge a competitive price to the customers, which usually depends on\nthe area of material needed to meet the demand. There are several publications\nconsidering heterogeneous irregular bins, see [4] and [5], who solve an applied\nproblem which arises in the leather industry. In these publications the pieces\nare approximated by grid squares or pixels rather than polygons. While this\nsimplifies the geometry, solutions suffer from inaccuracy in shape representation.\nIt is important to highlight that in this paper we use the direct representa\u0002tions of the pieces as polygons and do not restrict the rotation of pieces to a\npredefined set of angles. Han et al. [13] and Martinez-Sykora et al. [15] considered\nfree rotation for the 2D irregular bin packing problem with guillotine cuts, solving\nan application derived from the glass industry. More recently, Martinez-Sykora\net al. [16] and Abeysooriya et al. [1] considered free rotation for the problem with\nhomogeneous bins and also report results with restricted and fixed rotations. For\ncomparison purposes, we also address the problem where a finite set of rotations\nare allowed.\nThe main contribution of this paper is to efficiently solve the 2D-IMBSBPP\nconsidering continuous rotation of pieces by using an adaptation of the jostle\nprocedure. Jostle was first proposed by Dowsland et al. [10] for the strip packing\nproblem and then used in [1] in bin packing problems with homogeneous bins.\nOne of the most important properties of the jostle procedure is that it explores\nefficient solutions with a relatively low computational effort, compared with other\navailable algorithms. The jostle procedure works over the sequence of pieces that\nrepresents the order pieces are inserted in the layout. The constructive heuristic\niterates between packing from one end of the strip and then the other end taking\nthe sequence from the last iteration. The results presented in this paper show\na considerable improvement when using a heterogeneous set of bin sizes, which\ndemonstrates the efficiency of the algorithms presented.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we describe the problem and\nwe discuss the measure of performance used to evaluate the quality of feasible\nsolutions. Section 3 explains the jostle algorithms and the genetic algorithm to\nsolve 2D-IMBSBPP. Computational tests are presented in Section 4. Finally, in\nSection 5 we present the conclusions of the paper.\n2 Problem Description\nLet N0 be the number of rectangular bin types (stock sheets) and let Lk and\nWk be, respectively, the length and the width of bin type k \u2208 {1, . . . , N0}. Let\nP = {p1, . . . , pn} be the set of pieces to be cut from the bins, where n is the\nnumber of pieces. We assume that all the pieces may have a different shape.\nA solution s = {Bs\nk\n| k = 1, . . . , N0} is represented by a set of bins of each\ntype used in the solution, where each single bin b\ns\njk(Pjk, Ojk, Xjk, Yjk) \u2208 Bsk\nis\ndetermined by the subset of pieces placed in the bin (Pjk), the set of orientations\nused for each piece (Ojk) and the X and Y coordinates of the reference point\nof e...",
