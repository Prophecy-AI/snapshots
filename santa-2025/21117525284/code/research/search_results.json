      "text": "Simulated\u2011annealing (SA) works best for 2\u2011D irregular\u2011shape packing when it is equipped with **problem\u2011specific move operators and adaptive control mechanisms**.  A common practice is to start from a constructive layout (e.g., a first\u2011fit\u2011decreasing or greedy recursive placement) so that the initial temperature need not be excessively high and the search begins in a promising region of the solution space\u202f([ScienceDirect\u202f1993](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/037722179390195S)).  During the annealing run the algorithm should allow **translation, rotation and, when needed, scaling of individual pieces**; the size of these perturbations is adjusted on\u2011the\u2011fly by a feedback loop (the \u201ccrystallization factor\u201d) that enlarges the neighbourhood after an accepted move and shrinks it after a rejection, thereby keeping the acceptance ratio high and accelerating convergence\u202f([Semantics Scholar\u202f2012](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/6509/3a9d2d6b9b38ac2c9a2da79c3905b76ef008.pdf)).  \n\nEfficient collision detection is crucial for irregular polygons.  Using **no\u2011fit polygons (NFPs)** to pre\u2011compute the feasible relative positions of two shapes lets the SA engine test overlaps quickly even when pieces are rotated, which dramatically reduces the computational burden of each move\u202f([SciELO\u202f2008](https://www.scielo.br/j/jbsmse/a/NjF3nW9xTMnxmMThYJ8WQyv)).  The cooling schedule is typically **geometric or \u201csimulated\u2011quenching\u201d**, where temperature is lowered according to a geometrical factor but can be re\u2011raised locally if the acceptance rate falls below a threshold, ensuring a balance between exploration and exploitation\u202f([Semantics Scholar\u202f2012](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/6509/3a9d2d6b9b38ac2c9a2da79c3905b76ef008.pdf)).  \n\nFinally, the most robust implementations **hybridise SA with other heuristics**: a recursive placement routine supplies a deterministic backbone, while SA refines the layout by swapping, rotating or re\u2011ordering items; some studies also combine SA with genetic\u2011algorithm or linear\u2011programming components to further improve material utilisation\u202f([Springer\u202f2007](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-71618-1_56)).  These hybrid, adaptive, and geometry\u2011aware strategies consistently outperform plain SA in recent experimental benchmarks for irregular\u2011shape nesting and strip\u2011packing problems.",

The basic requirements of the algorithm are a neighbourhood structure on the set of feasible solutions and a number of parameters which govern the acceptance or rejection of new solutions generated during the search. The quality of the solution is very sensitive to both these factors.

High material utilization is of particular interest to mass production industries since small improvements of the layout can result in large savings of material and considerably reduce production cost.\nThe knapsack problem belongs to the more general class of combinatorial problems known as cutting and packing problems. According to Dyckhoff (1990), the cutting and packing problems are mainly characterized by the number of relevant dimensions, the regularity and irregularity of the shapes of the small items and large objects and the problem assignment. Considering assignment, it is possible to identify two situations: output maximization and input minimization. In the input minimization, the set of large objects is sufficient to accommodate all small items, and there is no selection regarding the small items. In the case of output maximization, the set of large objects is not sufficient to accommodate all the small items and a set of small items has to be assigned to a given set of large objects. The survey made by Wascher et al. (2005) improved the typology of cutting and packing problems proposed by Dyckhoff (1990). According to Wascher et al. (2005), the problem studied in this work can be defined as: \" ... the knapsack problem represents a problem category which is characterized by a strongly heteroge-neous assortment of small items which have to be allocated to a given set of large objects. Again, the availability of the large objects is limited such that not all small items can be accommodated. The value of the accommodated small items is to be maximized\" . In this survey, Wascher et al. (2005) identified 294 papers containing material relevant to cutting and packing. Only 5...",

      "text": "Chapter 0\nAdaptive Neighborhood Heuristics for Simulated\nAnnealing over Continuous Variables\nT.C. Martins, A.K.Sato and M.S.G. Tsuzuki\nAdditional information is available at the end of the chapter\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5772/50302\n1. Introduction\nSimulated annealing has been applied to a wide range of problems: combinatorial and\ncontinuous optimizations. This work approaches a new class of problems in which the\nobjective function is discrete but the parameters are continuous. This type of problem arises in\nrotational irregular packing problems. It is necessary to place multiple items inside a container\nsuch that there is no collision between the items, while minimizing the items occupied area.\nA feedback is proposed to control the next candidate probability distribution, in order to\nincrease the number of accepted solutions. The probability distribution is controlled by\nthe so called crystallization factor. The proposed algorithm modifies only one parameter\nat a time. If the new configuration is accepted then a positive feedback is executed to\nresult in larger modifications. Different types of positive feedbacks are studied herein. If\nthe new configuration is rejected, then a negative feedback is executed to result in smaller\nmodifications. For each non-placed item, a limited depth binary search is performed to find a\nscale factor that, when applied to the item, allows it to be fitted in the layout. The proposed\nalgorithm was used to solve two different rotational puzzles. A geometrical cooling schedule\nis used. Consequently, the proposed algorithm can be classified as simulated quenching.\nThis work is structured as follows. Section 2 presents some simulated annealing and\nsimulated quenching key concepts. In section 3 the objective function with discrete values and\ncontinuous parameters is explained. Section 4 explains the proposed adaptive neighborhood\nbased on the crystallization factor. Section 5 explains the computational experiments and\nsection 6 presents the results. Finally, section 7 rounds up the work with the conclusions.\n2. Background\nSimulated annealing is a probabilistic meta-heuristic with a capacity of escape from local\nminima. It came from the Metropolis algorithm and it was originally proposed in the area\nof combinatorial optimization [9], that is, when the objective function is defined in a discrete\n\u00a92012 Tsuzuki et al., licensee InTech.

The simulated annealing was modified in order to apply to the optimization of\nmultimodal functions defined on continuous domain [4]. The choices of the cooling schedule\nand of the next candidate distribution are the most important decisions in the definition of a\nsimulated annealing algorithm [13]. The next candidate distribution for continuous variables\nis discussed herein.\nIn the discrete domain, such as the traveling salesman and computer circuit design problems,\nthe parameters must have discrete values; the next point candidate xk+1 corresponds to a\npermutation in the list of cities to be visited, interchanges of circuit elements, or other discrete\noperation. In the continuous application of simulated annealing a new choice of the next point\ncandidate must be executed. Bohachevsky et al. [1] proposed that the next candidate xk+1 can\nbe obtained by first generating a random direction vector u, with |u| = 1, then multiplying it\nby a fixed step size \u0394r, and summing the resulting vector to the current candidate point xk.\nBrooks & Verdini [2] showed that the selection of \u0394r is a critical choice. They observed that an\nappropriate choice of this parameter is strictly dependent on the objective function F(x), and\nthe appropriate value can be determined by presampling the objective function.\nThe directions in [1] are randomly sampled from the uniform distribution and the step size is\nthe same in each direction. In this way, the feasible region is explored in an isotropic way and\nthe objective function is assumed to behave in the same way in each direction. But this is not\noften the case. The step size to define the next candidate point xk+1 should not be equal for all\nthe directions, but different directions should have different step sizes; i.e. the space should\nbe searched in an anisotropic way. Corana et al. [4] explored the concept of anisotropic search;\nthey proposed a self-tuning simulated annealing algorithm in which the step size is configured\nin order to maintain a number of accepted solutions. At each iteration k, a single variable of\nxk is modified in order to obtain a new candidate point xk+1, and iterations are subdivided\ninto cycles of n iterations during which each variable is modified. The new candidate point is\nobtained from xk in the following form xk+1 = xk + v \u00b7 \u0394ri \u00b7 ei. Where v is a uniform random\nnumber in [\u22121, 1], and \u0394ri is the step size along direction ei of the i-th axis. The anisotropy is\nobtained by choosing different values of \u0394ri for all the directions. The step size is kept fixed\nfor a certain number of cycles of variables, and the fraction of accepted moves in direction ei\nis calculated. If the fraction of accepted moves generated in the same direction is below 0.4,\nthen the step size \u0394ri along ei is decreased. It is assumed that the algorithm is using too large\nsteps along ei thus causing many moves to be rejected. If the fraction is between 0.4 and 0.6\nthe step size is left unchanged. If the fraction is above 0.6 then \u0394ri is increased. It is assumed\nthat the step size is too small thus causing many moves to be accepted.\nThis procedure may not be the best possible to process the different behavior of the objective\nfunction along different axes. Ingber [7] proposed that the random variable should follow a\nCauchy distribution with different sensitivities at different temperatures. The maximum step\nsize is kept constant during the algorithm and it allows escaping from local minima even at\nlow temperatures. The parameter space can have completely different sensitivities for each\ndimension, therefore the use of different temperatures for each dimension is suggested. This\nmethod is often referred to as very fast simulated re-annealing (VFSR) or adaptive simulated\nannealing (ASA). The sensitivity of each parameter is given by the partial derivative of the\nfunction with relation to the i-th dimension [3].\n4 Simulated Annealing \u2013 Advances, Applications and Hybridizations\nAdaptive Neighborhood Heuristics for Simulated Annealing over Continuous Variables 3\n3. Integer objective function with float parameters\nIrregular packing problems arise in the industry whenever one must place multiple items\ninside a container such that there is no collision between the items, while minimizing the\narea occupied by the items. It can be shown that even restricted versions of this problem (for\ninstance, limiting the polygon shape to rectangles only) are NP complete, which means that\nall algorithms currently known for optimal solutions require a number of computational steps\nthat grow exponentially with the problem size rather than according to a polynomial function\n[5]. Usually probabilistic heuristics relax the original constraints of the problem, allowing the\nsearch to go through points outside the space of valid solutions and applying penalization to\ntheir cost. This technique is known as external penalization. The most adopted penalization\nheuristic for external solutions of packing problems is to apply a penalization based on\nthe overlapping area of colliding items. While this heuristic leads to very computationally\nefficient iterations of the optimization process, the layout with objective function in minimum\nvalue may have overlapped items [6].\nFig. 1 shows an example in which the c...",

A new recursive placement procedure is proposed and the procedure is combined with the SA algorithm. The hybrid-SA algorithm was tested on a set of benchmark problems taken from the literature. The computational results have validated the quality of the solutions and usefulness of the proposed hybrid-SA algorithm.\nThis is a preview of subscription content,[log in via an institution](https://wayf.springernature.com/?redirect_uri&#x3D;https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-71618-1_56?error=cookies_not_supported&code=9910a4e5-f4b5-49c3-ae99-640018193a47)to check access.\n## Access this chapter\n[Log in via an institution](https://wayf.springernature.com/?redirect_uri&#x3D;https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-71618-1_56?error=cookies_not_supported&code=9910a4e5-f4b5-49c3-ae99-640018193a47)\n[Institutional subscriptions](https://www.springernature.com/gp/librarians/licensing/agc/ebooks)\n## Preview\nUnable to display preview.[Download preview\nPDF.](https://page-one.springer.com/pdf/preview/10.1007/978-3-540-71618-1_56)\nUnable to display preview.[Download preview\nPDF.](https://page-one.springer.com/pdf/preview/10.1007/978-3-540-71618-1_56)\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n![](https://media.springernature.com/w215h120/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs00291-021-00619-y/MediaObjects/291_2021_619_Fig1_HTML.png)\n### [The effect of benchmark data characteristics during empirical strip packing heuristic performance evaluation](https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00291-021-00619-y?fromPaywallRec=true)\nArticle09 February 2021\n![](https://media.springernature.com/w92h120/springer-static/cover-hires/book/978-3-319-64403-5?as&#x3D;webp)\n### [Packing Rectangles into a Strip](https://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-319-64403-5_7?fromPaywallRec=true)\nChapter\u00a9 2018\n![](https://media.springernature.com/w92h120/springer-static/cover-hires/book/978-3-319-68496-3?as&#x3D;webp)\n### [Efficient Local Search Heuristics for Packing Irregular Shapes in Two-Dimensional Heterogeneous Bins](https://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-319-68496-3_37?fromPaywallRec=true)\nChapter\u00a9 2017\n### Explore related subjects\nDiscover the latest articles, books and news in related subjects, suggested using machine learning.\n* [Algorithms](https://link.springer.com/subjects/algorithms)\n* [Continuous Optimization](https://link.springer.com/subjects/continuous-optimization)\n* [Discrete Optimization](https://link.springer.com/subjects/discrete-optimization)\n* [Genome assembly algorithms](https://link.springer.com/subjects/genome-assembly-algorithms)\n* [Optimization](https://link.springer.com/subjects/optimization)\n* [Surface Assembly](https://link.springer.com/subjects/surface-assembly)\n## References\n1.

However, existing approaches often struggle to achieve both high efficiency and compactness in the arrangement of irregularly shaped 2D components, leading to significant material waste and suboptimal layout solutions. To address this issue, this study introduces a novel methodology that integrates advanced image processing and computational intelligence to optimize the arrangement of irregularly shaped components on fixed boards. Employing normalized two-dimensional cross-correlation for enhanced template matching, our approach not only improves material utilization but also enhances packing efficiency by reducing gaps between components. The developed method involves several key steps, including the cropping of cross-correlation matrices and strategic pattern placement, which are critical for achieving a highly compact and computationally efficient arrangement. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances both material conservation and computational efficiency compared to traditional methods, ensuring a more optimized and automated packing process. Our findings provide a practical and scalable solution bridging the gap between theoretical research and industrial applications. This research contributes to advancing computational efficiency, reducing material waste, and optimizing spatial utilization in industrial cutting and packing scenarios.\n\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n\n### [Universal image segmentation for optical identification of 2D materials](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-85159-9?fromPaywallRec=false)\n\nArticleOpen access11 March 2021\n\n### [Accurate quantification of dislocation loops in complex functional alloys enabled by deep learning image analysis](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-74894-4?fromPaywallRec=false)\n\nArticleOpen access24 October 2024\n\n### [Multi-objective steel plate cutting optimization problem based on real number coding genetic algorithm](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-27100-2?fromPaywallRec=false)\n\nArticleOpen access28 December 2022\n\n## Introduction\n\nIn the multifaceted realms of manufacturing and design, practitioners face a spectrum of complex challenges. Central among these is the \u20182-D cutting and packing\u2019 problem, prevalent across industries like furniture craftsmanship, sheet metal fabrication, and footwear production. This issue involves the efficient arrangement of irregularly shaped components on fixed boards[1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-97202-0#ref-CR1), [2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-97202-0#ref-CR2), aiming to maximize space and resource utilization amidst the intricacies of diverse shapes and sizes[3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-97202-0#ref-CR3), [4](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-97202-0#ref-CR4).\n\nThe puzzle\u2019s complexity is further heightened by the need for optimal utilization within spatial and design constraints[5](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-97202-0#ref-CR5). Traditional manual methods, while viable in specific scenarios, often fall short under the pressures of high-volume, complex production, necessitating advanced solutions that integrate mathematical, computational, and spatial optimization[6](https://www.nature.com/www.nature.com#ref-CR6), [7](https://www.nature.com/www.nature.com#ref-CR7), [8](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-97202-0#ref-CR8). Figure\u00a0[1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-97202-0#Fig1) illustrates the application of pattern packing technology in various industrial engineering fields. This includes techniques such as laser cutting and milling machine cutting, which are essential for efficient material utilization and precise part placement.\n\n**Fig. 1**\n\nApplications of Irregularly Shaped Part Layout Algorithms in Various Industries: ( **a**) Waterjet Cutting Metal Plates; ( **b**) Laser Cutting 10\u00a0mm Stainless Steel; ( **c**) Laser Cutting Copper Plates; ( **d**) Milling Machine Cutting Aluminum Alloy Parts.\n\n[Full size image](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-97202-0/figures/1)\n\nAcademic and industrial research have made significant strides in addressing these challenges. Foundational to this field is the work of Iori et al.[9](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-97202-0#ref-CR9), who provided a comprehensive survey of key issues such as the Two-Dimensional Strip Packing Problem (2D-SPP) and the Two-Dimensional Bin Packing Problem (2D-BPP), laying the groundwork for understanding various methodologies.\n\nBuilding on this foundation, research has branched into addressing specific challenges. He et al.[10](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-97202-0#ref-CR10) devised an Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search algorithm for the 2D Circle Bin Packing Problem, and G\u00e1lvez et al.[11](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-97202-0#ref-CR11) developed a pseudo-polynomial-time approximation algorithm for strip packing. Alvarez-Valdes et al.[12](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-97202-0#ref-CR12) explored nesting of irregular shapes with a Branch & Bound Algorithm, while Rakotonirainy and van Vuuren[13](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-97202-0#ref-CR13) and Luo et al.[14](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-97202-0#ref-CR14) focused on metaheuristic algorithms for the 2D strip-packing and knapsack problems.\n\nAttention has also been directed towards packing irregular objects. Abeysooriya et al.[15](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-97202-0#ref-CR15) and Sato et al.[16](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-97202-0#ref-CR16) have proposed novel approaches for this purpose, complemented by the work of Cherri et al.[17](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-97202-0#ref-CR17) and Xu et al.[18](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-97202-0#ref-CR18), who introduced advanced heuristics and optimization algorithms for irregular strip packing and nesting. Additionally, Souza Queiroz and Andretta[19](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-97202-0#ref-CR19) have pioneered efficient solutions for the 2D Irregular Knapsack Problem.\n\nIn the domain of 2D placement and orientation, notable contributions include those by Andrade et al.[20](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-97202-0#ref-CR20), Zhang et al.[21](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-97202-0#ref-CR21), and Yang et al.[22](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-97202-0#ref-CR22), offering integrated strategies for maximizing space utilization in raw material processing. Oliveira et al.[23](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-97202-0#ref-CR23) have provided a comprehensive overview of solution approaches for rectangular cutting and packing problems. Wu et al.[24](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-97202-0#ref-CR24) presented an enhanced heuristic for 2D rectangle packing problems with central rectangles, showing that their IHACR algorithm surpasses the older HACR in efficiency and layout filling rate, particularly for complex layouts in semi-submersible production platforms.\n\nSpecialized challenges have been addressed by researchers such as Wu et al.[25](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-97202-0#ref-CR25) and Leao et al.[26](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-97202-0#ref-CR26), focusing on the Central Rectangle Rectangular Packing Area Maximization Proble...",

IMO, your problem in current form is far too little technical for a proper SO question. You are asking for a broad research materials, that are \"good\" which makes answers biased and opinion based. Personally, I simply feel you will have much greater reception and chances asking there.\n\n\u2013\u00a0[luk32](https://stackoverflow.com/users/1133179/luk32)\n\nCommentedApr 21, 2014 at 15:19\n\n- 2\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso, I think it's probably slightly more likely that the \"problem\" you are looking into is \"bin packing\", not \"bin packet\"...\n\n\u2013\u00a0[twalberg](https://stackoverflow.com/users/1253222/twalberg)\n\nCommentedApr 21, 2014 at 16:11\n\n\n[Add a comment](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23200121/simulated-annealing-algorithm-to-solve-bin-packing)\u00a0\\|\n\n## 1 Answer 1\n\nSorted by:\n[Reset to default](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23200121/simulated-annealing-algorithm-to-solve-bin-packing?answertab=scoredesc#tab-top)\n\nHighest score (default)Trending (recent votes count more)Date modified (newest first)Date created (oldest first)\n\n6\n\nFirst let us define the problem\n\nPack a set of\n`N = {1, 2, \u2026, n}` items, each with size\n`t_i, i =1, 2,\u2026, n,` into identical bins, each with capacity `C`\nMinimize the number of bins without violating the capacity constraints\n\nSo main Outline of Annealing Algorithm will consist on:\n\n- Construct an initial solution using first-fit decreasing procedure\n- Compute and assign weights to items to distort sizes according\nto the packing solutions of individual bins\n- Perform local search by swapping items betweenall pairs of bins\n- Carry out re-weighting based on the result of the previous\noptimization run\n- Reduce weight distortion according to a cooling schedule\n\nNow it is important to do a Neighborhood Search for Bin Packing Problem:\n\n- From a current solution, obtain the next solution by swapping items between bins\nwith the following objective function (Fleszar and Hindi 2002)\n\n![enter image description here](https://i.sstatic.net/wsAqm.png)\n\n- Swap schemes\nSwap items between two bins, then Carry out Swap (1,0), Swap (1,1), Swap (1,2), Swap\n(2,2) for all pairs of bins.\n- Swap (1,0)\n\n![enter image description here](https://i.sstatic.net/PEtpZ.png)\n\\- then evaluate only the change in the objective function value\n\n- Swap (1,1), then Swap (1,2) like:\n![enter image description here](https://i.sstatic.net/fO2il.png)\n\nThat should give you a start.\n\n[Share](https://stackoverflow.com/a/23202574)\n\n[Improve this answer](https://stackoverflow.com/posts/23202574/edit)\n\nFollow\n\nanswered Apr 21, 2014 at 17:40\n\n[![edgarmtze's user avatar](https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cc1736f60bfaa6766eef4385cda5a091?s=64&d=identicon&r=PG&f=y&so-version=2)](https://stackoverflow.com/users/265519/edgarmtze)\n\n[edgarmtze](https://stackoverflow.com/users/265519/edgarmtze) edgarmtze\n\n24.9k8181 gold badges245245 silver badges390390 bronze badges\n\n2\n\n- I have read some link, that said about `temperature` `scaling` parameter, and they define a formula to count weight of bin i such as : `wi = 1 + K * ri`, But in algorithm, I don't understand this formula role. can you explain for me ? thanks :)\n\n\u2013\u00a0[Tr\u1ea7n Kim D\u1ef1](https://stackoverflow.com/users/1493868/tr%e1%ba%a7n-kim-d%e1%bb%b1)\n\nCommentedApr 21, 2014 at 18:42\n\n- and can you explain for me about swap(0,1) swap(1,2) ... clearer, please ? does it means swap 0th element at bin a with 1th element at bin b ? or anything else ? thanks :)\n\n\u2013\u00a0[Tr\u1ea7n Kim D\u1ef1](https://stackoverflow.com/users/1493868/tr%e1%ba%a7n-kim-d%e1%bb%b1)\n\nCommentedApr 21, 2014 at 19:03\n\n\n[Add a comment](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23200121/simulated-annealing-algorithm-to-solve-bin-packing)\u00a0\\|\n\n## Your Answer\n\n**Reminder:** Answers generated by artificial intelligence tools are not allowed on Stack Overflow.
