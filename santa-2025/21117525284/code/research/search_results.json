No source details specific algorithms, heuristics, or implementation steps for such a solution, nor does any result mention a target score of\u202f67.  \n\nTherefore, based on the current information, a definitive \u201cbest approach\u201d for reaching that score with asymmetric packing cannot be provided.

Help solve a classic optimization problem with a festive twist.\n![AI Competition: Santa 2025 - Christmas Tree Packing Challenge - Detailed competition information, rules, and participation guidelines](https://ai77-pub.oss-ap-southeast-1.aliyuncs.com/competitions/images/logo_kagglesanta-2025.png)\nStart Date\n11/17/2025\nEnd Date\n1/30/2026\nOverview\n## \ud83c\udf84Santa 2025 - Christmas Tree Packing Challenge \ud83c\udf84## Overview\nThis competition, hosted by Kaggle, presents a festive twist on a classic optimization problem. Participants are tasked with determining the optimal way to pack Christmas tree toys into the smallest possible square box, allowing Santa Claus to mail them efficiently around the globe. The challenge is to find the dimensions of the smallest square box that can fit between 1 to 200 trees.\nThe competition is designed to encourage innovation and problem-solving skills, with a focus on packing efficiency. Participants are encouraged to submit their solutions, which will be evaluated based on the normalized area of the square bounding box for each puzzle configuration.\n### Description\nThe challenge is inspired by Santa&#x27;s need for the smallest box to fit all the tiny trees for his Christmas deliveries. Participants are required to find the best packing solution to help Santa Claus and win the competition&#x27;s prize.\n### Evaluation\nSubmissions are evaluated on the sum of the normalized area of the square bounding box for each puzzle. The formula for the score is:\n```\n`score = \u2211(sn^2/n)`\n```\nwhere`sn`is the side of the square box bounding the trees and`n`is the total number of trees in the configuration.\n### Submission File\nEach submission must include the tree position (`x`,`y`) and rotation (`deg`) for each`id`in the submission. The values must be converted to a string and prepended with an`s`before submission. Submissions with overlapping trees will result in an error. Location values must be constrained to -100 \u2264x, y \u2264100.\nThe file should have the following format:\n```\n`id,x,y,deg\n001\\_0,s0.0,s0.0,s20.411299\n002\\_0,s0.0,s0.0,s20.411299\n002\\_1,s-0.541068,s0.259317,s51.66348\netc.`\n```\n### Timeline\n* **November 17, 2025**: Start Date\n* **January 23, 2026**: Entry Deadline\n* **January 23, 2026**: Team Merger Deadline\n* **January 30, 2026**: Final Submission Deadline\nAll deadlines are at 11:59 PM UTC unless otherwise noted.\n### Prizes\n* **First Prize**: $12,000\n* **Second Prize**: $10,000\n* **Third Prize**: $10,000\n* **Fourth Prize**: $8,000\nAdditionally, a**Rudolph Prize**of $10,000 is awarded to the team holding 1st place on the leaderboard for the longest period of time between November 17, 2025, and January 30, 2026.\n### Citation\nWalter Reade and Ashley Oldacre.

I may add a gurobi version of thes emodels in the near future.\nMy posts series:\n* [A MILP Journey, part 1: proof of 2440 lower bound](https://www.kaggle.com/c/santa-2021/discussion/300507)\n* [A MILP Journey, part 2: 2440 solution](https://www.kaggle.com/c/santa-2021/discussion/300516)\n* [A MILP Journey, part 3: wildcards](https://www.kaggle.com/c/santa-2021/discussion/300522)\nThe text below is an edited version of these posts.\n# Introduction\n[](#introduction)\nI decided to see if one of the optimization technique I know the best, namely mixed integer linear model (MILP) could be used here. To my surprise it worked fine. Let me try to explain how I worked with successive MILP models towards a 2428 solution.\nOne way to solve problems with MILP is to work with relaxations of the problem, i.e. models that include only a part of the problem specification, in the hope that the relaxation is easier to solve. Once a relaxation is solved we can add a bit more of the problem to it and iterate.\nBefore describing my models let's introduce some concepts\n# Permutations, graph and cycles\n[](#permutations-graph-and-cycles)\nWe define a directed graph whose nodes are permutations of the string 1234567, and whose arcs are weighted with a cost. In the full problem, some permutations, the ones starting with 12, must appear in each of the 3 strings while the other permutations can appear only in one of them. We call the strings starting with 12 the mandatory strings.\nIn some variant I duplicate the nodes for mandatory strings 2 times or 3 times. In that case the cost of arcs from a mandatory string to a copy of itself is set to 7.\nGraph arcs cost is defined by the overlap between the two permutations.\nFor instance, the cost of the arc between 1234567 and 4567312 is 3, because if we merge the second string with the first with overlap overlap, then we get 1234567312 which is 3 chars longer than the first string.\nWe call c-arc an arc of cost c.\nThe next concept is that of 1-cycle. It is made of all the rotations of a given permutation. For instance the 1-cycle starting with 1234567 visits these permutations in order, via 7 1-arcs:\n1234567\n2345671\n3456712\n4567123\n5671234\n6712345\n7123456\n1234567\nIf we cut the cycle some arc, say the first one above, and merge the strings with overlap, then we get a string of length 13:\n2345671234567\nThat's a general property: the length of a string obtained by breaking a cycle and merging its permutations is 7 plus the sum of the cost of the arcs in the cycle minus the arc we broke.\nOur last concept is a 2-cycle. It is made of 6 broken 1-cycles. For instance the 2 cycle starting with 1234567 is made of these 1-cycles:\n2345671234567\n3456721345672\n4567231456723\n5672341567234\n6723451672345\n7234561723456\nIf we merge the strings with overlap then we get\n23456712345672134567231456723415672345167234561723456\n# Lower bound proof\n[](#lower-bound-proof)\nThe first relaxation I tried was very crude. The code is in the lower\\_bound\\_proof.ipynb notebook. I start with a graph without repeating mandatory permutations. The MILP model has two sets of variables :\n* visit(p) is an integer variable whose value is the number of time p appears in the problem solution. The lower bound of visit(p) is set to 3 for p mandatory, 1 otherwise.\n* next(p1, p2) is an integer variable whose value is the number of times p1 is immediately followed by p2 in the strings of the solution to the problem.\nThe graph does not contain all arcs. If there is an arc(p1, p2) such that there exist two other arcs (p1, p3) (p3, p2) and cost(p1, p3) + cost(p3, p2) = cost(p1, p2) then I remove the arc (p1, p2...",
