You saw an interesting challenge or the big prize money but feel a bit lost about how to tackle the competition ?\nThis blog provides a broad overview of Kaggle competitions, guides you through the winning methodologies, and offers tips and tricks to help you tackle a Kaggle competition more effectively.\n## All you need to know about Kaggle competitions\n![](https://dataroots.ghost.io/content/images/2023/06/Untitled-1.png)Kaggle competition overview page\n\ud83d\udca1Kaggle is a platform where data enthusiasts come together to explore and analyse datasets and participate in machine learning competitions. The platform is a fun and collaborative space that encourages learning, problem-solving, and innovation.\nWhile Kaggle has grown substantially over the last few years to a more all-round data science hub, the competitions were and remain Kaggle\u2019s raison d\u2019\u00eatre and come in all shapes and forms but can be divided into three main (albeit slightly arbitrary) categories: getting-started , community competitions, and cash prize competitions.\nFirstly there are the**getting-started competitions**, such as the[Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic?ref=dataroots.ghost.io)or[Digit Recognizer](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer?ref=dataroots.ghost.io)ones. These are meant more as a sandbox with a well-defined goal to allow newcomers to become familiar with ML concepts, libraries and the Kaggle ecosystem in a fun way. Together with the**community competitions**, where someone just had an idea for an interesting competition, these generally list \u201ckudos\u201d, \u201cswag\u201d or \u201cknowledge\u201d as their prizes with the reasoning that the journey and knowledge gained on the way are more important than the destination.\nWhat actually tends to attract people to Kaggle are the**competitions with cash prizes**. These \u00a0attach prize money to top leaderboard spots and are usually set up by companies or research institutes that actually want a problem solved and would like the broader audience to take a shot at this. With prizes ranging from a few 100\u2019s to multiple 100 000\u2019s of dollars, these attract some of the best in their respective fields, which makes competing challenging but very rewarding.\nEvery single one of those competitions is defined by a**dataset**and an**evaluation score**. Here the labels from the dataset define the problem to be solved and the evaluation score is the single objective measure that indicates how well a solution solves this problem (and that will be used to rank the solutions for the leaderboard).\nWhile the********************train set********************is publicly available, the data used to evaluate solutions is not and is usually divided into two parts. First there is the**public leaderboard test set**which is used to calculate leaderboard scores while the competition is still going on. This can be used by teams to check how well their solution performs on unseen data and verify their validation strategy. Secondly there is the**private leaderboard test set.**This is used to calculate the private leaderboard scores, which decides ones actual final place, and these are only disclosed after the competition ended.\nThis not only prevents fine-tuning on the test data but also keeps things exiting since leaderboards can completely change last minute if people did (either intentionally or not) do this anyway. The resulting shuffle usually makes for some interesting drama where long-reigning champions fall from grace and unnoticed underdogs, who kept best practices in mind, suddenly rise to the top.\n### Notebooks\nTo compete one can either work on private resources (such as a local machine or cloud-hosted vm or compute instance) or use a Kaggle notebook.\nPrivate resources do have some advantages since one has full freedom about the environment, packages, etc. Especially if you want to use packages such as MLFlow or Tensorboard, which do not work in the Kaggle notebooks. Next to this, not having a limit to running times, memory and disk space can be quite convenient.\nThe Kaggle notebooks are Jupyter notebooks running on a maintained and standardised environment, hosted by Kaggle and they come with unlimited, free CPU time (with session limits of 12h) and 30h of GPU time (per user) each week for most of your parallel computing needs. This ensures that everybody who wants to compete can compete and is not limited by their hardware, which makes the competitions as democratic as possible. Additionally, you can easily import Kaggle datasets in a few seconds, which is especially convenient for the larger ones which can easily exceed 100s of GBs. Finally they are also the way to submit a solution to the competition. The submission notebook will have to read in a (private )test set and generate predictions on this set that will be used to calculate the leaderboard score. So even if you work on your own resources for training and fine-tuning, you will have to convert your code to a Kaggle notebook eventually.\n## How to take the W in a Kaggle competition ?\nIt is a matter of approach taken and how many of your ideas you could try out to finish high on the leaderboard !\nWe participated in the[Vesuvius Challenge - Ink Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/c/vesuvius-challenge-ink-detection?ref=dataroots.ghost.io)competition. While we did not win any prizes, some of the top Kaggle competitors shared their solutions after the competition ended. The methodology used by the winners seems to be more or less the same across the board. Interested to know them ? Let\u2019s break them down in few simple steps !\n### 1. Have a good understanding of the competition and how to tackle the problem\nAs the people who are organising these competitions often already spend a lot of time finding a good solution themselves, a ton of material might be already available. We would recommend you to:\n* Read the competition overview and linked resources thoroughly\n* Get familiar with the data. Look at samples, plot statistics, all the usual EDA\n* Check existing literature on approaches that were tried/succeeded in solving this or similar problems### 2. Get inspired by other participants\u2019 work to get started\nTo earn Kaggle medals or because they are genuinely nice, some competitors share their knowledge through making notebooks and datasets public or sharing findings and insights in discussions to get \u201cupvotes\u201d. We recommend reading the ones that got a lot of upvotes. This step is really a must as there are so much things to try out to improve your result it is impossible to cover everything with your team.\n![](https://dataroots.ghost.io/content/images/2023/06/Untitled--1--1.png)Go in the \"Code\" section of the competition page. You can select notebooks with the most votes and check the number of upvotes on the right side of the notebook\nBased on your readings, choose a clear and simple notebook with a decent LB score as**baseline**. Try to come up with a strategy on how to improve this baseline based on your thoughts and what you read from the shared work.\n### 3. Improve your model in an efficient way\nIn this phase, you will experiment a lot in the hopes of improving your LB. The goal here is to maximise the number of experiments you will try in a limited amount of time !\n##### Create datasets for intermediate results / preprocessed data\nSaved preprocessed datasets and trained models will make your results comparis...",

The final solution is evaluated by an ensemble score that combines all cases.\n**Notebook Link**:[Santa 2025 - Christmas Tree Packing Challenge V1](https://www.kaggle.com/code/adityapawar327/santa-2025-christmas-tree-packing-challenge-v1)\n**Public Score**: 85.92\n## Table of Contents\n[](#table-of-contents)\n* Library Imports and Environment Setup\n* Global Configuration and Precision Settings\n* ChristmasTree Class Definition\n* Utility Functions (Scoring/Collision)\n* Simulated Annealing Algorithm (N &lt; 20)\n* Grid Search Algorithm (N &gt;= 20)\n* Hybrid &amp; Ensemble Solvers\n* Main Computation Loop (N = 1 to 200)\n* Submission Formatting and Export\n## Methodology\n[](#methodology)\n* **Small N (&lt; 20):**Uses Simulated Annealing for efficient search in small configuration spaces.\n* **Large N (&gt;= 20):**Uses a tailored Grid Search for tractable solution space exploration.\n* **Hybrid/Ensemble:**Runs multiple seeds and chooses the best solution for each N.\n* **Collision Detection:**Employs Shapely geometry operations to prevent tree overlap.\n* **Performance:**Code leverages parallelization (`ProcessPoolExecutor`) and high-precision (Decimal) arithmetic.\n## Usage\n[](#usage)\n1. Install dependencies:\n* `shapely`,`numpy`,`pandas`,`matplotlib`,`tqdm`\n* Run the notebook or script sequentially to output results and save a`submission.csv`.\n* Check the score on important N cases (e.g., 1, 10, 25, 50, 100, 150, 200).\n## Output\n[](#output)\n* The notebook prints key logs during computation.\n* A`submission.csv`is generated with columns:`id`,`x`,`y`,`deg`(example row:`001\\_0, s-9.146226, s-0.12832, s-224.999647`).\n## License\n[](#license)\nThis project is released under the[Apache 2.0 License](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).\n## Author\n[](#author)\nAditya Pawar ([Kaggle Profile](https://www.kaggle.com/adityapawar327))\nFor questions or collaboration, feel free to reach out via Kaggle discussions or connect on[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adityapawar327).\n## About\nIn this re-defined optimization problem, help Santa fit Christmas tree toys into the smallest (2-dimension) parcel size possible so that ...",
