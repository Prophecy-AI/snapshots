Participants are tasked with determining the optimal way to pack Christmas tree toys into the smallest possible square box, allowing Santa Claus to mail them efficiently around the globe. The challenge is to find the dimensions of the smallest square box that can fit between 1 to 200 trees.\nThe competition is designed to encourage innovation and problem-solving skills, with a focus on packing efficiency. Participants are encouraged to submit their solutions, which will be evaluated based on the normalized area of the square bounding box for each puzzle configuration.\n### Description\nThe challenge is inspired by Santa&#x27;s need for the smallest box to fit all the tiny trees for his Christmas deliveries. Participants are required to find the best packing solution to help Santa Claus and win the competition&#x27;s prize.\n### Evaluation\nSubmissions are evaluated on the sum of the normalized area of the square bounding box for each puzzle. The formula for the score is:\n```\n`score = \u2211(sn^2/n)`\n```\nwhere`sn`is the side of the square box bounding the trees and`n`is the total number of trees in the configuration.\n### Submission File\nEach submission must include the tree position (`x`,`y`) and rotation (`deg`) for each`id`in the submission. The values must be converted to a string and prepended with an`s`before submission. Submissions with overlapping trees will result in an error. Location values must be constrained to -100 \u2264x, y \u2264100.\nThe file should have the following format:\n```\n`id,x,y,deg\n001\\_0,s0.0,s0.0,s20.411299\n002\\_0,s0.0,s0.0,s20.411299\n002\\_1,s-0.541068,s0.259317,s51.66348\netc.`\n```\n### Timeline\n* **November 17, 2025**: Start Date\n* **January 23, 2026**: Entry Deadline\n* **January 23, 2026**: Team Merger Deadline\n* **January 30, 2026**: Final Submission Deadline\nAll deadlines are at 11:59 PM UTC unless otherwise noted.\n### Prizes\n* **First Prize**: $12,000\n* **Second Prize**: $10,000\n* **Third Prize**: $10,000\n* **Fourth Prize**: $8,000\nAdditionally, a**Rudolph Prize**of $10,000 is awarded to the team holding 1st place on the leaderboard for the longest period of time between November 17, 2025, and January 30, 2026.\n### Citation\nWalter Reade and Ashley Oldacre.
