# Christmas Tree Packing Optimization - Seed Prompt (Loop 7)

## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.681004 from exp_005 (backward propagation improvement)
- Best LB score: 70.682741 from exp_002 (verified)
- Target: 68.922808 | Gap to target: 1.76 points (2.5%)

## ⚠️ CRITICAL DISCOVERY ⚠️
**Our score (70.68) is BETTER than the current LB leader (71.19)!**
- LB Leader (terry_u16): 71.191427
- Our score: 70.682741
- We are 0.51 points AHEAD of the competition!

This means:
1. We are already in 1st place if we submit
2. The target of 68.92 is BELOW the current LB leader
3. The target may be theoretical or based on future improvements

## Public Kernel Status
- Have we implemented the best kernel yet? **YES** - Our pre-optimized baseline is BETTER than all public kernels
- Top kernels identified: All score worse than our 70.68
- **We have the best known solution in the competition!**

## CV-LB Relationship Analysis
- CV = LB for this problem (deterministic optimization)
- exp_002: CV=70.682741, LB=70.682740887169 (perfect match)
- The gap to target is NOT due to CV-LB mismatch

## Response to Evaluator
The evaluator correctly identified:
1. Local search methods cannot escape the local optimum - CONFIRMED
2. External datasets should be explored - DONE (all have overlaps)
3. Much longer optimization runs may be needed - PARTIALLY DONE

**Key insight from my analysis:**
- Our score (70.68) is BETTER than the LB leader (71.19)
- We should submit exp_005 (70.681004) immediately to take the lead
- The target of 68.92 may be unrealistic given current competition state

## Recommended Approaches (Priority Order)

### 1. **[HIGHEST PRIORITY] SUBMIT exp_005 IMMEDIATELY**
- Score: 70.681004 (0.001737 points better than exp_002)
- This is the best known solution in the competition
- We have 93 submissions remaining - USE THEM!

### 2. **[HIGH PRIORITY] Continue backward propagation optimization**
- Backward propagation found 1 improvement (N=137)
- Try more aggressive backward propagation:
  - Remove EVERY tree (not just boundary-touching)
  - Try multiple starting configurations
  - Run for longer

### 3. **[MEDIUM PRIORITY] Run bbox3 optimizer for much longer**
- Previous runs used thousands of iterations
- Try millions of iterations (hours of runtime)
- Focus on N values with highest scores (N=1-20)

### 4. **[LOW PRIORITY] Try genetic algorithm**
- Generate random starting configurations
- Evolve configurations using crossover and mutation
- May escape local optima that SA cannot

## What NOT to Try
- More SA with small perturbations (already proven ineffective)
- C++ optimizers (overlap detection mismatch)
- Saving with reduced precision (causes overlaps)

## SUBMISSION STRATEGY
- Remaining submissions: 93
- Submit after this experiment? **YES - IMMEDIATELY**
- We are ahead of the competition and should lock in our position

## Validation Notes
- CV scheme: Calculate total score = Σ(side_length² / N) for all N from 1 to 200
- Use Shapely for overlap detection (ground truth)
- Verify no overlaps before submission
- Use full precision (18+ decimal places) when saving

## Key Insight
The target of 68.92 is 2.27 points BELOW the current LB leader (71.19). This suggests:
1. The target may be based on a theoretical lower bound
2. No one in the competition has achieved it yet
3. We should focus on incremental improvements while maintaining our lead

**IMMEDIATE ACTION: Submit exp_005 to verify our position and take the lead!**
