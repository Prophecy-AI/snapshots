    "notes": "Implemented pure Python simulated annealing with Shapely collision detection (ground truth). Ran SA on all 200 N configurations with 1000-3000 steps each. Found NO improvements - the pre-optimized baseline is at a very strong local optimum. All configurations remain overlap-free. Gap to target: 1.76 points. The baseline was created with extensive optimization and is very hard to improve further with local search methods."
