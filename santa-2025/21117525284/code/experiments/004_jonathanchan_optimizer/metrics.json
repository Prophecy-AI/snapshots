    "notes": "Ran jonathanchan C++ SA optimizer (opt_v3 + fractional_translation + ls_v3) on repaired baseline. Optimizer improved score from 70.68 to 51.66 but introduced overlaps in 176 N configurations. After repairing overlaps with donor configurations, score returned to 70.68. Only 7 N values were improved without overlaps, but with 0.000000 improvement. The pre-optimized baseline is at a local optimum that's very hard to improve without introducing overlaps. Gap to target: 1.76 points."
