    "notes": "Used pre-optimized santa-2025.csv (70.68) and repaired 12 overlapping N configurations using chistyakov/submission_best.csv. Final score 70.68 with no overlaps. bbox3 optimizer and fix_direction did not improve further (baseline already at local optimum). Backward propagation found tiny improvement (0.0017 points) but introduced overlaps. Gap to target: 1.76 points. Massive improvement from grid baseline (88.14 -> 70.68 = 17.46 points)."
