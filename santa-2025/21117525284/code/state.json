The most widely cited exact framework is the **2\u2011level algorithm with a collision\u2011free region**: the first level places polygons in a coarse grid while the second level refines positions inside the collision\u2011free region, guaranteeing that no overlap occurs and often producing optimal or near\u2011optimal layouts for modest instance sizes\u202f([academia.edu](https://www.academia.edu/104990563/IRREGULAR_PLACEMENT_PROBLEM_Solved_with_a_2_Level_Algorithm_and_Collision_Free_Region)).  For larger, industrial\u2011scale problems the state\u2011of\u2011the\u2011art relies on **local\u2011search based heuristics**\u2014including a pure local\u2011search procedure and a **genetic algorithm** that simultaneously decides which stock sheet (bin) to use, the orientation of each polygon, and the placement order.  Empirical tests show the local\u2011search variant consist",
