One particular category of these packing problems is\ntwo-dimensional packing, which is encountered in everyday scenarios like arranging items\non a shelf and in industrial applications such as cutting cookies from rolled-out dough\nor manufacturing sets of tiles from standard-sized panels made of wood, glass, or metal.\nAnother intriguing example involves cutting fabric pieces for clothing production. In this\ncase, the pieces often cannot be rotated freely, as they must adhere to a desired pattern\nin the final product, which is tailored of multiple elements. The widespread applicability\nof two-dimensional packing problems has led to a surge of interest in designing efficient\nalgorithms to address them. In this paper, we follow the line of research and study the\nproblem of packing convex polygons without rotations in various settings depending on the\ntype of containers used.\nPast research focusing on theoretical considerations of two-dimensional packings mainly\nconcentrates on the scenario when all objects are axis-parallel rectangles. In this paper, we\nwill discuss packing without rotations, in which only translations are permitted. There are\ntwo main classes of the problem depending on whether the size of the container is fixed and\nwe want to minimize the number of containers used or whether we want to minimize the\ncontainer\u2019s size with respect to some objective function.\nA seminal example of the first class is the Geometric Bin Packing problem in which\na number of unit size squared bins to pack is to be minimized. The problem is arguably\nthe most natural generalization of the regular (1D) Bin Packing to two dimensions, and\nits absolute approximability has been fully understood. Unless P = N P, the best possible\nefficient constant factor approximation is 2 [15], and such an algorithm is known [10].\nIn the second class, there are several variants to be considered. An example is the\nStrip Packing Problem which is concerned with packing objects into a strip of width\n1 and infinite height in such a way that the maximum of all the heights of the placed\nobjects is minimized. Like Geometric Bin Packing, Strip Packing generalizes (1D)\nBin Packing. The best known efficient constant factor approximation for Strip Packing\nhas approximation factor (5/3 + \u03f5) [9]. It is known that there can not exist a polynomial\ntime algorithm with an approximation ratio of (3/2 \u2212 \u03f5) for any \u03f5 > 0 unless P = N P, which\nfollows directly from the approximation hardness of (1D) Bin Packing. Both classes of\nproblems have been also considered in the asymptotic setting, see e.g. [11, 5, 12].\nIn younger time, there was also an increase of interest in cases where the objects in\nquestion are general convex polygons. Alt, de Berg and Knauer [2, 3] considered the problem\nof packing an instance consisting of a number of convex polygons of the form p \u2282 [0, 1]2into\na minimum area axis-parallel rectangular container. We refer to this problem as Polygon\nArea Minimization throughout this paper. In the special case where the instance consists\nof rectangles only, the problem is known to admit a PTAS [4]. They proved the existence of\nthe following efficient algorithm:\nA 23.78-approximation for Polygon Area Minimization.\nRecently, Aamand, Abrahamsen, Beretta and Kleist [1] showed that the algorithm of Alt,\nde Berg and Knauer can be leveraged to obtain also efficient approximation algorithms of\nfurther problems:\nA 7-approximation for Polygon Perimeter Minimization.\nA 51-approximation for Polygon Strip Packing.\nAn 11-approximation for Polygon Bin Packing for polygons with diameter at most 1\n10 .\nA. Kurpisz and S. Suter 3\n1.1 Our results\nThe results of Alt, de Berg and Knauer [2, 3] and Aamand et al. [1] are heavily based on\nso-called shelf packing algorithms. In shelf packing algorithms, the objects are first placed\non the shelves, possibly ordered by height, which are later stacked on one another to build\na final solution. Compared to axis-parallel rectangles, the main challenge in designing an\napproximation algorithm for polygon packing problems is that objects cannot be sorted by\nheight and orientation simultaneously. As a result, the algorithm and its analysis in [2, 3]\nhave such a large approximation guarantee. In this paper, we provide new insight into how\nshelf packing algorithms should be applied to polygon packing problems. We introduce a\nsequence of transformations of the objects that allow us first to sort them by height and later\nby orientation to build a solution of a much better approximation guarantee. More precisely,\nwe design polynomial-time algorithms with the following factors:\nA 9.45-approximation for Polygon Area Minimization.\nUsing this algorithm as a subroutine, we build upon the methods from Aamand et al. [1] to\nobtain the following efficient approximation algorithms:\nA (3.75 + \u03f5)-approximation for Polygon Perimeter Minimization.\nA 21.89-approximation for Polygon Strip Packing.\nA 5.09-approximation for Polygon Bin Packing for polygons which have their diameter\nbounded by 1\n10 .\nThe results are proved in Sections 4, 5, 6, and 7 respectively. Furthermore, in Section 8\nwe show the following results, which make progress towards solving an open question of a\nO(1)-approximation algorithm for Polygon Bin Packing for arbitrary polygons.\nThere is an efficient O(\n1\n\u03b4\n)-approximation algorithm for Polygon Bin Packing for\ninstances where each polygon has width or height at most 1 \u2212 \u03b4.\nThere is an efficient O(1)-approximation algorithm for Polygon Bin Packing for\ninstances with the property that all polygons share a spine (up to translation) with height\nat least 3\n4\n.\n2 Preliminaries\nWe start out considerations by recalling a classical and well-known problem in theoretical\ncomputer science, the Bin Packing problem: Given a list of numbers s1, . . . , sn \u2208 (0, 1] \u2229 Q,\nrepresenting the sizes of n objects, the goal is to find the minimum number of bins of size 1,\nso that we can pac...",

Grandoni, E. Husi\u0107, M. Mari and A. Tinguely XX:1\n1 Introduction\nThe Maximum Independent Set of Convex Polygons problem (MISP) is a natural geometric\npacking problem with many applications in map labeling [13, 39], cellular networks [34],\nunsplittable flow [6], chip manufacturing [27], or data mining [18, 33]. Given a set of n\nconvex polygons in the plane, the goal is to select a maximum number of them such that the\npolygons are pairwise non-overlapping.\nMISP is NP-hard [16, 28], hence it makes sense to design approximation algorithms for it.\nDisappointingly, the best (polynomial-time) approximation ratio for MISP (more precisely\nfor k-intersecting curves) has been n\n\u03b5\n[17], for any fixed constant \u03b5 > 0. This ratio has\nrecently been improved to OPT\u03b5[12].\nApproximation Schemes. Interestingly, there is a quasi-polynomial time approximation\nscheme (QPTAS) for MISP [1] (if the polygons have at most quasi-polynomially many\nvertices in total). Thus, the problem is not APX-Hard, assuming NP \u2288 DTIME(2polylog(n)),\nsuggesting that it should be possible to obtain a polynomial time approximation scheme\n(PTAS) for the problem.\nIf we assume that we are allowed to shrink the polygons by a factor 1\u2212\u03b4 for an arbitrarily\nsmall constant \u03b4, then there is a PTAS for the problem [40]. Note that here the output is\ncompared to the optimal solution without shrinking.\nWhen the input polygons are fat, e.g., regular polygons, then PTASes are known [9, 15].\nAxis-parallel rectangles. A prominent special case of MISP that has attracted a lot of\nattention over the years is the maximum independent set of axis-parallel rectangles (MISR),\nwhere all the polygons are rectangles with their edges parallel with the axes. An O(log n)\napproximation for MISR was given in [30, 38]. This was slightly improved to O(log n/ log log n)\nin [10], and substantially improved to O(log log n) in [7]. In a recent breakthrough result,\nMitchell [36] presented the first constant factor approximation algorithm with approximation\nratio 10, and later 3 + \u03b5 in an updated version [37] with a considerably shorter case analysis.\nSubsequently, his approach was simplified and improved to a (2 +\u03b5)-approximation algorithm\nby G\u00e1lvez, Khan, Mari, M\u00f6mke, Reddy, and Wiese [21, 22]. These approaches rely on a\ndynamic program that considers all the partitions of a bounding box containing the instance\ninto a number of containers with constant complexity (constant number of line segments).\nOur contribution. With the goal of better understanding the approximability of MISP, in\nthis paper, we consider the following natural special case of MISP: d-MISP is the special case of\nMISP where the edges of the input polygons are parallel to a given set D of d = |D| directions.\nNotice that MISR is equivalent to 2-MISP. Our main result is a constant approximation for\nd-MISP when d is a constant.\n\u25b6 Theorem 1. There exists an 8d/3-approximation algorithm for d-MISP running in time\nO((nd)\nO(d4\nd\n)\n).\nOur result builds on the approaches in [21, 22, 37], however we have to face several additional\ncomplications. In particular, already for d = 3 the algorithm and its analysis deviates\nsubstantially from the known (polynomial-time) results in the literature about axis-aligned\nrectangles. An overview of our approach is given in Section 3.\nRelated Work. One can consider a natural weighted version of MISP, where each convex\npolygon has a positive weight, and the goal is to find an independent set of maximum total\nweight. The weighted version of MISR was studied in the literature, and the current-best\npolynomial time approximation factor is O(log log n) [8]. We remark that our approach,\nlikewise the approaches in [21, 22, 36], does not seem to extend to the weighted case.

The edge e3(P) is degenerate.\nparticular, finding a constant approximation for weighted MISR remains a challenging open\nproblem. We remark that the QPTAS in [1] extends to the weighted case, hence suggesting\nthat the weighted version of MISP might also admit a PTAS.\nMISR was also studied in terms of parameterized algorithms. Marx [35] proved that\nthe problem is W[1]-hard, which rules out the existence of an EPTAS. A parameterized\napproximation scheme for the problem is given in [23].\nA rectangle packing problem related to MISR is the 2D Knapsack problem. Here we\nare given an axis-parallel square (the knapsack) and a collection of axis-parallel rectangles.\nThe goal is to pack a maximum cardinality (or weight) subset of rectangles in the knapsack\n(without rotations). 2D Knapsack admits a QPTAS [2] and a few constant approximation\nalgorithms are known [19, 20, 29]. Here as well, finding a PTAS is a challenging open\nproblem.\nBonsma et al. [6] established an intriguing connection between MISR and the Unsplittable\nFlow on a Path problem. A PTAS for the latter problem was recently obtained [24], closing\na very long line of research (see, e.g., [3, 4, 5, 6, 25, 26]).\n2 Preliminaries\nIn this paper, a (possibly closed) curve is always assumed to be a polygonal chain (or a\nsingleton point) and a polygon S is a bounded set with non-empty interior int(S) and whose\nboundary \u2202S is a closed curve. We denote the closure of S as S\u00af, so S\u00af = \u2202S \u222a int(S). We say\nthat two polygons S, T (with non-empty interior) touch if int(S)\u2229int(T) = \u2205 but \u2202S\u2229\u2202T \u0338= \u2205\nand intersect if int(S) \u2229 int(T) \u0338= \u2205. A curve f touches S if f \u2229 int(S) = \u2205 but f \u2229 \u2202S \u0338= \u2205.\nA line segment or curve is called degenerate if it is a singleton point. A line segment\nor curve is assumed to be non-degenerate unless we explicitly state the opposite. For an\n(oriented) line segment e = ww\u2032 (resp. curve \u03b3 = w1w2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 wk) we define the head of e (of \u03b3)\nas h(e) = w\n\u2032\n(h(\u03b3) = wk) and the tail of e (of \u03b3) as t(e) = w (t(\u03b3) = w1) and the interior of\ne (of \u03b3) as int(e) = e \\ {h(e), t(e)} (int(\u03b3) = \u03b3 \\ {h(\u03b3), t(\u03b3)}). For a degenerate line segment\n(resp. curve), the head and the tail coincide with the line segment (resp. curve).\nFor a vector v = (x, y), let v\n\u22a5 := (y, \u2212x) (which is v rot...",

In*two-dimensional bin packing problems*these units are finite rectangles, and the objective is to pack all the items into the minimum number of units, while in*two-dimensional strip packing problems*there is a single standardized unit of given width, and the objective is to pack all the items within the minimum height. We discuss mathematical models, and survey lower bounds, classical approximation algorithms, recent heuristic and metaheuristic methods and exact enumerative approaches. The relevant special cases where the items have to be packed into rows forming levels are also discussed in detail.\n## Introduction\nIn several industrial applications one is required to allocate a set of rectangular items to larger rectangular standardized stock units by minimizing the waste. In wood or glass industries, rectangular components have to be cut from large sheets of material. In warehousing contexts, goods have to be placed on shelves. In newspapers paging, articles and advertisements have to be arranged in pages. In these applications, the standardized stock units are rectangles, and a common objective function is to pack all the requested items into the minimum number of units: the resulting optimization problems are known in the literature as two-dimensional bin packing problems. In other contexts, such as paper or cloth industries, we have instead a single standardized unit (a roll of material), and the objective is to obtain the items by using the minimum roll length: the problems are then referred to as two-dimensional strip packing problems. As we will see in the following, the two problems have a strict relation in almost all algorithmic approaches to their solution.\nMost of the contributions in the literature are devoted to the case where the items to be packed have a fixed orientation with respect to the stock unit(s), i.e., one is not allowed to rotate them. This case, which is the object of the present article, reflects a number of practical contexts, such as the cutting of corrugated or decorated material (wood, glass, cloth industries), or the newspapers paging. For variants allowing rotations (usually by 90\u00b0) and/or constraints on the items placement (such as the \u201cguillotine cuts\u201d), the reader is referred to Lodi et al. [41], [42], where a three-field classification of the area is also introduced. General surveys on cutting and packing problems can be found in Dyckhoff and Finke [17], Dowsland and Dowsland [16] and Dyckhoff et al. [18]. Results on the probabilistic analysis of packing algorithms can be found in Coffman and Shor [12] and Coffman and Lueker [11].\nLet us introduce the problems in a more formal way. We are given a set of*n*rectangular*items**j*\u2208*J*={1,\u2026,*n*}, each defined by a*width*,*w**j*, and a*height*,*h**j*:\n* (i)\nin the*Two-Dimensional Bin Packing Problem*(2BP), we are further given an unlimited number of identical rectangular*bins*of width*W*and height*H*, and the objective is to allocate all the items to the minimum number of bins;\n* (ii)\nin the*Two-Dimensional Strip Packing Problem*(2SP), we are further given a bin of width*W*and infinite height (hereafter called*strip*), and the objective is to allocate all the items to the strip by minimizing the height to which the strip is used.\nIn both cases, the items have to be packed with their*w*-edges parallel to the*W*-edge of the bins (or strip). We will assume, with no loss of generality, that all input data are positive integers, and that*w**j*\u2a7d*W*and*h**j*\u2a7d*H*(*j*=1,\u2026,*n*).\nBoth problems are strongly NP-hard, as is easily seen by transformation from the strongly NP-hard (one-dimensional)*Bin Packing Problem*(1BP), in which*n*items, each having an associated size*h**j*, have to be partitioned into the minimum number of subsets so that the sum of the sizes in each subset does not exceed a given capacity*H*.\nA third relevant case of rectangle packing is the following. Each item*j*has an associated profit*p**j*&gt;0, and the problem is to select a subset of items, to be packed in a single finite bin, which maximizes the total selected profit. This problem is usually denoted as (*Two-Dimensional*)*Cutting Stock*, although it had been introduced by Gilmore and Gomory [29] as (*Two-Dimensional*)*Cutting Knapsack*.\nIn this survey we concentrate on two-dimensional problems in which all items have to be packed, i.e., on 2SP and 2BP. The reader is referred to Dyckhoff et al. [18, Section 5] for an annotated bibliography on two-dimensional cutting stock problems. For both 2SP and 2BP, we also consider the special case where the items have to be packed into rows forming levels.\nIn Section 2 we discuss mathematical models for the various problems introduced above.

We first focus on the perfect packing problem (PP), which is a special case of 2SP, wherein all given rectangles are required to be packed without wasted space, and design branch-and-bound algorithms introducing several branching rules and bounding operations. A combination of these rules yields an algorithm that is especially efficient for feasible instances of PP. We then propose several methods of applying the PP algorithms to 2SP. Our algorithms succeed in efficiently solving benchmark instances of PP with up to 500 rectangles and those of 2SP with up to 200 rectangles. They are often faster than existing exact algorithms specially tailored for problems without rotations.\n\n## Suggested Citation\n\nKenmochi, Mitsutoshi & Imamichi, Takashi & Nonobe, Koji & Yagiura, Mutsunori & Nagamochi, Hiroshi, 2009.\n\" **[Exact algorithms for the two-dimensional strip packing problem with and without rotations](https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/ejores/v198y2009i1p73-83.html)**,\"\n[European Journal of Operational Research](https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/ejores.html), Elsevier, vol. 198(1), pages 73-83, October.\nHandle: _RePEc:eee:ejores:v:198:y:2009:i:1:p:73-83_\n\nas\n\nHTMLHTML with abstractplain textplain text with abstractBibTeXRIS (EndNote, RefMan, ProCite)ReDIFJSON\n\n## Download full text from publisher\n\n**File URL:** http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377-2217(08)00737-6 **Download Restriction:** Full text for ScienceDirect subscribers only\n---><---\n\nAs the access to this document is restricted, you may want to\n\nsearchfor a different version of it.\n\n## References listed on IDEAS\n\nas\n\nHTMLHTML with abstractplain textplain text with abstractBibTeXRIS (EndNote, RefMan, ProCite)ReDIFJSON\n\n01.

Our rectangle packer chooses the x-coordinates of all the rectangles before any of the y-coordinates. We then transform the problem into a perfect-packing problem with no empty space by adding additional rectangles. To determine the y-coordinates, we branch on the different rectangles that can be placed in each empty position. Our packer allows us to extend the known solutions for a consecutive-square benchmark from 27 to 32 squares. We also introduce three new benchmarks, avoiding properties that make a benchmark easy, such as rectangles with shared dimensions. Our third benchmark consists of rectangles of increasingly high precision. To pack them efficiently, we limit the rectangles' coordinates and the bounding box dimensions to the set of subset sums of the rectangles' dimensions. Overall, our algorithms represent the current state-of-the-art for this problem, outperforming other algorithms by orders of magnitude, depending on the benchmark.\n## Article Details\nIssue\n[Vol. 46 (2013)](https://jair.org/index.php/jair/issue/view/1130)\nSection\nArticles\n## news\nNEWS\n[AAAI Contributes to JAIR Sustainability Campaign](https://jair.org/index.php/jair/News#AAAIContribution)\n[Reproducibility Initiative](https://jair.org/index.php/jair/News#Reproducibility)\n[2025 IJCAI-JAIR Prize Awarded](https://jair.org/index.php/jair/News#IJCAI-JAIR)\n[Special Track on Multi-Agent Path Finding](https://jair.org/index.php/jair/News#Special-TrackMAPF)\n[JAIR Available in ACM Library](https://jair.org/index.php/jair/News#ACM)\n[JAIR Sustainability Campaign: Help Support Us](https://jair.org/index.php/jair/News#sustainability)\n## submission\nSUBMISSIONS\nJAIR invites submissions in all areas of AI.

      "text": "Optimal Rectangle Packing: A Meta-CSP Approach\nMichael D. Moffitt and Martha E. Pollack\nDepartment of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science\nUniversity of Michigan\nAnn Arbor, MI 48109, USA\n{mmoffitt, pollackm}@eecs.umich.edu\nAbstract\nWe present a new approach to optimal rectangle packing, an\nNP-complete problem that can be used to model many sim\u0002ple scheduling tasks. Recent attempts at incorporating artifi\u0002cial intelligence search techniques to the problem of rectangle\npacking have focused on a CSP formulation, in which partial\nassignments are defined to be the fixed placement of a sub\u0002set of rectangles. Our technique takes a significant departure\nfrom this search space, as we instead view partial assignments\nas subsets of relative pairwise relationships between rectan\u0002gles. This approach recalls the meta-CSP commonly con\u0002structed in constraint-based temporal reasoning, and is thus a\ncandidate for several pruning techniques that have been de\u0002veloped in that field. We apply these to the domain of rect\u0002angle packing, and develop a suite of new techniques that ex\u0002ploit both the symmetry and geometry present in this partic\u0002ular domain. We then provide experimental results demon\u0002strating that our approach performs competitively compared\nto the previous state-of-the-art on a series of benchmarks,\nmatching or surpassing it in speed on nearly all instances.\nFinally, we conjecture that our technique is particularly ap\u0002propriate for problems containing large rectangles, which are\ndifficult for the fixed-placement formulation to handle effi\u0002ciently.\nIntroduction\nThe problem of rectangle packing is one that has drawn at\u0002tention from several diverse fields of computer science. For\ninstance, in the context of scheduling, it can be used to rep\u0002resent scenarios where jobs require a fixed amount of time\nand resources, which compose the two dimensions of a sin\u0002gle rectangle. The task of packing many such rectangles into\nan enclosing space, so as to minimize the width, height, or\narea of this space, allows for the minimization of makespan,\nresources needed, or total wasted resource. In VLSI design,\nrectangles represent actual physical modules that need to be\nplaced in a spatial arrangement such that no two modules\noverlap.\nOne of the more recent approaches (Korf 2003) has cast\noptimal rectangle packing as a constraint satisfaction prob\u0002lem (CSP). In this formulation, a variable is created for each\nrectangle, whose legal values are the positions that rectan\u0002gle could occupy without exceeding the boundaries of the\nenclosing space. In addition, there is a binary constraint\nbetween each pair of rectangles, requiring that they do not\nCopyright \u0001c 2006, American Association for Artificial Intelli\u0002gence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved.\noverlap. To solve this CSP, Korf developed a backtracking\nalgorithm, where each partial assignment is defined to be\nthe fixed placement of a subset of rectangles. By obtaining\nlower bounds on the amount of wasted space at each node in\nthe search, an efficient algorithm is constructed, which was\nlater refined (Korf 2004) into the fastest known algorithm\nfor optimal rectangle packing.\nIn this paper, we present a new approach to rectangle\npacking. Specifically, we cast the problem of optimally\npacking a set of rectangles with fixed orientations as a meta\u0002CSP. In this formulation, we create a meta-variable for each\npair of rectangles, whose values are the four pairwise re\u0002lationships (i.e., above, below, left of, right of) that pre\u0002vent that pair from overlapping. As such, commitment to\nthe exact placement of any rectangle is not established un\u0002til a consistent solution has been generated. In this regard,\nour approach resembles graph-based methods for optimal\nrectangle packing (Onodera, Taniguchi, & Tamaru 1991),\nwhich have previously been unable to cope with more than a\nsmall handful of rectangles. The key difference in our meta\u0002CSP formulation is the introduction of modern artificial\u0002intelligence search techniques that greatly increase the effi\u0002ciency of exploring this alternative space. Some of these are\ndrawn from literature on constraint-based temporal reason\u0002ing (Dechter, Meiri, & Pearl 1991; Stergiou & Koubarakis\n1998; Tsamardinos & Pollack 2003), while others are en\u0002tirely new techniques that exploit the symmetry and geom\u0002etry present in this particular domain. We combine these\nmethods to create the BLUEBLOCKER solver, and provide ex\u0002perimental results demonstrating that our approach performs\ncompetitively compared to the previous state-of-the-art on a\nseries of benchmarks. Finally, we conjecture that our tech\u0002nique is particularly appropriate for problems containing\nlarge rectangles, which are difficult for the fixed-placement\nformulation to handle efficiently.\nBackground\nRectangle Packing\nConsider the following problem: we are given a set of N\njobs, where each job j requires a specific number of workers\n(or machines) mj and a specific amount of uninterrupted\nprocessing time pj . Assuming that all workers are paid the\nsame salary and work the same hours, one may wish to find\na schedule that minimizes the total cost of labor (which is\nproportional to the product of number of workers and the\ntotal hours worked).\n93\nThis problem can be approximated as a rectangle pack\u0002ing problem.1 Specifically, each job can be represented by a\nrectangle, with width wj being equal to the time required pj ,\nand height hj being equal to the required number of work\u0002ers mj . Minimizing the total labor cost is then equivalent to\nfinding an enclosing rectangle of dimensions W \u00d7 H whose\ntotal area is minimal. We refer to this as the Minimal Bound\u0002ing Box Problem. The decision variant of this, where the di\u0002mensions of the enclosing space are specified, we refer to as\nthe Containment Problem.\nPrevious work on rectangle packing has primarily focused\non generating approximate or suboptimal solutions, using\ntechniques such as genetic algorithms and simulated anneal\u0002ing. To facilitate these approaches, a number of data struc\u0002tures have been developed to represent a layout of rectangles\nincluding sequence pairs (Murata et al. 1995), BSG struc\u0002tures (Nakatake et al. 1996), and O-Trees (Guo, Cheng, &\nYoshimura 1999). We omit the details of such structures, as\nthey are largely unrelated to our formulation.\nThe first line of research to consider optimal two\u0002dimensional compactions of rectangles (Onodera,\nTaniguchi, & Tamaru 1991) applied a branch-and-bound\napproach, using a graph algorithm to maintain consistency\nat each step of the backtracking search. Extensions of\nthis method have been largely avoided, as it was shown to\nhandle no more than six rectangles tractably. More recently,\nan algorithm using the O-Tree representation was able\nto surpass this record by efficiently handling up to nine\nrectangles (Chan & Markov 2004).\nRectangle Packing as a CSP\nOne of the more distinctive approaches to rectangle packing\n(Korf 2003) applied artificial intelligence search techniques\nwith great success. In this work, rectangle packing is mod\u0002eled as a binary constraint satisfaction problem. There is a\nvariable for each rectangle, whose legal values are the po\u0002sitions it could occupy without exceeding the boundaries of\nthe enclosing space. In addition, there is a binary constraint\nbetween each pair of rectangles that they cannot overlap.\nTo solve this CSP, a backtracking algorithm is used. At\neach node in the search, a rectangle is given a fixed posi\u0002tion within the enclosing space. This is accomplished by\n\u201cdrawing\u201d the rectangle (or an outline of the rectangle) onto\na bitmap representing the entire area. For example, one such\npartial assignment is depicted in Figure 1. Here, two rect\u0002angles (in fact, squares) have been given assignments. The\nupper-left corner of the 6\u00d76 square has been placed at (0, 0),\nand the upper-left corner of the 5\u00d75 square has been placed\nat (6, 0). Suppose we have four more squares remaining,\nwith dimensions 4\u00d74, 3\u00d73, 2\u00d72, and 1\u00d71; by visual in\u0002spection...",

In addition, we present efficient approximation algorithms for special cases of the Polygon Bin Packing problem, progressing toward solving an open question concerning an O(1)-approximation algorithm for arbitrary polygons.\n Comments: This is the full version of the same-named paper which will be presented at ESA 2023 conference\n Subjects: Computational Geometry (cs.CG)  \n MSC classes: 68Q25  \n ACM classes: F.2.2  \n Cite as: arXiv:2308.08523 [cs.CG]  \n (or arXiv:2308.08523v1 [cs.CG] for this version) \n https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2308.08523 \n Focus to learn more  \n arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite \n \n\n Submission history\n\n From: Silvan Suter [view email]\n [v1] Wed, 16 Aug 2023 17:20:46 UTC (2,689 KB)\n Full-text links:\n\n Access Paper:\n\n Download a PDF of the paper titled Improved Approximations for Translational Packing of Convex Polygons, by Adam Kurpisz and Silvan Suter\n * Download PDF\n * PostScript\n * Other Formats\n (view license)\n Current browse context:\n cs.CG\n < prev | next >\n new | recent | 2308\n Change to browse by:\n cs\n\n References & Citations\n\n * NASA ADS\n * Google Scholar\n * Semantic Scholar\n a export BibTeX citation Loading...\n\n BibTeX formatted citation\n\n \u00d7\n loading...\n Data provided by:\n\n Bookmark\n\n Bibliographic Tools\n\n Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\n Bibliographic Explorer Toggle\n Bibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\n Litmaps Toggle\n Litmaps (What is Litmaps?)\n scite.ai Toggle\n scite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\n Code, Data, Media\n\n Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\n Links to Code Toggle\n CatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers (What is CatalyzeX?)\n DagsHub Toggle\n DagsHub (What is DagsHub?)\n Links to Code Toggle\n Papers with Code (What is Papers with Code?)\n ScienceCast Toggle\n ScienceCast (What is ScienceCast?)\n Demos\n\n Demos\n\n Replicate Toggle\n Replicate (What is Replicate?)\n Spaces Toggle\n Hugging Face Spaces (What is Spaces?)\n Related Papers\n\n Recommenders and Search Tools\n\n Link to Influence Flower\n Influence Flower (What are Influence Flowers?)\n Connected Papers Toggle\n Connected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\n Core recommender toggle\n CORE Recommender (What is CORE?)\n About arXivLabs\n\n arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\n arXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\n Both individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\n Have an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

      "text": "New Improvements in Optimal Rectangle Packing\nEric Huang and Richard E. Korf\nComputer Science Department\nUniversity of California, Los Angeles\nLos Angeles, CA 90095\nehuang@cs.ucla.edu, korf@cs.ucla.edu\nAbstract\nThe rectangle packing problem consists of find\u0002ing an enclosing rectangle of smallest area that can\ncontain a given set of rectangles without overlap.\nOur algorithm picks the x-coordinates of all the\nrectangles before picking any of the y-coordinates.\nFor the x-coordinates, we present a dynamic vari\u0002able ordering heuristic and an adaptation of a prun\u0002ing algorithm used in previous solvers. We then\ntransform the rectangle packing problem into a per\u0002fect packing problem that has no empty space, and\npresent inference rules to reduce the instance size.\nFor the y-coordinates we search a space that models\nempty positions as variables and rectangles as val\u0002ues. Our solver is over 19 times faster than the pre\u0002vious state-of-the-art on the largest problem solved\nto date, allowing us to extend the known solutions\nfor a consecutive-square packing benchmark from\nN=27 to N=32.\n1 Introduction\nGiven a set of rectangles, our problem is to find all enclosing\nrectangles of minimum area that will contain them without\noverlap. We refer to an enclosing rectangle as a bounding\nbox. The optimization problem is NP-hard, while the prob\u0002lem of deciding whether a set of rectangles can be packed in\na given bounding box is NP-complete, via a reduction from\nbin-packing [Korf, 2003]. The consecutive-square packing\nbenchmark is a simple set of increasingly difficult bench\u0002marks for this problem, where the task is to find the bounding\nboxes of minimum area that contain a set of squares of sizes\n1x1, 2x2, ..., up to NxN [Korf, 2003]. For example, Figure 1\nis an optimal solution for N=32. We use this benchmark here\nbut none of the techniques introduced in this paper are spe\u0002cific to packing squares as opposed to rectangles.\nRectangle packing has many practical applications. It ap\u0002pears when loading a set of rectangular objects on a pallet\nwithout stacking them, and also in VLSI design where rect\u0002angular circuit components must be packed onto a rectangu\u0002lar chip. Various other cutting stock and layout problems also\nhave rectangle packing at their core.\nFigure 1: An optimal solution for N=32 with a bounding box\nof 85x135.\n511\n(a) Compulsory part of a 5x2 at\nx=[0,2]\n(b) Assigning a 4x2 to [0,2].\nFigure 2: Examples of compulsory parts and intervals.\n2 Previous Work\nKorf [2003] divided the rectangle packing problem into two\nsubproblems: the minimal bounding box problem and the\ncontainment problem. The former finds a bounding box of\nleast area that can contain a given set of rectangles, while the\nlatter tries to pack the given rectangles in a given bounding\nbox. The algorithm that solves the minimal bounding box\nproblem calls the algorithm that solves the containment prob\u0002lem as a subroutine.\n2.1 Minimal Bounding Box Problem\nA simple way to solve the minimal bounding box problem\nis to find the minimum and maximum areas that describe\nthe set of feasible and potentially optimal bounding boxes.\nBounding boxes of all dimensions can be generated with ar\u0002eas within this range, and then tested in non-decreasing order\nof area until all feasible solutions of smallest area are found.\nThe minimum area is the sum of the areas of the given rectan\u0002gles. The maximum area is determined by the bounding box\nof a greedy solution found by setting the bounding box height\nto that of the tallest rectangle, and then placing the rectangles\nin the first available position when scanning from left to right,\nand for each column scanning from bottom to top.\n2.2 Containment Problem\nKorf\u2019s [2003] absolute placement approach modeled rectan\u0002gles as variables and empty locations in the bounding box\nas values. Moffitt and Pollack\u2019s [2006] relative placement ap\u0002proach used a variable for every pair of rectangles to represent\nthe relations above, below, left, and right. Absolute place\u0002ment was faster than relative placement [Korf et al., 2009],\nwhich in turn was faster than the methods of Clautiaux et al.\n[2007] and Beldiceanu et al. [2008].\nSimonis and O\u2019Sullivan [2008] used Clautiaux et al.\u2019s\n[2007] variable order with additional constraints from\nBeldiceanu et al. [2008] to greatly outperform Korf et al.\u2019s\nsolver [2009]. They used Prolog\u2019s backtracking engine to\nsolve a set of constraints which they specified prior to the\nsearch effort. They first assigned the x-coordinates of all\nthe rectangles before any of the y-coordinates. Since we use\nsome of these ideas, we review them here.\nSimonis and O\u2019Sullivan [2008] used two sets of redundant\nvariables for the x-coordinates. The first set of N variables\ncorrespond to \u201cintervals\u201d where a rectangle is assigned an\ninterval of x-coordinates. Interval sizes are hand-picked for\neach rectangle prior to search, and they induce a smaller rect\u0002angle representing the common intersecting area of placing\nthe rectangle in any location in the interval [Beldiceanu et\nal., 2008]. Larger intervals result in weaker constraint prop\u0002agation (less pruning) but a smaller branching factor, while\nsmaller intervals result in stronger constraint propagation but\na larger branching factor.\nAs shown in Figure 2b, a 4x2 rectangle assigned an x\u0002interval of [0,2] consumes 2 units of area at each x-coordinate\nin [2,3], represented by the doubly-hatched area. This \u201ccom\u0002pulsory profile\u201d [Beldiceanu et al., 2008] is a constraint com\u0002mon to all positions x \u2208 [0, 2] of the original 4x2 rectan\u0002gle. If there were no feasible set of interval assignments, then\nthe constraint would save us from having to try individual x\u0002values. However, if we do find a set of interval assignments,\nthen we must search for a set of single x-coordinate val\u0002ues. Simonis and O\u2019Sullivan [2008] used a total of 4N vari\u0002ables, assigning (in order) x-intervals, single x-coordinates,\ny-intervals, and finally single y-coordinates.\n3 Overall Search Strategy\nWe separate the containment problem from the minimal\nbounding box problem, and use Korf et al.\u2019s [2009] al\u0002gorithm to solve the latter problem. Like Simonis and\nO\u2019Sullivan [2008], we assign all x-coordinates prior to any y\u0002coordinates, and use interval variables for the x-coordinates.\nWe set a rectangle\u2019s interval size to 0.35 times its width,\nwhich gave us the best performance. Finally, we do not use\ninterval variables for the y-coordinates. All of the remaining\nideas presented in this paper are our contributions.\nAlthough we use some ideas used by Simonis and\nO\u2019Sullivan [2008], we do not take a constraint programming\napproach in which all constraints are specified to a general\npurpose solver like Prolog, prior to the search effort. Instead,\nwe have implemented our program from scratch in C++, al\u0002lowing us to easily choose which constraints and inferences to\nuse at what time, and giving us more flexibility during search.\nFor example, as we will explain later, we make different in\u0002ferences depending on the partial solution.\nWe implemented a chronological backtracking algorithm\nwith dynamic variable ordering and forward checking. Our\nalgorithm works in three stages as it goes from the root of the\nsearch tree down to the leaves:\n1. It first works on the x-coordinates in a model where\nvariables are rectangles and values are x-coordinate lo\u0002cations, using dynamic variable ordering by area and a\nconstraint that detects infeasible subtrees.\n2. For each x-coordinate solution found, it conducts a per\u0002fect packing transformation, applies inference rules to\nreduce the transformed problem size, and derives conti\u0002guity constraints between rectangles.\n3. It then searches for a set of y-coordinates in a model\nwhere variables are empty corners and values are rect\u0002angles.\n4 Assigning X-Coordinates\nFor the x-coordinates, we propose a dynamic variable order\nand a constraint adapted from Korf\u2019s [2003] wasted-space\npruning heuristic. For a bounding box of size WxH we use\n512\nan array of size W representing the...",
