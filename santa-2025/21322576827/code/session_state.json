      "finding": "This is a 2D polygon packing optimization problem. Goal: pack n Christmas trees (n=1 to 200) into smallest square bounding box. Score = sum of (side^2/n) for all n. Trees are 15-vertex polygons with specific shape (trunk + 3-tier branches). Key techniques: 1) bbox3 binary optimizer for global optimization, 2) shake_public for local refinement, 3) fix_direction rotation tightening using convex hull and minimize_scalar, 4) overlap repair by replacing invalid groups with donor solutions",
