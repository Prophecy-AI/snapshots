      "query": "What are the best optimization algorithms for 2D irregular polygon packing problems?",
      "finding": "For 2D irregular polygon packing problems, various optimization algorithms have been explored, with metaheuristic and hybrid approaches being particularly prominent. One effective method is a hybrid approach combining genetic algorithms with linear programming, which has been shown to optimize irregular packing efficiently ([MDPI](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/13/22/12474)). Additionally, local search heuristics based on nonlinear programming have been successfully applied to irregular strip packing problems, often outperforming conventional heuristics in minimizing waste ([ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0305054811001596)). Metaheuristic algorithms such as genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, and tabu search have also been reviewed extensively, with genetic algorithms being particularly popular due to their ability to explore large search spaces effectively ([Springer](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1012590107280)).

      "query": "What are the best techniques for minimizing bounding box in 2D polygon packing with rotation?",
      "finding": "Minimizing the bounding box in 2D polygon packing with rotation involves several advanced techniques aimed at reducing the overall area while ensuring polygons do not overlap. One of the most effective approaches is the use of exact algorithms such as branch-and-bound methods, which systematically explore possible placements and rotations to find the optimal solution. For instance, a parallel branch-and-bound-and-prune algorithm has been proposed for irregular strip packing with discrete rotations, which employs bounding techniques and conflict graphs to prune the search space efficiently ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.21009)). These algorithms often incorporate geometric computations like the minimum-area oriented bounding box (OMBB), which can be calculated using the rotating calipers method on the convex hull of the polygons, leading to tighter bounding boxes ([geidav.wordpress.com](https://geidav.wordpress.com/2014/01/23/computing-oriented-minimum-bounding-boxes-in-2d)). \n\nHeu",
