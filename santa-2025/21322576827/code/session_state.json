      "finding": "This is a 2D polygon packing optimization problem. Goal: pack n Christmas trees (n=1 to 200) into smallest square bounding box. Score = sum of (side^2/n) for all n. Trees are 15-vertex polygons with specific shape (trunk + 3-tier branches). Key techniques: 1) bbox3 binary optimizer for global optimization, 2) shake_public for local refinement, 3) fix_direction rotation tightening using convex hull and minimize_scalar, 4) overlap repair by replacing invalid groups with donor solutions",

      "query": "What are the best optimization algorithms for 2D irregular polygon packing problems?",
      "finding": "For 2D irregular polygon packing problems, various optimization algorithms have been explored, with metaheuristic and hybrid approaches being particularly prominent. One effective method is a hybrid approach combining genetic algorithms with linear programming, which has been shown to optimize irregular packing efficiently ([MDPI](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/13/22/12474)). Additionally, local search heuristics based on nonlinear programming have been successfully applied to irregular strip packing problems, often outperforming conventional heuristics in minimizing waste ([ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0305054811001596)). Metaheuristic algorithms such as genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, and tabu search have also been reviewed extensively, with genetic algorithms being particularly popular due to their ability to explore large search spaces effectively ([Springer](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1012590107280)).
