      "text": "For 2D irregular polygon packing problems, various optimization algorithms have been explored, with metaheuristic and hybrid approaches being particularly prominent. One effective method is a hybrid approach combining genetic algorithms with linear programming, which has been shown to optimize irregular packing efficiently ([MDPI](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/13/22/12474)). Additionally, local search heuristics based on nonlinear programming have been successfully applied to irregular strip packing problems, often outperforming conventional heuristics in minimizing waste ([ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0305054811001596)). Metaheuristic algorithms such as genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, and tabu search have also been reviewed extensively, with genetic algorithms being particularly popular due to their ability to explore large search spaces effectively ([Springer](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1012590107280)). More recent research emphasizes the use of local search heuristics and particle swarm optimization for handling the complexity of irregular shapes, especially in heterogeneous bin packing scenarios ([RePEc](https://ideas.repec.org/a/pal/jorsoc/v60y2009i1d10.1057_jors.2008.169), [Springer](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10479-013-1341-4)). Overall, hybrid algorithms combining metaheuristics with exact methods or nonlinear programming appear to be among the most effective for tackling the complexity of irregular polygon packing in 2D.",

It adopts two neighborhoods, swapping two given polygons in a placement and placing one polygon into a new position. The local search algorithm is used to minimize the overlap on the basis of the neighborhoods mentioned above and the unconstrained[nonlinear programming](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/nonlinear-programming)model is adopted to further minimize the overlap during the search process. Moreover, the[tabu](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/tabu)search algorithm is used to avoid[local minima](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/local-minimum), and a compact algorithm is presented to improve the result. The results of standard test instances indicate that when compared with other existing algorithms, the presented algorithm does not only show some signs of competitive power but also updates several best known results.\n## Introduction\nThe irregular strip packing problem, also known as the nesting problem, has a wide area of applications. Given a set of irregular shapes and a rectangular strip with a fixed width and an arbitrary length, the target of the two-dimensional irregular strip packing problem is to place all shapes within the strip such that the length of the strip is minimized and the irregular shapes do not overlap. A classic example application is clothing industry. Several pieces of clothes will be cut from a roll of fabric and the objective is to minimize the waste of fabric. The fabric has a fixed width and its length can be generally assumed infinite; so the problem is to minimize the length required for producing the specified number of irregular shapes.\nThe irregular strip packing problem is a NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem [1]. Numerous papers on nesting problem have been published since the first paper by Art [2]. Meta-heuristics are often used to solve this problem. Hopper and Turton [3] reviewed these methods, and a summary of geometric methods was published by Bennell and Oliveira [4]. As research progressed, further breakthroughs in algorithms for this problem have achieved in recent years. When compared with the previous years, these solutions have markedly improved the effect and speed of nesting results. The typical methods include Burke et al. [5], Gomes and Oliveira [6], Egeblad et al. [7], Imamichi et al. [8], etc.\nAlbano and Sapuppo [9] proposed an algorithm that places each shape at the bottom-left position, and the sequence of places is obtained by tree search. Jakobs [10] proposed a two-stage solution which first generates the rectangular enclosure of each irregular shape, and then finds the placement for these enclosures through a genetic algorithm. Secondly, a shrinking algorithm moves the shapes to another one as close as possible using the idea of the bottom-left heuristic. Gomes and Oliveira [11] based on bottom-left heuristic and find a good placement by exchanging two shapes in the layout. Dowsland et al. [12] developed a compact algorithm to improve the bottom-left heuristic algorithm. The algorithm first gets the initial placement by the bottom-left heuristic, and then uses a shaking process to compact the placement. Burke et al. [5] presented a new bottom-left heuristic algorithm based on discretization, and combination with hill climbing or tabu search to get a high quality solution. This algorithm can also pack the shapes with circular arcs and holes. Egeblad et al. [7] proposed an efficient fast local search method whose neighborhood is any horizontal or vertical translation of a given shape. They also formulated a polynomial time algorithm to find a translation with minimum overlap area between the given polygon and the other polygons in the current placement. Gomes and Oliveira [6] presented a separation algorithm to locally optimize the placement based on linear programming models, and used simulated annealing to guide the search. A new separation algorithm based on unconstrained nonlinear programming is proposed by Imamichi et al. [8]. They also designed an algorithm that swaps two polygons in a placement, and then the algorithms are combined as a component into an iterated local search algorithm for the overlap minimization problem. This method yielded several best known results on the standard test instances. Our algorithm is based on a separation algorithm presented by Imamichi et al. [8], and local search is adopted to guide the search. Moreover, a tabu search algorithm is used to avoid local minima and a compacted algorithm is used to improve the packing results.\n## Section snippets\n## Formulation\nIn this section, some fundamental elements of geometry are first defined, before formulation of the irregular strip packing problem algorithm is given.\n**Definition 1 (point)**\nA point*p*in two-dimensional space is represented by a pair:p=(px,py)\u2208R2.\n**Definition 2 (line segment)**\nA line segment*s*is a point set defined by two endpoints*p**a*and*p**b*:s={p\u2208R2,t\u2208[0,1]|p=pa+t(pb\u2212pa)}.\n**Definition 3 (polygon)**\nA polygon is a plane figure bounded by a closed path composes of a finite sequence of line segments denoted by*S*.

In the two-dimensional case, not only is it the case that the piece\u2019s size is important but its shape also has a significant influence. Therefore, DJD as a selection heuristic has to be paired with a placement heuristic to completely construct a solution to the underlying packing problem. A successful adaptation of the DJD requires a routine to reduce computational costs, which is also proposed and successfully tested in this paper. Results, on a wide variety of instance types with convex polygons, are found to be significantly better than those produced by more conventional selection heuristics.\n\nThis is a preview of

An efficient 2D irregular packing algorithm can effectively improve material utilization and reduce processing costs. The reduction in material consumption will also have a beneficial impact on the environment ([Ke et al., 2020](#B76)). Therefore, research of the packing problem is of great significance for technology and social interest.\nThe 2D packing problem is a type of combinatorial optimization problems to locate parts with different shapes compactly in one or more master sheet material to minimize the occupied space or maximize the utilization of the material. The 2D packing problem is currently recognized as a NP problem, which is mainly solved by heuristic algorithms. In recent years, many scholars have conducted research on 2D irregular packing problems with a verity of solutions.\nThere exists a number of review articles on packing and cutting problems. We have summarized the main review literature in the field of 2D packing and cutting as shown in[Table 1](#T1). Brown ([Brown, 1971](#B17)) introduced an optimum packing and depletion problem with optimization of space and resource usage. Harvey ([Salkin and De Kluyver, 1975](#B116)) surveyed the application of mathematical optimization models such as linear programming to the knapsack problem. Bruce ([Golden, 1976](#B50)) surveyed various approaches to the cutting stock problem. Hinxman ([Hinxman, 1980](#B65)) surveyed the trim-loss and assortment problems, this research paid more attention to cutting and packaging problems in practical applications, and did not mention much about theoretical methods. Garey and Coffman ([Garey and Johnson, 1981](#B47);[Coffman et al., 1984](#B27)) surveyed the approximation algorithms for bin packing problems. Israni ([Israni and Sanders, 1982](#B72)) reviewed the 2D cutting stock problem including almost all 2D packaging problems. The author also proposed a rectangular layout method. Sarin ([Sarin, 1983](#B118)) reviewed methodologies and literature to solve 2D stock cutting problems and introduced an interactive optimization procedure for a general 2D stock cutting problem. Dyckhoff ([Dyckhoff et al., 1985](#B38)) described a trim loss and related problems and categorized them briefly. Dudzi&#x00144;ski ([Dudzi&#x00144;ski and Walukiewicz, 1987](#B36)) summarized the exact methods for knapsack problems, such as linear programming. Matthias ([Rode and Rosenberg, 1987](#B114)) analyzed the algorithm for the trim-loss problems. Haessler ([Haessler and Sweeney, 1991](#B59)) reviewed the solution process of cutting stock problems, including placement algorithm and sequence optimization algorithm. Dowsland ([Dowsland and Dowsland, 1992](#B34)) reviewed the application of operations research methods to the packing problem and summarized some exact heuristics. Sweeney ([Sweeney and Paternoster, 1992](#B128)) categorized cutting and packing problems and made application-oriented research records. Cheng ([Cheng et al., 1994](#B22)) discussed 2D cutting stock problems and their application cases including the pallet loading problem and VLSI placement problem. With the gradual deepening of research on 2D layout problems, typology becomes a common research topic. 2D regular and irregular layout problems are clearly distinguished in practical applications and theoretical methods. Dowsland ([Dowsland and Dowsland, 1995](#B29)) gave a special review of the 2D irregular nesting problem for the first time. Mavridou ([Mavridou and Pardalos, 1997](#B98)) summarized applications of the genetic algorithm and simulated annealing algorithm in the optimization of facility layout problems. Dyckhoff ([Dyckhoff, 1990](#B37)) made a typology of the cutting and packing problems in detail, and W&#x000e4;scher ([W&#x000e4;scher et al., 2007](#B135)) improved the typology later. Hopper ([Hopper and Turton, 1999](#B67);[Hopper and Turton, 2001a](#B68);[Hopper and Turton, 2001b](#B69)) investigated the application of meta-heuristic and heuristic algorithms in 2D and 3D packing problems. Lodi ([Lodi et al., 2002a](#B90);[Lodi et al., 2002b](#B91)) reviewed algorithms proposed in the 1990s of 2D packing problems. Bennell et al. ([Bennell and Oliveira, 2008](#B10);[Bennell and Oliveira, 2009](#B9)) discussed 2D irregular packing problems and related geometric problems. Leao ([Leao et al., 2020](#B81)) introduced the mathematical models in the 2D irregular packing problem.\nTABLE 1\n[![www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/966691/fmech-08-966691-HTML/image_m/fmech-08-966691-t001.jpg)](https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/966691/fmech-08-966691-HTML/image_m/fmech-08-966691-t001.jpg)\n**TABLE 1**.

      "text": "Efficient Local Search Heuristics for Packing\nIrregular Shapes in Two-Dimensional\nHeterogeneous Bins\nRanga P. Abeysooriya1, Julia A. Bennell1, and Antonio Martinez-Sykora1\nBusiness School, University of Southampton, SO17 1BJ, Southampton, UK\nAbstract. In this paper we proposed a local search heuristic and a ge\u0002netic algorithm to solve the two-dimensional irregular multiple bin-size\nbin packing problem. The problem consists of placing a set of pieces rep\u0002resented as 2D polygons in rectangular bins with different dimensions\nsuch that the total area of bins used is minimized. Most packing algo\u0002rithms available in the literature for 2D irregular bin packing consider\nsingle size bins only. However, for many industries the material can be\nsupplied in a number of standard size sheets, for example, metal, foam,\nplastic and timber sheets. For this problem, the cut plans must decide\nthe set of standard size stock sheets as well as which pieces to cut from\neach bin and how to arrange them in order to minimise waste material.\nMoreover, the literature constrains the orientation of pieces to a single\nor finite set of angles. This is often an artificial constraint that makes\nthe solution space easier to navigate. In this paper we do not restrict\nthe orientation of the pieces. We show that the local search heuristic and\nthe genetic algorithm can address all of these decisions and obtain good\nsolutions, with the local search performing better. We also discuss the\naffect of different groups of stock sheet sizes.\nKeywords: Irregular shapes, Multiple bin size bin packing, Jostle Al\u0002gorithm\n1 Introduction\nThe two dimensional bin packing problem consists of placing a set of pieces,\nusually represented as rectangles or polygons, in one or several stock sheets\n(bins) in such a way the total waste generated is minimized. This problem arises\nin several industries where metal, foam, wood, plastic, paper or leather need to\nbe cut. Depending on the industrial application this problem has several variants\ndescribed by the properties of both the pieces to be placed and the bins. In this\npaper we address the problem where the pieces to be cut are irregular and may\nhave concavities. Pieces can be placed in any orientation within rectangular bins\nthat have a variety of different dimensions (heterogeneous bin sizes). We assume\nthat there are a limited number of bin types and there are enough bins of each\ntype to place all the demanded pieces in any set of bins. In this paper we denote\nthis problem as the two-dimensional irregular shape multiple bin size bin packing\nproblem (2D-IMBSBPP) and propose a local search heuristic, called jostle, and\na genetic algorithm to find efficient solutions.\nMost of the publications in the literature that consider heterogeneous bins\nare focused on packing rectangular pieces. Pisinger and Sigurad [19] consider a\nvariable bin cost when solving this problem. They propose a MILP model which\nis then solved by column generation. The model is intractable for large instances\nand difficult to solve even for small instances. Ortmann et al. [18] propose a\ntwo-phase approach. During the first phase they use first-fit decreasing with the\nlargest bins first. A second phase repacks bins into smaller bins. The two phase\nalgorithm is implemented with different bin sizes and aims to minimise the total\narea of the occupied bins. Wei et al. [21] propose a tabu search that uses a\nsequential packing heuristic, a local search, and a post-improvement procedure\nto reduce the total area of used bins in a feasible solution. Alvarez-Valdes et\nal. [2] implement meta-heuristic algorithms with variable bin costs which are\nnot proportional to the size of the bin. The objective is to minimize the cost of\nthe occupied bins, and the authors employ a greedy randomized adaptive search\nprocedure with path re-linking strategies to combine the best solutions obtained\nin the iterative process. In order to compare their results with Ortmann et al.\n[18]\u2019s, they modify the objective function to maximize the overall utilization of\nthe occupied bins.\nThe vast majority of research publications considering the packing of 2D\nirregular shapes address the 2D strip packing problem, also known as the nesting\nproblem. Instead of placing pieces into bins the aim is to place all the pieces into\na strip with fixed width and infinite length in such a way the total required length\nis minimized. However, recent publications of packing algorithms for irregular\npieces consider the bin packing problem with homogeneous bins, see [14], [20],\n[16] and [1]. However, in many situations bins are readily available to purchase\nas rectangular sheets in different standard sizes. In these industries companies\nusually handle several bin sizes in order to satisfy customer demand. The aim of\nthe companies is not only to reduce the waste generated in the cutting process,\nbut also charge a competitive price to the customers, which usually depends on\nthe area of material needed to meet the demand. There are several publications\nconsidering heterogeneous irregular bins, see [4] and [5], who solve an applied\nproblem which arises in the leather industry. In these publications the pieces\nare approximated by grid squares or pixels rather than polygons. While this\nsimplifies the geometry, solutions suffer from inaccuracy in shape representation.\nIt is important to highlight that in this paper we use the direct representa\u0002tions of the pieces as polygons and do not restrict the rotation of pieces to a\npredefined set of angles. Han et al. [13] and Martinez-Sykora et al. [15] considered\nfree rotation for the 2D irregular bin packing problem with guillotine cuts, solving\nan application derived from the glass industry. More recently, Martinez-Sykora\net al. [16] and Abeysooriya et al. [1] considered free rotation for the problem with\nhomogeneous bins and also report results with restricted and fixed rotations. For\ncomparison purposes, we also address the problem where a finite set of rotations\nare allowed.\nThe main contribution of this paper is to efficiently solve the 2D-IMBSBPP\nconsidering continuous rotation of pieces by using an adaptation of the jostle\nprocedure. Jostle was first proposed by Dowsland et al. [10] for the strip packing\nproblem and then used in [1] in bin packing problems with homogeneous bins.\nOne of the most important properties of the jostle procedure is that it explores\nefficient solutions with a relatively low computational effort, compared with other\navailable algorithms. The jostle procedure works over the sequence of pieces that\nrepresents the order pieces are inserted in the layout. The constructive heuristic\niterates between packing from one end of the strip and then the other end taking\nthe sequence from the last iteration. The results presented in this paper show\na considerable improvement when using a heterogeneous set of bin sizes, which\ndemonstrates the efficiency of the algorithms presented.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we describe the problem and\nwe discuss the measure of performance used to evaluate the quality of feasible\nsolutions. Section 3 explains the jostle algorithms and the genetic algorithm to\nsolve 2D-IMBSBPP. Computational tests are presented in Section 4. Finally, in\nSection 5 we present the conclusions of the paper.\n2 Problem Description\nLet N0 be the number of rectangular bin types (stock sheets) and let Lk and\nWk be, respectively, the length and the width of bin type k \u2208 {1, . . . , N0}.

It explores the procedure of applying the bottom-left strategy to a given order the bottom-left algorithm. The chapter explains the irregular strip packing problem and introduces some practical algorithms for irregular packing problems. It focuses on the problem of packing irregular shapes represented in bitmap format and analyses the rectilinear block packing problem and also introduces various schemes used to represent solutions to the rectilinear block packing problem and algorithms based on such coding schemes. The chapter considers two-dimensional irregular packing problems, which have been actively studied in the last decade. It provides some basic techniques including bottom-left strategy, clustering strategy, and no-fit polygons. The chapter shows that various algorithms proposed for the irregular strip packing and bin packing problems and their variants. T. Imamichi et al. proposed an iterated local search based on nonlinear programming for the irregular strip packing problem.\n\n[Taylor & Francis Group Logo![Taylor & Francis Group Logo](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/assets/images/tfgroup-logo-white.svg)](https://www.taylorfrancis.com)\n\n- PoliciesPolicies\n\n- [Privacy Policy](https://informa.com/privacy-policy/)\n- [Terms & Conditions](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/terms-and-conditions/)\n- [Cookie Policy](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/cookie-policy/)\n\n- JournalsJournals\n\n- [Taylor & Francis Online](https://www.tandfonline.com)\n\n- CorporateCorporate\n\n- [Taylor & Francis Group](https://taylorandfrancis.com/)\n\n- Help & ContactHelp & Contact\n\n- [Students/Researchers](https://help.taylorfrancis.com/students_researchers)\n- [Librarians/Institutions](https://help.taylorfrancis.com/librarians_institutions)\n\n- Connect with us\n\n\nRegistered in England & Wales No. 3099067\n\n5 Howick Place \\| London \\| SW1P 1WG\u00a9 2024 Informa UK Limited\n\nBack to Top",

Irregular shape packing is one of the most recent variants to be widely researched and its history extends over 40 years. The evolution of solution approaches to this problem can be attributed to increased computer power and advances in geometric techniques as well as more sophisticated and insightful algorithm design. In this paper we will focus on the latter. Our aim is not to give a chronological account or an exhaustive review, but to draw on the literature to describe and evaluate the core approaches. Irregular packing is combinatorial and as a result solution methods are heuristic, save a few notable exceptions. We will explore different ways of representing the problem and mechanisms for moving between solutions. We will also propose where we see the future challenges for researchers in this area.\n\n## Suggested Citation\n\nJ A Bennell & J F Oliveira, 2009.\n\" **[A tutorial in irregular shape packing problems](https://ideas.repec.org/a/pal/jorsoc/v60y2009i1d10.1057_jors.2008.169.html)**,\"\n[Journal of the Operational Research Society](https://ideas.repec.org/s/pal/jorsoc.html), Palgrave Macmillan;The OR Society, vol. 60(1), pages 93-105, May.\nHandle: _RePEc:pal:jorsoc:v:60:y:2009:i:1:d:10.1057\\_jors.2008.169_\n\nDOI: 10.1057/jors.2008.169\n\nas\n\nHTMLHTML with abstractplain textplain text with abstractBibTeXRIS (EndNote, RefMan, ProCite)ReDIFJSON\n\n## Download full text from publisher\n\n**File URL:** http://link.springer.com/10.1057/jors.2008.169\n\n**File Function:** Abstract\n\n**Download Restriction:** Access to full text is restricted to subscribers.\n\n* * *\n\n**File URL:** https://libkey.io/10.1057/jors.2008.169?utm\\_source=ideas\n\n**LibKey link**: if access is restricted and if your library uses this service, LibKey will redirect you to where you can use your library subscription to access this item\n\n---><---\n\nAs the access to this document is restricted, you may want to [search](https://ideas.repec.org/cgi-bin/htsearch2?q=%22A+tutorial+in+irregular+shape+packing+problems%22) for a different version of it.\n\n## References listed on IDEAS\n\nas\n\nHTMLHTML with abstractplain textplain text with abstractBibTeXRIS (EndNote, RefMan, ProCite)ReDIFJSON\n\n01.
