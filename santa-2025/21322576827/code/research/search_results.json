      "text": "Minimizing the bounding box in 2D polygon packing with rotation involves several advanced techniques aimed at reducing the overall area while ensuring polygons do not overlap. One of the most effective approaches is the use of exact algorithms such as branch-and-bound methods, which systematically explore possible placements and rotations to find the optimal solution. For instance, a parallel branch-and-bound-and-prune algorithm has been proposed for irregular strip packing with discrete rotations, which employs bounding techniques and conflict graphs to prune the search space efficiently ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.21009)). These algorithms often incorporate geometric computations like the minimum-area oriented bounding box (OMBB), which can be calculated using the rotating calipers method on the convex hull of the polygons, leading to tighter bounding boxes ([geidav.wordpress.com](https://geidav.wordpress.com/2014/01/23/computing-oriented-minimum-bounding-boxes-in-2d)). \n\nHeuristic approaches also play a crucial role, especially in practical applications where exact solutions are computationally expensive. Heuristics such as the no-fit polygon (NFP) method generate candidate placements by considering the Minkowski sum of polygons, which helps in efficiently exploring feasible arrangements with rotations ([PLOS One](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0295206)). These heuristics can be combined with local search or genetic algorithms to further refine the packing and minimize the bounding box. Overall, the best techniques often involve a hybrid of geometric computation for tight bounding boxes and combinatorial optimization algorithms to explore placement and rotation possibilities efficiently.",

Recent performance gains of the Mixed-Integer Linear\nProgramming (MILP) solvers have encouraged the proposal of exact optimization\nmodels for nesting. The Dotted-Board (DB) MILP model solves the discrete version\nof the nesting problem by constraining the positions of the polygons to be on a grid of\nfixed points. However, its number of non-overlapping constraints grows exponentially\nwith the number of dots and types of polygons, which encouraged the proposal\nof a reformulation called the DB Clique Covering (DB-CC) that sets the current\nstate-of-the-art by significantly reducing the constraints required. However, DB-CC\nrequires a significant preprocessing time to compute edge and vertex clique coverings.\nMoreover, current knowledge of the stable set polytope suggests that achieving a\ntighter formulation is unlikely. Thus, our hypothesis is that an ad-hoc exact algorithm\nrequiring no preprocessing might be a better option to solve the DB model than the\ncostly Branch-and-Cut approach. This work proposes an exact branch-and-bound\u0002and-prune algorithm to solve the DB model from the conflict inverse graph based\non ad-hoc data structures, bounding, and forward-checking for pruning the search\nspace. We introduce two 0-1 ILP DB reformulations with discrete rotations and\na new lower-bound algorithm as by-products. Our experiments show that DB-PB\nsignificantly reduces the resolution time compared to our replication of the DB-CC\nmodel. Seventeen open instances are solved up to optimality.\n1. Introduction\nCutting and packing regular (convex) and irregular (non-convex) polygons onto a rectangular strip with\nunbounded length is a tedious and usual task in most manufacturing industries based on the cutting of any flat\nmaterial. For instance, Milenkovic et al. [84] study the nesting problem for the fashion and apparel industry,\nwhilst Heistermann and Lengauer [64] and Whelan and Batchelor [124] do it for leather manufacturing,\nElamvazuthi et al. [45] in furniture, Han et al. [62] in the glass industry, Alves et al. [8] in the automotive\nindustry, and Cheok and Nee [29] and Hamada et al. [61] in shipbuilding. The irregular strip-packing problem\nis also known as nesting or marker making in the industry, and it consists in computing a non-overlapping\nplacement of a set of irregular polygons, called pieces, onto a fixed-width rectangular strip with unbounded\nlength, called the board, whose length is the minimum possible. Another closely related problem, called\ntwo-dimensional bin packing [80, 66], is defined as the computation of a non-overlapping placement of a set\nof polygons onto a larger closed polygon, called the bin, to minimize the number of bins required. Regular\nand irregular strip and bin packing problems, and all their variants concerning the geometry of the pieces\n\u2217Corresponding author\njlastra@ucm.es (J.J.

[122], and extensively reviewed by Sweeney and Paternoster [116], Dowsland and\nDowsland [41], Wang and W\u00e4scher [120], and Bennell et al. [18], among others.\nResearch on the irregular strip and bin packing problems can be traced back to the pioneering Linear\nProgramming (LP) models for rectangular bin packing introduced by Gilmore and Gomory [55], and the\npioneering heuristic methods for irregular strip packing proposed by Art [10], Adamowicz and Albano [4, 3],\nand Albano and Sapuppo [6] in the late nineteen sixties and seventies. These early works introduce many of\nthe basic ideas subsequently exploited by all heuristics methods reported in the literature, such as the notion\nof a feasible non-overlapping region between pieces based on the No-Fit Polygon (NFP) representation [16],\nand the sequential placement of pieces based on bottom-left heuristics. The boundary and outer region of the\nno-fit polygon \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc39 \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc35 set the feasible positions in which polygon \ud835\udc35 can be placed, without rotating, into\na non-overlapping position with respect to polygon \ud835\udc34. Thus, the no-fit polygon allows one to compute the\nfeasible relative placements between polygons \ud835\udc34 and \ud835\udc35 a priori by checking whether their relative position\nvector \ud835\udeff\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc35 = \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc35 \u2212 \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc34 belongs to either the boundary or the outer region of \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc39 \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc35, where \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc34 and \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc35\ndenote their corresponding reference points. This property has converted the NFP into the most broadly\nadopted and effective geometric representation for nesting reported in the literature, both for the families of\nheuristics methods [17] and for exact mathematical models [73].\nFowler et al. [51] show that the irregular strip-packing problem is NP-complete. For this reason, most\npractical solutions reported in the literature since the pioneering work of Art [10] are based on sequential\nplacement heuristics to build efficiently feasible solutions that are combined with meta-heuristics for\nexploring the space of feasible solutions, as shown in most of surveys on nesting [42, 43, 65, 17, 102]. Elkeran\n[46] introduces the current state-of-the-art heuristic method for nesting, called Guided Cuckoo Search (GCS),\nwhich defines a two-stage method based on piece clustering and NFP-based bottom-left heuristics [57] to\nbuild an initial feasible solution that is shrunk by solving an overlap minimization problem using a variant\nof the cuckoo search meta-heuristics. Although GCS was introduced more than a decade ago, subsequent\nworks have been unable to outperform its results, as shown by Pinheiro et al. [98, table 3], Sato et al. [107,\ntable 5], Cherri et al. [30, table 4], Mundim et al. [87, table 6], Amaro J\u00fanior et al. [9, table 2], and Sato et al.\n[106, tables 4-5]. More recently, other authors have introduced new heuristics for the continuous and discrete\nversions of the nesting problem, such as the works of Fang et al. [48], Na and Yang [88], Guo et al. [60],\nSato et al. [108], Queiroz and de Queiroz [101], Umetani and Murakami [119], and Queiroz and Andretta\n[100]. For a recent comparison of heuristics and exact mathematical models for nesting, we refer the readers\nto the comparative evaluation carried out by Giovenali et al. [56].\nThe recent performance gains achieved by state-of-the-art Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) solvers\n[22, 2, 67] have encouraged the proposal of exact mathematical models for nesting during the last\ndecade, as shown by the literature reviews of Leao et al. [73] and Lastra-D\u00edaz and Ortu\u00f1o [70]. The\nexact mathematical models for nesting can be categorized into mixed-integer linear programming models,\nConstraint Programming (CP) models, and non-linear programming models, as shown in the categorization\nof Lastra-D\u00edaz and Ortu\u00f1o [70, Fig. 1]. In turn, the family of mathematical programming models for nesting\ncan be categorized into three large families according to the type of decision variables used to represent\nthe position of the pieces as follows. Firstly, the family of continuous models, such as the pioneering MILP\nmodel of Li [76, \u00a78], and the subsequent MILP models propo...",

      "title": "Computing oriented minimum bounding boxes in 2D",
      "text": "# Introduction\n\n_Oriented bounding boxes_ are an important tool for visibility testing and collision detection in computer graphics. In this post I want to talk about how to compute the oriented _minimum_ bounding box (OMBB) of an arbitrary polygon in two dimensions. As a polygon just enforces an ordering on a set of points (vertices), everything described in the following equally applies to simple point sets. _Minimum_ in this context refers to the area of the bounding box. A minimum oriented bounding box is also known as _smallest-area enclosing rectangle_. However, I will stick to the former term throughout this article as it is more frequently used in the computer graphics world.\n\nThe easiest way of computing a bounding box for a polygon is to determine the minimum and maximum ![x](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x&bg=ffffff&fg=777777&s=0&c=20201002&zoom=4.5)\u2013 and ![y](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y&bg=ffffff&fg=777777&s=0&c=20201002&zoom=4.5)\u2013 coordinates of its vertices. Such an _axis aligned bounding box_ (AABB) can be computed trivially but it\u2019s in most cases significantly bigger than the polygon\u2019s OMBB. Finding the OMBB requires some more work as the bounding box\u2019 area must be minimized, constrained by the location of the polygon\u2019s vertices. Look at the following figure for an illustration (AABB in blue, OMBB in red).\n\n![AABB vs OMBB](https://geidav.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/aabb_vs_ombb.png?w=820)\n\nThe technique for computing OMBBs presented in the following consists of two detached steps. In the first step the _convex hull_ of the input polygon is computed. If the polygon is convex this step can be omitted because a convex polygon is equal to its convex hull. In the second step the _Rotating Calipers_ method is employed on the convex hull to compute the resulting OMBB. I will focus on the Rotating Calipers method because it\u2019s not very widely known in comparison to the numerous ways of computing convex hulls.\n\n# Convex hulls\n\nIn less mathematical but more illustrative terms the _convex hull_ of a set of ![n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=777777&s=0&c=20201002&zoom=4.5) points can be described as the closed polygonal chain of all outer points of the set, which entirely encloses all set elements. You can picture it as the shape of a rubber band stretched around all set elements. The convex hull of a set of two-dimensional points can be efficiently computed in ![O(n\\log n)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%28n%5Clog+n%29&bg=ffffff&fg=777777&s=0&c=20201002&zoom=4.5). In the figure below the convex hull of the vertices of a concave polygon is depicted.\n\n![Convex hull of vertices of concave polygon](https://geidav.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/convex_hull2.png?w=820)\n\nThere are numerous algorithms for computing convex hulls: _Quick Hull_, _Gift Wrapping_ (also known as _Jarvis March_), _Graham\u2019s Algorithm_ and some more. I\u2019ve chosen the Gift Wrapping algorithm for my implementation because it\u2019s easy to implement and provides good performance in case ![n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=777777&s=0&c=20201002&zoom=4.5) is small or the polygon\u2019s convex hull contains only a few vertices. The runtime complexity is ![O(nh)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%28nh%29&bg=ffffff&fg=777777&s=0&c=20201002&zoom=4.5), where ![h](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=h&bg=ffffff&fg=777777&s=0&c=20201002&zoom=4.5) is the number of vertices in the convex hull. In the general case Gift Wrapping is outperformed by other algorithms. Especially, when all points are part of the convex hull. In that case the complexity degrades to ![O(n^2)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%28n%5E2%29&bg=ffffff&fg=777777&s=0&c=20201002&zoom=4.5).\n\nAs there are many good articles on the Gift Wrapping algorithm available online, I won\u2019t describe it another time here. Instead I want to focus on the lesser-known Rotating Calipers method for computing OMBBs. However, take care that your convex hull algorithm correctly handles collinear points. If multiple points lie on a convex hull edge, only the spanning points should end up in the convex hull.\n\n# Rotating Calipers\n\n_Rotating Calipers_ is a versatile method for solving a number of problems from the field of computational geometry. It resembles the idea of rotating a dynamically adjustable caliper around the outside of a polygon\u2019s convex hull. Originally, this method was invented to compute the diameter of convex polygons. Beyond that, it can be used to compute OMBBs, the minimum and maximum distance between two convex polygons, the intersection of convex polygons and many things more.\n\nThe idea of using the Rotating Calipers method for computing OMBBs is based on the following theorem, establishing a connection between the input polygon\u2019s convex hull and the orientation of the resulting OMBB. The theorem was proven in 1975 by Freeman and Shapira[1](https://geidav.wordpress.com/2014/01/23/computing-oriented-minimum-bounding-boxes-in-2d/#fn-1057-FreemanShapira1975):\n\n> The smallest-area enclosing rectangle of a polygon has a side collinear with one of the edges of its convex hull.\n\nThanks to this theorem the number of OMBB candidates is dramatically reduced to the number of convex hull edges. Thus, the complexity of the Rotating Calipers method is _linear_ if the convex hull is already available. If it isn\u2019t available the overall complexity is bound by the cost of computing the convex hull. An example of a set of OMBB candidates (red) for a convex hull (green) is depicted in the figure below. Note, that there are as many OMBB candidates as convex hull edges and each OMBB candidate has one side flush with one edge of the convex hull.\n\n![OMBB candidates](https://geidav.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/ombb_candidates.png?w=820)\n\nTo determine the OMBB of a polygon, first, two orthogonally aligned pairs of parallel _supporting lines_ through the convex hull\u2019s _extreme points_ are created. The intersection of the four lines forms a rectangle. Next, the lines are simultaneously rotated about their supporting points until one line coincides with an edge of the convex hull. Each time an edge coincides, the four lines form another rectangle / OMBB candidate. This process is repeated until each convex hull edge once coincided with one of the four caliper lines. The resulting OMBB is the OMBB candidate with the smallest area. The entire algorithm is outlined step by step below.\n\n1. Compute the convex hull of the input polygon.\n2.

years due to its wide application in industry. However, most of the research efforts are devoted to positioning techniques of the rectangles for various problem variants, the efficient implementation of the packing procedure is relatively less studied. In this paper, we propose an efficient constructive algorithm for the rectangular packing problem with rotations. We design a preprocess procedure with four data structures to store the information used for item selection. The gaps on the skyline are categorized into three types according to their associated edges for the placement procedure, during which the item is searched and packed in a descending order of the fitness value. The entire constructive phase takes a time complexity of O(*n*log*n*). For the packing improvement phase, we optimize the packing through random perturbation on the sequence and orientation of the item. Three classes of stochastic problems are generated ranging from small-scale to extra-large-scale, the recorded running time confirms the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.

Introduction\nGiven a group of large objects with regular shape and homogeneous material, designing an assortment of the small items accommodated by the large objects to minimize the waste is the classic cutting and packing problem [[1](#pone.0295206.ref001)].

      "text": "Online Packing to Minimize Area or Perimeter\nMikkel Abrahamsen\u2217 Lorenzo Beretta\u2217\nJanuary 21, 2021\nAbstract\nWe consider online packing problems where we get a stream of axis-parallel rectangles. The\nrectangles have to be placed in the plane without overlapping, and each rectangle must be placed\nwithout knowing the subsequent rectangles. The goal is to minimize the perimeter or the area of the\naxis-parallel bounding box of the rectangles. We either allow rotations by 90\u25e6or translations only.\nFor the perimeter version we give algorithms with an absolute competitive ratio slightly less than\n4 when only translations are allowed and when rotations are also allowed.\nWe then turn our attention to minimizing the area and show that the asymptotic competitive\nratio of any algorithm is at least \u2126(\u221an), where n is the number of rectangles in the stream, and\nthis holds with and without rotations. We then present algorithms that match this bound in both\ncases and the competitive ratio is thus optimal to within a constant factor. We also show that the\ncompetitive ratio cannot be bounded as a function of Opt. We then consider two special cases.\nThe first is when all the given rectangles have aspect ratios bounded by some constant. The\nparticular variant where all the rectangles are squares and we want to minimize the area of the\nbounding square has been studied before and an algorithm with a competitive ratio of 8 has been\ngiven [Fekete and Hoffmann, Algorithmica, 2017]. We improve the analysis of the algorithm and\nshow that the ratio is at most 6, which is tight.\nThe second special case is when all edges have length at least 1. Here, the \u2126(\u221a\nn) lower bound still\nholds, and we turn our attention to lower bounds depending on Opt. We show that any algorithm\nfor the translational case has an asymptotic competitive ratio of at least \u2126(\u221a\nOpt). If rotations are\nallowed, we show a lower bound of \u2126(\u221a4 Opt). For both versions, we give algorithms that match\nthe respective lower bounds: With translations only, this is just the algorithm from the general case\nwith competitive ratio O(\n\u221a\nn) = O(\n\u221a\nOpt). If rotations are allowed, we give an algorithm with\ncompetitive ratio O(min{\n\u221a\nn, \u221a4 Opt}), thus matching both lower bounds simultaneously.\n1 Introduction\nProblems related to packing appear in a plethora of big industries. For instance, two-dimensional versions\nof packing arise when a given set of pieces have to be cut out from a large piece of material so as to\nminimize waste. This is relevant to clothing production where cutting patterns are cut out from a roll\nof fabric, and similarly in leather, glass, wood, and sheet metal cutting.\nIn some applications, it is important that the pieces are placed in an online fashion. This means that\nthe pieces arrive one by one and we need to decide the placement of one piece before we know the ones\nthat will come in the future. This is in contrast to offline problems, where all the pieces are known in\nadvance. Problems related to packing were some of the first for which online algorithms were described\nand analyzed. Indeed, the first use of the terms \u201conline\u201d and \u201coffline\u201d in the context of approximation\nalgorithms was in the early 1970s and used for algorithms for bin-packing problems [14].\nIn this paper, we study online packing problems where the pieces can be placed anywhere in the plane\nas long as they do not overlap. The goal is to minimize the region occupied by the pieces. The pieces are\naxis-parallel rectangles, and they may or may not be rotated by 90\u25e6. We want to minimize the size of\nthe axis-parallel bounding box of the pieces, and the size of the box is either the perimeter or the area.\nThis results in four problems: PerimeterRotation, PerimeterTranslation, AreaRotation, and\nAreaTranslation.\n\u2217Basic Algorithms Research Copenhagen (BARC), University of Copenhagen.

The usual definitions [7, 9, 11] of competitive\nratio (or worst case ratio, as it may also be called [11]) can only be used to describe that the cost of\nthe solution produced by an online algorithm is at most some constant factor higher than the cost Opt\nof the optimal (offline) solution. In the study of approximation algorithms, it is often the case that the\napproximation ratio is described not just as a constant, but as a more general function of the input. In\nthe same way, we generalize the definition of competitive ratios to support such statements about online\nalgorithms.\nConsider an algorithm A for one of the packing problems studied in this paper. Let L be the set\nof non-empty streams of rectangular pieces. For a stream L \u2208 L, we define A(L) to be the cost of the\npacking produced by A and let Opt(L) be the cost of the optimal (offline) packing. We say that A has\nan absolute competitive ratio of f(L), for some function f : L \u2212\u2192 R\n+ which may just be a constant, if\nsup\nL\u2208L\nA(L)\nOpt(L)f(L)\n\u2264 1.\nWe say that A has an asymptotic competitive ratio of f(L) if\nlim sup\nc\u2212\u2192\u221e \u0012\nsup \u001a\nA(L)\nOpt(L)f(L)\n| L \u2208 L and Opt(L) = c\n\u001b\u0013 \u2264 1.\nIn this paper, the functions f(L) that we consider will be (i) constants, (ii) functions of the number\nof pieces n = |L|, (iii) functions of Opt(L).\nBy definition, if A has an absolute competitive ratio of f(L), then A also has an asymptotic compet\u0002itive ratio of f(L), but A may also have a smaller asymptotic competitive ratio g(L) < f(L). However,\nthe following easy lemma shows that for the problems studied in this paper, any constant asymptotic\ncompetitive ratio can be matched to within an arbitrarily small difference by an absolute competitive\nratio.\nLemma 1. For the problems studied in this paper, if an algorithm A has an asymptotic competitive ratio\nof some constant c > 1, then for every \u03b5 > 0, there is an algorithm A0 with absolute competitive ratio\nc + \u03b5. It follows that any constant lower bound on the absolute competitive ratio is also a lower bound on\nthe asymptotic competitive ratio.\nProof. Let n > 0 be so large that when Opt(L) \u2265 n, we have A(L)\ncOpt(L) \u2264 1 + \u03b5/c. When the first piece\np of a stream L is given, A0chooses a scale factor \u03bb > 0 big enough that when p is scaled up by \u03bb, the\nresulting piece p\n0\n:= \u03bbp alone has cost n (i.e., the area or the perimeter of p\n0\nis n). The algorithm A0\nnow imitates the strategy of A on the stream \u03bbL we get by scaling up all pieces of L by \u03bb. We then get\nthat\nA0(L)\n(c + \u03b5)Opt(L)\n=\nA(\u03bbL)\n(c + \u03b5)Opt(\u03bbL)\n\u2264\n(1 + \u03b5/c)c\nc + \u03b5\n= 1.\nFor this reason, we do not distinguish between absolute and asymptotic competitive ratios when the\nratio is a constant. Note that the argument does not work when the competitive ratio is a non-constant\nfunction of Opt.\nResults and structure of the paper We develop online algorithms for the perimeter versions Peri\u0002meterRotation and PerimeterTranslation, both with a competitive ratio slightly less than 4.\nThese algorithms are described in Section 2. The idea is to partition the positive quadrant into bricks,\nwhich are axis-parallel rectangles with aspect ratio \u221a\n2. In each brick, we build a stack of pieces which\nwould be too large to place in a brick of smaller size. Online packing algorithms using higher-dimensional\nbricks were described by Januszewski and Lassak [15] and our algorithms are inspired by an algorithm\nof Fekete and Hoffmann [13] that we will get back to. Interestingly, we show in Section 2.2 that a more\ndirect adaptation of the algorithm of Fekete and Hoffmann has a competitive ratio of at least 4, and\nis thus inferior to the algorithm we describe. We also give a lower bound of 4/3 for the version with\ntranslations and 5/4 for the version with rotations.\nIn Sec...",

The goal of this optimization problem is to place a set of irregular\npolygons onto a material sheet without overlapping and in a way that minimizes wasted\nmaterial.\nIn this thesis, we delve into a fast 2D packing algorithm that automatically arranges\nparts of a user\u2019s design onto their available material sheets to provide live feedback on\nhow much material they have left. To do this, we make use of the concept of the no fit\npolygon to generate candidate placements, and we utilize custom heuristics and performance\noptimization to improve packing quality and runtime .\nOur technical evaluation shows that the implementation is fast enough to work at\ninteractive speeds and produce solutions of similar quality to other tools and algorithms that\nperform automated packing.\nThesis Supervisor: Stefanie Mueller\nTitle: Assistant Professor\n3\n4\nAcknowledgments\nFirst of all, I would like to extend my deepest gratitude to my advisor, Professor Stefanie\nMueller.

      "text": "New Improvements in Optimal Rectangle Packing\nEric Huang and Richard E. Korf\nComputer Science Department\nUniversity of California, Los Angeles\nLos Angeles, CA 90095\nehuang@cs.ucla.edu, korf@cs.ucla.edu\nAbstract\nThe rectangle packing problem consists of find\u0002ing an enclosing rectangle of smallest area that can\ncontain a given set of rectangles without overlap.\nOur algorithm picks the x-coordinates of all the\nrectangles before picking any of the y-coordinates.\nFor the x-coordinates, we present a dynamic vari\u0002able ordering heuristic and an adaptation of a prun\u0002ing algorithm used in previous solvers. We then\ntransform the rectangle packing problem into a per\u0002fect packing problem that has no empty space, and\npresent inference rules to reduce the instance size.\nFor the y-coordinates we search a space that models\nempty positions as variables and rectangles as val\u0002ues. Our solver is over 19 times faster than the pre\u0002vious state-of-the-art on the largest problem solved\nto date, allowing us to extend the known solutions\nfor a consecutive-square packing benchmark from\nN=27 to N=32.\n1 Introduction\nGiven a set of rectangles, our problem is to find all enclosing\nrectangles of minimum area that will contain them without\noverlap. We refer to an enclosing rectangle as a bounding\nbox. The optimization problem is NP-hard, while the prob\u0002lem of deciding whether a set of rectangles can be packed in\na given bounding box is NP-complete, via a reduction from\nbin-packing [Korf, 2003]. The consecutive-square packing\nbenchmark is a simple set of increasingly difficult bench\u0002marks for this problem, where the task is to find the bounding\nboxes of minimum area that contain a set of squares of sizes\n1x1, 2x2, ..., up to NxN [Korf, 2003]. For example, Figure 1\nis an optimal solution for N=32. We use this benchmark here\nbut none of the techniques introduced in this paper are spe\u0002cific to packing squares as opposed to rectangles.\nRectangle packing has many practical applications. It ap\u0002pears when loading a set of rectangular objects on a pallet\nwithout stacking them, and also in VLSI design where rect\u0002angular circuit components must be packed onto a rectangu\u0002lar chip. Various other cutting stock and layout problems also\nhave rectangle packing at their core.\nFigure 1: An optimal solution for N=32 with a bounding box\nof 85x135.\n511\n(a) Compulsory part of a 5x2 at\nx=[0,2]\n(b) Assigning a 4x2 to [0,2].\nFigure 2: Examples of compulsory parts and intervals.\n2 Previous Work\nKorf [2003] divided the rectangle packing problem into two\nsubproblems: the minimal bounding box problem and the\ncontainment problem. The former finds a bounding box of\nleast area that can contain a given set of rectangles, while the\nlatter tries to pack the given rectangles in a given bounding\nbox. The algorithm that solves the minimal bounding box\nproblem calls the algorithm that solves the containment prob\u0002lem as a subroutine.\n2.1 Minimal Bounding Box Problem\nA simple way to solve the minimal bounding box problem\nis to find the minimum and maximum areas that describe\nthe set of feasible and potentially optimal bounding boxes.\nBounding boxes of all dimensions can be generated with ar\u0002eas within this range, and then tested in non-decreasing order\nof area until all feasible solutions of smallest area are found.\nThe minimum area is the sum of the areas of the given rectan\u0002gles. The maximum area is determined by the bounding box\nof a greedy solution found by setting the bounding box height\nto that of the tallest rectangle, and then placing the rectangles\nin the first available position when scanning from left to right,\nand for each column scanning from bottom to top.\n2.2 Containment Problem\nKorf\u2019s [2003] absolute placement approach modeled rectan\u0002gles as variables and empty locations in the bounding box\nas values. Moffitt and Pollack\u2019s [2006] relative placement ap\u0002proach used a variable for every pair of rectangles to represent\nthe relations above, below, left, and right. Absolute place\u0002ment was faster than relative placement [Korf et al., 2009],\nwhich in turn was faster than the methods of Clautiaux et al.\n[2007] and Beldiceanu et al. [2008].\nSimonis and O\u2019Sullivan [2008] used Clautiaux et al.\u2019s\n[2007] variable order with additional constraints from\nBeldiceanu et al. [2008] to greatly outperform Korf et al.\u2019s\nsolver [2009]. They used Prolog\u2019s backtracking engine to\nsolve a set of constraints which they specified prior to the\nsearch effort. They first assigned the x-coordinates of all\nthe rectangles before any of the y-coordinates. Since we use\nsome of these ideas, we review them here.\nSimonis and O\u2019Sullivan [2008] used two sets of redundant\nvariables for the x-coordinates. The first set of N variables\ncorrespond to \u201cintervals\u201d where a rectangle is assigned an\ninterval of x-coordinates. Interval sizes are hand-picked for\neach rectangle prior to search, and they induce a smaller rect\u0002angle representing the common intersecting area of placing\nthe rectangle in any location in the interval [Beldiceanu et\nal., 2008]. Larger intervals result in weaker constraint prop\u0002agation (less pruning) but a smaller branching factor, while\nsmaller intervals result in stronger constraint propagation but\na larger branching factor.\nAs shown in Figure 2b, a 4x2 rectangle assigned an x\u0002interval of [0,2] consumes 2 units of area at each x-coordinate\nin [2,3], represented by the doubly-hatched area. This \u201ccom\u0002pulsory profile\u201d [Beldiceanu et al., 2008] is a constraint com\u0002mon to all positions x \u2208 [0, 2] of the original 4x2 rectan\u0002gle. If there were no feasible set of interval assignments, then\nthe constraint would save us from having to try individual x\u0002values. However, if we do find a set of interval assignments,\nthen we must search for a set of single x-coordinate val\u0002ues. Simonis and O\u2019Sullivan [2008] used a total of 4N vari\u0002ables, assigning (in order) x-intervals, single x-coordinates,\ny-intervals, and finally single y-coordinates.\n3 Overall Search Strategy\nWe separate the containment problem from the minimal\nbounding box problem, and use Korf et al.\u2019s [2009] al\u0002gorithm to solve the latter problem. Like Simonis and\nO\u2019Sullivan [2008], we assign all x-coordinates prior to any y\u0002coordinates, and use interval variables for the x-coordinates.\nWe set a rectangle\u2019s interval size to 0.35 times its width,\nwhich gave us the best performance. Finally, we do not use\ninterval variables for the y-coordinates. All of the remaining\nideas presented in this paper are our contributions.\nAlthough we use some ideas used by Simonis and\nO\u2019Sullivan [2008], we do not take a constraint programming\napproach in which all constraints are specified to a general\npurpose solver like Prolog, prior to the search effort. Instead,\nwe have implemented our program from scratch in C++, al\u0002lowing us to easily choose which constraints and inferences to\nuse at what time, and giving us more flexibility during search.\nFor example, as we will explain later, we make different in\u0002ferences depending on the partial solution.\nWe implemented a chronological backtracking algorithm\nwith dynamic variable ordering and forward checking. Our\nalgorithm works in three stages as it goes from the root of the\nsearch tree down to the leaves:\n1. It first works on the x-coordinates in a model where\nvariables are rectangles and values are x-coordinate lo\u0002cations, using dynamic variable ordering by area and a\nconstraint that detects infeasible subtrees.\n2. For each x-coordinate solution found, it conducts a per\u0002fect packing transformation, applies inference rules to\nreduce the transformed problem size, and derives conti\u0002guity constraints between rectangles.\n3. It then searches for a set of y-coordinates in a model\nwhere variables are empty corners and values are rect\u0002angles.\n4 Assigning X-Coordinates\nFor the x-coordinates, we propose a dynamic variable order\nand a constraint adapted from Korf\u2019s [2003] wasted-space\npruning heuristic. For a bounding box of size WxH we use\n512\nan array of size W representing the...",

We first focus on the perfect packing problem (PP), which is a special case of 2SP, wherein all given rectangles are required to be packed without wasted space, and design branch-and-bound algorithms introducing several branching rules and bounding operations. A combination of these rules yields an algorithm that is especially efficient for feasible instances of PP. We then propose several methods of applying the PP algorithms to 2SP. Our algorithms succeed in efficiently solving benchmark instances of PP with up to 500 rectangles and those of 2SP with up to 200 rectangles. They are often faster than existing exact algorithms specially tailored for problems without rotations.\n\n## Suggested Citation\n\nKenmochi, Mitsutoshi & Imamichi, Takashi & Nonobe, Koji & Yagiura, Mutsunori & Nagamochi, Hiroshi, 2009.\n\" **[Exact algorithms for the two-dimensional strip packing problem with and without rotations](https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/ejores/v198y2009i1p73-83.html)**,\"\n[European Journal of Operational Research](https://ideas.repec.org/s/eee/ejores.html), Elsevier, vol. 198(1), pages 73-83, October.\nHandle: _RePEc:eee:ejores:v:198:y:2009:i:1:p:73-83_\n\nas\n\nHTMLHTML with abstractplain textplain text with abstractBibTeXRIS (EndNote, RefMan, ProCite)ReDIFJSON\n\n## Download full text from publisher\n\n**File URL:** http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377-2217(08)00737-6 **Download Restriction:** Full text for ScienceDirect subscribers only\n---><---\n\nAs the access to this document is restricted, you may want to\n\nsearchfor a different version of it.\n\n## References listed on IDEAS\n\nas\n\nHTMLHTML with abstractplain textplain text with abstractBibTeXRIS (EndNote, RefMan, ProCite)ReDIFJSON\n\n01.

We investigate the problem of \u001cnding a minimum-area container for the disjoint\npacking of a set of convex polygons by translations. In particular, we consider axis-parallel\nrectangles or arbitrary convex sets as containers. For both optimization problems which are\nNP-hard we develop e\u001ecient constant factor approximation algorithms.\n1 Introduction\nAlgorithms for e\u001eciently packing objects into containers have important applications: In\ntwo dimensions, the problem occurs, e.g., in the context of cutting out a given set of patterns\nfrom a given large piece of material minimizing waste, typically in apparel fabrication or\nsheet metal processing. In three dimensions the problem occurs naturally in minimizing\nstorage space or container space for transportation.\nThe problem has numerous variants. The most basic one is the decision problem\nwhether a set of given objects can be packed into a given container. In sheet metal and\napparel processing, mostly the problem of strip packing [12, 13, 5] occurs, i.e., a given set of\nobjects needs to be packed inside a strip of a given \u001cxed width using as short a piece of the\nstrip as possible. Here, we will consider the problem of minimizing the area of the container.\nMoreover, the shape of the objects to be packed is signi\u001ccant, e.g., in two dimensions\narbitrary rectangles, axis-parallel rectangles, convex polygons, or simple polygons. Further\u0002more, the allowable transformations for placing the objects play an important role: Is it\nallowed to rotate them, i.e., apply rigid motions, or are only translations allowed? We will\nconsider packing by translations, which is an important variant in practice. For example, in\napparel production there are usually patterns of weaving or texture on the material so that\nthe position where a piece should be cut out cannot be rotated arbitrarily.\nAlready the most simple versions of the problem are NP-hard, e.g., packing a given\nset of axis-parallel rectangles into a given axis-parallel container by translation, as can easily\n\u2217Research was partially carried out at the International INRIA-McGill-Victoria Workshop on Problems in\nComputational Geometry, Barbados 2015.

So, only for a constant number of\nobjects polynomial-time algorithms are known, see [1, 2, 14, 3, 8, 9, 10, 7]. Therefore,\nnumerous approximation algorithms and heuristics have been investigated, mostly in the\noperations research and combinatorial optimization communities and mostly on axis-parallel\nrectangles under translation for a given container or strip. For a survey see [11].\nNot much work has been done so far on approximation algorithms for the problem of\n\u001cnding minimum area containers, either convex ones or axis-parallel boxes. For objects that\nare axis-parallel, rectangles under translation, and arbitrary rectangles or convex polygons\nunder rigid motion, approximation algorithms can be developed from the known ones for\nstrip packing [13]. In fact, in [15] it is shown that packing axis-parallel rectangles under\ntranslation with an approximation factor of 2, and packing convex polygons under rigid\nmotions with an approximation factor of 4 is possible e\u001eciently.\nThus the status of the packing problem in the translational case can be summarized\nas follows: All known algorithms that produce optimal results or have provable approxi\u0002mation ratios fall into one of two categories: They either pack only a very special kind of\nobjects like line-segments or axis-parallel boxes, or they pack a constant number of poly\u0002gons. Since the problem for a non-constant number of objects is NP-hard, this leaves the\nfollowing question: can the packing problem for n objects that are not axis-parallel be e\u001e-\nciently approximated? We answer this question a\u001ermatively for packing a set P of convex\npolygons into a minimum-area rectangular container. Using this result, we also show how to\napproximate the minimum-area convex container for P. Our algorithms run in O(n log n)\ntime.\nWe remark that the restriction to translational packing makes the problem harder.\nIndeed, if we allow rotations then we can compute a minimum-area oriented bounding box\nfor each input polygon, rotate those boxes so that they become axis-parallel, and then pack\nthe boxes using a known algorithm for axis-parallel boxes. Since the minimum-area oriented\nbounding box has area at most twice the area of the polygon itself, this can give a good\napproximation ratio. When we are not allowed to rotate the polygons this approach fails,\nsince the area of the axis-parallel bounding box of a polygon can be arbitrarily much larger\nthan the area of the polygon itself. Our result shows that we can still get a constant\u0002factor approximation in the translational case. The approximation factors we obtain are\nfairly large, but to the best of our knowledge this is the \u001crst proof that these NP-hard\noptimization problems can be approximated at all.\n2 Rectangular Containers\nLet P := {p1, . . . , pk} be a set of convex polygons with n vertices in total. We call an axis\u0002aligned box into which we can pack all polygons (without rotating them) a container for P.\nOur goal is to \u001cnd a container for P of minimum area. Let bopt be a minimum-area container\nfor P, and let opt be its area. Below we present an algorithm that \u001cnds a container of area\nat most 17.45 \u00b7 opt.\nDe\u001cne the height of a polygon p, denoted height(p), to be the di\u001berence between\nits maximum and minimum y-coordinates, and let hmax := maxp\u2208P height(p). Furthermore,\n2\nJournal of Computational Geometry jocg.org\nJoCG 8(1), 1\u201310, 2017 3\nhi\nFig. 1: Example of a packing produced by our algorithm for a single height class.\nde\u001cne the width of a polygon p, denoted width(p), to be the di\u001berence between its maximum\nand minimum x-coordinates, and let wmax := maxp\u2208P width(p). We partition P into height\nclasses using a parameter \u03b1, with 0 < \u03b1 < 1 which is determined later to give the optimal\napproximation factor. More precisely, P is partitioned into subsets P0, P1, . . . according\nto the height: Polygons with height between hmax and \u03b1hmax go into P0, polygons with\nheight between \u03b1hmax and \u03b1\n2hmax go into P1, and so on. More precisely, Pi contains all\npolygons p \u2208 P such that hi+1 < height(p) 6 hi, where hi = \u03b1\nihmax. Our general strategy\nis now as follows:\n1. Pack each height class Pi separately into a container Bi of height hi.\n2. Replace each nonempty container Bi by a collection of axis-aligned mini-containers\nthat are not too wide. Pack all mini-containers into a single container B.\nNext we explain each of these steps in detail.\nStep 1: Packing polygons from one height class. Consider the height class Pi, which\ncontains all polygons whose height lies in the range (\u03b1hi, hi]. Let \u03c3 := [0, \u221e) \u00d7 [0, hi] be a\nsemi-in\u001cnite strip of height hi. We place the polygons from Piinto \u03c3 in a greedy manner,\nas follows: For a polygon p, let s(p) be the segment connecting the lowest vertex of p to the\nhighest vertex of p. If p has horizontal edges, then s(p) connects the bottom-left vertex to\nthe top-right vertex. We call s(p) the spine of p. We sort the polygons in Pi according to\nthe slopes of their spines and then we p...",
