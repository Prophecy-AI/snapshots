      "title": "ANSWER",
      "text": "Top\u2011scoring teams in the **Santa\u202f2025 \u2013 Christmas Tree Packing** competition reach sub\u201169 scores by building on the strongest public baseline and then applying heavy individual refinement.\u202fThe leaderboard shows the best public solution sits at a true local optimum around\u202f70.99, while the top private\u2011leaderboard score is roughly\u202f69.03\u202f\u2013 a gap that the best teams close with extra hand\u2011crafted tweaks and bespoke search\u202f([kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/santa-2025/discussion/665978)).\u202fMost of the top\u2011100 entries (all under\u202f70.9) are described as \u201ca combination of individual effort and the best public \u2026\u201d\u202f([kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/santa-2025/discussion/665669)), indicating that teams start from the public solution and then iterate with custom heuristics (e.g., local search, simulated\u2011annealing\u2011style moves, greedy insertions) to push the score lower.\n\nA key ingredient of these refinements is the **asymmetric solution approach**.\u202fExperiments reported for small instance sizes (\u202fN\u202f<\u202f60) show a clear advantage: \u201casymmetry yields better scores\u201d and becomes the main bottleneck for further improvement\u202f([kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/santa-2025/discussion/666880)).\u202fIn practice this means abandoning any imposed symmetry on the tree layout and allowing each tree to be placed independently, with arbitrary rotations and offsets, so the overall bounding square can be tightened beyond what symmetric patterns permit. By exploring asymmetric configurations through targeted local moves, teams can shave enough area off the bounding box to drop their normalized score below the 69\u202fthreshold.",

The final solution is evaluated by an ensemble score that combines all cases.\n**Notebook Link**:[Santa 2025 - Christmas Tree Packing Challenge V1](https://www.kaggle.com/code/adityapawar327/santa-2025-christmas-tree-packing-challenge-v1)\n**Public Score**: 85.92\n## Table of Contents\n[](#table-of-contents)\n* Library Imports and Environment Setup\n* Global Configuration and Precision Settings\n* ChristmasTree Class Definition\n* Utility Functions (Scoring/Collision)\n* Simulated Annealing Algorithm (N &lt; 20)\n* Grid Search Algorithm (N &gt;= 20)\n* Hybrid &amp; Ensemble Solvers\n* Main Computation Loop (N = 1 to 200)\n* Submission Formatting and Export\n## Methodology\n[](#methodology)\n* **Small N (&lt; 20):**Uses Simulated Annealing for efficient search in small configuration spaces.\n* **Large N (&gt;= 20):**Uses a tailored Grid Search for tractable solution space exploration.\n* **Hybrid/Ensemble:**Runs multiple seeds and chooses the best solution for each N.\n* **Collision Detection:**Employs Shapely geometry operations to prevent tree overlap.\n* **Performance:**Code leverages parallelization (`ProcessPoolExecutor`) and high-precision (Decimal) arithmetic.\n## Usage\n[](#usage)\n1.
