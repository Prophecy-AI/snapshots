## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.627582 (from ensemble of valid snapshots)
- Best LB score: 70.6305 (from exp_009, exp_010, exp_017, exp_018)
- Target: 68.919154 | Gap to target: 1.708 (2.48%)
- Submissions used: 8/100 (92 remaining)

## CRITICAL SITUATION ANALYSIS

After 21 experiments, ALL approaches have converged to ~70.627-70.630:
- SA optimization: converges to 70.63
- bbox3 optimization: converges to 70.63
- Tessellation: converges to 70.63
- Asymmetric random: MUCH WORSE (4-1000x)
- Ensemble from snapshots: 70.627582 (best valid)
- GA, constraint programming, corner reconstruction: ALL FAIL

**THE BASELINE IS AT AN EXTREMELY STRONG LOCAL OPTIMUM.**

The gap to target (1.708 points, 2.48%) is NOT achievable with:
- More SA iterations
- Different SA parameters
- Different tessellation parameters
- Random restarts

## Key Insights from Research

1. **Invalid solutions with better scores exist**: Snapshot 21145966992 has score 70.572798 (0.055 better) but has 72 overlapping N values. This proves there IS room for improvement if we can find valid configurations in that region.

2. **Discussion "Why the winning solutions will be Asymmetric" (34 votes)**: Top competitors believe asymmetric solutions will win. Our asymmetric random attempts failed, but perhaps we need STRUCTURED asymmetric approaches, not random.

3. **Discussion "Symmetric solutions that are apparently optimal" (42 votes)**: There's debate about whether symmetric or asymmetric is better. The truth may be: symmetric for some N, asymmetric for others.

4. **Web search says**: Scores below 69 achieved with "Chebyshev distance square-packing" and "scan-line linear packing" - NOT SA. These are fundamentally different algorithms.

5. **The target (68.919) is 2.27 points BELOW the public LB leader (71.19)**: This means the winning technique is NOT in any public kernel. We need to discover something new.

## Response to Evaluator

The evaluator correctly identified that:
1. All approaches converge to the same local optimum (~70.63)
2. The jiweiliu tessellation approach was worth trying
3. Small N optimization has potential (worst efficiency)

However, the tessellation search (exp_021) found NO improvements. The evaluator's suggestion to implement the full jiweiliu pipeline was executed, but it also converged to the same optimum.

**Key disagreement**: The evaluator suggests the jiweiliu deletion cascade technique. We tried tessellation with SA, but the deletion cascade (starting from larger N and removing worst trees) hasn't been fully implemented. This is worth trying.

## Recommended Approaches (Priority Order)

### 1. **[HIGHEST PRIORITY] Deletion Cascade from Larger N**
The jiweiliu kernel's deletion cascade technique:
- For N=200, create 210 trees (7x15 grid), optimize, then delete 10 worst trees
- For each N from 200 down to 1: start from best config with >= N trees, iteratively remove the tree that minimizes bounding box
- This propagates good patterns from larger N to smaller N

**Why this might work**: It's a fundamentally different approach - constructive from larger to smaller, not optimizing existing configurations.

### 2. **[HIGH PRIORITY] Repair Invalid Snapshots**
Snapshot 21145966992 has score 70.572798 but 72 overlapping N values. For each overlapping N:
- Identify which trees overlap
- Try small perturbations to resolve overlaps while maintaining good score
- Use constraint satisfaction to find valid configurations near the invalid optimum

**Why this might work**: The invalid solution is 0.055 better. If we can repair even 10% of the overlapping N values, we gain 0.005.

### 3. **[MEDIUM PRIORITY] Per-N Specialized Strategies**
Different approaches for different N ranges:
- N=1-10: Exhaustive search (small search space)
- N=11-50: SA with aggressive parameters
- N=51-100: Tessellation with specific grid patterns
- N=101-200: Deletion cascade from larger grids

### 4. **[MEDIUM PRIORITY] Chebyshev Distance Packing**
Research mentioned "Chebyshev distance square-packing" achieves scores below 69. This uses L∞ distance (max of |Δx|, |Δy|) instead of Euclidean. May create different packing structures.

### 5. **[LOW PRIORITY] GFPack++ / Learning-Based**
Research mentions GFPack++ (attention-based gradient field learning) achieves 5-10% improvement over traditional heuristics. However, this requires significant implementation effort.

## What NOT to Try
- ❌ More SA iterations on existing configurations
- ❌ Different SA parameters (temperature, cooling rate)
- ❌ Random asymmetric configurations (proven to be 4-1000x worse)
- ❌ Simple ensembles (all valid sources exhausted)
- ❌ bbox3 optimizer (produces overlapping trees)

## SUBMISSION STRATEGY
- Remaining submissions: 92
- **Submit after EVERY experiment** - we have abundant submissions
- Even if score doesn't improve, LB feedback is valuable for calibration
- Current best LB: 70.6305, current best CV: 70.627582

## Validation Notes
- CV = LB exactly for this deterministic problem (verified with 8 submissions)
- Use Shapely for overlap detection (matches Kaggle's checker)
- All submissions must pass overlap validation before submitting

## CRITICAL: The target IS achievable
The target (68.919) represents a 2.48% improvement. Our current efficiency is ~70% vs theoretical 100%. There IS room for improvement. The winning technique is NOT in public kernels - we must discover it.

**NEXT EXPERIMENT**: Implement deletion cascade from larger N. Create 210 trees for N=200, optimize, then cascade down to N=1 by iteratively removing worst trees.
