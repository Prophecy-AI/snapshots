## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.627634 from snapshot 21191207951
- Best LB score: 70.6305 (from exp_009, exp_010, exp_017, exp_018)
- Target: 68.919154 | Gap to target: 1.708 (2.48%)

## Critical Analysis After 21 Experiments

### The Problem
ALL 21 experiments converge to ~70.63. This is a STRONG LOCAL OPTIMUM that cannot be escaped by:
- SA optimization (tried multiple times)
- bbox3 optimization (produces overlaps)
- Tessellation approaches (same or worse)
- Asymmetric configurations (much worse)
- Ensemble from multiple sources (marginal gains)
- Genetic algorithms (worse)
- Constraint programming (no improvement)

### Key Insight from Invalid Snapshot Analysis
The invalid snapshot 21145966992 has score 70.572798 (0.055 better than best valid).
However, analysis shows:
- 72 N values have overlapping trees
- ALL improvements come from those overlapping configurations
- There are ZERO N values where invalid is both better AND valid

This proves: **The valid configurations are at the TRUE optimum for the current approach.**

### What This Means
The only way to improve is to find a FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT solution structure that:
1. Has different tree arrangements (not just optimized positions)
2. Achieves tighter packing without overlaps
3. Uses a different algorithmic approach entirely

## Response to Evaluator

The evaluator correctly identified that we're stuck at a local optimum. The analysis confirms:
1. All SA/optimization approaches converge to the same ~70.63 score
2. The invalid snapshot's improvements ALL come from overlapping configurations
3. We need a fundamentally different approach

The evaluator's suggestion to implement the jiweiliu pipeline was tried in exp_021 - it found NO improvements. The tessellation approach produces the same or worse results.

## The Real Challenge

The target (68.919) is 2.48% below our best. This requires:
- 1.24% reduction in average side length per N
- Finding configurations that are ~1.24% more efficient

The current best solutions have efficiency ~130-144% vs theoretical minimum.
To reach target, we need efficiency ~127-141%.

## Recommended Approaches (Priority Order)

### 1. **[HIGHEST PRIORITY] Overlap Repair Strategy**
The invalid snapshot shows WHERE improvements exist (72 N values).
Try to REPAIR those overlapping configurations:
- For each overlapping N, identify which tree pairs overlap
- Try micro-adjustments to separate them while preserving the tight packing
- Use constraint satisfaction to find valid configurations close to the invalid ones

### 2. **[HIGH PRIORITY] Per-N Specialized Optimization**
Focus on the 72 N values where the invalid snapshot is better:
- These are the N values with room for improvement
- Try exhaustive search for small N (1-10)
- Try different initial configurations for medium N (11-50)
- Try different tessellation patterns for large N (51-200)

### 3. **[MEDIUM PRIORITY] Different Packing Paradigm**
Instead of optimizing existing solutions:
- Try constructive heuristics (greedy placement, beam search)
- Try different lattice structures (hexagonal, triangular)
- Try non-grid arrangements

### 4. **[RESEARCH] Study What Top Teams Do**
The target suggests someone has achieved 68.919. Research:
- What techniques achieve scores below 69?
- What do the top private teams use?
- Are there unpublished techniques?

## What NOT to Try
- More SA iterations on current solutions (converges to same optimum)
- bbox3 optimization (produces overlaps)
- Simple tessellation (same or worse)
- Random asymmetric configurations (much worse)
- Ensemble from existing sources (all at same optimum)

## Validation Notes
- CV = LB exactly (deterministic problem)
- Always validate for overlaps before submission
- Use Shapely for overlap detection

## SUBMISSION STRATEGY
- Remaining submissions: 92
- Submit after this experiment? YES - we have abundant submissions
- Even if no improvement, LB feedback is valuable
