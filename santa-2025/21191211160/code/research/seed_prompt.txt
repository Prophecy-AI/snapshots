## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.627634 from snapshot 21191207951
- Best LB score: 70.6305 (from exp_009, exp_010, exp_017, exp_018)
- Target: 68.919154 | Gap to target: 1.708 (2.42%)

## Critical Analysis

After 21 experiments, ALL approaches converge to ~70.63. The baseline is at an EXTREMELY STRONG LOCAL OPTIMUM that cannot be escaped by:
- SA optimization (bbox3, sa_v1_parallel, jiweiliu-style)
- Tessellation with parameter search
- Asymmetric random configurations
- Grid-based initial solutions
- Ensemble from multiple sources

### Key Findings from Loop 20 Analysis:
1. **Theoretical minimum**: 49.125 (69.6% current efficiency)
2. **Gap analysis**: To reach target, need to fix N=1 to N=8 (worst 8 N values)
3. **N=1 alone**: 37.1% efficiency, 0.416 potential improvement
4. **Small N (1-10)**: Only 6.1% of score but worst efficiency

### What We've Tried (ALL FAILED):
- exp_000-003: Baseline + ensemble from multiple sources
- exp_004-008: bbox3 optimization, SA optimization, repair+ensemble
- exp_009-010: Fractional translation, tessellation, ensemble from saspav
- exp_011-015: Random restart SA, GA, constraint programming
- exp_016-018: Basin hopping, C++ SA, snapshot ensemble
- exp_019-021: SA with different params, asymmetric configs, tessellation search

### What We HAVEN'T Tried:
1. **Corner-rebuild technique** (chistyakov kernel): Extract smaller N layouts from corners of larger N layouts
2. **Exact solvers for small N** (N=1-10): Branch-and-bound or constraint programming
3. **Per-N specialized strategies**: Different approach for each N range
4. **Crystalline packing with specific symmetries**: p4, p6, etc.
5. **Minkowski sum-based placement**: Use NFP (No-Fit Polygon) for exact placement

## Response to Evaluator

The evaluator correctly identified that:
1. All approaches converge to the same local optimum (~70.630)
2. The jiweiliu pipeline (2-tree tessellation + deletion cascade) hasn't been fully exploited
3. Translation distance optimization explores a different solution space

However, my tessellation search (exp_021) found NO improvements over baseline for N=100,144,150,196,200. The baseline structure is fundamentally better than any tessellation I can generate.

**Key disagreement**: The evaluator suggests the jiweiliu pipeline might work. But my analysis shows the baseline is already at a very strong local optimum that tessellation cannot beat. The issue is not the optimization algorithm - it's the STRUCTURE of the solution.

**My hypothesis**: The target score (68.919) requires a fundamentally different structural approach that is NOT in any public kernel. The winning teams have discovered something that isn't shared publicly.

## Recommended Approaches (Priority Order)

1. **[HIGHEST PRIORITY] Corner-rebuild technique from chistyakov kernel**
   - For each large N layout, extract smaller N layouts from its corners
   - This propagates good patterns from larger N to smaller N
   - Different from deletion cascade - uses spatial locality

2. **[HIGH PRIORITY] Exact solver for small N (N=1-10)**
   - N=1-10 have worst efficiency (37-65%)
   - Use branch-and-bound or constraint programming
   - Even small improvements here have high leverage

3. **[MEDIUM PRIORITY] Per-N specialized strategies**
   - Different approach for N<10, N=10-50, N=50-100, N>100
   - Focus optimization effort on worst-efficiency N values

4. **[EXPERIMENTAL] Try fundamentally different initial configurations**
   - Not random - use mathematical patterns (hexagonal, diagonal, etc.)
   - Start from scratch, not from pre-optimized solutions

## What NOT to Try
- More SA iterations on existing solutions (converges to same optimum)
- Different SA parameters (same result)
- Tessellation with different angles (already tried, no improvement)
- Ensemble from more sources (all sources at same optimum)

## Validation Notes
- CV = LB exactly (deterministic problem)
- Use Shapely for overlap detection
- Verify no overlaps before submission

## SUBMISSION STRATEGY
- Remaining submissions: 92
- Submit after this experiment? YES - we have abundant submissions
- Even if score doesn't improve, LB feedback is valuable
