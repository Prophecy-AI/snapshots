## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.630429 (from snapshot 21180223864)
- Best LB score: 70.630455 (exp_018)
- Target: 68.919154 | Gap to target: 1.711 (2.42%)

## CRITICAL SITUATION ASSESSMENT

After 20 experiments, we are STUCK at a strong local optimum:
- ALL approaches converge to ~70.630
- Asymmetric solutions FAILED (4-1000x worse than baseline)
- Perturbing baseline makes it WORSE
- SA/bbox3/basin hopping/constraint programming all converge to same score

**The gap to target (1.711 points, 2.42%) is NOT achievable with micro-optimizations.**

## Response to Evaluator

The evaluator correctly identified that:
1. Asymmetric approaches failed because they were "too naive" - random configurations from scratch
2. The egortrushin kernel uses STRUCTURED tessellation with specific nt=[nx, ny] parameters
3. The tree removal technique (N+1 → N) is key but we only got 0.000013 improvement

**I agree with the evaluator's assessment.** The current approach is fundamentally wrong.

## What We Know Works
1. **2-tree seed pattern** with angles ~75° and ~255° (from jiweiliu kernel)
2. **Grid translation** with parameters a (x-spacing) and b (y-spacing)
3. **Tree removal technique** - for each N, try removing each tree from N+1

## What We Haven't Tried Properly
1. **Systematic tessellation parameter search** - Different nt=[nx, ny] for each N
2. **Different base angles** - Not just ~75°/255°, try other angle pairs
3. **Non-rectangular tessellations** - Hexagonal, triangular patterns
4. **Minkowski sum optimization** - Different geometric approach

## Recommended Approaches (Priority Order)

### 1. **[HIGHEST PRIORITY] Implement jiweiliu 2-tree tessellation with parameter search**
The jiweiliu kernel uses:
- 2-tree seed with angles ~75° and ~255°
- Grid translation with optimized a, b parameters
- SA to optimize seed positions, angles, AND translation distances

**Key insight**: The tessellation parameters (a, b, nx, ny) define the STRUCTURE.
Different parameters explore different basins that SA cannot reach.

For each N, try multiple tessellation configurations:
- N=100: nt=[5,10], [4,13], [2,25], [10,5], etc.
- N=144: nt=[6,12], [8,9], [4,18], [12,6], etc.
- N=200: nt=[7,15], [8,13], [10,10], [5,20], etc.

### 2. **[HIGH PRIORITY] Focus on large N (100-200)**
Large N contributes 48% of total score. Improvements here have 2x impact.
- N=100-200 has efficiency ~72% vs theoretical 100%
- There IS room for improvement

### 3. **[MEDIUM PRIORITY] Try different base angle pairs**
Current best uses ~75°/255°. Try:
- 60°/240° (hexagonal-like)
- 45°/225° (diagonal)
- 30°/210° (shallow angle)
- 90°/270° (perpendicular)

### 4. **[LOWER PRIORITY] Minkowski sum approach**
Use the "forbidden area" concept from discussions to compute valid placements.

## What NOT to Try
- ❌ More SA iterations on current solution (already at local optimum)
- ❌ Random asymmetric configurations (proven to fail)
- ❌ Perturbing baseline angles (makes it worse)
- ❌ bbox3 with different parameters (converges to same score)

## Validation Notes
- CV = LB exactly (deterministic problem)
- No distribution shift concerns
- Overlap checking is critical - use Shapely

## SUBMISSION STRATEGY
- Remaining submissions: 85
- Submit after EVERY experiment to get LB feedback
- Even small improvements (0.0001) should be submitted to verify
