## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.627582 from snapshot 21191211160 (NEW BEST!)
- Best LB score: 70.6305 (from exp_009, exp_010, exp_017, exp_018)
- Target: 68.919154 | Gap to target: 1.708 (2.42%)

## Critical Analysis After 21 Experiments

**ALL APPROACHES CONVERGE TO ~70.63:**
- Ensemble from multiple sources: 70.630478
- SA optimization: 70.630455
- Tessellation search: 70.630429
- Asymmetric configurations: WORSE than baseline
- bbox3 optimization: produces overlaps
- C++ SA: produces overlaps

**THE PROBLEM IS STRUCTURAL:**
We are stuck at a LOCAL OPTIMUM. All valid solutions converge to ~70.63.
The gap to target (1.71 points, 2.42%) CANNOT be closed by:
- More SA iterations
- Different SA parameters
- Different tessellation parameters
- Ensemble of existing solutions

## Response to Evaluator

The evaluator correctly identified that:
1. All approaches converge to the same local optimum (~70.630)
2. The improvement rate is declining (0.0008 per experiment)
3. At this rate, reaching target would require 2,139+ experiments

**I AGREE with the evaluator's assessment.** The current approach is fundamentally wrong.

However, I found a BETTER valid snapshot (21191211160 with 70.627582) that the evaluator didn't know about. This is a 0.003 improvement, but still far from target.

## Key Insights from Research

**WEB SEARCH REVEALED:**
1. Top teams use MIP (Mixed Integer Programming) to get near-optimal lower bounds
2. Exact solvers (MIP/CP) combined with local-search refinements
3. Hybrid pipelines: MIP solution + fast heuristics
4. N<58: SA for unstructured packings
5. N>58: Crystalline Packing (regular geometric lattices)

**DISCUSSION TITLES REVEAL:**
1. "Why the winning solutions will be Asymmetric" (34 votes) - asymmetric may be key
2. "Symmetric solutions that are apparently optimal" (42 votes) - debate on symmetry
3. "Efficient basin search" (7 votes) - better initial arrangements
4. "k-mer exploration" (11 votes) - novel approach

## What We HAVEN'T Tried

1. **MIP/CP Formulation**: Use exact solvers (OR-Tools, Gurobi) to find optimal placements
2. **Per-N Specialized Strategies**: Different algorithms for small N vs large N
3. **Constraint Programming**: Model the problem as constraints and use CP solver
4. **Spectral Packing**: Use FFT-based collision detection (psacking library)
5. **True Asymmetric Search**: Not random asymmetric, but GUIDED asymmetric search
6. **Basin Hopping with Different Basins**: Start from fundamentally different configurations

## Recommended Approaches (Priority Order)

### 1. **[HIGHEST PRIORITY] MIP/CP Formulation for Small N**
Use OR-Tools or similar to find OPTIMAL placements for N=1-20.
Small N contributes ~11% of total score but may have room for improvement.

```python
from ortools.sat.python import cp_model
# Model tree positions as integer variables
# Add non-overlap constraints
# Minimize bounding box
```

### 2. **[HIGH PRIORITY] Spectral Packing (psacking)**
The psacking library uses FFT-based collision detection for efficient packing.
This is a fundamentally different approach from SA.

### 3. **[MEDIUM PRIORITY] Per-N Analysis**
Analyze which N values have the worst efficiency.
Focus optimization efforts on those specific N values.

### 4. **[MEDIUM PRIORITY] Guided Asymmetric Search**
Instead of random asymmetric configurations, use guided search:
- Start from best symmetric solution
- Systematically break symmetry in ways that reduce bounding box

## What NOT to Try
- ❌ More SA iterations on existing solutions
- ❌ Different SA parameters (temperature, cooling rate)
- ❌ Different tessellation parameters
- ❌ Random asymmetric configurations
- ❌ bbox3 optimizer (produces overlaps)

## SUBMISSION STRATEGY
- Remaining submissions: 92
- **SUBMIT the new best snapshot (70.627582)** to verify CV=LB
- This is a small improvement but confirms the snapshot is valid

## Validation Notes
- CV = LB exactly for this deterministic problem
- All 8 submissions confirm perfect CV-LB alignment
- Shapely-based overlap detection matches Kaggle validation

## CRITICAL: THE TARGET IS ACHIEVABLE
The target (68.919) is 2.27 points BELOW the public LB leader (71.19).
Our current best (70.627) is BETTER than the public LB leader.
The gap to target (1.71 points) requires finding a fundamentally different solution structure.

The winning technique is NOT in public kernels. We must INNOVATE.
