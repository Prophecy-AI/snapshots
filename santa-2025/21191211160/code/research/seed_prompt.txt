## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.627582 from ensemble of valid snapshots
- Best LB score: 70.6305 (from exp_009, exp_010, exp_017, exp_018)
- Target: 68.919154 | Gap to target: 1.708 points (2.42%)

## CRITICAL SITUATION ANALYSIS

After 21 experiments, we have hit a HARD WALL:
- ALL valid solutions converge to ~70.627-70.630
- Invalid solutions (with overlaps) score better (70.57) but fail Kaggle validation
- SA, tessellation, asymmetric, bbox3, GA, constraint programming - ALL converge to same optimum
- The gap to target (1.71 points, 2.42%) is NOT achievable with micro-optimization

## Response to Evaluator

The evaluator correctly identified that we're stuck at a local optimum. Their suggestion to implement the "full jiweiliu pipeline" was tried in exp_021 but produced NO improvements. The tessellation approach with various grid configurations and angle pairs all converge to the same ~70.63 score.

**Key insight from evaluator that I AGREE with:**
- "The target may require techniques NOT in public kernels"
- The target (68.92) is 2.27 points BELOW the public LB leader (71.19)
- This suggests the winning technique is NOT public

**Where I DISAGREE with evaluator:**
- The jiweiliu pipeline has been tried and doesn't work
- Small N optimization has been tried (N=1-10) - baseline is already optimal
- The "deletion cascade" technique doesn't help because the baseline structure is already optimal

## THE REAL PROBLEM

The target of 68.919 requires a 2.42% improvement. Our current best (70.627) is already BETTER than the public LB leader (71.19). This means:

1. The target was set based on a solution that is NOT publicly available
2. The winning approach uses a fundamentally different algorithm/structure
3. No amount of SA/tessellation/optimization will reach it

## WHAT HAS BEEN TRIED (ALL FAILED)
1. ✗ SA optimization (multiple variants, parameters)
2. ✗ bbox3 optimization
3. ✗ Tessellation with 2-tree seeds
4. ✗ Asymmetric random configurations
5. ✗ Basin hopping
6. ✗ Genetic algorithms
7. ✗ Constraint programming
8. ✗ Corner rebuild technique
9. ✗ Cross-N extraction
10. ✗ C++ SA optimizer
11. ✗ Ensemble from multiple sources

## WHAT HASN'T BEEN TRIED

1. **GFPack++ / Score-based diffusion models** - Research mentioned these achieve SOTA on irregular polygon packing
2. **Minkowski sum-based placement** - Exact geometric approach
3. **Branch-and-bound for small N** - Exact solver (not heuristic)
4. **Crystalline packing with specific plane-group symmetries** - p4, p6 symmetries
5. **Learning-based approaches** - Train a model to predict good placements

## Recommended Approaches (Priority Order)

### 1. **[HIGHEST PRIORITY] Submit current best to get LB feedback**
We have a new best score (70.627582) that hasn't been submitted. Submit it to verify CV-LB alignment.

### 2. **[HIGH PRIORITY] Research GFPack++ implementation**
The web search mentioned "GFPack++ builds an attention-based encoder for geometry and relational features, then learns a continuous gradient field that directly drives polygons toward collision-free, high-density placements."

This is a fundamentally different approach that could break through the local optimum.

### 3. **[MEDIUM PRIORITY] Try exact solver for small N**
For N=1-10, use a proper branch-and-bound or constraint programming solver (not heuristic SA). The baseline might not be truly optimal for these small cases.

### 4. **[LOW PRIORITY] Investigate the invalid solutions**
The snapshot 21145966992 has score 70.572798 but 72 overlapping N values. Can we:
- Identify WHICH N values have overlaps
- Use the valid N values from this snapshot
- Only repair the overlapping ones

## SUBMISSION STRATEGY
- Remaining submissions: 92
- **SUBMIT NOW** - We have a new best score (70.627582) that needs LB verification
- With 92 submissions remaining, we should submit after every meaningful experiment

## What NOT to Try
- More SA with different parameters (exhausted)
- More tessellation configurations (exhausted)
- More asymmetric random starts (doesn't work)
- Any approach that has been tried in the 21 experiments

## Validation Notes
- CV = LB exactly for this deterministic problem
- All 8 submissions confirm perfect CV-LB alignment
- Use Shapely for overlap detection (matches Kaggle validation)
