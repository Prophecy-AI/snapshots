## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.627896 from snapshot 21191207951 (NEW BEST - just discovered!)
- Best LB score: 70.630455 (exp_018)
- Target: 68.919154 | Gap to target: 1.709 (2.42%)

## Critical Analysis After 21 Experiments

**ALL APPROACHES CONVERGE TO THE SAME LOCAL OPTIMUM (~70.63)**

After 21 experiments trying:
- SA optimization (multiple variants)
- bbox3 optimizer
- Tessellation with parameter search
- Asymmetric configurations
- Basin hopping
- Genetic algorithms
- Ensemble from multiple sources
- Grid-based initial solutions

**EVERY valid approach produces scores between 70.627 and 70.647**

The baseline is at an EXTREMELY STRONG LOCAL OPTIMUM that cannot be escaped by:
- Running more SA iterations
- Trying different SA parameters
- Using different optimizers (bbox3, tree_packer, etc.)
- Tessellation with different grid sizes
- Random restarts

## Response to Evaluator

The evaluator correctly identified that:
1. We're stuck at a local optimum (~70.63)
2. The improvement rate is declining to near zero
3. The jiweiliu pipeline hasn't been fully exploited

However, I've now tried the jiweiliu-style tessellation approach (exp_021) and it also failed to improve. The tessellation search found NO improvements over baseline for N=100,144,150,196,200.

**Key insight**: The target (68.919) is 2.27 points BELOW the public LB leader (71.19). This means:
1. The winning technique is NOT in any public kernel
2. No amount of optimization of existing approaches will reach the target
3. We need a FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT approach that hasn't been tried

## What We Know

1. **CV = LB exactly** (deterministic problem, no distribution shift)
2. **Current best valid score: 70.627896** (snapshot 21191207951)
3. **All public kernels converge to ~70.63** (same local optimum)
4. **Target requires 2.42% improvement** which is HUGE for this problem
5. **Small N (1-10) are already optimal** - exhaustive search confirmed

## What Hasn't Been Tried (Research Needed)

1. **Crystalline packing with specific plane-group symmetries**
   - The 17 wallpaper groups (p1, p2, pm, pg, p4, p6, etc.)
   - Different symmetry groups may have different local optima
   
2. **Minkowski sum-based placement**
   - Use Minkowski sums to compute exact no-overlap regions
   - Place trees at vertices of Minkowski sum boundaries
   
3. **Constraint programming with global optimization**
   - Use CP-SAT or similar to find globally optimal solutions
   - May be feasible for small N, then use patterns for large N

4. **Per-N specialized strategies**
   - Different algorithms for different N ranges
   - N=1-10: Already optimal
   - N=11-50: May benefit from different approach
   - N=51-200: Tessellation patterns

5. **Tree deletion cascade (jiweiliu)**
   - Start from N+k trees, iteratively remove worst tree
   - Propagates good patterns from larger N to smaller N

## Recommended Approaches (Priority Order)

### 1. **SUBMIT THE NEW BEST** (IMMEDIATE)
We found a better valid snapshot (70.627896 vs 70.630455). Submit it to verify LB score.

### 2. **Ensemble from ALL valid snapshots**
Create ensemble picking best valid solution for each N from all 74 snapshots.
This may find small improvements for specific N values.

### 3. **Research crystalline packing**
Search for: "What plane-group symmetries achieve densest 2D packing for irregular polygons?"
The Christmas tree shape may have a specific optimal symmetry.

### 4. **Implement tree deletion cascade**
For each N from 200 down to 1:
- Start from best configuration with >= N trees
- Iteratively remove the tree that minimizes bounding box
- This propagates good patterns from larger N to smaller N

### 5. **Focus on worst-efficiency N values**
Analyze which N values have worst efficiency (S²/N vs theoretical minimum).
These have the most room for improvement.

## What NOT to Try
- ❌ More SA iterations on current solutions (already at local optimum)
- ❌ Different SA parameters (all converge to same result)
- ❌ bbox3 with different settings (produces overlaps or same result)
- ❌ Random initial configurations (much worse than baseline)
- ❌ Simple grid-based solutions (25% worse than baseline)

## SUBMISSION STRATEGY
- Remaining submissions: 92
- **SUBMIT IMMEDIATELY**: We have a new best (70.627896) that hasn't been submitted
- Continue experimenting after submission

## Validation Notes
- CV = LB exactly (deterministic problem)
- All solutions validated with Shapely overlap detection
- Score = sum of S²/N for N=1-200
