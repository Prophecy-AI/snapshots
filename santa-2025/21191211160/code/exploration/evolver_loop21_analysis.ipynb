    "## Key Strategic Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We Know:\n",
    "1. **All public approaches converge to the same optimum** - This suggests the baseline structure is fundamentally correct\n",
    "2. **Asymmetric random configurations are WORSE** - The symmetric structure is important\n",
    "3. **Exhaustive search for N=2 shows baseline is optimal** - Small N is already well-optimized\n",
    "4. **The gap is 2.42%** - This is significant but not impossible\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We Haven't Tried:\n",
    "1. **MIP (Mixed Integer Programming)** - Can prove optimality or find better solutions\n",
    "2. **Different structural approaches** - Not just optimizing within the same basin\n",
    "3. **Per-N specialized strategies** - Different algorithms for different N ranges\n",
    "4. **Learning from invalid solutions** - The invalid snapshot 21145966992 has better scores for some N\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommended Next Steps:\n",
    "1. **Submit current best (70.627582)** to confirm LB alignment\n",
    "2. **Implement MIP for small N** - Can prove optimality\n",
    "3. **Study the structure of optimal solutions** - What patterns emerge?\n",
    "4. **Try fundamentally different initial configurations** - Not random, but structured differently"
