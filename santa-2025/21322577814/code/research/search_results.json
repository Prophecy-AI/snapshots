      "text": "In simulated annealing applied to 2D packing optimization problems, the temperature schedule is a critical component that influences the algorithm's performance. Although specific details can vary depending on the problem and implementation, a common approach involves starting with a high initial temperature to allow broad exploration of the solution space and gradually decreasing it according to a predefined cooling schedule ([K\u00e4mpke, 2025](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/BF02283751.pdf); [Cornell University](https://optimization.cbe.cornell.edu/index.php?title=Simulated_annealing)). \n\nThe most widely used schedules include geometric cooling, where the temperature is multiplied by a constant factor less than one at each step (e.g., T_{k+1} = \u03b1 T_k, with 0 < \u03b1 < 1), and logarithmic schedules, which decrease more slowly and are theoretically proven to guarantee convergence to a global optimum under ideal conditions ([Standar, 2003](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/BF00143921.pdf)). The choice of initial and final temperatures, as well as the cooling rate, significantly impacts the effectiveness of the optimization; typically, the initial temperature is set high enough to accept worse solutions initially, and the schedule is tuned to gradually reduce acceptance probability as the temperature drops ([Cornell University](https://optimization.cbe.cornell.edu/index.php?title=Simulated_annealing)). \n\nIn practice, adaptive or problem-specific schedules are often employed, where the temperature is adjusted based on the progress of the search or empirical performance, especially in complex 2D packing problems ([Boseniuk, 2003](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0377221702002187)). Overall, the schedule's design balances exploration and exploitation, aiming to find high-quality solutions efficiently while avoiding premature convergence.",

      "text": "Statistics and Computing 4 (1994) 21-32 \nTemperature schedules for simulated \nannealing \nJULIAN STANDER* \nIstituto per le Applicazioni del Caleolo, CNR, Viale del Polielinieo 137, 00161 Roma, Italy \nBERNARD W. SILVERMAN \nUniversity of Bristol, Department of Mathematics, Bristol BS8 1TW, UK \nReceived January 1993 and accepted June 1993 \nIt is well known that the behaviour of the simulated annealing approach to optimization is \ncrucially dependent on the choice of temperature schedule. In this paper, a dynamic program\u0002ming approach is used to find the temperature schedule which is optimal for a simple minimi\u0002zation problem. The optimal schedule is compared with certain standard non-optimal choices. \nThese generally perform well provided the first and last temperatures are suitably selected. \nIndeed, these temperatures can be chosen in such a way as to make the performance of the \nlogarithmic schedule almost optimal. This optimal performance is fairly robust to the choice \nof the first temperature. \nThe dynamic programming approach cannot be applied directly to problems of more \nrealistic size, such as those arising in statistical image reconstruction. Nevertheless, some \nsimulation experiments suggest that the general conclusions from the simple minimization \nproblem do carry over to larger problems. Various families of schedules can be made to \nperform well with suitable choice of the first and last temperatures, and the logarithmic \nschedule combines good performance with reasonable robustness to the choice of the first \ntemperature. \nKeywords: Dynamic programming, image reconstruction, stochastic optimization \n1. Introduction \nAssume that we want to find the global minimum of a \ncomplicated function E(x) over a finite, but usually very \nlarge, set of possible configurations X. Simulated annealing \nhas been extensively used for this task in the last decade. \nSee Laarhoven and Aarts (1987) and Bertsimas and Tsitsiklis \n(1993) for general reviews of the literature about this sto\u0002chastic optimization technique, and Ripley (1988) for a very \nclear introduction which we now summarize. \nAssume here for simplicity that there is only one con\u0002figuration, s that achieves the global minimum of E(x) \nover 2(. Define a family of probability measures P~, \nindexed by temperature r > 0, on P( by \nP~ (x) oc exp {-E(x) } 1/~- \n* Address for correspondence: University of Plymouth, School of Mathe\u0002matics and Statistics, Plymouth PL4 8AA, UK. \n0960-3174 \u000e9 1994 Chapman & Hall \nand note that as 7- decreases to 0, P~ increasingly \nconcentrates on 2. In particular, if at each discrete time t \nand temperature Tt we take a sample X(~-t) from P~-' and \nif we let Tt tend to 0 as t increases, we would hope that \nX(Tt) \"~ s in some sense. \nThe rate at which 7t decreases as t increases is crucial. \nGeman and Geman (1984) and Hajek (1988) present \nsome asymptotic results about this rate. Essentially, Hajek \nshows that, under certain mild assumptions, a necessary \nand sufficient condition for \nX(Tt) ~ :~ in probability as t ~ oc (1) \nis that \nEexp - =~, (2) \nt=l \\ \nwhere d* is a constant depending on E and the sampling \nmechanism, but independent of the starting configuration. \nIf r t is taken to be F/log (t + 1) then the necessary and \n22 Julian Stander and Bernard W. Silverman \nsufficient condition (2) holds if and only if F > d*. How\u0002ever, it is well known that Hajek's result does not in itself \ngive a satisfactory temperature schedule, and that the \nconvergence rates it demonstrates are unacceptably slow \nin practice. \nIn this paper we study the choice of temperature \nschedule in simulated annealing as applied to problems of \nvastly different degrees of complexity. In Section 2 of this \npaper we present a dynamic programming algorithm \nwhich, for any given initial distribution on 2( and any \ninteger T, yields the temperature schedule of length T that \nmaximizes the probability that X('rr) = 2. This approach \nis only computationally feasible when 2( is small, and \nwe apply it to find optimal schedules of various lengths in \na 'toy' problem where the function to be minimized is \nexplicitly specified. We compare the optimal schedules so \nproduced with schedules given by one- and two-step\u0002ahead strategies, as well as a number of commonly used \nfamilies of schedules parametrized by their first and last \ntemperatures. \nIn Section 3 we turn to the application of simulated \nannealing to problems of more realistic size arising in \nimage reconstruction. A simulation study enables various \ntemperature schedules to be compared. We discover that \nmany of our findings about the temperature schedule \nfrom the 'toy' minimization problem carry over to this \nmuch more complicated setup. Minimization problems \narising from two separate image reconstruction problems \nare considered. In the first, the reconstruction of a binary \nimage, the global optimum of the objective function can \nin fact be found explicitly by a completely different algo\u0002rithm (Greig et al. 1989), and so there is a benchmark \nagainst which simulated annealing can be compared. In \nthe second, the reconstruction of a grey-level image, there \nis no such absolute standard, and comparisons can only \nbe made between different iterative methods. \nFinally, in Section 4 we present our conclusions and \nmake some tentative suggestions for the application of \nour work. \n2. A dynamic programming approach to finding the \noptimal temperature schedule \nLabel the points in 2( in such a way that 1 corresponds to \nthe global minimum of the function E. Let 7r (~ be the \ninitial probabilities of the points in X, Q (0-) be a matrix \nof transition probabilities that defined the sampling \nmechanism employed by the simulated annealing algo\u0002rithm at temperature 0-, and T be an arbitrary but fixed \ninteger. Our objective is to find, for any 7c (~ the maximum \nvalue of the probability of being in state I after Titerations, \nthat is \n[0r(~ Q (0-1)Q (0-2)'\" Q (~-r)]l, (3) \nover all temperature schedules of length T, \n(0-1,.--, o-r), (4) \nwhere 0-i -> 0 for i = 1,..., Tand [~b]t is used to denote the \nfirst component of the vector r We shall refer to the maxi\u0002mizing temperature schedule as the optimal temperature \nschedule. \n2.1. The dynamic programming approach \nWe shall use a standard dynamic programming approach, \nas described in Bellman (1957) for example, to find the \noptimal temperature schedule. The algorithm comprises \ntwo stages. \nThe first stage involves setting up a table of results, as \nfollows: \nStep 1. For all probability vectors 7r, find 0-~ (Tr) that \nmaximizes \n[7rQ(0-1)]1 over 0-1 >- 0, \nand store the maximum value as p l(Tr). \nSteps k = 2,..., T. For all probability vectors ~r, find \n0-~ (Tr) that maximizes \npk-({TrQ(0-k)} over 0-k -- 0, \nand store the maximum value as pk(Tr). The values of \nPk_l{~rQ(0-k)} were found in Step k - 1. \nThese T steps can be thought of as yielding an infinite \ntable of T rows. The entries of this table are 0-~ (st) and \npg (st) for k = 1,..., T and for all probability vectors st. \nOf course, when this is implemented on the computer, \nsome form of discretization has to be employed for \nthe 7rs. In the simple case that we shall discuss below in \nsection 2.3, 71=(71l,Tr2, Tr3) , where 7rl,Tr2, Tr3~0 and \n7rl + ~r2 + 7r3 = 1. We calculate the required quantities \non a regular grid of points in the appropriate region. \nIf a value is required at an intermediate point, we use \nlinear interpolation between the calculated values. The \ngauge of the grid was 0.02; finer grids did not give notice\u0002ably better results. Other types of discretization with \nappropriate interpolation were tried. For example, we \nexperimented with the case when the discretization became \nfiner as the value of the probability of being in state 1 \napproached unity. Again, this did not give notice\u0002ably better results than those obtained by using the regular \ngrid. \nThe second stage of the dynamic programming approach \ninvolves reading off the sche...",

Inspired by the annealing process in metallurgy, the algorithm explores the solution space by occasionally accepting worse solutions with a probability that diminishes over time. This reduces the risk of getting stuck in local optima and increases the likelihood of discovering the global optimum.\n\nThe basic steps of the SA algorithm are as follows:\n\n1. Initialization: Begin with an initial solution s0{\\\\displaystyle s\\_{0}} and an initial temperature T0{\\\\displaystyle T\\_{0}}\u200b.\n2. Iterative Improvement: While the stopping criteria are not met:\n   - Generate a new solution snew{\\\\displaystyle s\\_{new}} \u200bin the neighborhood of the current solution s.\n   - Calculate the difference in objective values \u0394E=f(snew)\u2212f(s){\\\\displaystyle \\\\Delta E=f(s\\_{new})-f(s)}, where f{\\\\displaystyle f} is the objective function.\n   - If \u0394E<0{\\\\displaystyle \\\\Delta E<0} (i.e., snew{\\\\displaystyle s\\_{new}} is a better solution), accept snew{\\\\displaystyle s\\_{new}}\u200b as the current solution.\n   - If \u0394E>0{\\\\displaystyle \\\\Delta E>0}, accept snew{\\\\displaystyle s\\_{new}}\u200b with a probability P=exp\u2061(\u2212\u0394ET){\\\\displaystyle P=\\\\exp \\\\left(-{\\\\frac {\\\\Delta E}{T}}\\\\right)}.\n   - Update the temperature T{\\\\displaystyle T} according to a cooling schedule, typically T=\u03b1\u22c5T{\\\\displaystyle T=\\\\alpha \\\\cdot T}, where \u03b1{\\\\displaystyle \\\\alpha } is a constant between 0 and 1.\n3. Termination: Stop the process when the temperature falls below a minimum threshold , or after a predefined number of iterations. The best solution encountered is returned as the approximate optimum.\n\n### Pseudocode for Simulated Annealing\n\n```\ndef SimulatedAnnealing(f, s_0, T_0, alpha, T_min):\n    s_current = s_0\n    T = T_0\n    while T > T_min:\n        s_new = GenerateNeighbor(s_current)\n        delta_E = f(s_new) - f(s_current)\n        if delta_E < 0 or Random(0, 1) < math.exp(-delta_E / T):\n            s_current = s_new\n        T = alpha * T\n    return s_current\n\n```\n\n### Assumptions and Conditions\n\n#### **Objective Function Continuity**\n\nThe objective function f{\\\\displaystyle f} is assumed to be defined and continuous in the search space.\n\n#### **Cooling Schedule**\n\nThe cooling schedule, typically geometric, determines how T{\\\\displaystyle T} decreases over iterations. The cooling rate \u03b1{\\\\displaystyle \\\\alpha } affects the convergence speed and solution quality.\n\n**Acceptance Probability**\n\nBased on the Metropolis criterion, the probability P=exp\u2061(\u2212\u0394ET){\\\\displaystyle P=\\\\exp \\\\left(-{\\\\frac {\\\\Delta E}{T}}\\\\right)} allows the algorithm to accept worse solutions initially, encouraging broader exploration.\n\n#### **Termination Condition**\n\nSA terminates when T{\\\\displaystyle T} falls below Tmin{\\\\displaystyle T\\_{min}}\u200b or when a predefined number of iterations is reached.\n\n## Numerical Examples\n\nFigure 1: Configuration for L\n\nThe Ising model is a classic example from statistical physics and in order to reach its optimal state, we can use Simulated Annealing (SA) to reach a minimal energy state.[\\[6\\]](https://optimization.cbe.cornell.edu/optimization.cbe.cornell.edu#cite_note-6) In the SA approach, we start with a high \"temperature\" that allows random changes in the system\u2019s configuration, which helps explore different arrangements of spins. As the temperature lowers, the algorithm gradually favors configurations with lower energy, eventually \"freezing\" into a low-energy state.\n\n### _**Problem Setup**_\n\nConsider a small 2\u00d72{\\\\displaystyle 2\\\\times 2} grid of spins, where each s...",

The major motivation for applying a modified genetic algorithm is as an attempt to alleviate the problem of pre-mature convergence. We found that in the long run, the mixed heuristic produces better results; while the pure heuristic produces only \u201cgood\u201d results, but produces them faster.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe two-dimensional orthogonal packing problem consists of packing rectangular pieces of predetermined sizes into a large but finite rectangular plate (the _stock plate_), or equivalently, cutting small rectangular pieces from the large rectangular plate. We wish to find \u201cpacking patterns\u201d that minimize the unused area ( _trim loss_). The problem has obvious relevancy to the textile, paper, and other industries, and in the three-dimensional case, is related to the problem of packing boxes into a container.\n\nThe problem has been formulated as an integer program. For that approach and variations, see Beasley (1985), Tsai (1993) or Christofides (1995). Recently, different meta-heuristics have been applied to problems of this kind, for instance, see Parada et al. (1998), Lai and Chan (1997), Jakobs (1996), Glover et al. (1995), Dowsland, 1993, Dowsland, 1996. For an introduction to meta-heuristics, see Osman and Laporte (1996). Based on the papers of Jakobs (1996), also Lai and Chan (1997), we have carried out extensive comparisons of these heuristics (Leung et al., 2000). An important building block in any area of research is a valid comparison among the different theories or models that were proposed in the field. Such a comparison is missing in the area of meta-heuristics for the two-dimensional orthogonal packing problem.\n\nIn our investigation, we found that the pure genetic algorithm meta-heuristic usually produces good results. Nevertheless, we also found that this heuristic converges very fast; thus, good results were produced at early stages. That is, while good, these results are improvable if what we call \u201cpre-mature convergence\u201d can be avoided. For this purpose, we employ a mixed meta-heuristic and test its performance.\n\n## Section snippets\n\n## Methodology\n\nA packing pattern may be represented by a permutation, which corresponds to the sequence in which the small rectangles are packed. Other representations may be found in Beasley (1985) or Dowsland, 1993, Dowsland, 1996. In this paper we concentrate on the permutation representation. Now if we have a permutation, we know the order of packing the small pieces, but we may still consider different strategies for packing the pieces. In Jakobs\u2019s (1996) paper, the problem of packing rectangular pieces\n\n## The difference process strategy\n\nIn the difference process strategy, while trying to pack a new piece, the \u201cempty spaces\u201d are considered. In short, a space is a rectangular area of largest possible size, with sides parallel to the stock plate, which is not yet occupied by any rectangular pieces. One may observe that in the packing process, there are only finitely many spaces. At the very beginning, there is only one space and its bottom left corner is precisely at the origin. After the first piece is packed, there are\n\n## Genetic search algorithm\n\nA genetic search algorithm is a heuristic search process that resembles natural selection. There are many variations and refinements, but any genetic algorithm has the features of reproduction, crossover and mutation. Initially a population is selected, and by means of crossovers among members of the population or mutations of members, the better of the population will remain, because of the \u201csurvival of the fittest\u201d. This idea was first proposed by Holland (1975), among others. For its many\n\n## Simulated annealing and genetic algorithms\n\nAfter many reported experiments in the literature, genetic algorithms have been found to be efficient and robust. In addition, it is usually straightforward to encode a problem suitable for application of genetic algorithms. Nevertheless, genetic algorithms also have their shortcomings. In fact, if the worst members are discarded after each generation, the population will tend to quickly become homogeneous. If the mutation probability is small then chromosomes of large variation in fitness may\n\n## Experimental results\n\nWe have altogether 19 test problems. The first eight problems came from Lai and Chan (1997) and Jakobs (1996). The 9th and the 10th problems were our own constructions. They all have a known optimal solution of zero trim loss, so that the absolute performances of the various algorithms can be determined. The number of rectangular pieces in each stock plate ranges from 10 to 50. The data sets for these 10 problems are given in Table 1, Table 2, Table 3, Table 4, Table 5, Table 6, Table 7, Table 8\n\n## Final remarks\n\nTheoretically, we can tune the cooling process and the iteration numbers of a SA to achieve the global optimum (Mahfoud and Goldberg, 1995). Nevertheless, this implies that longer times may be required to achieve optimal or good solutions. Moreover, the serial nature of SA prevents us from employing parallelism. On the other hand, though GA exhibits implicit parallelism it is not easy to control the GA\u2019s convergence. Formally, there is also no proof of its global convergence. See, however,\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThanks to C.H.

In the past, very large combinatorial optimization problems have been solved using this technique. It has also been shown that this method is effective in obtaining close-to-optimal solutions for problems known to be NP complete. Further, this technique is applicable to a whole class of problems that satisfy a few requirements.\n\nThe purpose of this paper is to illustrate an efficient version of the simulated annealing method as applied to a variant of the bin-packing problem. The computational complexity of the method is linear in input size similar to various well-known heuristic methods for the problem. The solutions obtained, however, are much better than any of the heuristic methods. The particular variant of the bin-packing problem we consider has several practical applications such as static task allocation in process scheduling and batch processing. At the time of this writing, we have not yet seen a stochastic solution to the bin-packing problem in the literature.\n\nOne of the distinguishing features of our research is the high quality of solutions obtained by our method. Extensive simulation experiments we have carried out show that the solutions obtained by the stochastic method show a significant improvement over those obtained by any of the well-known heuristic methods.\n\n- [Previous article in issue](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0898122194900760)\n- [Next article in issue](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0898122194900787)\n\n## Keywords\n\nBin-Packing\n\nCombinatorial optimization\n\nGlobal minimum\n\nMonte Carlo methods\n\nNP completeness\n\nSimulated annealing\n\nStatistical cooling\n\n[View PDF](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0898122194900779/pdf?md5=30492ae375a8dc570527f689a4f3bffb&pid=1-s2.0-0898122194900779-main.pdf)\n\nRecommended articles\n\n## References\n\n01.

It considers various parameters such as landscape and neighborhood. The need for a better understanding of SA, with the additional goal of implementing the algorithm efficiently, motivated this study. The method selected to conduct that study was to carry out experiments to obtain practical data, which could be utilized to carry out a theoretical study simultaneously. Experiments on such a stochastic algorithm as SA were initiated following the observation that it is possible to calculate the exact probability for SA to reach any point in the landscape, provided that the number of solutions and the number of neighbors per solution are small enough. An efficient development of a SA simulator has enabled us to study the influence of the tuning of all the main parameters of SA as well as theoretical concepts such as thermodynamic equilibrium and optimal temperature decrement rules. Interesting results have been obtained in the field of adaptive cooling schedules that enable us to demonstrate that the classical cooling schedules are all equivalent. Finally a new schedule has been proposed that exhibits some useful properties. The proposed cooling schedule has been successfully implemented in the SA algorithm to solve the well known traveling salesman problem.\n## Introduction\nIn 1953, Metropolis et al. proposed an algorithm for the efficient simulation of the evolution of a solid to thermal equilibrium. Almost 30 years later, Kirkpatrick et al. (1982) realized that there exists a profound analogy between minimizing the cost function of a combinatorial optimization problem and the slow cooling of a solid until it reaches its low energy ground state and that the optimization process can be carried out by applying the Metropolis criterion. By substituting energy for cost and by executing the Metropolis algorithm at a sequence of slowly decreasing temperature values, Kirkpatrick et al. obtained a combinatorial optimization algorithm that they called \u201csimulated annealing\u201d. Twenty years later SA is still of great interest and the research into this algorithm and its applications has evolved into a field of study of its own (Michalewicz et al., 2000; Salamon et al., 2002; Hromkovic, 2003).\nEven if the theoretical basis of the algorithm have been known for almost two decades, still there is a lack of enough practical information about it. As a matter of fact, it is still not simple for a user to design his own algorithm. A lot of tuning, usually, has to be carried out and no theoretical results give clear statement about which temperature decrement rule should be used or what kind of neighborhood should be chosen.\nWe initiated our study of SA while working on loading pattern optimization of nuclear reactors at Electricit\u00e9 de France (EDF). Indeed, thanks to its robustness and flexibility, SA is currently the most widely used combinatorial optimization algorithm in this field. At that time we were particularly interested in using SA in some new multiobjective optimization algorithms (Collette, 2002).\nThe work presented in this paper has evolved out of the results of the experiments carried out employing simulated annealing and of a theoretical study, which was aimed at improving the design of SA algorithms. At the beginning of the work, an important aspect of investigation was the level of performances that could be expected to obtain employing the SA algorithm. We needed to know how SA would perform on a given landscape with a given temperature decrement rule and a given neighborhood. Our interest lied in obtaining satisfactory answers to the age-old questions like how high the temperature should be for the SA algorithm to be able to climb a given hill.\nIn the initial phase of our work we performed some calculations for simple one-dimension cases and then we noticed that, for small problems and for a limited number of neighbors, it was possible to calculate exactly the probability for SA to find a given solution. Taking this into account, we developed a basic SA simulator which enabled us to calculate the distribution of probability over the landscape. The benefit of this simple method is that results of the experiments can be displayed as a probability density that can be easily exploited for further analysis. These experiments helped us to achieve several interesting empirical results that allowed a better understanding of the SA and that were helpful in the subsequent design of improved implementations of the algorithm. We have achieved interesting results in the field of neighborhoods, where it has been demonstrated that the neighborhood structure should have some desirable properties to make it possible for the SA algorithm to explore efficiently the solution space. Then we have studied the theoretical concept of thermal equilibrium and its effect on SA convergence. Finally we have studied cooling schedules. Our experiments enabled us to construct an optimum schedule that could not be used in practice but that showed that there was no clearly better cooling schedule than logarithmic schedule to ensure convergence toward the set of optima with probability one. Then we conducted experiments on adaptive cooling schedules to compare classical proposals. This study led to important theoretical results. First we were able to show that several classical adaptive temperature decrement rules proposed in the literature, that had different theoretical foundations and different mathematical equations, were in fact the same practical rule. Next, we were able to calculate a new adaptive decrement rule that exhibit...",

The hybrid simulated annealing algorithm uses the modified penalty algorithm to generate an initial solution and then improves it using simulated annealing. It is tested on single-row layout problems with facilities of unequal area and multi-row layout problems with facilities of equal area. The algorithm produced solutions better than those previously reported in the literature for two of the larger single-row problems and five multi-row layout problems. For all the other single-row problems and eight of ten multi-row layout test problems, it produced the best known solutions. The hybrid simulated annealing algorithm appears to produce better quality solutions than the simulated annealing and tabu navigation algorithms, but requires more computation time than simulated annealing.\n\nSpecial issue articlesRecommended articles\n\n- R.E.

Many heuristic algorithms can apply the 2-opt local search to find better solutions. In complete 2-opt local search, every valid neighboring solutions of swapping mechanism will be compared, which is very time consuming especially when a sequential algorithm is adopted. Nowadays, graphic processing units (GPUs) have evolved into powerful and flexible parallel computation platforms that have been widely used to accelerate the solving of NP-hard problems. Therefore, in this study, we focus on how to use GPUs to solve the single-row facility layout problem (SRFLP) with the 2-opt-based simulated annealing (SA) heuristic algorithm. As far as we know, this study is the first to solve SRFLP by using a GPU. After analyzing the fitness function and the move gains calculation between parent and child solutions, we propose a prefix-sum formula table to eliminate a large amount of replicated computation. To calculate move gains for the 2-opt local search during each iteration, many GPU threads are created and they construct and lookup the table in parallel. According to experimental results, if the prefix-sum formula table is not adopted, the GPU version outperforms the sequential CPU counterpart with the best speedup of 123. However, if the table is used in the GPU version, the best speedup can reach up to 3208. Because the proposed parallelization approach with the prefix-sum formula table is based on the features of the 2-opt local search and the SRFLP fitness function, it can be applied to any 2-opt-based heuristic algorithm for solving SRFLP even though the SA algorithm is used in this study.\n\n- ### [A GRASP algorithm for solving large-scale single row facility layout problems](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305054819300486)\n\n\n\n2019, Computers and Operations Research\n\n\n\nShow abstract\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe single-row facility layout problem (SRFLP) is an NP-hard problem, which consists of arranging facilities along a straight line in order to minimize the weighted sum of distances between all pairs of facilities. In this paper, an implementation of the Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP) meta-heuristic is presented to solve large-scale instances of the problem. The novelty of the proposed implementation is that it is endowed with a diversification phase based on frequency memory. The algorithm was tested on 93 instances with sizes up to one thousand facilities. To date, in the literature, there is only one work, which has considered instances of such magnitude. Computational experiments demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm, which improved the best-known values for 29 out of 93 instances.\n\n- ### [Mathematical modeling and multi-start search simulated annealing for unequal-area facility layout problem](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417417305274)\n\n\n\n2018, Expert Systems with Applications\n\n\n\nShow abstract\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this paper, a mixed integer nonlinear programming model (MINLP) is ...",

Specifically, it is a[metaheuristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaheuristic)to approximate[global optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_optimization)in a large[search space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution_space)for an[optimization problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimization_problem). For large numbers of local optima, SA can find the global optimum.[&#91;1&#93;](#cite_note-1)It is often used when the search space is discrete (for example the[traveling salesman problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traveling_salesman_problem), the[boolean satisfiability problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_satisfiability_problem),[protein structure prediction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_structure_prediction), and[job-shop scheduling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Job-shop_scheduling)). For problems where a fixed amount of computing resource is available, finding an approximate global optimum may be more relevant than attempting to find a precise local optimum. In such cases, SA may be preferable to exact algorithms such as[gradient descent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent)or[branch and bound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_and_bound). The problems solved by SA are currently formulated by an[objective function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective_function)of many variables, subject to several[mathematical constraints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_constraints). In practice, a constraint violation can be penalized as part of the objective function.\nSimilar techniques have been independently introduced on several occasions, including Pincus (1970),[&#91;2&#93;](#cite_note-2)Khachaturyan et al. (1979,[&#91;3&#93;](#cite_note-3)1981[&#91;4&#93;](#cite_note-4)), Kirkpatrick, Gelatt and Vecchi (1983), and Cerny (1985).[&#91;5&#93;](#cite_note-5)In 1983, this approach was used by Kirkpatrick, Gelatt Jr., and Vecchi[&#91;6&#93;](#cite_note-:2-6)for a solution of the[traveling salesman problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traveling_salesman_problem). They also proposed its current name, simulated annealing.\nThe name of the algorithm comes from[annealing in metallurgy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annealing_(metallurgy)), a technique involving heating and controlled cooling of a material to alter its[physical properties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_properties). This notion of slow cooling implemented in the simulated annealing algorithm is interpreted as a slow decrease in the probability of accepting worse solutions as the solution space is explored. Accepting worse solutions allows for a more extensive search for the global optimal solution. Simulated annealing algorithms work by progressively decreasing the temperature from an initial positive value to zero. At each time step, the algorithm randomly selects a solution close to the current one, measures its quality, and moves to it according to the temperature-dependent probabilities of selecting better or worse solutions.\nThe simulation can be performed either by a solution of[kinetic equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kinetic_equations&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1)for[probability density functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_density_functions),[&#91;7&#93;](#cite_note-:0-7)[&#91;8&#93;](#cite_note-:1-8)or by using a[stochastic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic)sampling method.[&#91;6&#93;](#cite_...",
