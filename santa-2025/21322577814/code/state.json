      "query": "What are the best algorithms for 2D irregular polygon packing optimization problems?",
      "finding": "The best algorithms for 2D irregular polygon packing optimization problems encompass a variety of approaches, including heuristic, metaheuristic, and exact methods. Metaheuristic algorithms such as genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, and tabu search have been widely applied due to their ability to navigate large and complex search spaces effectively. For instance, a review from 2001 highlights the use of genetic algorithms specifically tailored for irregular packing problems, emphasizing their flexibility and effectiveness in handling the combinatorial nature of these tasks ([Springer](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1012590107280)). More recent research has focused on hybrid approaches, combining genetic algorithms with local search heuristics to improve solution quality and computational efficiency, especially in applications involving multiple bin sizes and irregular shapes ([MDPI](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/13/22/12474), [University of Southampton](https://epri",

    {
      "query": "What is simulated annealing temperature schedule for 2D packing optimization problems?",
      "finding": "In simulated annealing applied to 2D packing optimization problems, the temperature schedule is a critical component that influences the algorithm's performance. Although specific details can vary depending on the problem and implementation, a common approach involves starting with a high initial temperature to allow broad exploration of the solution space and gradually decreasing it according to a predefined cooling schedule ([K\u00e4mpke, 2025](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/BF02283751.pdf); [Cornell University](https://optimization.cbe.cornell.edu/index.php?title=Simulated_annealing)). \n\nThe most widely used schedules include geometric cooling, where the temperature is multiplied by a constant factor less than one at each step (e.g., T_{k+1} = \u03b1 T_k, with 0 < \u03b1 < 1), and logarithmic schedules, which decrease more slowly and are theoretically proven to guarantee convergence to a global optimum under ideal conditions ([Standar, 2003](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.",
