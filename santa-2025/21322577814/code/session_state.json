      "finding": "The best algorithms for 2D irregular polygon packing optimization problems encompass a variety of approaches, including heuristic, metaheuristic, and exact methods. Metaheuristic algorithms such as genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, and tabu search have been widely applied due to their ability to navigate large and complex search spaces effectively. For instance, a review from 2001 highlights the use of genetic algorithms specifically tailored for irregular packing problems, emphasizing their flexibility and effectiveness in handling the combinatorial nature of these tasks ([Springer](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1012590107280)). More recent research has focused on hybrid approaches, combining genetic algorithms with local search heuristics to improve solution quality and computational efficiency, especially in applications involving multiple bin sizes and irregular shapes ([MDPI](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/13/22/12474), [University of Southampton](https://epri",
