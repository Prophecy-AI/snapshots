  "notes": "Tried constraint programming with OR-Tools CP-SAT solver and multi-start SA. CP found solutions but they all had overlaps because the simplified distance constraints don't accurately model tree polygon geometry. Multi-start SA with 10 restarts per N found no improvements. This confirms the baseline is at a strong optimum."
