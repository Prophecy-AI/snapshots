  "notes": "Constructive interlock algorithm tested on N=10,20,30,50,100. Built solutions from scratch using 2-angle tessellation (45° and 225°) with optimal interlock offset (dx=-0.64, dy=0). Tried various cell spacings (0.4-1.0). Found NO improvements - all constructed solutions were equal to or worse than baseline. The baseline configurations are highly optimized irregular packings that cannot be replicated by regular interlock patterns."
