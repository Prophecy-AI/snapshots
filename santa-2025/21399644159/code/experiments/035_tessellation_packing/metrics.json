  "key_finding": "All tessellation patterns (hexagonal, diamond, brick, interlock) produce WORSE scores than baseline for all tested N values. The baseline configurations are already more efficient than regular periodic patterns.",
  "notes": "Tested 4 tessellation patterns with 3 base angles each, optimizing spacing parameters. None beat the baseline. This confirms that the current solutions use non-periodic, optimized arrangements that cannot be improved by regular tessellations."
