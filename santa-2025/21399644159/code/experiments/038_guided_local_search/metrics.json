  "key_finding": "GLS penalized many features but found NO improvements. The baseline is at the boundary of the feasible region - any perturbation that reduces bounding box causes overlaps.",
  "notes": "Tested GLS with feature-based penalties (boundary trees, angle bins, position bins). Despite penalizing 26-40+ features per N value, no valid improvements were found. This confirms the solution is at a boundary optimum, not an interior local optimum."
