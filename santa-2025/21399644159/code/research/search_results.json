      "text": "To effectively escape local optima in 2D polygon packing problems, especially when solutions are at the boundary of the feasible region, one promising approach involves incorporating strategies that promote solution diversity and facilitate exploration beyond local minima. For instance, the study on a hybrid GA-LP algorithm suggests that hybrid methods can enhance the search process by combining global and local search techniques ([MDPI](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/13/22/12474)). Similarly, the approach of examining neighbor solutions in random order, as described in another study, allows the algorithm to explore alternative configurations and escape boundary traps more effectively ([ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0360835220304216)). \n\nAdditionally, heuristic strategies such as \"jostling\" or \"kicking\" solutions\u2014small perturbations designed to move solutions away from local optima\u2014are employed in some heuristics to diversify the search space ([White Rose](https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/id/eprint/134688/1/Accepted_article_IJPE.pdf)). These methods, combined with local search techniques based on nonlinear programming or evolutionary algorithms with heuristics like four corners, can help overcome the challenge of solutions lying at the boundary of the feasible region ([ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0305054811001596); [ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0377221706003018)). Overall, the key is to incorporate stochastic perturbations, diversified neighborhood searches, and hybrid algorithms that balance exploration and exploitation to avoid getting trapped at boundary solutions.",

The purpose of RPAMP is to ensure maximum use of the materials used in industries and minimize the trim loss. The yield from materials is significant issue. Because a small change in placement can result in a significant reduction in production costs and material savings. In this study, 2D-RPAMP, which is widely seen in the manufacturing industry, has been investigated. The solution approaches have been developed by using heuristic methods such as no-fit polygon and bottom-left fill and metaheuristic method such as Simulated Annealing (SA). In experimental studies, the bottom-left fill method is used for the placement process, no-fit polygon method is used in order to avoid overlapping between the parts placed, and the [SA algorithm](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/mathematics/simulated-annealing-algorithm) is employed for the faster and efficient packing process. As a result of experiments using the hybrid methodology consisting of the [SA algorithm](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/simulated-annealing-algorithm) can reach reasonable level of the trim loss varies that is between 0,21% and 9,1% for most industry. The experimental results show the efficiency of the packing process with hybrid methodology.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe 2D rectangle packing area minimization problem (2D-RPAMP) is the placement of multiple shapes on a broad surface or material without overlapping smoothly. This problem is encountered in a wide range of industries, such as glass (Wei, Zhu, Lim, Liu, & Chen, 2018), steel (Gon\u00e7alves, 2007), paper (Oliveira, Neuenfeldt J\u00fanior, Silva, & Carravilla, 2016), sheet (Leung, Zhang, & Sim, 2011), metal (Valvo, 2017), textile (Thomas & Chaudhari, 2013), leather (\u015eenel, G\u00f6k\u00e7e, Y\u00fcksel, & Yi\u011fit, 2018), apparel (He & Wu, 2013), automotive (Wu et al., 2016), etc. The RPAMP can provide increasing of profitability for many industrial areas by reducing profitaiblity. The main objective is minimizing the trim loss of used materials and placing all parts while fulfilling the constraints specific to problems. The 2D-RPAMP consists two types that are strip packing problem (SPP) and rectangle packing problem (RPP) (Wu et al., 2016). The SSP and RPP are determined as open and two dimensional knapsack problem respectively (W\u00e4scher, Hau\u00dfner, & Schumann, 2007).\n\n2D-RPAMP is widely worked by many researchers. This problem is a kind of numerical optimization problem. Because, 2D-RPAMP doesn\u2019t have exact or analytical mathematical model. Furthermore many un-modeled components affect the optimization process. For this reason, heuristic and meta-heuristic optimization algorithms can be used for increasing yield of the material usage with 2D-RPAMP. The bottom-left (Jakobs, 1996), improved bottom-left (Liu & Teng, 1999) and no-fit polygon (F\u0131rat and Alpaslan, 2019, F\u0131rat et al., 2019) are examples of heuristic algorithms. The genetic algorithms (Thomas & Chaudhari, 2013), simulated annealing (Zhan, Lin, Zhang, & Zhong, 2016), tabu search (Wei, Oon, Zhu, & Lim, 2011), a new artificial bee colony (Topta\u015f & Hanbay, 2019), novel chaotic bat algorithm (Hong, Li, Geng, & Zhang, 2019), dragonfly algorithm (Pant, Han, & Wang, 2019; Z. Zhang & Hong, 2019) and particle swarm optimization (Guo et al., 2016, Kundra and Sadawarti, 2015) are the examples of meta-heuristic algorithms.\n\nThe bottom-left (BL) heuristic algorithm was proposed by Baker, Coffman, and Rivest (1980), and then Chazelle (1983). Jakobs (1996) proposed a genetic algorithm-based methodology to place polygons on a rectangular sheet. The first part is placed in the bottom-left corner of the main part, and parts are moved from the top-right corner of the main part to the bottom-left as far as possible. Hopper and Turton (2001b) investigated the strength of the various packing algorithms, such as simulated annealing (SA), genetic algorithm, naive evolution, hill climbing, and random search. It has been seen that the SA produces better solutions for the absolute majority of test cases. A rapid and novel heuristic recursive algorithm is proposed to find a minimum height is presented by D. Zhang, Kang, and Deng (2006). E. K. Burke, Kendall, and Whitwell (2004) and Edmund K. Burke, Kendall, and Whitwell (2009) demonstrated that by combining bottom-left-fill and simulated annealing algorithms with best-fit heuristic methods will increase the solution quality of packing process. A novel heuristic approach is proposed based on two essential concepts, which are named the corner-occupying action and caving degree by Huang, Chen, and Xu (2007). A novel heuristic recursive structure combined with branch-and-bound techniques based method is proposed by Cui, Yang, Cheng, and Song (2008). The effectiveness of the packing processes is evaluated according to a specific fitness function after the packing is performed with heuristic methods. In many RPAMP, height or trim loss is usually utilized as fitness value. It is quite challenging to find the right set of input parameters required for packing problems. Accordingly, it is known that meta-heuristic algorithms are sufficient to find the optimal solution with a smart search procedure (V...",

Abeysooriya, Julia A. Bennell, Antonio Martinez-Sykora\nSouthampton Business School, University of Southampton, UK\nAbstract\nThe paper investigates the two-dimensional irregular packing problem with\nmultiple homogeneous bins (2DIBPP). The literature on irregular shaped\npacking problems is dominated by the single stock sheet strip packing prob\u0002lem. However, in reality manufacturers are cutting orders over a multi-stock\nsheets. Despite its greater relevance, there are only a few papers that tackle\nthis problem in the literature. A multi-stock sheet problem has two decision\ncomponents; the allocation of pieces to stock sheets and the layout design for\neach stock sheet. In this paper, we propose a heuristic method that addresses\nboth the allocation and placement problems together based on the Jostle al\u0002gorithm. Jostle was first applied to strip packing. In order to apply Jostle\nto the bin packing problem we modify the placement heuristic. In addition\nwe improve the search capability by introducing a diversification mechanism\ninto the approach. Furthermore, the paper presents alternative strategies for\nhandling rotation of pieces, which includes a restricted set of angles and un\u0002restricted rotation. Very few authors permit unrestricted rotation of pieces,\ndespite this being a feature of many problems where the material is homoge\u0002neous. Finally, we investigate alternative placement criteria and show that\nInternational Journal of Production Economics\nthe most commonly applied bottom left criteria does not perform as well as\nother options. The paper evaluates performance of each algorithm using dif\u0002ferent sets of instances considering convex and non-convex shapes. Findings\nof this study reveal that the proposed algorithms can be applied to different\nvariants of the problem and generate significantly better results.\nKeywords:\nCutting and packing, heuristics, Irregular shapes, bin packing\n1. Introduction\nThe paper addresses the Two-Dimensional Bin Packing Problem where\nthe pieces may be any simple polygon; we denote it as the 2DIBPP. The prob\u0002lem arises in many industries where there is a requirement for irregular shape\npieces to be cut from multiple fixed dimension stock sheets such as metal,\nwood, paper and plastic. Despite the many real-life applications, the problem\nhas received relatively little attention in the literature when compared to the\nrectangle bin packing problem or the irregular shape strip packing problem.\nMoreover, most data instances for irregular packing problems restrict the\norientation of the pieces to one, two or four angles of orientation. However,\nmany types of material are homogeneous and pieces can be cut in any orien\u0002tation. Specifically, the paper describes a heuristic solution method for the\n2DIBPP where the stock sheets are homogeneous and a feasible solution is\nfound when all the pieces are packed within the bins with no overlap between\npieces. The objective is to minimize the total number of bins needed to cut\nall of the pieces.\nOur approach draws on the literature for irregular strip packing and ap\u00022\nplies these concepts to bin packing. Further the paper describes new features\nthat significantly enhance the performance of the algorithm and make it more\ngenerally applicable. The components of our approach include: a single-pass\nconstructive algorithm (CA) that constructs the bins, placement decisions\nthat allow either a finite set of rotation angles or free rotation of the pieces,\nand an improvement heuristic. The CA is based on TOPOS, which was orig\u0002inally proposed by Oliveira et al. (2000) and later improved by Bennell and\nSong (2010). Since the problem definition allows pieces to take any angle of\norientation, we develop placement rules that permit pieces to rotate either\nby a pre-defined finite set of orientations or any angle in the range of 0 to\n360 degrees. Finally, the improvement heuristic uses the principles of the\nJostle approach proposed by Dowsland et al. (1998) for strip packing. The\ncombination of Jostle and the CA means that the approach solves both the\nplacement and allocation problems together rather than considering them as\ntwo independent problems. Further improvements are made to the Jostle\nheuristic to enhance its ability to search the solution space including a kick\nto diversify away from local optima and a merge and split mechanism to\nretain profitable combinations of pieces.\nThe contribution of this paper is as follows. We are one of the few pa\u0002pers to consider multiple bins for packing irregular shapes, and the first to\ninclude the free rotation of the pieces. Hence, the contribution is to propose\nand solve a more general and more realistic problem for many industries.\nSecond, we introduce a new method for identifying promising rotations for\nthe pieces in the case when any angle is permitted. This is important because\nfree rotation implies an infinite neigbourhood, which can be sampled from\n3\nbut not exhaustively search. The final contribution is the development of\nan efficient heuristic adapted from the Jostle approach that is competitive\nacross all nesting benchmark data sets. In addition, we introduce a diversifi\u0002cation mechanism from local search to improve the performance of the Jostle\napproach.\nThe paper is organised as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of the\npublished work on irregular packing with multiple stock sheets. In Section 3,\nwe define the problem while introducing some notations used in the paper.\nSection 4 introduces our packing procedure. This includes the proposed CA\nand describes how we handle finite rotation, free rotation and hole-filling.\nSection 5 describes the implementation of the Jostle heuristic for the bin\npacking problem and considers its performance as a local search procedure.\nIn the same section, we propose an iterated Jostle approach and describe\nthree variants. We present the experimental design and the computational\nresults in Section 6. This includes results of experiments we use to improve\nthe performance of the algorithms and the results we achieved for existing\nbenchmark problems. Section 7, discusses our conclusions from the research.\n2. Literature Review\nIn this section we provide a brief overview of the literature. Note that\nthere is very little literature on this specific problem, while there is exten\u0002sive literature on t...",

It adopts two neighborhoods, swapping two given polygons in a placement and placing one polygon into a new position. The local search algorithm is used to minimize the overlap on the basis of the neighborhoods mentioned above and the unconstrained[nonlinear programming](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/nonlinear-programming)model is adopted to further minimize the overlap during the search process. Moreover, the[tabu](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/tabu)search algorithm is used to avoid[local minima](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/local-minimum), and a compact algorithm is presented to improve the result. The results of standard test instances indicate that when compared with other existing algorithms, the presented algorithm does not only show some signs of competitive power but also updates several best known results.\n## Introduction\nThe irregular strip packing problem, also known as the nesting problem, has a wide area of applications. Given a set of irregular shapes and a rectangular strip with a fixed width and an arbitrary length, the target of the two-dimensional irregular strip packing problem is to place all shapes within the strip such that the length of the strip is minimized and the irregular shapes do not overlap. A classic example application is clothing industry. Several pieces of clothes will be cut from a roll of fabric and the objective is to minimize the waste of fabric. The fabric has a fixed width and its length can be generally assumed infinite; so the problem is to minimize the length required for producing the specified number of irregular shapes.\nThe irregular strip packing problem is a NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem [1]. Numerous papers on nesting problem have been published since the first paper by Art [2]. Meta-heuristics are often used to solve this problem. Hopper and Turton [3] reviewed these methods, and a summary of geometric methods was published by Bennell and Oliveira [4]. As research progressed, further breakthroughs in algorithms for this problem have achieved in recent years. When compared with the previous years, these solutions have markedly improved the effect and speed of nesting results. The typical methods include Burke et al. [5], Gomes and Oliveira [6], Egeblad et al. [7], Imamichi et al. [8], etc.\nAlbano and Sapuppo [9] proposed an algorithm that places each shape at the bottom-left position, and the sequence of places is obtained by tree search. Jakobs [10] proposed a two-stage solution which first generates the rectangular enclosure of each irregular shape, and then finds the placement for these enclosures through a genetic algorithm. Secondly, a shrinking algorithm moves the shapes to another one as close as possible using the idea of the bottom-left heuristic. Gomes and Oliveira [11] based on bottom-left heuristic and find a good placement by exchanging two shapes in the layout. Dowsland et al. [12] developed a compact algorithm to improve the bottom-left heuristic algorithm. The algorithm first gets the initial placement by the bottom-left heuristic, and then uses a shaking process to compact the placement. Burke et al. [5] presented a new bottom-left heuristic algorithm based on discretization, and combination with hill climbing or tabu search to get a high quality solution. This algorithm can also pack the shapes with circular arcs and holes. Egeblad et al. [7] proposed an efficient fast local search method whose neighborhood is any horizontal or vertical translation of a given shape. They also formulated a polynomial time algorithm to find a translation with minimum overlap area between the given polygon and the other polygons in the current placement. Gomes and Oliveira [6] presented a separation algorithm to locally optimize the placement based on linear programming models, and used simulated annealing to guide the search. A new separation algorithm based on unconstrained nonlinear programming is proposed by Imamichi et al. [8]. They also designed an algorithm that swaps two polygons in a placement, and then the algorithms are combined as a component into an iterated local search algorithm for the overlap minimization problem. This method yielded several best known results on the standard test instances. Our algorithm is based on a separation algorithm presented by Imamichi et al. [8], and local search is adopted to guide the search. Moreover, a tabu search algorithm is used to avoid local minima and a compacted algorithm is used to improve the packing results.\n## Section snippets\n## Formulation\nIn this section, some fundamental elements of geometry are first defined, before formulation of the irregular strip packing problem algorithm is given.\n**Definition 1 (point)**\nA point*p*in two-dimensional space is represented by a pair:p=(px,py)\u2208R2.\n**Definition 2 (line segment)**\nA line segment*s*is a point set defined by two endpoints*p**a*and*p**b*:s={p\u2208R2,t\u2208[0,1]|p=pa+t(pb\u2212pa)}.\n**Definition 3 (polygon)**\nA polygon is a plane figure bounded by a closed path composes of a finite sequence of line segments denoted by*S*.

The four corners\u2019 (FC) heuristic is specifically designed to increase the search efficiency of EAs. Experiments with the FC heuristic are conducted on 31 problems from the literature both with rotations permitted and without rotations permitted, using two different EA algorithms: a self-adaptive parallel recombinative simulated annealing (PRSA) algorithm, and a self-adaptive genetic algorithm (GA). Results on bin packing problems yield the smallest trim losses we have seen in the published literature; with the FC heuristic, zero trim loss was achieved on problems of up to 97 rectangles. A comparison of the self-adaptive GA to fixed-parameter GAs is presented and the benefits of self-adaption are highlighted.\n\n## Introduction\n\nTwo-dimensional (2D) packing problems occur in a wide range of industries. The goal is simply the optimal utilization of space or material available. In the garment and paper industries the problem is often to cut smaller pieces from a large roll of cloth or paper while reducing the scrap. In the wood, glass, and metal industries the task is not to cut from a roll, but to cut from a fixed size sheet or plate. In the semiconductor industry the task is VLSI floor planning with the goal being to optimize the use of space on the chip.\n\nThere are two major variants of the 2D packing problem: bin packing and strip packing. In the 2D bin packing variant, rectangles are to be packed in bins of given width and height, the goal being to minimize the number of bins used. In the 2D strip packing variant, rectangles must be packed in a fixed width, infinite height strip, the goal being to minimize the height. The bin packing variant is most suitable for the wood, glass, metal, and semiconductor industries, while the strip packing variant will generally apply to the paper and garment industries.\n\nAn important consideration is whether or not the rectangles can be rotated as they are placed. In the wood and garment industries one may care about the grain of the material and rotations may not be permitted. While in the paper, glass, and semiconductor industries there may be no particular restrictions. Allowing rotations adds flexibility and can result in a better packing, while at the same time apparently complicating the task.\n\nGiven the many permutations of 2D packing problems, most research focuses on a particular type of the packing problem: either bin packing or strip packing, with or without rotations. A recent survey of 2D packing problems is given by Lodi et al. (2002). A typology of cutting and packing problems is defined in W\u00e4scher et al. (2006).\n\nBeing NP-hard, the 2D packing problems are an attractive challenge for evolutionary algorithms (EA). For application to strip packing problems, Jakobs (1996) developed a genetic algorithm (GA) using the bottom-left (BL) packing method with support for rotation of rectangles. Hopper and Turton (2001) provide a comprehensive comparison of GA, simulated annealing (SA), na\u00efve evolution, and simple hill-climbing for the strip packing problem with rotations and for various BL methods. A recent paper by Lesh et al. (2004) gives a method to find strip packing solutions using an exact branch and bounds exhaustive search. They successfully find perfect packings (zero trim loss) for problem sizes up to 30 rectangles. In regards to bin packing problems, Babu and Babu (1999) use a GA and a BL packing heuristic. Recently, Leung et al. (2003) developed a mixed simulated annealing-genetic algorithm.\n\nIn this paper, we design the four corners\u2019 (FC) packing heuristic with the aim to increase the search efficiency of EAs when applied to bin packing problems. By the nature of the FC heuristic, the packings produced are non-guillotineable and bottom-left stability is not preserved. In this research we study only orthogonal packing problems, consisting of one bin with the goal to seek minimum trim loss. In the typology of cutting and packing problems as defined by W\u00e4scher et al. (2006), we deal with a two-dimensional, output maximization problem: we have one large rectangle of fixed dimensions, into which the value of the placed smaller rectangles (assumed proportional to area of the rectangle) must be maximized. The smaller rectangles are strongly heterogeneous and must be laid out orthogonally. Specifically, we study the two-dimensional single orthogonal knapsack problem.\n\nThe FC heuristic is tested with two different self-adapting EAs: a self-adapting parallel recombinative simulated annealing (PRSA) algorithm and a self-adapting GA. The results are presented both with and without support for rotations. The FC heuristic combined with the self-adapting PRSA algorithm is found to produce tighter packings than any of the methods we have seen published in the literature.\n\nThis paper is outlined as follows. In Section 2, an analysis on how EAs work on packing problems is performed and the EA-friendly four corners\u2019 packing heuristic is introduced. In Section 3, a detailed description of the EA components developed in this study is given. Section 4 describes details of the PRSA implementation. Section 5 describes the GA implementation. The remaining sections cover the experimental settings, results, and conclusions.\n\n## Section snippets\n\n## Designing the four corners\u2019 heuristic\n\nIn this section, we analyze how EAs commonly function on packing problems and propose a four corners\u2019 heuristic designed specifically for EAs. GAs are chosen as the representative EA for this discussion, however most of the principles apply in general to the many types of EAs. For example, SA can be implemented using the genome encoding and the mutation operators of a GA. An implementation of PRSA (see Section 4) could use both the mutation and crossover operators of a GA as is done in this\n\n## Common components of a self-adapting evolutionary algorithm\n\nThe PRSA and GA algorithms implemented in this paper share the genome structure, the crossover operators, mutation operators, and the fitness function.\n\n## Self-adaptive parallel recombinative simulate...",

An efficient 2D irregular packing algorithm can effectively improve material utilization and reduce processing costs. The reduction in material consumption will also have a beneficial impact on the environment ([Ke et al., 2020](#B76)). Therefore, research of the packing problem is of great significance for technology and social interest.\nThe 2D packing problem is a type of combinatorial optimization problems to locate parts with different shapes compactly in one or more master sheet material to minimize the occupied space or maximize the utilization of the material. The 2D packing problem is currently recognized as a NP problem, which is mainly solved by heuristic algorithms. In recent years, many scholars have conducted research on 2D irregular packing problems with a verity of solutions.\nThere exists a number of review articles on packing and cutting problems. We have summarized the main review literature in the field of 2D packing and cutting as shown in[Table 1](#T1). Brown ([Brown, 1971](#B17)) introduced an optimum packing and depletion problem with optimization of space and resource usage. Harvey ([Salkin and De Kluyver, 1975](#B116)) surveyed the application of mathematical optimization models such as linear programming to the knapsack problem. Bruce ([Golden, 1976](#B50)) surveyed various approaches to the cutting stock problem. Hinxman ([Hinxman, 1980](#B65)) surveyed the trim-loss and assortment problems, this research paid more attention to cutting and packaging problems in practical applications, and did not mention much about theoretical methods. Garey and Coffman ([Garey and Johnson, 1981](#B47);[Coffman et al., 1984](#B27)) surveyed the approximation algorithms for bin packing problems. Israni ([Israni and Sanders, 1982](#B72)) reviewed the 2D cutting stock problem including almost all 2D packaging problems. The author also proposed a rectangular layout method. Sarin ([Sarin, 1983](#B118)) reviewed methodologies and literature to solve 2D stock cutting problems and introduced an interactive optimization procedure for a general 2D stock cutting problem. Dyckhoff ([Dyckhoff et al., 1985](#B38)) described a trim loss and related problems and categorized them briefly. Dudzi&#x00144;ski ([Dudzi&#x00144;ski and Walukiewicz, 1987](#B36)) summarized the exact methods for knapsack problems, such as linear programming. Matthias ([Rode and Rosenberg, 1987](#B114)) analyzed the algorithm for the trim-loss problems. Haessler ([Haessler and Sweeney, 1991](#B59)) reviewed the solution process of cutting stock problems, including placement algorithm and sequence optimization algorithm. Dowsland ([Dowsland and Dowsland, 1992](#B34)) reviewed the application of operations research methods to the packing problem and summarized some exact heuristics. Sweeney ([Sweeney and Paternoster, 1992](#B128)) categorized cutting and packing problems and made application-oriented research records. Cheng ([Cheng et al., 1994](#B22)) discussed 2D cutting stock problems and their application cases including the pallet loading problem and VLSI placement problem. With the gradual deepening of research on 2D layout problems, typology becomes a common research topic. 2D regular and irregular layout problems are clearly distinguished in practical applications and theoretical methods. Dowsland ([Dowsland and Dowsland, 1995](#B29)) gave a special review of the 2D irregular nesting problem for the first time. Mavridou ([Mavridou and Pardalos, 1997](#B98)) summarized applications of the genetic algorithm and simulated annealing algorithm in the optimization of facility layout problems. Dyckhoff ([Dyckhoff, 1990](#B37)) made a typology of the cutting and packing problems in detail, and W&#x000e4;scher ([W&#x000e4;scher et al., 2007](#B135)) improved the typology later. Hopper ([Hopper and Turton, 1999](#B67);[Hopper and Turton, 2001a](#B68);[Hopper and Turton, 2001b](#B69)) investigated the application of meta-heuristic and heuristic algorithms in 2D and 3D packing problems. Lodi ([Lodi et al., 2002a](#B90);[Lodi et al., 2002b](#B91)) reviewed algorithms proposed in the 1990s of 2D packing problems. Bennell et al. ([Bennell and Oliveira, 2008](#B10);[Bennell and Oliveira, 2009](#B9)) discussed 2D irregular packing problems and related geometric problems. Leao ([Leao et al., 2020](#B81)) introduced the mathematical models in the 2D irregular packing problem.\nTABLE 1\n[![www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/966691/fmech-08-966691-HTML/image_m/fmech-08-966691-t001.jpg)](https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/966691/fmech-08-966691-HTML/image_m/fmech-08-966691-t001.jpg)\n**TABLE 1**.

The MPP problem involves a\nconvex polygonal container C and a polygon set P = {p1, p2, ..., pN }, where polygon piis\nassociated with a value vi. It seeks for a non-overlapping packing with the maximum total\nvalue. The challenge presents a total of 180 instances whose number of polygons ranges from\n28 to 50,000. The official document [4] gives a detailed description of the challenge.\nOur proposed algorithm employs a general process to solve these instances indiscriminately,\nand the overall framework is presented in Figure 1. We first partition a large-scale problem\ninto multiple small-scale subproblems (Section 2) and then solve each subproblem using\nupper-level polygon ordering (Section 3.1) and lower-level packing optimization techniques\n(Section 3.2). Section 4 presents our experimental results, followed by conclusions.\n1 Corresponding author: Zhouxing Su\n\u00a9 Canhui Luo, Zhouxing Su, and Zhipeng L\u00fc;\nlicensed under Creative Commons License CC-BY 4.0\n40th International Symposium on Computational Geometry (SoCG 2024).\nEditors: Wolfgang Mulzer and Jeff M.

It involves two components: partitioning the container C into\nmultiple regions and assigning polygons to each region.\n2.1 Container Partitioning\nThe container partitioning process consists of two steps, as shown in Figure 2. Initially, we\narrange two-dimensional square grids starting from the bottom-left corner of the bounding\nbox until the entire container is covered. The subregions formed by the intersection of the\ncontainer with all the grids constitute its partition C = C1 \u222a C2 \u222a ... \u222a Cm. Subsequently,\nwe merge the small subregions with adjacent grids, which are difficult to be used effectively.\nThe grid is dimensioned to keep the scale of each subproblem at approximately 300 polygons,\nmaking a trade-off between effectiveness and efficiency of lower-level packing optimization.\n2.2 Polygon Assignment\nWe adopt a simple approach of randomly assigning polygons to each subregion. Specifically, for\neach subregion Ci, we randomly select a polygon pj from P until\nP\nj\narea(pj )\narea(Ci) \u2265\nPN\ni=0\narea(pi)\narea(C)\n.\nThe advantage of random assignment lies in ensuring that the overall characteristics of each\nsubproblem align with the original problem.\nC.

We repeatedly select one remaining polygon with the\nhighest priority (ties are broken by value) and try to insert it into the current solution. If the\ninsertion with lower-level packing optimization fails, we skip the current polygon and turn to\nthe next one. For the majority of instances, the priority is defined as the value-to-area ratio\nof a polygon (we also call it unit value). Polygons with higher unit values are prioritized\nfor putting in the container, which is called the Unit Value First (UVF) strategy. For\nsmall-scale instances (N < 100), we employ the \u03b1\u03b2-random strategy. It randomly selects\n\u03b1% and \u03b2% of the polygons and reassigns their UVF-based priority to the highest and the\nlowest, respectively. These instances are run for multiple times to ensure comprehensive\noptimization, with \u03b1 and \u03b2 set to 10 in our implementation.\n3.2 Lower-Level Packing Optimization\nThe position of a polygon can be represented by the coordinates l = (x, y) of a reference point,\nsuch as the bottom-left corner of the boundary. Then, the translation of a polygon can be\nrepresented by a vector pointing from its original position to its new position. Given a feasible\npacking S and a polygon p to be placed, it is impossible to find a non-overlapping position\nfor p without moving other polygons in most cases. This section introduces the algorithm for\neliminating overlaps for an invalid packing, which involves solving an unconstrained nonlinear\nproblem and heuristic polygon movement.\nS o C G 2 0 2 4\n86:4 A General Heuristic Approach for Maximum Polygon Packing\n3.2.1 Overlap Minimization\nTo determine the appropriate translation for the polygons, we utilized the no-fit polygon\n(NFP) and inner-fit polygon (IFP), which are fundamental in algorithmic approaches to\ngeometric design and optimization challenges. For a fixed polygon pi and a movable polygon\npj , NFP(pi, pj ) describes their non-overlapping positions with boundaries in contact precisely,\nwhich can be utilized to determine the minimum translation for pj to avoid overlap. Similarly,\nIFP(pi, pj ) is employed to determine the minimum translation to place pj inside pi. Figure 3\nillustrates the polygon translations determined using NFP (left) and IFP (right). The readers\nmay refer to Burke et al. [2] for a more detailed description.\nFor a packing S, based on NFP and IFP, we define the overlap between polygons pi\nand pj as fij (S), representing the minimum translation to separate them, and f0i(S) as the\nminimum translation for moving pi to fit into the container. Subsequently, we employ the\nseparation algorithm proposed by Imamichi et al. [7] to minimize the overlap, which involves\nsolving an unconstrained nonlinear programming problem as follows:\nmin\nS\nF(S) = X\n0\u2264i<j\u2264N\nf\n2\nij (S) (1)\nThe model relaxes the non-overlapping constraint but introduces repulsion forces between\nany two overlapped polygons. We use the classic L-BFGS (limited memory BFGS) method\nto solve this problem. It makes the packing S converge to a local optimum but strongly\ndepends on the initial layout. ...",
