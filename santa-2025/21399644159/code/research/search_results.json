      "text": "Beyond local optima when using simulated annealing and genetic algorithms for 2D polygon packing, several advanced techniques can improve solution quality. One effective approach is integrating **self-adaptive evolutionary algorithms** with heuristics such as the four corners\u2019 heuristic, which dynamically adjusts parameters during the search process to escape stagnation ([Hopper, 2007](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0377221706003018)). Additionally, **adaptive neighborhood search methods** have proven successful; for example, applying adaptive neighborhood structures within simulated annealing can help explore the solution space more thoroughly and avoid premature convergence ([Bohachevsky et al., 2008](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S147466701535549X)). \n\nAnother promising technique is employing **multi-level or hierarchical algorithms**, such as combining local search heuristics with collision-free region algorithms or collision detection strategies, which can efficiently navigate complex solution landscapes ([Martins & Tsuzuki, 2008](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S147466701535549X); [Abeysooriya et al., 2017](https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/415314/1/ICCL17_paper_43.pdf)). Furthermore, hybrid methods that combine simulated annealing or genetic algorithms with **hyper-heuristics** or **metaheuristic frameworks** can adaptively select or tune heuristics during the search, leading to better escape from local optima ([Lopez-Camacho et al., 2014](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2014.04.043)). \n\nIn summary, techniques such as self-adaptation, adaptive neighborhood search, hierarchical hybrid algorithms, and hyper-heuristic frameworks are among the most effective strategies for escaping local optima in 2D polygon packing problems beyond traditional simulated annealing and genetic algorithms ([Hopper, 2007](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0377221706003018); [Bohachevsky et al., 2008](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S147466701535549X)).",

The four corners\u2019 (FC) heuristic is specifically designed to increase the search efficiency of EAs. Experiments with the FC heuristic are conducted on 31 problems from the literature both with rotations permitted and without rotations permitted, using two different EA algorithms: a self-adaptive parallel recombinative simulated annealing (PRSA) algorithm, and a self-adaptive genetic algorithm (GA). Results on bin packing problems yield the smallest trim losses we have seen in the published literature; with the FC heuristic, zero trim loss was achieved on problems of up to 97 rectangles. A comparison of the self-adaptive GA to fixed-parameter GAs is presented and the benefits of self-adaption are highlighted.\n\n## Introduction\n\nTwo-dimensional (2D) packing problems occur in a wide range of industries. The goal is simply the optimal utilization of space or material available. In the garment and paper industries the problem is often to cut smaller pieces from a large roll of cloth or paper while reducing the scrap. In the wood, glass, and metal industries the task is not to cut from a roll, but to cut from a fixed size sheet or plate. In the semiconductor industry the task is VLSI floor planning with the goal being to optimize the use of space on the chip.\n\nThere are two major variants of the 2D packing problem: bin packing and strip packing. In the 2D bin packing variant, rectangles are to be packed in bins of given width and height, the goal being to minimize the number of bins used. In the 2D strip packing variant, rectangles must be packed in a fixed width, infinite height strip, the goal being to minimize the height. The bin packing variant is most suitable for the wood, glass, metal, and semiconductor industries, while the strip packing variant will generally apply to the paper and garment industries.\n\nAn important consideration is whether or not the rectangles can be rotated as they are placed. In the wood and garment industries one may care about the grain of the material and rotations may not be permitted. While in the paper, glass, and semiconductor industries there may be no particular restrictions. Allowing rotations adds flexibility and can result in a better packing, while at the same time apparently complicating the task.\n\nGiven the many permutations of 2D packing problems, most research focuses on a particular type of the packing problem: either bin packing or strip packing, with or without rotations. A recent survey of 2D packing problems is given by Lodi et al. (2002). A typology of cutting and packing problems is defined in W\u00e4scher et al. (2006).\n\nBeing NP-hard, the 2D packing problems are an attractive challenge for evolutionary algorithms (EA). For application to strip packing problems, Jakobs (1996) developed a genetic algorithm (GA) using the bottom-left (BL) packing method with support for rotation of rectangles. Hopper and Turton (2001) provide a comprehensive comparison of GA, simulated annealing (SA), na\u00efve evolution, and simple hill-climbing for the strip packing problem with rotations and for various BL methods. A recent paper by Lesh et al. (2004) gives a method to find strip packing solutions using an exact branch and bounds exhaustive search. They successfully find perfect packings (zero trim loss) for problem sizes up to 30 rectangles. In regards to bin packing problems, Babu and Babu (1999) use a GA and a BL packing heuristic. Recently, Leung et al. (2003) developed a mixed simulated annealing-genetic algorithm.\n\nIn this paper, we design the four corners\u2019 (FC) packing heuristic with the aim to increase the search efficiency of EAs when applied to bin packing problems. By the nature of the FC heuristic, the packings produced are non-guillotineable and bottom-left stability is not preserved. In this research we study only orthogonal packing problems, consisting of one bin with the goal to seek minimum trim loss. In the typology of cutting and packing problems as defined by W\u00e4scher et al. (2006), we deal with a two-dimensional, output maximization problem: we have one large rectangle of fixed dimensions, into which the value of the placed smaller rectangles (assumed proportional to area of the rectangle) must be maximized. The smaller rectangles are strongly heterogeneous and must be laid out orthogonally. Specifically, we study the two-dimensional single orthogonal knapsack problem.\n\nThe FC heuristic is tested with two different self-adapting EAs: a self-adapting parallel recombinative simulated annealing (PRSA) algorithm and a self-adapting GA. The results are presented both with and without support for rotations. The FC heuristic combined with the self-adapting PRSA algorithm is found to produce tighter packings than any of the methods we have seen published in the literature.\n\nThis paper is outlined as follows. In Section 2, an analysis on how EAs work on packing problems is performed and the EA-friendly four corners\u2019 packing heuristic is introduced. In Section 3, a detailed description of the EA components developed in this study is given. Section 4 describes details of the PRSA implementation. Section 5 describes the GA implementation. The remaining sections cover the experimental settings, results, and conclusions.\n\n## Section snippets\n\n## Designing the four corners\u2019 heuristic\n\nIn this section, we analyze how EAs commonly function on packing problems and propose a four corners\u2019 heuristic designed specifically for EAs. GAs are chosen as the representative EA for this discussion, however most of the principles apply in general to the many types of EAs. For example, SA can be implemented using the genome encoding and the mutation operators of a GA. An implementation of PRSA (see Section 4) could use both the mutation and crossover operators of a GA as is done in this\n\n## Common components of a self-adapting evolutionary algorithm\n\nThe PRSA and GA algorithms implemented in this paper share the genome structure, the crossover operators, mutation operators, and the fitness function.\n\n## Self-adaptive parallel recombinative simulate...",

This problem is approached with an heuristic based on Simulated Annealing (SA) with adaptive neighborhood. Traditional \u201cexternal penalization\u201d techniques are avoided through the application of the no\u2013fit polygon, that determinates the collision-free area for each polygon before its placement. The SA controls continuous and discrete parameters. The rotation applied and the translation of the polygon are continuous parameters, and the sequence of placement is represented as a set of discrete parameters. For each non\u2013placed item, a limited depth binary search is performed to find a scale factor that when applied to the item, would allow it to be fitted in the container.\n\n- [Previous article in issue](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1474667015355488)\n- [Next article in issue](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1474667015355506)\n\n## Keywords\n\nSimulated Annealing\n\nPlacement Problems\n\nOptimization\n\nProbabilistic Heuristics\n\n[View PDF](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S147466701535549X/pdf?md5=7bca88c33d2daef044751913b4156e2b&pid=1-s2.0-S147466701535549X-main.pdf)\n\nSpecial issue articlesRecommended articles\n\n## References\n\n01.

      "text": "Efficient Local Search Heuristics for Packing\nIrregular Shapes in Two-Dimensional\nHeterogeneous Bins\nRanga P. Abeysooriya1, Julia A. Bennell1, and Antonio Martinez-Sykora1\nBusiness School, University of Southampton, SO17 1BJ, Southampton, UK\nAbstract. In this paper we proposed a local search heuristic and a ge\u0002netic algorithm to solve the two-dimensional irregular multiple bin-size\nbin packing problem. The problem consists of placing a set of pieces rep\u0002resented as 2D polygons in rectangular bins with different dimensions\nsuch that the total area of bins used is minimized. Most packing algo\u0002rithms available in the literature for 2D irregular bin packing consider\nsingle size bins only. However, for many industries the material can be\nsupplied in a number of standard size sheets, for example, metal, foam,\nplastic and timber sheets. For this problem, the cut plans must decide\nthe set of standard size stock sheets as well as which pieces to cut from\neach bin and how to arrange them in order to minimise waste material.\nMoreover, the literature constrains the orientation of pieces to a single\nor finite set of angles. This is often an artificial constraint that makes\nthe solution space easier to navigate. In this paper we do not restrict\nthe orientation of the pieces. We show that the local search heuristic and\nthe genetic algorithm can address all of these decisions and obtain good\nsolutions, with the local search performing better. We also discuss the\naffect of different groups of stock sheet sizes.\nKeywords: Irregular shapes, Multiple bin size bin packing, Jostle Al\u0002gorithm\n1 Introduction\nThe two dimensional bin packing problem consists of placing a set of pieces,\nusually represented as rectangles or polygons, in one or several stock sheets\n(bins) in such a way the total waste generated is minimized. This problem arises\nin several industries where metal, foam, wood, plastic, paper or leather need to\nbe cut. Depending on the industrial application this problem has several variants\ndescribed by the properties of both the pieces to be placed and the bins. In this\npaper we address the problem where the pieces to be cut are irregular and may\nhave concavities. Pieces can be placed in any orientation within rectangular bins\nthat have a variety of different dimensions (heterogeneous bin sizes). We assume\nthat there are a limited number of bin types and there are enough bins of each\ntype to place all the demanded pieces in any set of bins. In this paper we denote\nthis problem as the two-dimensional irregular shape multiple bin size bin packing\nproblem (2D-IMBSBPP) and propose a local search heuristic, called jostle, and\na genetic algorithm to find efficient solutions.\nMost of the publications in the literature that consider heterogeneous bins\nare focused on packing rectangular pieces. Pisinger and Sigurad [19] consider a\nvariable bin cost when solving this problem. They propose a MILP model which\nis then solved by column generation. The model is intractable for large instances\nand difficult to solve even for small instances. Ortmann et al. [18] propose a\ntwo-phase approach. During the first phase they use first-fit decreasing with the\nlargest bins first. A second phase repacks bins into smaller bins. The two phase\nalgorithm is implemented with different bin sizes and aims to minimise the total\narea of the occupied bins. Wei et al. [21] propose a tabu search that uses a\nsequential packing heuristic, a local search, and a post-improvement procedure\nto reduce the total area of used bins in a feasible solution. Alvarez-Valdes et\nal. [2] implement meta-heuristic algorithms with variable bin costs which are\nnot proportional to the size of the bin. The objective is to minimize the cost of\nthe occupied bins, and the authors employ a greedy randomized adaptive search\nprocedure with path re-linking strategies to combine the best solutions obtained\nin the iterative process. In order to compare their results with Ortmann et al.\n[18]\u2019s, they modify the objective function to maximize the overall utilization of\nthe occupied bins.\nThe vast majority of research publications considering the packing of 2D\nirregular shapes address the 2D strip packing problem, also known as the nesting\nproblem. Instead of placing pieces into bins the aim is to place all the pieces into\na strip with fixed width and infinite length in such a way the total required length\nis minimized. However, recent publications of packing algorithms for irregular\npieces consider the bin packing problem with homogeneous bins, see [14], [20],\n[16] and [1]. However, in many situations bins are readily available to purchase\nas rectangular sheets in different standard sizes. In these industries companies\nusually handle several bin sizes in order to satisfy customer demand. The aim of\nthe companies is not only to reduce the waste generated in the cutting process,\nbut also charge a competitive price to the customers, which usually depends on\nthe area of material needed to meet the demand. There are several publications\nconsidering heterogeneous irregular bins, see [4] and [5], who solve an applied\nproblem which arises in the leather industry. In these publications the pieces\nare approximated by grid squares or pixels rather than polygons. While this\nsimplifies the geometry, solutions suffer from inaccuracy in shape representation.\nIt is important to highlight that in this paper we use the direct representa\u0002tions of the pieces as polygons and do not restrict the rotation of pieces to a\npredefined set of angles. Han et al. [13] and Martinez-Sykora et al. [15] considered\nfree rotation for the 2D irregular bin packing problem with guillotine cuts, solving\nan application derived from the glass industry. More recently, Martinez-Sykora\net al. [16] and Abeysooriya et al. [1] considered free rotation for the problem with\nhomogeneous bins and also report results with restricted and fixed rotations. For\ncomparison purposes, we also address the problem where a finite set of rotations\nare allowed.\nThe main contribution of this paper is to efficiently solve the 2D-IMBSBPP\nconsidering continuous rotation of pieces by using an adaptation of the jostle\nprocedure. Jostle was first proposed by Dowsland et al. [10] for the strip packing\nproblem and then used in [1] in bin packing problems with homogeneous bins.\nOne of the most important properties of the jostle procedure is that it explores\nefficient solutions with a relatively low computational effort, compared with other\navailable algorithms. The jostle procedure works over the sequence of pieces that\nrepresents the order pieces are inserted in the layout.

The major motivation for applying a modified genetic algorithm is as an attempt to alleviate the problem of pre-mature convergence. We found that in the long run, the mixed heuristic produces better results; while the pure heuristic produces only \u201cgood\u201d results, but produces them faster.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe two-dimensional orthogonal packing problem consists of packing rectangular pieces of predetermined sizes into a large but finite rectangular plate (the _stock plate_), or equivalently, cutting small rectangular pieces from the large rectangular plate. We wish to find \u201cpacking patterns\u201d that minimize the unused area ( _trim loss_). The problem has obvious relevancy to the textile, paper, and other industries, and in the three-dimensional case, is related to the problem of packing boxes into a container.\n\nThe problem has been formulated as an integer program. For that approach and variations, see Beasley (1985), Tsai (1993) or Christofides (1995). Recently, different meta-heuristics have been applied to problems of this kind, for instance, see Parada et al. (1998), Lai and Chan (1997), Jakobs (1996), Glover et al. (1995), Dowsland, 1993, Dowsland, 1996. For an introduction to meta-heuristics, see Osman and Laporte (1996). Based on the papers of Jakobs (1996), also Lai and Chan (1997), we have carried out extensive comparisons of these heuristics (Leung et al., 2000). An important building block in any area of research is a valid comparison among the different theories or models that were proposed in the field. Such a comparison is missing in the area of meta-heuristics for the two-dimensional orthogonal packing problem.\n\nIn our investigation, we found that the pure genetic algorithm meta-heuristic usually produces good results. Nevertheless, we also found that this heuristic converges very fast; thus, good results were produced at early stages. That is, while good, these results are improvable if what we call \u201cpre-mature convergence\u201d can be avoided. For this purpose, we employ a mixed meta-heuristic and test its performance.\n\n## Section snippets\n\n## Methodology\n\nA packing pattern may be represented by a permutation, which corresponds to the sequence in which the small rectangles are packed. Other representations may be found in Beasley (1985) or Dowsland, 1993, Dowsland, 1996. In this paper we concentrate on the permutation representation. Now if we have a permutation, we know the order of packing the small pieces, but we may still consider different strategies for packing the pieces. In Jakobs\u2019s (1996) paper, the problem of packing rectangular pieces\n\n## The difference process strategy\n\nIn the difference process strategy, while trying to pack a new piece, the \u201cempty spaces\u201d are considered. In short, a space is a rectangular area of largest possible size, with sides parallel to the stock plate, which is not yet occupied by any rectangular pieces. One may observe that in the packing process, there are only finitely many spaces. At the very beginning, there is only one space and its bottom left corner is precisely at the origin. After the first piece is packed, there are\n\n## Genetic search algorithm\n\nA genetic search algorithm is a heuristic search process that resembles natural selection. There are many variations and refinements, but any genetic algorithm has the features of reproduction, crossover and mutation. Initially a population is selected, and by means of crossovers among members of the population or mutations of members, the better of the population will remain, because of the \u201csurvival of the fittest\u201d. This idea was first proposed by Holland (1975), among others. For its many\n\n## Simulated annealing and genetic algorithms\n\nAfter many reported experiments in the literature, genetic algorithms have been found to be efficient and robust. In addition, it is usually straightforward to encode a problem suitable for application of genetic algorithms. Nevertheless, genetic algorithms also have their shortcomings. In fact, if the worst members are discarded after each generation, the population will tend to quickly become homogeneous. If the mutation probability is small then chromosomes of large variation in fitness may\n\n## Experimental results\n\nWe have altogether 19 test problems. The first eight problems came from Lai and Chan (1997) and Jakobs (1996). The 9th and the 10th problems were our own constructions. They all have a known optimal solution of zero trim loss, so that the absolute performances of the various algorithms can be determined. The number of rectangular pieces in each stock plate ranges from 10 to 50. The data sets for these 10 problems are given in Table 1, Table 2, Table 3, Table 4, Table 5, Table 6, Table 7, Table 8\n\n## Final remarks\n\nTheoretically, we can tune the cooling process and the iteration numbers of a SA to achieve the global optimum (Mahfoud and Goldberg, 1995). Nevertheless, this implies that longer times may be required to achieve optimal or good solutions. Moreover, the serial nature of SA prevents us from employing parallelism. On the other hand, though GA exhibits implicit parallelism it is not easy to control the GA\u2019s convergence. Formally, there is also no proof of its global convergence.

It is based on a simple local search scheme in which the neighborhood is any horizontal or vertical translation of a given polygon from its current position. To escape local minima we apply the meta-heuristic method*Guided Local Search*.\nThe strength of our solution method comes from a new algorithm which is capable of searching the neighborhood in polynomial time. More precisely, given a single polygon with*m*edges and a set of polygons with*n*edges the algorithm can find a translation with minimum overlap in time O(*mn*log(*mn*)). Solutions for standard test instances are generated by an implementation and a comparison is done with recent results from the literature. The solution method is very robust and most of the best solutions found are also the currently best results published.\nOur approach to the problem is*very*flexible regarding problem variations and special constraints, and as an example we describe how it can handle materials with quality regions.\nFinally, we generalize the algorithm for the fast neighborhood search and present a solution method for three-dimensional nesting problems.\n## Introduction\nNesting is a term used for many related problems. The most common problem is strip-packing where a number of irregular shapes must be placed within a rectangular strip such that the strip-length is minimized and no shapes overlap. The clothing industry is a classical example of an application for this problem. Normally, pieces of clothes are cut from a roll of fabric. A high utilization is desirable and it requires that as little of the roll is used as possible. The width of the roll is fixed, hence the problem is to minimize the length of the fabric. Other nesting problem variations exist, but in the following the focus is on the strip-packing variant. Using the typology of W\u00e4scher et al. (2006) this is a two-dimensional irregular open dimension problem (ODP).\nIn the textile industry the shapes of the pieces of clothes are usually referred to as*markers*or*stencils*. In the following we will use the latter term except when the pieces need to be defined more precisely e.g. as polygons.\nIn order to state the problem formally we first define the associated decision problem:\n**Nesting Decision Problem**\nGiven a set of stencilsSand a piece of material, position the stencilsSsuch that\n* \u2022No pair of stencils overlap.\n* \u2022All stencils are contained within the boundaries of the material.\nThe strip-packing variant can now be stated as\n**Strip Nesting Problem**\nGiven a set of stencilsSand a strip (the material) with width*w*find the minimal length*l*for which the Nesting Decision Problem can be solved (Fig. 1).\nThe Strip Nesting Problem is NP-hard (e.g. Nielsen and Odgaard, 2003).\nIn this paper we present a new solution method for the Strip Nesting Problem. After a short analysis of some of the existing approaches to the problem (Section 2) we present a short outline of the new solution method in Section 3. In short, the approach is a local search method (Section 4) using the meta-heuristic*Guided Local Search*(Section 5) to escape local minima. A very efficient search of the neighborhood in the local search is the subject of Section 6.\nIn the definitions above we have ignored the additional constraints which are often given for a nesting problem e.g. whether rotating and/or flipping the stencils is allowed. In Section 7 a discussion on how we handle such problem variations emphasizes the flexibility of our solution method.\nExperiments show that our solution method is very efficient compared with other published methods. Results are presented in Section 8. Finally, in Section 9, it is shown that our solution method is quite easily generalized to three-dimensional nesting problems.\n## Section snippets\n## Existing approaches to nesting problems\nThere exists numerous solution methods for nesting problems. A thorough survey by Dowsland and Dowsland (1995) exists, but a more recent survey has also been done by Nielsen and Odgaard (2003). Meta-heuristics are one of the most popular tools for solving nesting problems. A detailed discussion of these can be found in the introductory sections of Bennell and Dowsland (1999).\nThe following is a brief discussion of some of the most interesting approaches to nesting problems previously presented\n## Solution method outline\nIn this section we will give a brief outline of our solution method. Our method is a relaxed placement method and it can handle irregular polygons with holes. A new geometric approach is utilized and the*Guided Local Search*meta-heuristic is used to escape local minima. This approach is inspired by a paper by Faroe et al. (2003) which presented a similar approach for the two-dimensional Bin Packing Problem for rectangles.\nThe following describes the basic algorithm for the Strip Nesting Problem.\n* (1)\n## Placement\nFirst we define a*placement*formally. LetS={s1,\u2026,sn}be a set of polygons. A placement ofs\u2208Scan be described by the tuple(sx,sy,s\u03b8,sf)\u2208R\u00d7R\u00d7[0,2\u03c0)\u00d7{false,true}where (*s**x*,*s**y*) is the position,*s**\u03b8*is the rotation angle and*s**f*states whether*s*is flipped. Now the mapp:S\u2192R\u00d7R\u00d7[0,2\u03c0)\u00d7{false,true}is a placement of the polygonsS.\n## Objective function\nGiven a set of polygonsS={s1,\u2026,sn}and a fixed-length strip with length*l*and width*w*, letPbe the space of possible placements. We now wish to minimize the objective\n## Guided local search\nTo escape local minima encountered during local search we apply the meta-heuristic*Guided Local Search*(*GLS*). GLS was introduced by Voudouris and Tsang (1995) and has previously been successfully applied to e.g. the*Traveling Salesman Problem*(Voudouris and Tsang, 1999) and two- and thre...",

This problem is approached with an heuristic based on simulated annealing. Traditional \" external penalization\" techniques are avoided through the application of the no-fit polygon, that determinates the collision-free region for each small item before its placement. The simulated annealing controls: the rotation applied and the placement of the small item. For each non-placed small item, a limited depth binary search is performed to find a scale factor that when applied to the small item, would allow it to be fitted in the large object. Three possibilities to define the sequence on which the small items are placed are studied: larger-first, random permutation and weight sorted. The proposed algorithm is suited for non-convex small items and large objects.\n**Keywords:**knapsack problem, cutting and packing, optimization\n**Introduction**\nThe knapsack problem arises in the industry whenever one must place multiple small items inside a large object such that there is no collision between the small items, while either minimizing the size of the large object or maximizing the volume occupied by the small items. High material utilization is of particular interest to mass production industries since small improvements of the layout can result in large savings of material and considerably reduce production cost.\nThe knapsack problem belongs to the more general class of combinatorial problems known as cutting and packing problems. According to Dyckhoff (1990), the cutting and packing problems are mainly characterized by the number of relevant dimensions, the regularity and irregularity of the shapes of the small items and large objects and the problem assignment. Considering assignment, it is possible to identify two situations: output maximization and input minimization. In the input minimization, the set of large objects is sufficient to accommodate all small items, and there is no selection regarding the small items. In the case of output maximization, the set of large objects is not sufficient to accommodate all the small items and a set of small items has to be assigned to a given set of large objects. The survey made by Wascher et al. (2005) improved the typology of cutting and packing problems proposed by Dyckhoff (1990). According to Wascher et al. (2005), the problem studied in this work can be defined as: \" ... the knapsack problem represents a problem category which is characterized by a strongly heteroge-neous assortment of small items which have to be allocated to a given set of large objects. Again, the availability of the large objects is limited such that not all small items can be accommodated. The value of the accommodated small items is to be maximized\" . In this survey, Wascher et al. (2005) identified 294 papers containing material relevant to cutting and packing. Only 5...",

The container has a fixed width, while its length can change so that all items are placed in it. The objective is to find a layout of the set of polygons that minimizes the length of the container. The proposed algorithm constructively creates layouts from an ordered list of items and a placement heuristic. The placement determines the collision free region (represents the set of translations to create a feasible layout) for the item to be placed. It is shown that the collision free region must be calculated using non-regularized Boolean operations, as contours of no-fit polygons should be ignored. The proposed algorithm to solve the placement problem has two levels, in the internal level the container has fixed dimensions, and the external level reduces or increases the variable dimension. The placement heuristic searches for degenerated vertices and edges as they represent local maximum compaction. Computational comparisons on benchmark problems show that the proposed algorithm generated highly competitive solutions. Moreover, our algorithm updated some best known results.\n...Read more\n## Key takeaways\n![sparkles](https://a.academia-assets.com/images/icons/sparkle.svg)\nAI\n1. The proposed two-level algorithm effectively minimizes container length for irregular polygon packing.\n2. Collision free regions (CFRs) are determined using non-regularized Boolean operations to avoid contour interference.\n3. Placement heuristic prioritizes degenerated edges and vertices for optimal item fitting and compaction.\n4. Benchmark tests with 13 datasets demonstrated competitive results, achieving 100% density in some cases.\n5. Simulated annealing (SA) is integrated for sequence and position control of item placements.\n## Related papers\n[Rotational Placement of Irregular Polygons over Containers with Fixed Dimensions using Simulated Annealing and No-Fit Polygons](https://www.academia.edu/58884840/Rotational_Placement_of_Irregular_Polygons_over_Containers_with_Fixed_Dimensions_using_Simulated_Annealing_and_No_Fit_Polygons)\n[Thiago de Castro Martins](https://independent.academia.edu/ThiagodeCastroMartins)\nJournal of the Brazilian Society of Mechanical Sciences and Engineering, 2008\nThis work deals with the problem of minimizing the waste of space that occurs on a rotational placement of a set of irregular bi-dimensional small items inside a bidimensional large object.

In the two-dimensional case, not only is it the case that the piece&#39;s size is important but its shape also has a significant influence. Therefore, DJD as a selection heuristic has to be paired with a placement heuristic to completely construct a solution to the underlying packing problem. A successful adaptation of the DJD requires a routine to reduce computational costs, which is also proposed and successfully tested in this paper. Results, on a wide variety of instance types with convex polygons, are found to be significantly better than those produced by more conventional selection heuristics.\ndownloadDownload free PDF[View PDFchevron\\_right](https://www.academia.edu/69875946/An_effective_heuristic_for_the_two_dimensional_irregular_bin_packing_problem)\n[Irregular rotational placement of shapes over non-convex containers with fixed dimensions](https://www.academia.edu/104990568/Irregular_rotational_placement_of_shapes_over_non_convex_containers_with_fixed_dimensions)\n[Thiago de Castro Martins](https://independent.academia.edu/ThiagodeCastroMartins)\n8th IFAC International Workshop on Intelligent Manufacturing Systems, 2007, 2007\nThis work deals with the problem of minimize the waste of space that occurs on a placement of a set of bi-dimensional items inside a bi-dimensional container with fixed dimensions.
