The proposed attention-based diffusion model for 2D irregular packing, GFPack++, supports\ncontinuous rotation and accommodating arbitrary boundaries.\n\n## 1\\. Introduction\n\nIrregular shape packing is a classic challenge in operation research, with significant implications for various applications such as texture atlas generation and material utilization in manufacturing\u00a0(Wang et\u00a0al., [2021](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib34)). Its NP-hard nature requires practical and effective packing algorithms to optimize space utilization.\n\nTraditional numerical optimization methods are often slow and costly. Recently, learning-based methods have emerged as a promising alternative for irregular packing, mainly using reinforcement learning\u00a0(Xu et\u00a0al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib37); Yang et\u00a0al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib39)).\nAnother promising approach is the diffusion model, which learns geometric relationships from teacher packing examples and establishes a gradient field for all objects, guiding them to move simultaneously\u00a0(Hosseini et\u00a0al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib11); Xue et\u00a0al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib38)).\nIn particular, the work of (Xue et\u00a0al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib38)), namely GFPack, achieves a notable trade-off between computational cost and space utilization, demonstrating scalability in terms of polygon count and generalizability to rectangular container boundaries.\nHowever, it still faces unresolved issues, notably the lack of support for rotation, a relatively high occurrence of object collisions in results, and limited adaptability to arbitrary boundaries.\n\nThe main idea of the learning-based packing framework is to capture the geometric relationships between shapes, which are essential for the gradient computation.\nSuch relationships in latent space encompass multiple facets: the _spatial (position, orientation) relationship_ of the shapes, the _geometric features relationship_ among them, and the _container boundary conditions_ that constrain them.\nHowever, GFPack falls short in fully representing these relationships.\nIt solely focuses on the positional aspect, neglecting orientation, thus hindering rotational capabilities. Furthermore, it relies on PointNeXt\u00a0(Qian et\u00a0al., [2022](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib24)) for geometric feature extraction, ignoring critical details like polygon edges and resulting in a loss of topological and local features.\nThus, we argue that the full potential of gradient learning has not been thoroughly exploited in GFPack.\n\nIn this study, we introduce two primary strategies to tackle the challenge of learning packing policies.\nFirstly, we use a graph to represent each object and encode it with an _attention-based geometric encoder_, which can capture polygonal geometry information effectively.\nSecondly, we design an _attention-based relation encoding_ mechanism to encode intricate relationships both between polygons and among polygons and boundaries, eliminating the need to explicitly represent the relationships with a graph.\nThis attention-based diffusion model enhances the understanding of how objects interact with each other and the boundaries, resulting in superior performance in both training and inference.\nWe also investigate the utilization distribution between the teacher and inference data and design a weighting function to prioritize tighter teacher data during training, confirmed to be effective.\n\nThis paper makes the following contributions:\n\n1. -\n\n\nWe propose GFPack++, a novel packing framework that employs attention-based learning of gradient fields, supporting continuous rotation and enhancing generalization.\n\n2. -\n\n\nAdvancing beyond GFPack, we encapsulate geometric relationships in an attention-based encoder, incorporating mutual spatial (position, orientation) relationships of objects, their geometric features, and container boundary conditions, and a weighting function to facilitate effective learning policies.\n\n3. -\n\n\nGFPack++ achieves superior irregular packing results, demonstrating higher space utilization over several widely used baselines, one order of magnitude faster than the previous diffusion-based method, coupled with promising generalization for arbitrary boundaries.\n\n\n## 2\\. Related Work\n\n#### Traditional packing approaches\n\nTraditional methods usually involve placement optimization and sequence planning ( _c.f_.surveys\u00a0(Bennell and Oliveira, [2009](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib3); Leao et\u00a0al., [2020](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib18))). Most research focuses on placement optimization with heuristic rules (e.g., BL, BLF), NFP-based search\u00a0(Bennell and Song, [2008](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib4)), or mathematical models\u00a0(Hopper and Turton, [2001](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib10)). Novel approaches include SDF-based placement\u00a0(Pan et\u00a0al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib23)) and spectral domain correlation\u00a0(Cui et\u00a0al., [2023](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.07579v1#bib.bib6)), but they only support limited rotations.

It is also known as cutting or\nnesting problem, which involves arranging a collection of irregu\u0002larly shaped pieces onto one or multiple boards. The objective is to\nposition each piece entirely within the board(s) without overlaps,\nall while minimizing the waste material produced.\narXiv:2310.19814v1 [cs.LG] 18 Oct 2023\nTianyang Xue, Mingdong Wu, Lin Lu, Haoxuan Wang, Hao Dong, and Baoquan Chen\nOne of the key applications of irregular packing is manufacturing.\nIn these scenarios, packing problems take on different forms, such\nas packing parts to be cut from a larger piece of material in order\nto minimize waste and save costs in traditional manufacturing\nindustries like garment manufacturing, furniture making, metal\nsheet cutting, or arranging multiple models within the build volume\nfor simultaneous 3D printing to increase model production while\nminimizing material waste, and reducing print time.\nIn manufacturing applications, a fast, scalable, and generalizable\npacking algorithm is crucial for real-world deployment.\n\u2022 Efficient algorithms streamline decision-making, simplify\u0002ing deployment for end-users.\n\u2022 The size and aspect ratio of the container may vary depend\u0002ing on the raw material or machines used.\n\u2022 Packed objects may have similar shapes with slight devia\u0002tions due to customization and personalization preferences.\nThese objectives motivate us to propose a learning-based method\nto understand the relationships and similarities among the well\u0002packed examples from a dataset with limited size, instead of solving\nthe packing case individually without considering any priors.\nAs a classic NP-hard problem [Milenkovic 1999], the irregular\npacking problem is typically tackled using heuristic algorithms and\nglobal optimization strategies [Guo et al. 2022], which can be very\ntime-consuming. In recent years, machine learning approaches have\nemerged as potential solutions to address the challenging problem\nof packing optimization. The success of employing reinforcement\nlearning to address the bin packing problem [Verma et al. 2020; Zhao\net al. 2022] underscores its potential for aiding in the sequential\noptimization of packing. While researchers have strived to enhance\nthe initialization [Wo\u0142czyk 2018] or packing sequence [Fang et al.\n2023] for irregular packing, a trade-off between computational time\nand utilization rate persists.\nTo realize a fast, scalable, and generalizable packing algorithm,\nour key insight is to reframe the packing problem into modeling\nthe data distribution of sub-optimal packing examples. These ex\u0002amples can be generated by arbitrary packing algorithms, which\nwe refer to as the teacher algorithms. Specifically, such a learning\napproach should learn the correlations between the packing opti\u0002mality and the spatial relationships of polygons from the examples.\nBy modeling the local and global correlations together, the learned\nknowledge can generalize to unseen shapes, varying quantities,\nand diverse rectangular containers, which enables scalable and\ngeneralizable in-distribution packing.\nDuring testing, a solution can be generated via several neural\nnetwork inferences, without further online exploration or exhaus\u0002tive optimization, which enables a fast packing process. Thanks to\nthe inherent parallelism of deep learning, we can generate multiple\nsolution candidates in parallel and preserve the best one, which\nfurther improves the time efficiency of the packing process.\nInspired by [Wu et al. 2022], which proposes a score-based frame\u0002work that estimates a target gradient field (TarGF) to guide object\nrearrangement, we aim to develop a score-based approach for mod\u0002eling the teacher data. However, adapting this technique to the\nirregular packing problem is non-trivial due to the hard constraints\non the validity of packed objects, i.e., non-overlapping. As a result,\nsolving the irregular packing requires a coarse-to-fine refinement\nprocess guided by multiple levels of gradient fields, rather than a\nsingle gradient update (TarGF).\nTo achieve this goal, we introduce two key designs for the score\nnetwork: multi-scale feature extraction and coarse-to-fine relation\nextraction. The former incorporates a multi-scale feature extraction\nnetwork that encodes the geometric features of polygons at different\nscales. The latter employs a multi-layered coarse-to-fine graph\nconvolutional network (GCN) with varying neighbor ranges for\neffective message-passing. By combining these two key designs, our\napproach tailors the score network to effectively support the coarse\u0002to-fine refinement process, resulting in improved generalization\nand scalability for solving the 2D irregular packing problem.\nWe evaluate our method in two industrial packing domains,\nconsidering only translations. Empirical results demonstrate our\nmethod achieves spatial utilization rates that are either similar to or\nexceed those of teacher packing examples. Furthermore, our method\nscales with polygon count and generalizes to diverse container\nconstraints and polygon shapes within the training distribution.\nIn summary, our contributions are listed as follows:\n\u2022 We propose a score-based generative modeling approach to\ntackle th...",

An efficient 2D irregular packing algorithm can effectively improve material utilization and reduce processing costs. The reduction in material consumption will also have a beneficial impact on the environment ([Ke et al., 2020](#B76)). Therefore, research of the packing problem is of great significance for technology and social interest.\nThe 2D packing problem is a type of combinatorial optimization problems to locate parts with different shapes compactly in one or more master sheet material to minimize the occupied space or maximize the utilization of the material. The 2D packing problem is currently recognized as a NP problem, which is mainly solved by heuristic algorithms. In recent years, many scholars have conducted research on 2D irregular packing problems with a verity of solutions.\nThere exists a number of review articles on packing and cutting problems. We have summarized the main review literature in the field of 2D packing and cutting as shown in[Table 1](#T1). Brown ([Brown, 1971](#B17)) introduced an optimum packing and depletion problem with optimization of space and resource usage. Harvey ([Salkin and De Kluyver, 1975](#B116)) surveyed the application of mathematical optimization models such as linear programming to the knapsack problem. Bruce ([Golden, 1976](#B50)) surveyed various approaches to the cutting stock problem. Hinxman ([Hinxman, 1980](#B65)) surveyed the trim-loss and assortment problems, this research paid more attention to cutting and packaging problems in practical applications, and did not mention much about theoretical methods. Garey and Coffman ([Garey and Johnson, 1981](#B47);[Coffman et al., 1984](#B27)) surveyed the approximation algorithms for bin packing problems. Israni ([Israni and Sanders, 1982](#B72)) reviewed the 2D cutting stock problem including almost all 2D packaging problems. The author also proposed a rectangular layout method. Sarin ([Sarin, 1983](#B118)) reviewed methodologies and literature to solve 2D stock cutting problems and introduced an interactive optimization procedure for a general 2D stock cutting problem. Dyckhoff ([Dyckhoff et al., 1985](#B38)) described a trim loss and related problems and categorized them briefly. Dudzi&#x00144;ski ([Dudzi&#x00144;ski and Walukiewicz, 1987](#B36)) summarized the exact methods for knapsack problems, such as linear programming. Matthias ([Rode and Rosenberg, 1987](#B114)) analyzed the algorithm for the trim-loss problems. Haessler ([Haessler and Sweeney, 1991](#B59)) reviewed the solution process of cutting stock problems, including placement algorithm and sequence optimization algorithm. Dowsland ([Dowsland and Dowsland, 1992](#B34)) reviewed the application of operations research methods to the packing problem and summarized some exact heuristics. Sweeney ([Sweeney and Paternoster, 1992](#B128)) categorized cutting and packing problems and made application-oriented research records. Cheng ([Cheng et al., 1994](#B22)) discussed 2D cutting stock problems and their application cases including the pallet loading problem and VLSI placement problem. With the gradual deepening of research on 2D layout problems, typology becomes a common research topic. 2D regular and irregular layout problems are clearly distinguished in practical applications and theoretical methods. Dowsland ([Dowsland and Dowsland, 1995](#B29)) gave a special review of the 2D irregular nesting problem for the first time. Mavridou ([Mavridou and Pardalos, 1997](#B98)) summarized applications of the genetic algorithm and simulated annealing algorithm in the optimization of facility layout problems. Dyckhoff ([Dyckhoff, 1990](#B37)) made a typology of the cutting and packing problems in detail, and W&#x000e4;scher ([W&#x000e4;scher et al., 2007](#B135)) improved the typology later. Hopper ([Hopper and Turton, 1999](#B67);[Hopper and Turton, 2001a](#B68);[Hopper and Turton, 2001b](#B69)) investigated the application of meta-heuristic and heuristic algorithms in 2D and 3D packing problems.

The goal of this optimization problem is to place a set of irregular\npolygons onto a material sheet without overlapping and in a way that minimizes wasted\nmaterial.\nIn this thesis, we delve into a fast 2D packing algorithm that automatically arranges\nparts of a user\u2019s design onto their available material sheets to provide live feedback on\nhow much material they have left. To do this, we make use of the concept of the no fit\npolygon to generate candidate placements, and we utilize custom heuristics and performance\noptimization to improve packing quality and runtime .\nOur technical evaluation shows that the implementation is fast enough to work at\ninteractive speeds and produce solutions of similar quality to other tools and algorithms that\nperform automated packing.\nThesis Supervisor: Stefanie Mueller\nTitle: Assistant Professor\n3\n4\nAcknowledgments\nFirst of all, I would like to extend my deepest gratitude to my advisor, Professor Stefanie\nMueller. She has been especially supportive during these trying times and has always been\navailable to give guidance and instruction. I would also like to give the hugest of thank yous\nto Ticha Sethapakdi and Daniel Anderson without whom this thesis could not have been\npossible. Ticha was the mastermind of Fabricaide and its user interface, and also somehow\nsimultaneously manages to be one of the coolest and one of the most awkward people I\nknow. Dan was always available to provide guidance and support in wrangling with C++\nand other difficult aspects of the implementation. Even outside the context of working on\nFabricaide, Ticha and Dan have been great friends and role models throughout the time I\ngot to know them. I could not have asked for a better group of mentors and colleagues than\nProfessor Mueller, Ticha and Dan.\nI am extremely grateful to my friends and family both here in the MIT community as\nwell as back home in the Philippines all the way at the other side of the world. I am thankful\nfor all the love and concern I\u2019ve received from them in spite of current circumstances.\nFinally, I would like to thank the rest of the Human Computer Interaction Engineering\nGroup for creative such a fun and welcoming environment. Be it sharing and discussing\nideas during lab meetings or hitting the dance floor with Just Dance for celebrations, I have\nnever had a boring moment with this great group of people.\nLanguage and Figure Note\nThroughout this thesis, I use the word \u201cwe\u201d to signify that this work has been a group effort.\nHowever, the work that is provided in detail is my own. Figures and images were jointly\ncreated by the project team.\n5\n6\nContents\n1 Introduction 13\n2 Related Work 15\n2.1 Preparing Designs for Laser Cutting . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 15\n2.2 Arranging Parts of a 2D Design . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 16\n3 Packing Algorithm 19\n3.1 Preliminaries . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 19\n3.1.1 No Fit Polygons . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 19\n3.1.2 Applying NFPs to the Packing Problem . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 20\n3.1.3 Bin Selection . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 21\n3.2 Overview . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 23\n3.3 Implementation . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 24\n3.3.1 Sheets with Holes . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 24\n3.3.2 Basic Part Placement Algorithm . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 24\n3.3.3 Order and Rotations of Parts . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 25\n3.3.4 Heuristics . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 29\n3.3.5 Placement across Multiple Sheets . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 30\n3.3.6 Partial Packing . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 32\n3.3.7 Complexity Analysis . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 33\n3.4 Implementation Optimizations . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 35\n3.4.1 Caching of NFPs . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 35\n3.4.2 Incremental Heuristic Calculation . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 36\n7\n3.4.3 Shape Dilation and Simplification . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 36\n3.5 Technical Evaluation of Part Placement Algorithm . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 37\n3.5.1 Benchmark Dataset . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 37\n3.5.2 Benchmark Setup . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 38\n3.5.3 Evaluation of Runtime . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 38\n3.5.4 Evaluation of Solution Quality . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 39\n3.5.5 Additional Evaluation for Standard Datasets . . . . . . . . . . . . . 40\n4 Fabricaide System Overview 43\n4.1 Core System Features . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 43\n4.1.1 Drawing Parts and Assigning Materials . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 43\n4.1.2 Live Packing Previews . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 44\n4.1.3 Material Warnings and Suggested Substitutes . . . . . . . . . . . . 46\n4.1.4 Material Utilization . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 47\n4.2 Implementation . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 47\n4.2.1 Splitting a Design into Constituent Materials . . . . . . . . . . . . 47\n4.2.2 Calculating Material Utilization . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 48\n4.3 Qualitative Evaluation of Fabricaide . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 49\n4.3.1 User Study Procedure . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 49\n4.3.2 User Study Findings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 49\n5 Conclusions 53\n8\nList of Figures\n3-1 A fixed-position polygon (black), a polygon to place (gray), and their NFP\n(red).

In this post we&#x27;ll have a look what goes into collision detection as well as a strategy to pack any arbitrary shape in 2D.\n#### By[Ahmad Moussa](https://www.gorillasun.de/author/ahmad/)\nPublished on July 22, 2022\nLast Updated on August 28, 2024\n21 min read\n![A Simple Solution for Shape Packing in 2D](https://www.gorillasun.de/content/images/size/w1200/2023/03/banner2.jpg)\nThis blog post is about the age-old creative coding problem of shape packing! Even though it might seem like a simple task at first, it is actually quite an involved undertaking. It also usually entails having a broader look at how collision detection algorithms work. In the following sections we'll work our way up to an algorithm with which you can essentially pack any sort of geometric shapes, and combinations thereof.\n![](https://www.gorillasun.de/content/images/2023/03/example1.jpg)\n![](https://www.gorillasun.de/content/images/2023/03/example2.jpg)\nBefore we begin, I want to point out that I had a first encounter with this algo back in February of 2022. I never completed that particular idea, but it led to an interesting packing scheme. You can see some of the artworks my code produced above.\n![](https://www.gorillasun.de/content/images/2023/03/maplands.jpg)\nI also recently learned that a few others have made their own version of this idea. In June I faced a packing problem where I had to draw all sorts of geometric shapes to the canvas. I was left scratching my head at first and it took me quite a while to find a solution. While researching different methods I came across[Amy Goodchild\u2019s](https://twitter.com/amygoodchild?ref=gorillasun.de)[writeup](https://www.amygoodchild.com/blog/maplands?ref=gorillasun.de)on a wonderful sketch of hers called \"Maplands\" where she used a similar strategy to what I ultimately did to implement my idea.\n![](https://www.gorillasun.de/content/images/2023/03/fruitpacking.jpg)\nLater on I also re-discovered[Tarwin Stroh-Spijer's](https://twitter.com/tarwin?ref=gorillasun.de)[fruit salad packing sketch](https://openprocessing.org/sketch/1533577?ref=gorillasun.de), which initially evolved from[Jeff's (aka ippsketch)](https://twitter.com/ippsketch?ref=gorillasun.de)[banana packing sketch](https://ippsketch.com/posts/non-circular-packing/?ref=gorillasun.de). I had a thorough look at Tarwin's beautifully written packing library, and a lot of the code in later sections of this post are based on Tarwin's method. Go check out the folks mentioned above, they're all awesome creative individuals!\n### Discussion:\n1. [Packing Algorithms in Generative Art](#packing-algorithms-in-generative-art)\n2.

Despite its deceptive simplicity, bin packing is actually an[NP-Hard problem](https://stackoverflow.com/a/19510170?ref=gorillasun.de), with it's associated decision problem (checking if the items to be packed fit in a certain area), is[NP-Complete](https://gorillasun.de/blog/rectangle-packing-an-incredibly-difficult-problem?ref=gorillasun.de). Understanding this is not necessary for what follows however. I just find it incredibly interesting though, I keep finding myself coming back to this problem thinking: \"Surely this can't be this difficult!\"\nPacking algorithms are useful for a range of real life scenarios, such as packing boxes in a warehouse, or positioning shapes on a sheet of laser cutting material such that the amount of wasted material is minimised. Packing is a heavily researched area of mathematics and fairly advanced algorithms have been developed to solve different variations of it. In generative art the primary goal of packing algorithms is often the creation of visually pleasing and interesting packing patterns. We also often don't start with shapes that have a pre-determined size (usually real life objects have a pre-determined size duh), but make them up on the go.\nHence gen-art packing algorithms vary a little in that regard. I'd like to show off a few artworks that have in one another or another been made with packing algorithms. Here's two stunning artworks from[Caleb Ogg](https://twitter.com/iso_hedron?ref=gorillasun.de):\n![](https://www.gorillasun.de/content/images/2023/03/Colorshift2.jpg)\n![](https://www.gorillasun.de/content/images/2023/03/Lens3.jpg)\nCaleb's pieces[Lens 3](https://superrare.com/0x6125e13fc97f6fc97ea14cf925211e4dc0e99f0f/lens-3-18?ref=gorillasun.de)and[Colorshift 2](https://superrare.com/0x6125e13fc97f6fc97ea14cf925211e4dc0e99f0f/colorshift-2-12?ref=gorillasun.de), part of his ongoing 'Coalesce' series, are some of the most interesting circle packing sketches I've seen in a while. Note that the images shown here (2000x2000px) don't do the originals justice which are absolutely gigantic (16000x16000px). Built on a system of circles and rings, Caleb makes use of an underlying noise field for a nifty creative effect. I especially like how Lens conveys the illusion of multiple overlapping lenses that appear to contort the coloration of the underlying circles, which is done by scaling and multiplying the underlying noise field. Excited to see where this series is heading, always a pleasure when Caleb's sketches bless my timeline.\nA little less recent[example](https://www.infinite.center/2015/08/08/circles-inside-circles/?ref=gorillasun.de)of a circle packing sketch is by none other than Jared Tarbell:\n![](https://www.gorillasun.de/content/images/2023/03/javadpack.jpg)\nAs well as this[beautiful homage](https://www.reddit.com/r/generative/comments/ibk6pf/circle_packing_\u00e0_la_tarbell/?ref=gorillasun.de)to Jared's sketch by prolific creative coder[Dmitri Cherniak](https://twitter.com/dmitricherniak?ref=gorillasun.de):\n![](https://www.gorillasun.de/content/images/2023/03/dimitripack-1.webp)\nIf you like these patterns you should also check out the[Appolonian Gasket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollonian_gasket?ref=gorillasun.de)(alternatively Appolonian circle packing). And for good measure we also need to mention[Yann LeGalle](https://twitter.com/Yann_LeGall?ref=gorillasun.de)who just utterly blows my mind on a regular basis:\nAnd one of the earliest ones that captivated me and initially motivated me to explore circle packing for myself was this sketch by Piter Pasma's:\n> [> > > > > > > > View this post on Instagram\n> > > > > > > > > > > > ](https://www.instagram.com/p/CLEl7WGH6j8/?utm_source=ig_embed&utm_campaign=loading)\n[> A post shared by Piter Pasma (@piterpasma)\n](https://www.instagram.com/p/CLEl7WGH6j8/?utm_source=ig_embed&utm_campaign=loading)\nI really love this one.

An efficient 2D irregular packing algorithm can effectively improve material utilization and reduce processing costs. The reduction in material consumption will also have a beneficial impact on the environment ([Ke et al., 2020](#B76)). Therefore, research of the packing problem is of great significance for technology and social interest.\nThe 2D packing problem is a type of combinatorial optimization problems to locate parts with different shapes compactly in one or more master sheet material to minimize the occupied space or maximize the utilization of the material. The 2D packing problem is currently recognized as a NP problem, which is mainly solved by heuristic algorithms. In recent years, many scholars have conducted research on 2D irregular packing problems with a verity of solutions.\nThere exists a number of review articles on packing and cutting problems. We have summarized the main review literature in the field of 2D packing and cutting as shown in[Table 1](#T1). Brown ([Brown, 1971](#B17)) introduced an optimum packing and depletion problem with optimization of space and resource usage. Harvey ([Salkin and De Kluyver, 1975](#B116)) surveyed the application of mathematical optimization models such as linear programming to the knapsack problem. Bruce ([Golden, 1976](#B50)) surveyed various approaches to the cutting stock problem. Hinxman ([Hinxman, 1980](#B65)) surveyed the trim-loss and assortment problems, this research paid more attention to cutting and packaging problems in practical applications, and did not mention much about theoretical methods. Garey and Coffman ([Garey and Johnson, 1981](#B47);[Coffman et al., 1984](#B27)) surveyed the approximation algorithms for bin packing problems. Israni ([Israni and Sanders, 1982](#B72)) reviewed the 2D cutting stock problem including almost all 2D packaging problems. The author also proposed a rectangular layout method. Sarin ([Sarin, 1983](#B118)) reviewed methodologies and literature to solve 2D stock cutting problems and introduced an interactive optimization procedure for a general 2D stock cutting problem. Dyckhoff ([Dyckhoff et al., 1985](#B38)) described a trim loss and related problems and categorized them briefly. Dudzi&#x00144;ski ([Dudzi&#x00144;ski and Walukiewicz, 1987](#B36)) summarized the exact methods for knapsack problems, such as linear programming. Matthias ([Rode and Rosenberg, 1987](#B114)) analyzed the algorithm for the trim-loss problems. Haessler ([Haessler and Sweeney, 1991](#B59)) reviewed the solution process of cutting stock problems, including placement algorithm and sequence optimization algorithm. Dowsland ([Dowsland and Dowsland, 1992](#B34)) reviewed the application of operations research methods to the packing problem and summarized some exact heuristics. Sweeney ([Sweeney and Paternoster, 1992](#B128)) categorized cutting and packing problems and made application-oriented research records. Cheng ([Cheng et al., 1994](#B22)) discussed 2D cutting stock problems and their application cases including the pallet loading problem and VLSI placement problem. With the gradual deepening of research on 2D layout problems, typology becomes a common research topic. 2D regular and irregular layout problems are clearly distinguished in practical applications and theoretical methods. Dowsland ([Dowsland and Dowsland, 1995](#B29)) gave a special review of the 2D irregular nesting problem for the first time. Mavridou ([Mavridou and Pardalos, 1997](#B98)) summarized applications of the genetic algorithm and simulated annealing algorithm in the optimization of facility layout problems. Dyckhoff ([Dyckhoff, 1990](#B37)) made a typology of the cutting and packing problems in detail, and W&#x000e4;scher ([W&#x000e4;scher et al., 2007](#B135)) improved the typology later. Hopper ([Hopper and Turton, 1999](#B67);[Hopper and Turton, 2001a](#B68);[Hopper and Turton, 2001b](#B69)) investigated the application of meta-heuristic and heuristic algorithms in 2D and 3D packing problems. Lodi ([Lodi et al., 2002a](#B90);[Lodi et al., 2002b](#B91)) reviewed algorithms proposed in the 1990s of 2D packing problems. Bennell et al. ([Bennell and Oliveira, 2008](#B10);[Bennell and Oliveira, 2009](#B9)) discussed 2D irregular packing problems and related geometric problems. Leao ([Leao et al., 2020](#B81)) introduced the mathematical models in the 2D irregular packing problem.\nTABLE 1\n[![www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/966691/fmech-08-966691-HTML/image_m/fmech-08-966691-t001.jpg)](https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/966691/fmech-08-966691-HTML/image_m/fmech-08-966691-t001.jpg)\n**TABLE 1**. Review literature in the field of cutting and packing problems.\nThe scope of these reviews is broad, mainly for all 2D packing problems including rectangular packing and other regular packing problems. These review papers are out of date with missed innovative algorithms of 2D irregular packing. Since 2010, only Leao ([Leao et al., 2020](#B81)) reviewed 2D irregular packing problems. But he only introduced the mathematical models, instead of reviewing 2D irregular packing problems comprehensively. In recent years, there is not ...",
