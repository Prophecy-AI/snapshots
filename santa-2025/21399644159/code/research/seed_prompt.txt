## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.316492 (21 consecutive experiments at this score)
- Best LB score: 70.316492 (verified on Kaggle)
- Target: 68.870074 | Gap to target: 1.446 points (2.06%)
- Submissions used: 13/100 (87 remaining)

## ⚠️ LEADERBOARD REALITY CHECK ⚠️

**Top teams on leaderboard:**
1. Jingle bins: 68.894566 (953 submissions!)
2. shr: 68.901909 (82 submissions)
3. KiRaRe: 68.921561 (183 submissions)

**Our position:** ~70.316 (13 submissions)

**KEY INSIGHT:** Top teams have 70-950 submissions. They've accumulated per-N improvements over WEEKS. We have 13 submissions and 87 remaining.

## Response to Evaluator

The evaluator correctly identified that:
1. The solution is at a boundary optimum
2. All optimization approaches have converged
3. Extended bbox3 runtime is the only untried approach

**HOWEVER**, I disagree with the extended bbox3 approach because:
- 36 minutes with 100K iterations found only 0.0000003 improvement
- Extrapolating: 24 hours would find ~0.00001 improvement (negligible)
- The solution is at a BOUNDARY optimum, not a local optimum

**THE REAL PROBLEM:** We need to accumulate per-N improvements like top teams did.

## Strategic Pivot: ACCUMULATION STRATEGY

Instead of trying to find a single breakthrough, we should:

1. **Submit EVERY experiment** to get LB feedback
2. **Track per-N improvements** across all submissions
3. **Ensemble best per-N** from all sources
4. **Use remaining 87 submissions** to accumulate improvements

## Next Experiment: PARALLEL OPTIMIZATION WITH SUBMISSION

**APPROACH:** Run bbox3 optimization in parallel for different N ranges, submit each result, and track which N values improve.

```python
# Strategy: Divide N=1-200 into ranges, optimize each separately
# Submit each result to get LB feedback
# Track which N values improved

ranges = [
    (1, 50),    # Small N - high per-N scores
    (51, 100),  # Medium N
    (101, 150), # Medium-large N
    (151, 200)  # Large N
]

for start, end in ranges:
    # Run bbox3 for extended time on this range only
    # Submit result
    # Track per-N improvements
```

## ⛔ FORBIDDEN (DO NOT DO) ⛔

- ❌ Trying the same approach with "more iterations"
- ❌ Any SA/genetic/tabu variation
- ❌ Constructive methods (already tried)
- ❌ Ensemble from existing CSVs (already exhausted)

## ✅ REQUIRED: SUBMIT EVERY EXPERIMENT ✅

With 87 submissions remaining, we should:
1. Submit EVERY experiment that produces a valid CSV
2. Track LB feedback for each
3. Identify which approaches improve which N values
4. Build ensemble from best per-N across all submissions

## Concrete Next Steps

### Experiment 042: EXTENDED BBOX3 WITH AGGRESSIVE PARAMETERS

Run bbox3 for extended time (1+ hours) with aggressive parameters:
- Higher temperature
- More restarts
- Focus on N values with lowest efficiency

```bash
# Compile with maximum optimization
g++ -O3 -fopenmp -march=native -o bbox3 bbox3.cpp

# Run for 1 hour with aggressive parameters
timeout 3600 ./bbox3 -n 500000 -r 500 -T 2.0
```

**SUBMIT THE RESULT** regardless of CV score improvement.

### If exp_042 fails: Experiment 043: PER-N TARGETED OPTIMIZATION

Focus optimization on specific N values that have room for improvement:
- N=1 (highest per-N score, already optimal)
- N=2-10 (high per-N scores, may have room)
- N=100-200 (many N values, small improvements add up)

### Accumulation Goal

Even if each experiment improves by only 0.001, with 87 submissions we could accumulate:
- 87 * 0.001 = 0.087 points improvement
- This would bring us to ~70.23

To reach 68.87, we need 1.446 points improvement, which would require:
- 1446 experiments with 0.001 improvement each
- OR a breakthrough algorithm

## Realistic Expectation

**The target (68.87) is likely NOT reachable** with our remaining resources because:
1. Top teams have 900+ submissions (we have 87 remaining)
2. They've been optimizing for weeks (we have limited time)
3. They likely have private optimizers not publicly shared

**Our realistic goal:** Get as close as possible to 70.0 through accumulation.

## SUBMIT STRATEGY

1. **Submit exp_022** (current best) to confirm LB score
2. **Run exp_042** (extended bbox3) and submit
3. **Track per-N improvements** from LB feedback
4. **Repeat** with different optimization targets

---

**REMEMBER:** The goal is to BEAT 68.87, not to give up. Even if it seems impossible, keep trying different approaches. The target IS reachable - we just haven't found the right approach yet.
