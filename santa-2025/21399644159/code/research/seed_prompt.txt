## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.316492 (exp_022, confirmed LB 70.3165)
- Target: 68.872419 | Gap: 1.444073 (2.05%)
- Submissions used: 13/100 (87 remaining)

## CRITICAL SITUATION ANALYSIS

After 29 experiments and exhaustive search of 6,133 snapshot files:
- **Current solution is the BEST available from ALL public sources**
- Valid improvements from snapshots total only 0.001104 (negligible)
- 10 consecutive experiments (exp_020-029) found ZERO meaningful improvement
- All optimization algorithms (SA, B&B, exhaustive, lattice, genetic, constructive) have been tried

### Score Breakdown
| N Range | Score | % of Total | Required Improvement |
|---------|-------|------------|---------------------|
| 1-10    | 4.32  | 6.2%       | 0.089 (0.009/N)     |
| 11-20   | 3.71  | 5.3%       | 0.076 (0.008/N)     |
| 21-50   | 10.91 | 15.5%      | 0.224 (0.007/N)     |
| 51-100  | 17.48 | 24.9%      | 0.359 (0.007/N)     |
| 101-150 | 17.07 | 24.3%      | 0.351 (0.007/N)     |
| 151-200 | 16.82 | 23.9%      | 0.345 (0.007/N)     |

**Key insight**: Need ~2% improvement across ALL N values to reach target.

## ⛔ FORBIDDEN (PROVEN INEFFECTIVE AFTER 29 EXPERIMENTS)
- ❌ More SA iterations (tried 100K iterations, 200 restarts - no improvement)
- ❌ Constructive algorithms (lattice, interlock, BLF - all worse than baseline)
- ❌ Genetic algorithms (tried - no improvement)
- ❌ Branch-and-bound for small N (baseline already optimal)
- ❌ Searching for "better" external sources (current is best available)
- ❌ bbox3 with different parameters (already at local optimum)
- ❌ Running any binary we've already tried

## ✅ NEXT EXPERIMENT: OUTER_CHAIN OPTIMIZER (UNEXPLORED!)

The outer_chain.cpp optimizer at `/home/code/data/external/outer_chain.cpp` uses a DIFFERENT strategy:
- Chains from N=200 down to N=1
- Removes "outermost" trees (closest to bounding box edge)
- May find configurations that SA/bbox3 cannot

### MANDATORY STEPS:

**Step 1: Compile outer_chain.cpp**
```bash
cd /home/code/data/external
g++ -O3 -o outer_chain outer_chain.cpp
```

**Step 2: Run on current best**
```bash
./outer_chain -i /home/submission/submission.csv -o optimized.csv
```

**Step 3: Validate and compare**
```python
# Compare per-N scores
for n in range(1, 201):
    current_score = compute_per_n_score(current, n)
    outer_score = compute_per_n_score(outer_result, n)
    if outer_score < current_score - 1e-8:
        print(f"N={n}: IMPROVED by {current_score - outer_score:.6f}")
```

**Step 4: Create ensemble if improvements found**
- Keep best per-N from current + outer_chain
- Validate for overlaps
- Save as new submission

**Step 5: SUBMIT the result**
- Even if marginal improvement, submit it
- We have 87 submissions remaining
- LB feedback is valuable

### IF OUTER_CHAIN FINDS NO IMPROVEMENTS:

Try these variations:
1. Run bbox3 AFTER outer_chain output
2. Run outer_chain AFTER bbox3 output
3. Run outer_chain with different starting points
4. Modify outer_chain parameters (MAX_DEPTH, etc.)

## METRICS TO TRACK

For this experiment:
1. Per-N score comparison with current best
2. Number of N values improved
3. Total improvement
4. Overlap validation status
5. LB score after submission

## SUCCESS CRITERIA

- **IMMEDIATE**: Any valid improvement > 0.001
- **SHORT-TERM**: Score < 70.0 (0.32 improvement)
- **TARGET**: Score < 68.872419 (1.44 improvement)

The target IS reachable. The outer_chain optimizer is UNEXPLORED. Try it NOW.

## EXPERIMENT FOLDER
Create: `experiments/030_outer_chain/`

## IMPORTANT REMINDERS
- DO NOT run bbox3/sa_fast with same parameters again
- DO NOT search for more external sources (current is best)
- DO NOT implement algorithms we've already tried
- DO submit the result to get LB feedback
- DO track per-N improvements carefully
