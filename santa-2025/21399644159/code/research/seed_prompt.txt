## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.316492 from exp_022 (ensemble)
- Best LB score: 70.3165 (verified)
- Target: 68.870074 | Gap to target: 1.446 (2.10%)

## 🚨 CRITICAL BREAKTHROUGH: BBOX3 NOW COMPILES! 🚨

**The bbox3.cpp source code has been successfully compiled!**

```bash
cd /home/code/experiments
g++ -O3 -fopenmp -std=c++17 bbox3.cpp -o bbox3_local
# SUCCESS! Binary created at /home/code/experiments/bbox3_local
```

This is the MOST IMPORTANT development in 14 experiments. The bbox3 optimizer is the most sophisticated tool available, with:
- Complex Number Vector Coordination
- Fluid Dynamics simulation
- Hinge Pivot mechanics
- Density Gradient Flow
- Global Boundary Tension
- Aggressive overlap-and-repair cycles

## Submission Log (TRACK EVERYTHING!)
| Exp | Approach | CV | LB | Notes |
|-----|----------|----|----|-------|
| 000 | baseline | 70.52 | - | Initial |
| 010 | safe_ensemble | 70.37 | 70.37 | First improvement |
| 016 | ensemble | 70.35 | 70.35 | Better ensemble |
| 019 | ensemble | 70.34 | 70.34 | Marginal gain |
| 022 | ensemble | 70.32 | 70.32 | Current best |
| 033 | CP + SA | 70.32 | - | No improvement |

## What We've Learned
1. **PUBLIC CEILING REACHED**: Score 70.316492 is the BEST among ALL 283 external CSV files
2. **All optimization methods failed**: SA, B&B, lattice, interlock, jostle, CP - NONE improved
3. **The baseline is at a strong local/global optimum**
4. **bbox3 binary was incompatible** - but NOW WE CAN COMPILE IT!

## Response to Evaluator

The evaluator correctly identified that:
1. bbox3 binary incompatibility was a MAJOR BLOCKER - **NOW RESOLVED**
2. Optimization time has been too short (minutes, not hours)
3. CP model was too simplified (Manhattan distance doesn't model tree polygons)
4. 14 consecutive experiments with no improvement indicates strategy exhaustion

**I AGREE with the evaluator's top priority**: Run compiled bbox3 for extended periods.

## Next Experiment: EXTENDED BBOX3 OPTIMIZATION (CRITICAL!)

### MANDATORY FIRST STEP: Run bbox3_local for extended optimization

The compiled bbox3_local binary is at `/home/code/experiments/bbox3_local`

1. Create experiment folder: `experiments/034_extended_bbox3/`
2. Copy bbox3_local and submission.csv to the folder
3. Check how bbox3 expects input (read the source code)
4. Run bbox3 for AT LEAST 2 hours
5. Monitor progress and save any improvements

### How to check bbox3 input format:
```bash
head -200 /home/code/experiments/bbox3.cpp | grep -A20 "main"
# Look for how it reads the input file
```

### Expected Behavior
- bbox3 will read submission.csv
- It will run SA with advanced physics simulation
- It will output improved configurations
- Run for AT LEAST 2 hours (longer is better)

### Alternative: Run sa_fast_v2.cpp
If bbox3 has issues, compile and run sa_fast_v2.cpp:
```bash
cd /home/code/data/external/kernel_outputs/fast-sa-cpp/
g++ -O3 -fopenmp -std=c++17 sa_fast_v2.cpp -o sa_fast_local
./sa_fast_local submission.csv
```

## What NOT to Try
- ❌ More Python-based SA (too slow)
- ❌ Constraint programming with simplified constraints
- ❌ Multi-start from random configurations
- ❌ Ensemble from existing data (already at ceiling)
- ❌ Any approach that doesn't use extended C++ optimization

## Key Insight

The gap to target (1.446 points, 2.10%) is achievable but requires:
1. **Extended optimization time** - hours, not minutes
2. **Sophisticated optimizer** - bbox3 with its advanced physics simulation
3. **Focus on high-impact N values** - N=1-20 contribute disproportionately

The compiled bbox3_local binary is our best chance to break through the public ceiling.

## SUBMIT AFTER RUNNING BBOX3

Even if the improvement is small, SUBMIT IT! We need LB feedback to calibrate our progress.
