## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.316492 from exp_022 (strict_ensemble)
- Best LB score: 70.3165 (verified)
- Target: 68.870074 | Gap to target: 1.446 points (2.06%)
- Submissions: 13/100 used, 87 remaining

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: WE ARE AT THE PUBLIC SOLUTION CEILING

After 33 experiments:
1. Our score (70.316492) matches the BEST available public solution
2. ALL external sources (283+ CSV files) have been exhausted
3. 13 consecutive experiments found ZERO improvement
4. The solution is at a BOUNDARY OPTIMUM - perturbation methods cannot improve it

## ⛔ FORBIDDEN (PROVEN NOT TO WORK)
- Local search (SA, gradient, Powell, Nelder-Mead) - boundary optimum
- Random restart with different configurations - all worse
- Exhaustive search for small N - baseline already optimal
- NFP-based placement - no improvement
- Backward propagation - no improvement
- Fractional translation - no improvement
- Jostle algorithm - no improvement
- Lattice/interlock patterns - all worse
- ANY ensemble from existing sources - all exhausted

## ✅ REQUIRED: EXTENDED BBOX3 OPTIMIZATION

The ONLY remaining path is extended optimization. Top teams run bbox3 for HOURS or DAYS.

### EXPERIMENT 033: EXTENDED BBOX3 OPTIMIZATION

**MANDATORY STEPS:**

1. **Run bbox3 for 2+ hours on N=1-30** (highest impact on score)
```bash
cd /home/code/data/external
for n in $(seq 1 30); do
    timeout 7200 ./bbox3 -n $n -i /home/submission/submission.csv -o output_n${n}.csv
done
```

2. **Track per-N improvements**
```python
for n in range(1, 31):
    new_score = compute_score_for_n(output, n)
    if new_score < baseline_scores[n]:
        print(f"N={n}: IMPROVED by {baseline_scores[n] - new_score:.6f}")
```

3. **Create ensemble from best per-N**
- Keep baseline for N values where bbox3 didn't improve
- Use bbox3 output for N values where it improved

4. **SUBMIT the result** - we need LB feedback

### WHY THIS APPROACH

- Top teams have 900+ submissions and run optimization for DAYS
- We've only run bbox3 for minutes, not hours
- Extended optimization can find improvements that quick runs miss
- Even small improvements (0.001 per N) accumulate to significant gains

### EXPECTED OUTCOME

- If bbox3 finds improvements: Score will decrease
- If no improvements after 2+ hours: We've truly hit the ceiling
- Either way, we get valuable information

### ALTERNATIVE: CONSTRAINT PROGRAMMING

If extended bbox3 doesn't work, implement constraint programming:
```python
from ortools.sat.python import cp_model

model = cp_model.CpModel()
# Variables: x, y, angle for each tree
# Constraints: no overlaps (using NFP)
# Objective: minimize bounding box
```

This is a fundamentally different approach that models the problem as constraints.

## SUBMIT STRATEGY

With 87 submissions remaining:
- SUBMIT every experiment that produces a valid submission
- LB feedback is our learning signal
- Even if CV is same, LB might be different

## KEY METRICS TO TRACK

1. Per-N scores before and after optimization
2. Total runtime for each N
3. Number of N values improved
4. Total improvement in points

## DO NOT

- ❌ Run another variation of SA/gradient/local search
- ❌ Try another ensemble from existing sources
- ❌ Implement another constructive heuristic
- ❌ Give up - the target IS reachable with extended optimization
