## Current Status
- Best CV score: 70.316492 from exp_022 (strict ensemble)
- Best LB score: 70.3165 (verified)
- Target: 68.870074 | Gap: 1.446 points (2.06%)

## CRITICAL SITUATION ANALYSIS

After 35 experiments, we have hit the **PUBLIC SOLUTION CEILING**:
- All 6,188 snapshot CSV files processed
- All public optimizers (bbox3, sa_fast, tree_packer) exhausted
- bbox3 ran for 12 minutes with 50K iterations → ZERO improvement
- 15 consecutive experiments with no meaningful improvement

**The current score (70.316) is the BEST achievable with public methods.**

## What We Know Works
1. N=1 is ALREADY OPTIMAL at 45° (score 0.661250) - cannot improve
2. Ensemble of best per-N from all sources = current best
3. All local search methods fail (SA, gradient, Powell, Nelder-Mead)
4. All global search methods fail (differential evolution, multi-start)
5. All constructive methods produce worse scores than ensemble

## What We Know DOESN'T Work
- Running bbox3/sa_fast longer → same score
- Different parameters on same optimizer → same score
- Ensembling more public solutions → already at ceiling
- Local perturbations → solution is at boundary optimum

## Response to Evaluator

The evaluator correctly identifies that we've reached the PUBLIC SOLUTION CEILING. Their analysis is accurate:
- 15 consecutive experiments with no improvement
- bbox3 found 0.0000% improvement in 12 minutes
- The solution is at the boundary of the feasible region

However, I disagree with the suggestion to run bbox3 for 24+ hours. The log shows 0.0000% improvement for ALL N values - more time won't help when the optimizer can't find ANY direction to improve.

## THE BREAKTHROUGH INSIGHT

The target (68.87) is 2.06% better than current (70.32). This gap CANNOT be closed by:
- Running optimizers longer
- Trying different optimization algorithms
- Ensembling more public solutions

**The gap requires NOVEL PACKING STRATEGIES not available in public kernels.**

## NEXT EXPERIMENT: TESSELLATION-BASED PACKING

The discussion "For Large N Use Tessellations" (Chris Deotte, 58 votes) suggests a fundamentally different approach. Instead of optimizing individual tree positions, use **periodic tessellation patterns**.

### Approach: Hexagonal/Diamond Tessellation

For large N (N > 50), trees can be packed more efficiently using tessellation patterns:

```python
# Tessellation approach for large N
def create_tessellation_packing(n, pattern='hexagonal'):
    """
    Create a tessellation-based packing for N trees.
    
    Patterns:
    - 'hexagonal': Trees in hexagonal grid with alternating orientations
    - 'diamond': Trees in diamond pattern (45° rotated grid)
    - 'brick': Offset rows like bricks
    """
    trees = []
    
    if pattern == 'hexagonal':
        # Hexagonal packing: each row offset by half the spacing
        row_height = 0.9  # Vertical spacing between rows
        col_width = 0.65  # Horizontal spacing
        
        row = 0
        placed = 0
        while placed < n:
            x_offset = (row % 2) * col_width / 2
            cols_in_row = int((n - placed) ** 0.5) + 1
            
            for col in range(cols_in_row):
                if placed >= n:
                    break
                x = col * col_width + x_offset
                y = row * row_height
                angle = 0 if (row + col) % 2 == 0 else 180
                trees.append((x, y, angle))
                placed += 1
            row += 1
    
    return trees
```

### Why This Might Work

1. **Tessellations exploit periodicity**: Regular patterns can achieve higher packing density than random optimization
2. **Different local optima**: Tessellation-based solutions are in a DIFFERENT basin than the current ensemble
3. **Scalable**: Works well for large N where individual optimization is expensive
4. **Proven in similar problems**: Hexagonal packing is optimal for circles

### Implementation Plan

1. **Test on N=50, N=100, N=150, N=200** first
2. Compare tessellation score vs current ensemble score for each N
3. If ANY N improves, keep that solution
4. Combine with current ensemble (best per-N selection)

## ALTERNATIVE: ASYMMETRIC PACKING SEARCH

The discussion "Why the winning solutions will be Asymmetric" (40 votes) suggests top competitors use asymmetric arrangements. Current solutions may be stuck in symmetric local optima.

### Approach: Asymmetric Perturbation

```python
def asymmetric_search(baseline_config, n):
    """
    Search for asymmetric improvements by breaking symmetry.
    """
    best = baseline_config
    best_score = compute_score(best)
    
    # Try breaking symmetry in different ways
    for i in range(len(best)):
        for j in range(i+1, len(best)):
            # Swap positions of trees i and j
            candidate = swap_trees(best, i, j)
            if is_valid(candidate):
                score = compute_score(candidate)
                if score < best_score:
                    best = candidate
                    best_score = score
    
    return best
```

## EXPERIMENT REQUIREMENTS

### MANDATORY: Test on Small N First
Before running on all 200 N values:
1. Test tessellation on N=50, N=100
2. Compare to baseline per-N scores
3. Only proceed if improvement > 0.001

### MANDATORY: Per-N Tracking
```python
improvements = []
for n in [50, 100, 150, 200]:
    tess_score = compute_tessellation_score(n)
    base_score = get_baseline_score(n)
    if tess_score < base_score:
        improvements.append((n, base_score - tess_score))
        print(f"✅ N={n}: IMPROVED by {base_score - tess_score:.6f}")
    else:
        print(f"❌ N={n}: No improvement")
```

### MANDATORY: Overlap Validation
Use integer-scaled coordinates for overlap checking:
```python
SCALE = 10**18
def validate_no_overlap(trees):
    # Scale to integers to avoid floating-point precision issues
    ...
```

## ⛔ FORBIDDEN (DO NOT DO)
- Running bbox3/sa_fast with "more iterations" - PROVEN NOT TO WORK
- Ensembling more public CSV files - ALREADY AT CEILING
- Local search on current solution - AT BOUNDARY OPTIMUM
- Any approach that produced < 0.01 improvement in last 15 experiments

## SUCCESS CRITERIA
- Find ANY N value where tessellation beats current ensemble
- Even 0.01 improvement on a single N is valuable
- Combine improvements with current ensemble for final submission

## SUBMIT AFTER EXPERIMENT
YES - submit to get LB feedback. We have 95 submissions remaining.
Even if total score is worse, we learn which N values improved.
