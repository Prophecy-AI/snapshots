## CRITICAL INSIGHT FROM LOOP 31

**THE SOLUTION IS AT THE BOUNDARY OF THE FEASIBLE REGION**

Gradient optimization (exp_031) proved definitively that:
1. L-BFGS-B, Powell, Nelder-Mead, SLSQP all find improvements (0.00001-0.14 per N)
2. BUT ALL improvements cause tree overlaps
3. This means ANY movement that reduces bounding box causes overlaps
4. The solution is NOT at an interior local optimum - it's at the BOUNDARY

**IMPLICATION**: Local optimization CANNOT improve this solution. We need fundamentally different configurations.

## What We've Learned (from 31 experiments)

### DOES NOT WORK:
- Simulated Annealing - no improvement, creates overlaps
- Exhaustive search for N=2 - baseline already optimal
- NFP placement - no improvement
- Multi-start random - random configs 73% worse
- Branch and bound - no improvement
- Lattice packing - no improvement
- Interlock patterns - no improvement
- Jostle algorithm - no improvement
- BLF constructive - no improvement
- Gradient optimization - proves boundary optimum

### WHAT PARTIALLY WORKS:
- Ensemble from snapshots - improved from 70.615 to 70.316 (0.3 points)
- But snapshot mining is exhausted - only 0.001 points remaining

## Response to Evaluator

The evaluator correctly identified that the solution is at the BOUNDARY of the feasible region. Local optimization is futile. We need fundamentally different configurations.

## ⛔ FORBIDDEN (WILL BE REJECTED)
- bbox3, sa_fast, eazy_optimizer, tree_packer - FORBIDDEN
- subprocess.run() or os.system() - FORBIDDEN
- Running ANY binary or executable - FORBIDDEN
- Any more local optimization experiments - PROVEN FUTILE

## Next Experiment: VERY LONG GLOBAL SEARCH WITH DIFFERENT INITIAL CONFIGURATIONS

### APPROACH: Random Restart Global Search + Tessellation Patterns

The key insight from research is that escaping boundary optima requires:
1. **Jostling/Kicking** - large perturbations to escape local optima
2. **Different initial configurations** - not starting from current solution
3. **Global search** - not local refinement

### SPECIFIC IMPLEMENTATION:

```python
# EXPERIMENT 032: Random Restart Global Search

# Strategy 1: Generate COMPLETELY DIFFERENT initial configurations
def generate_random_config(n, seed):
    """Generate a random valid configuration for N trees"""
    np.random.seed(seed)
    trees = []
    angles = np.random.uniform(0, 360, n)
    order = np.random.permutation(n)
    
    for i in order:
        x, y = find_blf_position(trees, angles[i])
        trees.append((x, y, angles[i]))
    return trees

# Generate 100 different initial configurations
# Run SA on each for 10000 iterations
# Keep best per-N across all restarts

# Strategy 2: Tessellation-based initial configs
patterns = ['hexagonal', 'square', 'diagonal', 'spiral', 'concentric']
for pattern in patterns:
    config = generate_tessellation(n, pattern)
    # Optimize from this starting point
```

### FOCUS ON SMALL N FIRST

Small N values (N=1-10) contribute 6.2% of total score.
For N=2-5, try EXHAUSTIVE search over:
- All angle combinations (0-360° in 1° steps)
- All relative positions (grid search)

### VALIDATION

Before submitting, verify:
1. No overlaps (use integer arithmetic with SCALE=10^18)
2. Correct row counts for each N
3. Score calculation matches expected

## SUBMIT STRATEGY

With 95 submissions remaining, submit EVERY experiment that produces a valid submission.
Even if CV is worse, LB feedback is valuable.
