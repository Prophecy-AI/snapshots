    "- N=200: 73% efficiency\n",
    "- All bounding boxes are already SQUARE (rotation optimized)\n",

    "### 3. What Would It Take to Reach Target?\n",
    "- Need ~2% improvement across ALL N values\n",
    "- Or ~10% improvement on specific N ranges\n",
    "- Average improvement needed per N: 0.007220\n",

    "- They have 900+ submissions to iterate\n",
    "- Reaching 68.89 may require resources beyond what's available\n",

    "### Option 2: Try Fundamentally Different Approaches\n",

    "- **Different tessellation patterns**: Current uses 2-angle pattern, try 3 or 4 angles\n",

    "Given:\n",
    "1. 9 consecutive experiments with ZERO improvement\n",
    "2. Extended optimization found only 0.0000003 improvement\n",

    "\n",
    "**The current approach has reached its limit.**\n",

    "To make progress, we need to:\n",
    "1. Implement a CONSTRUCTIVE algorithm that builds solutions from scratch\n",
    "2. Focus on medium N (21-100) where there might be room for improvement\n",
    "3. Try different tessellation patterns for large N"
