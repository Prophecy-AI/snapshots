      "finding": "Two\u2011dimensional polygon packing that seeks the smallest enclosing rectangle (bounding box) is typically tackled with a blend of exact geometric constructions and heuristic/meta\u2011heuristic searches.  The most widely used exact frameworks are **no\u2011fit polygon (NFP)\u2011based methods** and **mixed\u2011integer programming (MIP)** formulations; the NFP, often built via a Minkowski sum or decomposition algorithm, enumerates all feasible relative placements of two polygons and feeds them to a placement heuristic, while MIP encodes non\u2011overlap constraints and directly minimizes the box area ([Frontiers](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/mechanical-engineering/articles/10.3389/fmech.2022.966691/full); [MDPI](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/13/22/12474)).  For irregular shapes, the **envelope\u2011polygon** and **pixel\u2011based** approaches are also common: the envelope method wraps each part in a simple shape (e.g., convex hull) to prune the search space, whereas pixel counting provides a fast overlap test th",
