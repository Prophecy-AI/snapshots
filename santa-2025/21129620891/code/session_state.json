      "finding": "Two\u2011dimensional irregular polygon packing \u2013 often called irregular strip or bin packing \u2013 seeks a layout of arbitrarily shaped polygons inside a rectangular sheet (or a set of sheets) while minimizing waste or the number of bins used. Because the geometry of each piece influences both feasibility and quality of a solution, the problem is NP\u2011hard and is typically tackled with a blend of constructive heuristics, local\u2011search/meta\u2011heuristic refinements, and, for small instances, exact methods\u202f([Frontiers review](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmech.2022.966691/full)).\n\nAmong the most successful approaches are:\n\n* **Constructive placement heuristics** \u2013 the classic bottom\u2011left (BL) rule and its variants provide a fast initial sequence; the Djang\u2011Finch selection heuristic (DJD) adapted for irregular shapes, when coupled with a placement routine, yields significantly better packings than conventional selectors\u202f([Springer article](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10479",

      "finding": "The no\u2011fit polygon (NFP) is a geometric construct that represents **all relative positions at which two planar polygons can be placed without intersecting**.  In a 2\u2011D packing or nesting problem the NFP of a \u201cmoving\u201d piece\u202fA with respect to a fixed piece\u202fB defines the feasible region for the reference point of\u202fA; any point inside the NFP corresponds to a placement where the two shapes do not overlap, while points outside would cause a collision.  Because the NFP reduces a continuous overlap test to a simple point\u2011in\u2011polygon query, it is a cornerstone of irregular cutting\u2011stock and nesting algorithms\u202f([Computers & Operations Research](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0305054806000669); [Elsevier](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0377221706012379)).\n\nMost modern NFP generators are based on **Minkowski sums** or on **sliding/orbital methods** that trace the interaction of the two polygon boundaries.
