      "text": "The no\u2011fit polygon (NFP) is a geometric construct that represents **all relative positions at which two planar polygons can be placed without intersecting**.  In a 2\u2011D packing or nesting problem the NFP of a \u201cmoving\u201d piece\u202fA with respect to a fixed piece\u202fB defines the feasible region for the reference point of\u202fA; any point inside the NFP corresponds to a placement where the two shapes do not overlap, while points outside would cause a collision.  Because the NFP reduces a continuous overlap test to a simple point\u2011in\u2011polygon query, it is a cornerstone of irregular cutting\u2011stock and nesting algorithms\u202f([Computers & Operations Research](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0305054806000669); [Elsevier](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0377221706012379)).\n\nMost modern NFP generators are based on **Minkowski sums** or on **sliding/orbital methods** that trace the interaction of the two polygon boundaries.  The Minkowski\u2011sum approach treats the NFP as the sum of polygon\u202fA and the reflected polygon\u202fB, and then removes interior edges to expose holes, slits and lock\u2011and\u2011key positions\u202f([PDF from Southampton](https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/36850/1/CORMSIS-05-05.pdf)).  An alternative \u201corbital\u201d or sliding algorithm moves one polygon around the other, recording the sequence of edge\u2011to\u2011edge contacts (trace line segments) that form the outer boundary of the NFP; degenerate cases such as interlocking concavities or internal holes are handled by discarding interior trace segments and explicitly identifying holes\u202f([Burke\u202fet\u202fal., 2006](https://www.graham-kendall.com/papers/bhkw2007.pdf); [Rao\u202f&\u202fLuo, 2022](https://www.mdpi.com/2227-7390/10/16/2941)).  The resulting polygon can be stored as an ordered list of vertices or edges, enabling fast collision checks during the search for optimal packings.\n\nIn practice the NFP is pre\u2011computed for every pair of part shapes (and for each allowed rotation) and then used by heuristic or exact packing solvers to explore placement candidates efficiently.  By converting a complex geometric overlap problem into a lookup of feasible translation vectors, the NFP technique dramatically speeds up 2\u2011D irregular polygon packing, making it feasible for industrial nesting applications such as textile, sheet\u2011metal and glass cutting\u202f([Dean\u202fet\u202fal., 2004](https://nestprofessor.com/articles/An%20improved%20method%20for%20calculating%20the%20no-fit%20polygon(Automatic%20nesting%20software).pdf)).",

Although the concept was first described in 1966, it was not until the early 90s that the general trend of research moved away from direct trigonometry to favour the nofit polygon. Since then, the ability to calculate the nofit polygon has practically become a pre-requisite for researching irregular packing problems. However, realization of this concept in the form of a robust algorithm is a highly challenging task with few instructive approaches published. In this paper, a procedure using the [mathematical concept](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/mathematical-concept) of Minkowski sums for the calculation of the nofit polygon is presented. The described procedure is more robust than other approaches using Minkowski sum knowledge and includes details of the removal of internal edges to find holes, slits and lock and key positions. The procedure is tested on benchmark data sets and gives examples of complicated cases.\n\n### Scope and purpose\n\nCutting and packing problems involving irregular shapes feature in a wide variety of manufacturing processes. Automated solution techniques that can generate packing arrangements more efficiently than current technology that employs user intervention, must be able to handle the complex geometry that arises from these problems. The nofit polygon has been demonstrated to be an effective tool in providing efficient handling of the geometric characteristics of these problems. The paper presents a new algorithmic procedure for deriving this tool.\n\n## Introduction\n\nCutting and packing problems involving irregular shapes are common in a variety of manufacturing processes. They occur whenever a piece of irregular shape is to be cut from a sheet of stock material. Examples include dye-cutting in the engineering sector, parts nesting for shipbuilding, marker layout in the garment industry, and leather cutting for shoes, furniture and other goods. The paper specifically addresses the geometric calculations required for tackling these problems. Here we consider that shapes are irregular if they are; polygonal, i.e no arcs; simple, i.e. non-self-intersecting; and non-rectangular. Even when all the components are rectangular the problem of finding layouts that minimize waste is known to be NP-hard. Where irregular components are involved an extra dimension of complexity is generated by the geometry.\n\nThe precise requirements of a good layout will differ from industry to industry and this has led to a variety of algorithmic approaches. In spite of their differences, all the methods have a common requirement in which they need to be able to identify whether a layout is feasible or not, i.e. do any of the pieces overlap. Early research handled this problem in a number of ways. Adamowicz and Albano \\[1\\] chose to nest pieces into simpler shapes where the geometry can be more easily calculated. If the shapes are used directly then the intersection of pieces can be handled by direct trigonometric approaches such as the D function \\[2\\], \\[3\\]. Alternatively the stock sheet and the pieces can be approximated as grid squares, often referred to as the raster method. Hence, if a piece occupies, fully or partially, a grid square it is coded as occupied \\[4\\], \\[5\\].\n\nAlthough all these approaches have merit, it is widely recognized that the nofit polygon (NFP) is more efficient, provided you have a robust and efficient NFP generator, and has become the principle approach for handling the geometry in nesting problems. Unfortunately, some researchers believe that despite the value of this tool, its introduction may have stifled research into this variant of packing problems. W\u00e4scher et al. \\[6\\] report that there have been only 21 publications in irregular problems in the last 10 years. Researchers attribute this to the fact that the realization of the NFP as a robust algorithm is, in itself, a highly challenging task. Those considering embarking on research into irregular shaped packing may be discouraged by the significant investment of time required in first developing an NFP generator. Hence, it is essential that robust and easily realizable algorithms are available in order to facilitate new interest into this important problem.\n\nThe primary purpose of this paper is to introduce a new procedure for calculating the NFP. The method is developed from the theory of Minkowski sums \\[7\\] and builds on the principles proposed by Ghosh \\[8\\], \\[9\\] and by Bennell et al. \\[10\\]. Further, the paper includes an algorithmic procedure for eliciting the true boundary of the NFP, including holes, slits and exact fits. It should be noted that the polygons considered in this paper are two-dimensional and restricted to translational motion i.e. rotations are not considered. The next section outlines the most commonly cited approaches for calculating the NFP and points out their positive features and disadvantages. Section 3 reviews in more detail the Minkowski sum approach. This is followed by a description of our new procedure based on Minkowski sums. Section 5, develops our approach for removing redundant internal points and therefore identifying the true boundary. In both cases the full algorithmic steps are provided. Finally, we develop some theoretical and empirical analysis of the approach to demonstrate its robustness with respect to being capable of handling all combinations of simple polygons.\n\n## Section snippets\n\n## Documented approaches for generating the nofit polygon\n\nThe NFP is a combination of the properties of two component polygons that, as a result, represents all the relative positions of the two polygons in which they either touch or overlap. It is well documented that the NFP can reduce the complexity of detecting overlap between two pieces from O(nm+n+m), where n and m are the number of edges in each polygon, obtained from direct trigonometry, to a simple point inclusion test of O(k), where k is the number of edges in the NFP.

Despite its relevance to industry, research publications are relatively low when compared to other cutting and packing problems. One explanation offered is the perceived difficulty and substantial time investment of developing a geometric tool box to assess computer generated solutions. In this paper we set out to provide a tutorial covering the core geometric methodologies currently employed by researchers in cutting and packing of irregular shapes. The paper is not designed to be an exhaustive survey of the literature but instead will draw on the literature to illustrate the theory and implementation of the approaches. We aim to provide a sufficiently instructive description to equip new and current researchers in the area to select the most appropriate methodology for their needs.\n## Introduction\nCutting and packing problems involving irregular shapes arise in a wide variety of industries including; garment manufacturing, sheet metal cutting, furniture making and shoe manufacturing. An example of a layout from the garment manufacturing industry is provided in Fig. 1. As a result the range of problem variants involving irregular shapes, referred to here as nesting problems, is a core area of research in the field of cutting and packing. The problem is NP-complete and as a result solution methodologies predominantly utilise heuristics. A further defining characteristic of nesting problems is the requirement to develop powerful geometric tools to handle the wide variety and complexity of shapes that need to be packed. In this paper we propose to provide detailed explanations of the most popular techniques for handling the geometry when solving nesting problems and provide guidance on their implementation, strengths and weaknesses.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized in six sections. In the next section the nesting problem is defined more precisely and the key differences between nesting problems and other cutting and packing problems are highlighted. In particular, the importance of the geometry is explained. In Section 3 geometric approaches based on pixel or raster representations are introduced. In Section 4 the concept of the*D*function is presented including algorithms to handle geometric tasks that use this function. In the following section, the nofit polygon is introduced and two different algorithms for its generation are described, one based on the sliding analogy and another using Minkowski sums. Polygon decomposition is also discussed in this section. In Section 6 the concept of Phi function is presented with illustrative examples.\n## Section snippets\n## Problem definition\nNesting problems are one of many terms used to identify the group of problems that will be discussed. A discussion of nomenclature is beyond the scope of this paper, however, it is helpful to identify the other names under which these problems are referenced. Some commonly used terms are irregular shape stock cutting, irregular packing, polygon placement, marker making, non-convex cutting stock, 2-D packing problems or some combination of any of these terms. The term*nesting problems*is adopted\n## Pixel/raster method\nRaster methods are approaches that divide the continuous stock sheet into discrete areas, hence reducing the geometric information to coding the data by a grid represented by a matrix. However, different authors have used different codification schemes, which are largely driven by the placement algorithm that will use this geometric information.\nOliveira and Ferreira (1993) propose the simplest coding scheme that uses the value of 1 to code the existence of piece and the value of 0 to denote the\n## Direct trigonometry and the*D*function\nGiven that the raster representation cannot accurately represent the irregular shape of the pieces, the alternative is to use the polygons directly. When representing the pieces as polygons the amount of information is proportional to the number of vertices and does not depend on the absolute size of the pieces or of the layout. However unlike the raster method, the feasibility or quality of a placement is not implied by the geometry and as a result another evaluation method must be employed.\n## The nofit polygon\nThe nofit polygon has become an increasingly popular option for dealing with the geometry since it is more efficient than direct trigonometry, particularly when using an iterative search, yet shares the benefit of accuracy by using the original edges of the polygon. In addition, the concept opens up new options for placement strategies. In essence the NFP is a polygon derived from aggregating the two component polygons. It can be used, along with the vector difference of the position of the two\n## Phi function\nThe phi-function is the most recent innovation in dealing with the geometric issues for nesting problems. Its purpose is to represent all mutual positions of two objects (in this context polygons), and therefore it is often associated with the NFP. However, this association is misleading as the NFP is only a special case of the broader theory. The Phi-function for cutting and packing were conceived and applied by Stoyan et al., 2001, Stoyan et al., 2004 and this research group continue to be\n## Conclusion\nThe paper has given a detailed description of the operations of a number of different approaches for dealing with the geometry required in the solution of nesting problems, these are; the raster method, direct trigonometry, the Nofit polygon and phi-functions. Each has its advantages and limitations and a common theme is that the more computationally efficient the approach the more complex it is to realise. There is no doubt that there is a sign...",

The improved algorithm can cope with complex cases and is given an implementation in detail. The proposed concept of a touching group can simplify the judging process when recognizing the potential translation vector for an orbital polygon. In addition, the generation of the no-fit polygon only involves three main steps based on the proposed concept. The proposed algorithm has a mechanism that searches other start positions to generate a complete no-fit polygon for handling complex cases. To improve the efficiency, many acceleration strategies have been proposed, such as point exclusion strategy and point inclusion test. The robust and efficient performance of the algorithm is tested by well-known benchmark instances and degenerate and complex cases, such as holes, interlocking concavities and jigsaw-type pieces. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can produce complete no-fit polygons for complex cases, and acceleration strategies can reduce the creation time of no-fit polygon on benchmark instances by more than sixteen percent on average.\nKeywords:\n[no-fit polygon](https://www.mdpi.com/search?q=no-fit+polygon);[irregular packing problem](https://www.mdpi.com/search?q=irregular+packing+problem);[sliding algorithm](https://www.mdpi.com/search?q=sliding+algorithm);[cutting](https://www.mdpi.com/search?q=cutting);[configuration space obstacle](https://www.mdpi.com/search?q=configuration+space+obstacle)\nMSC:\n90; 68; 51\n## 1. Introduction\nIn the field of cutting and packing problems, there is a kind of problem known as the two-dimensional (2D) irregular packing problem or the nesting problem. It is commonly encountered in many industries and applications, such as metal sheet cutting [1,2], leather [3], clothing [4], paper [5] and spatial arrangement [6]. Through excellent algorithms to optimize the packing, even a one percent increase in the material utilization rate will save lots of resource costs for enterprises and generate huge economic benefits for the whole society. Despite the many practical applications and benefits, the problem has received relatively little attention in the literature when compared to the regular packing problem [7,8,9]. One of the main reasons is that researchers have to deal with the geometry problem, which is the first obstacle they encounter. This means that satisfying the constraint of having all irregular pieces without overlapping is much harder than regular pieces.\nDirect trigonometry involving line intersection and point inclusion testing is the classic method to identify the positional relationship between two polygons. However, the optimization algorithms will become inefficient when it adopts this method, which results in the slightly poor performance of the algorithms. The alternative used in irregular packing problems is the no-fit polygon (NFP), which is also used in the field of engineering and robot motion planning and the aircraft parking stand allocation problem [10]. The no-fit polygon facilitates the research of irregular packing problems [11,12,13,14]. It is an increasingly popular option since it is more efficient than direct trigonometry, particularly when using an iterative search. Determining whether polygons overlap, touch, or are separated only needs to conduct a simple test to identify whether the reference point is inside the NFP. Essentially, the no-fit polygon describes the region in which two polygons intersect. The computational efficiency gained by utilizing this method is very attractive. Hence, it is important to develop an algorithm for creating NFP for the research of irregular packing problems. The algorithm can enrich the application in 2D geometrical computer software.\nHowever, there are few published works on algorithms for generating NFP. Note the fact that developing a robust geometry library is still needed, and this task is very time-consuming and difficult. Furthermore, it is difficult to develop a robust NFP generator because of the complexity of irregular piece shapes. Thus, we propose an improved sliding algorithm for the generation of NFP and give an implementation in detail of our algorithm. Such an algorithm can become good preparation for applying more strategies to solve the irregular packing problem. For instance, in the work published by Costa et al. [15], if the NFP algorithm is efficient, it can directly calculate the new merged piece instead of approximating by one already computed because of this time-consuming operation. In other words, the more efficient the algorithm is, the better.\nThe proposed algorithm only involves two simple geometric stages. The first is generating the external NFP between two polygons, which includes three main steps: finding the touching group, determining the translation vector from all touching groups and computing the translation distance. The second stage is searching on the unvisited edges to determine whether there is a feasible starting point that can be found. If the starting point is available, then return to the first stage to generate the NFP.\nThe contributions of this study are:\n* To address the problem of the efficient and robust creation of the no-fit polygon;\n* To propose an improved sliding algorithm and provide a detailed implementation;\n* To present the concept of touching group, resulting in the number of cases to consider being reduced by half when determining the feasible translation vector;\n* To develop many acceleration strategies to improve the algorithm\u2019s efficiency, such as the point exclusion strategy, the right side test, and the point inclusion test;\n* To assess the performance of the proposed alg...",

INTRODUCTION\nThe paper specifically addresses the geometric calculations required for tackling\ncutting and packing problems involving irregular shapes. Such problems are common in\nmanufacturing processes and occur whenever a piece of irregular shape is to be cut from\na sheet of stock material. Examples include dye-cutting in the engineering sector, parts\nnesting for shipbuilding, marker layout in the garment industry, and leather cutting for\nshoes, furniture and other goods. Here we consider that shapes are irregular if they are;\npolygonal, i.e no arcs; simple, i.e. do not self-cross; and non-rectangular. Even when all\nthe components are rectangular the problem of finding layouts that minimize waste is\nknown to be NP-hard. Where irregular components are involved an extra dimension of\ncomplexity is generated by the geometry.\nThe precise requirements of a good layout will differ from industry to industry and\nthis has lead to a variety of algorithmic approaches. In spite of their differences, all the\nmethods have a common requirement in which they need to be able to identify whether a\nlayout is feasible or not, i.e. do any of the pieces overlap. Early research handled this\nproblem in a number of ways. Adamowicz and Albano (1976) chose to nest pieces into\nsimpler shapes where the geometry can be more easily calculated. If the shapes are used\ndirectly then the intersection of pieces can be handled by direct trigonometric approaches\nsuch as the D function (Mehadavan, 1984; Konopasek, 1981). Alternatively the stock\nsheet and the pieces can be approximated as grid squares, often referred to as the raster\nmethod. Hence, if a piece occupies, fully or partially, a grid square it is coded as occupied\n(Oliveira and Ferreira, 1993; Babu and Babu, 2001).\n4\nAlthough all these approaches have merit, it is widely recognized that the nofit\npolygon (NFP) is more efficient, provided you have a robust and efficient NFP generator,\nand has become the principle approach for handling the geometry in nesting problems.\nUnfortunately, some researchers believe that despite the value of this tool, its introduction\nmay have stifled research into this variant of packing problems. W\u00e4scher, Hau\u00dfner and\nSchumann (2005) reports that there have been only 21 publications in irregular problems\nin the last 10 years. Researchers attribute this to the fact that the realization of the NFP as\na robust algorithm is, in itself, a highly challenging task. Those considering embarking on\nresearch into irregular shaped packing may be discouraged by the significant investment\nof time required in first developing an NFP generator. Hence, it is essential that robust\nand easily realizable algorithms are available in order to facilitate new interest into this\nimportant problem.\nThe primary purpose of this paper is to introduce a new procedure for calculating the\nNFP. The method is developed from the theory of Minkowski sums and builds on the\nprinciples proposed by Ghosh (1993) and by Bennell, Dowsland and Dowsland (2001).\nFurther, the paper includes an algorithmic procedure for eliciting the true boundary of the\nNFP, including holes, slits and exact fits. The next section outlines the most commonly\ncited approaches for calculating the NFP and points out their positive features and\ndisadvantages. Section 3 reviews in more detail the Minkowski sum approach. This is\nfollowed by a description of our new procedure based on Minkowski sums. Section 5,\ndevelops our approach for removing redundant internal points and therefore identifying\nthe true boundary. In both cases the full algorithmic steps are provided. Section 6 outlines\n5\nthe modification required in order to determine the inner-fit polygon. Finally, we develop\nsome theoretical and empirical analysis of the approach to demonstrate its robustness.\n2. DOCUMENTED APPROACHES FOR GENERATING THE NOFIT\nPOLYGON\nThe nofit polygon (NFP) is a combination of the properties of two component\npolygons that, as a result, represents all the relative positions of the two polygons in\nwhich they either touch or overlap. It is well documented that the NFP can reduce the\ncomplexity of detecting overlap between two pieces from O(nm+n+m), where n and m\nare the number of edges in each polygon, obtained from direct trigonometry, to a simple\npoint inclusion test of O(k), where k is the number of edges in the NFP. Full explanations\nof the concept can be found in (Mehadevan, 1984; Ghosh, 1991; Bennell, 1998; Bennell\nDowsland and Dowsland, 2001), where the most intuitive description is found in\nCunningham-Green (1989), who describes the motion of one polygon sliding around the\nboundary of the other; often referred to as the orbiting method. Figure 1a and 1b\nillustrates the motion of polygon B, the orbiting polygon, sliding around A, the fixed\npolygon, tracing the locus of a reference point on B. He also notes that when both\npolygons are convex, the NFP is an exact replication of the edges of both polygons, with\nopposite orientation, sorted into their slope order. Figure 1c shows the edges of both\npolygons, where A has counterclockwise orientation and B has clockwise orientation,\nsorted into slope order; these can be directly mapped onto the NFP in figure 1b. Note that\nthis role and orientation of polygons A and B will be adopted for the remainder of the\npaper. Cunningham-Green\u2019s (1989) observations underpin two of the most common\n6\napproaches to generating the NFP; the orbiting method that simulates the sliding motion,\nand Minkowski sums that sort the edges according to the the slope order and edge\nprecedence, i.e the sequential order of edges around the polygons. A further approach\ncommonly employed is that of decomposition. A brief description of each is provided\nhere.\nFigure 1: The locus of the reference point on B traces the NFP as it slides around A.\nThis is equivalent to connecting the edges in slope order.\nMinkowski sum\nClearly, when both component polygons are convex the NFP is very simple to\ncalculate by sorting the edges into slope order.

There\nhave been many different strategies for producing solutions to the irregular stock cutting problem.

Survey papers can\nbe found in (Dowsland and Dowsland, 1992; Sweeney and Paternoster, 1992; Dyckhoff, 1990). However, the\nfeature that connects all of the approaches is that they are all required to cope with the geometry of the prob\u0002lem. This can be especially complicated when highly irregular shapes are used which may include holes or con\u0002cavities. The implementation of robust and efficient geometry routines can be laborious and can often take\nconsiderably longer than the packing strategies themselves. In particular, the geometry must handle all of\nthe interactions between shapes such as detecting whether two shapes are overlapping and calculating the\ntranslation distance required in a given direction so that the overlap is resolved. As we show in the following\nsection, although these tests can be implemented using trigonometric techniques, the no-fit polygon represents\na considerably more efficient solution.\nWhilst the generation of the no-fit polygon is academically challenging, it is a \u2018tool\u2019 and not a \u2018solution\u2019 and\nthis is perhaps one of the reasons why there are many publications in the literature which state that the no-fit\npolygon is used but which provide relatively little or no details on its implementation. In this paper we con\u0002centrate specifically on the no-fit polygon and provide an overview of the previous techniques that have been\nused for its creation. Furthermore, we describe and provide full implementation details for a new robust orbi\u0002tal approach that can cope with the traditional problem cases that many other approaches cannot handle.\nHopefully this will help in the further dissemination of the benefits of using the no-fit polygon (as opposed\nto traditional trigonometry based approaches) within both the industrial and the academic communities.\n2. The no-fit polygon \u2013 an overview\nIn this section we describe the functionality of the no-fit polygon and we compare it to the more traditional\ntrigonometric based overlap and intersection tests. We also give brief overviews of the many techniques that\nhave been used to generate no-fit polygons within the previous literature.\n2.1. The no-fit polygon\nThe first application of no-fit polygon techniques within the field of cutting and packing was presented by\nArt (1966), although the term \u2018\u2018shape envelop\u2019\u2019 was used. It was ten years later that the term \u2018\u2018no-fit polygon\u2019\u2019\nwas introduced by Adamowicz and Albano who approached the irregular stock cutting problem by using no\u0002fit polygons to pack shapes together using their minimum enclosing rectangles (Adamowicz and Albano,\n1976). The term \u2018\u2018configuration space obstacle\u2019\u2019 is often used to denote the NFP within the field of engineering\nand robot motion planning but the term has also been used with respect to cutting and packing in (Cuningh\u0002ame-Green, 1989). The \u2018\u2018hodograph\u2019\u2019 is often used to describe the no-fit polygon within the mathematics com\u0002munity (Stoyan and Ponomarenko, 1977; Scheithauer and Terno, 1993; Bennell et al., 2001). The main\nfunction of the no-fit polygon is to describe the region in which two polygons intersect. The following example\ngives an overview of the NFP construct.\nGiven two polygons, A and B, the no-fit polygon can be found by tracing one shape around the boundary\nof another. One of the polygons remains fixed in position and the other traverses around the fixed polygon\u2019s\nedges whilst ensuring that the polygons always touch but never intersect. Throughout this paper we adopt the\nconvention of the first polygon being fixed and the second being the traversing/orbiting polygon. Therefore,\nwhen polygon B traces around the fixed polygon A, the resulting no-fit polygon is denoted by NFPAB. In order\nto create the NFPAB object we must choose a reference point from B which will be traced as B moves around\nA. In our implementations we use the first vertex, within the shape vertex list, as the reference point (see\nFig. 1). The reference point can be any arbitrary point providing it follows the movements of the orbiting poly\u0002gon. It is also important to maintain the relative position of the reference point with respect to polygon B as\nthis is required when using the NFP to test for overlap.\nIn order to test whether polygon B overlaps polygon A we use NFPAB and B\u2019s reference point. If polygon B\nis positioned so that its reference point is inside the polygon NFPAB then it overlaps with polygon A. If the\n28 E.K. Burke et al. / European Journal of Operational Research 179 (2007) 27\u201349\nreference point is on the boundary of NFPAB then polygon B touches polygon A. Finally, if the reference point\nis outside of NFPAB then polygons A and B do not overlap or touch (see Fig. 2). The no-fit polygon is used\nwithin the following papers from the literature (Grinde and Cavalier, 1995; Ramkumar, 1996; Cheng and Rao,...",

Introduction\nAn issue in two-dimensional packing is determining the set of feasible locations that one polygon\nmay take with respect to another polygon, such that the polygons do not overlap. This set of locations is\nknown as a no-fit polygon (NFP). The terms Minkowski sum, -function, hodograph, dilation, envelope\nand configuration space obstacle have also been used by other researchers.\nLet each polygon be represented by an ordered list of edges. The location of each polygon i in the\ntwo-dimensional plane is represented by a reference point, .

Polygon edge slope order is equivalent to NFP edge order.\nCunninghame-Green [2] showed that for the case when polygons A and B are convex, NFP[A, B] can\nbe created by ordering the edges of A and in increasing slope order.

[7] states that a polygon is convex if and only if it does not contain any turning points.\nOtherwise it is non-convex. The initial stage of Ghosh\u2019s approach is to sort all the edges of polygon A and polygon B by slope into\none list which we will call MergeList. If both polygon A and B are convex, then MergeList gives the edge\norder for NFP[A, B], and the method is equivalent to that of Cunninghame-Green [2]. Assuming polygon A is non-convex, and polygon B is convex, the method proceeds as follows:\nStarting in MergeList at the first edge of polygon A, visit the edges of A in order, and add them to\nthe list of edges (NFPList) which make up NFP[A, B]. If edge A is a turning point, then the direction of\ntravel along MergeList is reversed. Any edges of B which are passed are added to NFPList. B edges are\npositive if the direction of travel forward, and negative if the direction is backward. This continues until\nthe first edge of polygon A has been returned to. The resulting NFPList we will call GhoshList.

Following around the slope diagram, starting and finishing at 0, mimics the process of traversing\nover MergeList. The outer envelope of NFPList gives NFP[A, B] (see Fig. 7).\nGhosh\u2019s method works for all simple polygons (no holes) when polygon A is non-convex and polygon\nB is convex. The method also works when both polygons are non-convex, as long as no two cavities from\neither polygon interfere which each other. This occurs when an interval of MergeList has wrongly ordered\nedges from both polygons. When this does occur, this interval must be traversed in two or more parallel\npaths. Although the theory of traversal by parallel paths holds true for complex non-convex cases, there\nare considerable implementation problems in sorting out the paths. These difficulties led Bennell et al.\n[7] to seek a different approach.\nH.T. Dean et al. / Computers & Operations Research 33 (2006) 1521 \u2013 1539 1527\nThe calculation difficulties of Bennell\u2019s method has motivated development of a more robust and\nefficient method of calculating NFPs. Like Bennell\u2019s method, it exploits the fact that the NFP of a non\u0002convex polygon and a convex polygon can be easily and efficiently found by Ghosh\u2019s method. However,\nthe new method does not use dummy edges to replace cavities of B.\n3. A new method\nIntuitively, it would seem a good idea to modify Bennell\u2019s method to start \u201clooking\u201d for the next B\nedge of a cavity once an occurrence of the current B edge has been found, instead of continuing to look\nfor the furthest occurrence of that B edge. However, if there is more than one occurrence of a B edge in\nany given segment then this approach will run into difficulties.\nA solution to this is to make sure that each traversal segment contains only positive or negative occur\u0002rences of each B edge of a particular cavity. Replacing a B cavity with a dummy edge D will not guarantee\nthis (see Fig. 8).\nFig. 8 shows a dummy edge D, whose cavity is composed of edges 1 and 2. In this example, Bennell\u2019s\nmethod would require only one segment which would contain a single occurrence of D. However, this\nsegment contains both positive and negative occurrences of 1.\nTo guarantee that there is only positive or negative occurrences of a given cavity B edge, we split the\ntraversal of GhoshList using the algorithm given in Pseudo-code 3.1:\nThe position in GhoshList which corresponds to 0.\nTravelDir 1\nCurrentSign 1\nTravelSign 1\n1\nLoop1{\nTravelDir\nIf GhoshList PolygonType Then\nIf GhoshList PolygonIndex 0 And TravelDir 1 Then\nSeg i End\nExit Algorithm\nElse If GhoshList IsTurningPoint True Then\nTravelSign TravelSign 1\nSeg Start\nEnd If\nElse If GhoshList IsInCavity True And CurrentSign TravelSign\nThen\nTravelDir TravelDir 1\nSeg Start\nTravelSign TravelSign 1\nExit Loop1\nEnd If\n}\nH.T.

These problems usually consist of a number of irregular pieces that are to be placed onto one or more sheets of material in the most efficient layout possible, so that all pieces are assigned and do not overlap. Additionally, there are usually rotational constraints enforced on the pieces due to the physical properties of the problem such as grain on the material, patterns on textiles and the cutting technology being employed. Sometimes rotational constraints may be used for non-physical reasons such as to restrict pieces to a finite set of rotations thus simplifying layout construction procedures and allowing for faster solutions to be obtained. The two-dimensional stock cutting problem has been shown to be NP hard and is therefore intrinsically difficult to solve (Garey and Johnson, 1979). There have been many different strategies for producing solutions to the irregular stock cutting problem. These include linear programming approaches, heuristic placement methods, metaheuristic guided search techniques and other novel approaches such as the iterative jostling of pieces (Dowsland et al., 1998). Survey papers can be found in (Dowsland and Dowsland, 1992, Sweeney and Paternoster, 1992, Dyckhoff, 1990). However, the feature that connects all of the approaches is that they are all required to cope with the geometry of the problem. This can be especially complicated when highly irregular shapes are used which may include holes or concavities. The implementation of robust and efficient geometry routines can be laborious and can often take considerably longer than the packing strategies themselves. In particular, the geometry must handle all of the interactions between shapes such as detecting whether two shapes are overlapping and calculating the translation distance required in a given direction so that the overlap is resolved. As we show in the following section, although these tests can be implemented using trigonometric techniques, the no-fit polygon represents a considerably more efficient solution.\nWhilst the generation of the no-fit polygon is academically challenging, it is a \u2018tool\u2019 and not a \u2018solution\u2019 and this is perhaps one of the reasons why there are many publications in the literature which state that the no-fit polygon is used but which provide relatively little or no details on its implementation. In this paper we concentrate specifically on the no-fit polygon and provide an overview of the previous techniques that have been used for its creation. Furthermore, we describe and provide full implementation details for a new robust orbital approach that can cope with the traditional problem cases that many other approaches cannot handle. Hopefully this will help in the further dissemination of the benefits of using the no-fit polygon (as opposed to traditional trigonometry based approaches) within both the industrial and the academic communities.\n## Section snippets\n## The no-fit polygon \u2013an overview\nIn this section we describe the functionality of the no-fit polygon and we compare it to the more traditional trigonometric based overlap and intersection tests. We also give brief overviews of the many techniques that have been used to generate no-fit polygons within the previous literature.\n## The new no-fit polygon construction algorithm\nWe now describe our new approach for robust no-fit polygon generation through the use of orbital methods utilising standard trigonometrical techniques. For the intersection calculations within our presented implementation, it is important to use a robust geometry library. It is also beneficial to implement routines that are as fast and as close to optimal as possible in order to promote fast no-fit polygon generation and packing algorithms. We have implemented such a library. Although this can\n## Problem cases\nIn this section we discuss each of the problem cases that cause difficulties with other methods and show why our approach is able to handle them without specific case-by-case implementations. In each figure of this section we identify the stationary and orbiting polygons in dark and light grey shading respectively and we show the reference point of the orbiting polygon by a black dot. This is used to trace the loops of the no-fit polygon (which we number).

The NFP has in recent years become an important tool for handling the geometric calculations for two-dimensional irregular shape nesting problems. Its value lies in reducing the computational complexity of detecting whether two polygons overlap.

The NFP has in recent years become an important tool for handling the geometric calculations for two-dimensional irregular shape nesting problems. Its value lies in reducing the computational complexity of detecting whether two polygons overlap. The proposed NFP generator is based on the novel concept of trace line segments that are derived from the interaction of the two-component polygons. The complete set of the trace line segments contain all the boundary edges of the NFP and some internal points that need to be discarded. Algorithms for deriving the trace line segments, efficiently determining those segments that form the boundary of the NFP and the identification of holes and degenerate cases are described\nThis record has no associated files available for download.\n## More information\nPublished date:September 2007\n[Learn more about Management research](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/business-school/research/index.page)\n## Identifiers\nLocal EPrints ID:56836\nURI:http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/id/eprint/56836\nDOI:[doi:10.1057/palgrave.jors.2602255](http://dx.doi.org/10.1057/palgrave.jors.2602255)\nISSN:0160-5682\nPURE UUID:60eee1e7-868d-443f-a446-ff8429c708f3\n## Catalogue record\nDate deposited:06 Aug 2008\nLast modified:15 Mar 2024 11:03\n## Export record\nASCII CitationAtomBibTeXData Cite XMLDublin CoreDublin CoreEP3 XMLEndNoteHTML CitationHTML CitationHTML ListJSONMETSMODSMPEG-21 DIDLOpenURL ContextObjectOpenURL ContextObject in SpanRDF+N-TriplesRDF+N3RDF+XMLRIOXX2 XMLReferReference ManagerSimple Metadata## Altmetrics\n## Share this record\n[Share this on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/56836/)[Share this on Twitter](<https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=The irregular nesting problem - a new approach for nofit polygon calculation+https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/56836/>)[Share this on Weibo](<http://service.weibo.com/share/share.php?url=The irregular nesting problem - a new approach for nofit polygon calculation+https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/56836/>)\n## Contributors\nAuthor:H.Y.
