An efficient 2D irregular packing algorithm can effectively improve material utilization and reduce processing costs. The reduction in material consumption will also have a beneficial impact on the environment ([Ke et al., 2020](#B76)). Therefore, research of the packing problem is of great significance for technology and social interest.\nThe 2D packing problem is a type of combinatorial optimization problems to locate parts with different shapes compactly in one or more master sheet material to minimize the occupied space or maximize the utilization of the material. The 2D packing problem is currently recognized as a NP problem, which is mainly solved by heuristic algorithms. In recent years, many scholars have conducted research on 2D irregular packing problems with a verity of solutions.\nThere exists a number of review articles on packing and cutting problems. We have summarized the main review literature in the field of 2D packing and cutting as shown in[Table 1](#T1). Brown ([Brown, 1971](#B17)) introduced an optimum packing and depletion problem with optimization of space and resource usage. Harvey ([Salkin and De Kluyver, 1975](#B116)) surveyed the application of mathematical optimization models such as linear programming to the knapsack problem. Bruce ([Golden, 1976](#B50)) surveyed various approaches to the cutting stock problem. Hinxman ([Hinxman, 1980](#B65)) surveyed the trim-loss and assortment problems, this research paid more attention to cutting and packaging problems in practical applications, and did not mention much about theoretical methods. Garey and Coffman ([Garey and Johnson, 1981](#B47);[Coffman et al., 1984](#B27)) surveyed the approximation algorithms for bin packing problems. Israni ([Israni and Sanders, 1982](#B72)) reviewed the 2D cutting stock problem including almost all 2D packaging problems. The author also proposed a rectangular layout method. Sarin ([Sarin, 1983](#B118)) reviewed methodologies and literature to solve 2D stock cutting problems and introduced an interactive optimization procedure for a general 2D stock cutting problem. Dyckhoff ([Dyckhoff et al., 1985](#B38)) described a trim loss and related problems and categorized them briefly. Dudzi&#x00144;ski ([Dudzi&#x00144;ski and Walukiewicz, 1987](#B36)) summarized the exact methods for knapsack problems, such as linear programming. Matthias ([Rode and Rosenberg, 1987](#B114)) analyzed the algorithm for the trim-loss problems. Haessler ([Haessler and Sweeney, 1991](#B59)) reviewed the solution process of cutting stock problems, including placement algorithm and sequence optimization algorithm. Dowsland ([Dowsland and Dowsland, 1992](#B34)) reviewed the application of operations research methods to the packing problem and summarized some exact heuristics. Sweeney ([Sweeney and Paternoster, 1992](#B128)) categorized cutting and packing problems and made application-oriented research records. Cheng ([Cheng et al., 1994](#B22)) discussed 2D cutting stock problems and their application cases including the pallet loading problem and VLSI placement problem. With the gradual deepening of research on 2D layout problems, typology becomes a common research topic. 2D regular and irregular layout problems are clearly distinguished in practical applications and theoretical methods. Dowsland ([Dowsland and Dowsland, 1995](#B29)) gave a special review of the 2D irregular nesting problem for the first time. Mavridou ([Mavridou and Pardalos, 1997](#B98)) summarized applications of the genetic algorithm and simulated annealing algorithm in the optimization of facility layout problems. Dyckhoff ([Dyckhoff, 1990](#B37)) made a typology of the cutting and packing problems in detail, and W&#x000e4;scher ([W&#x000e4;scher et al., 2007](#B135)) improved the typology later. Hopper ([Hopper and Turton, 1999](#B67);[Hopper and Turton, 2001a](#B68);[Hopper and Turton, 2001b](#B69)) investigated the application of meta-heuristic and heuristic algorithms in 2D and 3D packing problems. Lodi ([Lodi et al., 2002a](#B90);[Lodi et al., 2002b](#B91)) reviewed algorithms proposed in the 1990s of 2D packing problems. Bennell et al. ([Bennell and Oliveira, 2008](#B10);[Bennell and Oliveira, 2009](#B9)) discussed 2D irregular packing problems and related geometric problems. Leao ([Leao et al., 2020](#B81)) introduced the mathematical models in the 2D irregular packing problem.\nTABLE 1\n[![www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/966691/fmech-08-966691-HTML/image_m/fmech-08-966691-t001.jpg)](https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/966691/fmech-08-966691-HTML/image_m/fmech-08-966691-t001.jpg)\n**TABLE 1**.

Shalaby, Mohamed Kashkoush \nMechanical Design and Production Department, Faculty of Engineering, Cairo University, Giza, Egypt \nEmail: kashkou@uwindsor.ca \nReceived December 12, 2012; revised January 15, 2013; accepted January 28, 2013\nABSTRACT \nTwo-Dimensional Irregular Strip Packing Problem is a classical cutting/packing problem. The problem is to assign, a \nset of 2-D irregular-shaped items to a rectangular sheet. The width of the sheet is fixed, while its length is extendable \nand has to be minimized. A sequence-based approach is developed and tested. The approach involves two phases; opti\u0002mization phase and placement phase. The optimization phase searches for the packing sequence that would lead to an \noptimal (or best) solution when translated to an actual pattern through the placement phase. A Particle Swarm Optimi\u0002zation algorithm is applied in this optimization phase. Regarding the placement phase, a combined algorithm based on \ntraditional placement methods is developed. Competitive results are obtained, where the best solutions are found to be \nbetter than, or at least equal to, the best known solutions for 10 out of 31 benchmark data sets. A Statistical Design of \nExperiments and a random generator of test problems are also used to characterize the performance of the entire algo\u0002rithm. \nKeywords: Cutting and Packing; Irregular Strip Packing; Nesting; Placement Procedures; Particle Swarm Optimization \n1. Introduction \nThe problem of packing or cutting out shapes with \nminimal waste is a classical problem that exists in many \nindustrial fields. Common applications are found in sheet \nmetal, leather, furniture, shipbuilding, and textile Indus\u0002tries. Cutting stock, trim loss, bin packing, strip packing, \npallet loading, nesting, and knapsack problems, are all \nrelated names for cutting and packing problems. The first \ngeneral classification for cutting and packing problems is \nintroduced in Dychkoff [1]. Dychkoff developed a spe\u0002cial classification for cutting and packing problems in \nwhich he called it a typology. Recently, an improved \ntypology was developed by W\u00e4scher [2], which is par\u0002tially based on Dyckhoff\u2019s original one, but it adopts new \ncategorization criteria. \nThe scope of this research is the two-dimensional Ir\u0002regular Strip Packing Problem which is classified as an \nOpen Dimension Problem (ODP), according to W\u00e4scher\u2019s \nimproved typology. The problem is to assign (cut or \npack), a set of two-dimensional irregular-shaped items to \na rectangular object (sheet for cutting or container for \npacking). The width of the object is fixed, while its \nlength is extendable and has to be minimized. A typical \napplication for this problem is found in the textile Indus\u0002try under the name \u201cMarker-Making\u201d. Another popular \nname is \u201cNesting\u201d which has been, and still, used by \nmany authors for the Irregular Strip Packing Problems, \nand even for other irregular cutting and packing prob\u0002lems in general. The problem is schematically demon\u0002strated in Figure 1, where the best arrangement for the \ngiven items into the strip to minimize the pattern length \nis sought. \nThe 2-D rectangular packing problem has been shown \nby Fowler et al. [3] to be NP-complete. As the irregular \ncase is more complex, hence it could also be considered \nas NP-complete, and as a result they are practically tack\u0002led through heuristic approaches. Two main heuristic \napproaches are applied; sequence-based approach and \ndirect approach. The first approach utilizes an optimiza\u0002tion technique to find the packing sequence of items that \nwould lead to the best possible pattern when employed \nunder a certain placement method (Babu and Babu [4], \nFischer and Dagli [5], Takahara et al. [6], and Burke et al. \n[7]). While the second approach heuristically builds an \ninitial pattern that may not be a feasible one, and an op\u0002timization technique is directly applied to the items posi\u0002tions seeking the best possible feasible pattern (Bennell \nand Dowsland [8], Gomes and Oliveira [9], Immamichi \net al. [10], and Umetani et al. [11]). \nOther solution approaches are found in the literature \nthat could not be categorized under any of the two main \napproaches mentioned above. These approaches involve; \nmathematical programming approach followed by Grinde \nCopyright \u00a9 2013 SciRes. AJOR\nM. A. SHALABY, M. KASHKOUSH 269\nSheet Width \nSheet Length (Open) Pattern length \nFigure 1. A schematic illustration for the 2-D irregular strip \npacking problem. \nand Daniels [12] and Fischetti and Luzzi [13], Constraint \nLogic Programming (CLP) approach followed by Carra\u0002villa et al. [14], and dynamic sequence-based approach \nfollowed by Oliveira et al. [15], and Bennell and Song \n[16]. \nDeveloping a geometrical technique for handling the \ngraphical aspects of irregular shapes is used to be the \nmain obstacle among extending the research in this \nproblem, compared to the regular cutting and packing \none. Three geometry handling techniques are widely \nused in the literature. Pixel or Raster Method is an ap\u0002proximate method that is employed by Jain and Gea [17], \nBabu and Babu [4], and Fischer and Dagli [5]. Direct \ntrigonometry techniques are used by Hifi and M\u2019Hallah \n[18], Takahara et al. [6], and Burke et al. [7]. A more \nsophisticated technique is the no-fit polygon which is \napplied by Oliveira et al. [15], Bennell and Song [16], \nand Imamichi et al. [10]. \nMany authors used to incorporate meta-heuristic \nsearch techniques in their solution algorithms. Three \nmain meta-heuristics are commonly used with irregular \ncutting and packing problems, they are; Genetic Algo\u0002rithm (Jakobs [19], Hifi and M\u2019Hallah [18], and Hu-yao \nand Yuan-jun [20]), Simulated Annealing (Oliveira and \nFerreira [21], Han and Na [22], Heckmann and Lengauer \n[23], and Gomes and Oliveira [9]), and Tabu Search \n(Blazewicz et al. [24], Bennell and Dowsland [8], and \nBurke et al. [7]). \nFrom the above review, much interest could be noticed \nin the Irregular Strip Packing Problem for the last few \nyears. This could be attributed to two main reasons; \nfirstly, until now, no optimal solution could be found for \na real-sized problem, a very small improvement in a \ngiven arrangement in a cutting or packing operation \ncould save a considerably large amount of money. Sec\u0002ondly, is the significant increase in the capabilities of \nmodern computational engines, which made it available \nto apply techniques that would be impractical to apply 15 \nyears ago. Several heuristic and meta-heuristic optimiza\u0002tion techniques have been applied and investigated with \nthe problem. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algo\u0002rithm, originally introduced by Kennedy and Eberhart \n[25], is a lately developed stochastic optimization tech\u0002nique that has proved good performance in various opti\u0002mization fields, but has not been applied to a Strip Pack\u0002ing Problem or any cutting or packing problem. This \nresearch investigates the performance of PSO to find a \ncompetitive (or even better) performance to the existing \napproaches. \n2. Proposed Solution Approach \nThe solution approach proposed in this paper, which is \ngiven the name \u201cSwarmNest\u201d, is a sequence-based ap\u0002proach that consists of two phases; optimization phase \nand placement phase. SwarmNest assumes only hole-free \npolygons that are allowed to rotate by increments of 90\u02da. \nFor the optimization phase, a Particle Swarm Optimi\u0002zation (PSO) algorithm is employed to search for the \noptimal packing sequence. Up to our knowledge, this is \nthe first time Particle Swarm is utilized in tackling an \nirregular packing problem. A proposed Local Search \nroutine is also used to enhance the algorithm perform\u0002ance. As to the placement phase, a combined placement \nalgorithm is develop...",

To be worthwhile, such a combination should outperform the single heuristics. This article presents a GA-based method that produces general hyper-heuristics that solve two-dimensional regular (rectangular) and irregular (convex polygonal) bin-packing problems. A hyper-heuristic is used to define a high-level heuristic that controls low-level heuristics. The hyper-heuristic should decide when and where to apply each single low-level heuristic, depending on the given problem state. In this investigation two kinds of heuristics were considered: for selecting the figures (pieces) and objects (bins), and for placing the figures into the objects. Some of the heuristics were taken from the literature, others were adapted, and some other variations developed by us. We chose the most representative heuristics of their type, considering their individual performance in various studies and also in an initial experimentation on a collection of benchmark problems. The GA included in the proposed model uses a variable-length representation, which evolves combinations of condition-action rules producing hyper-heuristics after going through a learning process which includes training and testing phases. Such hyper-heuristics, when tested with a large set of benchmark problems, produce outstanding results for most of the cases. The testbed is composed of problems used in other similar studies in the literature. Some additional instances for the testbed were randomly generated.

The container has a fixed width, while its length can change so that all items are placed in it. The objective is to find a layout of the set of polygons that minimizes the length of the container. The proposed algorithm constructively creates layouts from an ordered list of items and a placement heuristic. The placement determines the collision free region (represents the set of translations to create a feasible layout) for the item to be placed. It is shown that the collision free region must be calculated using non-regularized Boolean operations, as contours of no-fit polygons should be ignored. The proposed algorithm to solve the placement problem has two levels, in the internal level the container has fixed dimensions, and the external level reduces or increases the variable dimension. The placement heuristic searches for degenerated vertices and edges as they represent local maximum compaction. Computational comparisons on benchmark problems show that the proposed algorithm generated highly competitive solutions. Moreover, our algorithm updated some best known results.\n...Read more\n## Key takeaways\n![sparkles](https://a.academia-assets.com/images/icons/sparkle.svg)\nAI\n1.

This problem is approached with an heuristic based on simulated annealing. Traditional &quot;external penalization&quot; techniques are avoided through the application of the no-fit polygon, that determinates the collision-free region for each small item before its placement. The simulated annealing controls: the rotation applied and the placement of the small item. For each non-placed small item, a limited depth binary search is performed to find a scale factor that when applied to the small item, would allow it to be fitted in the large object. Three possibilities to define the sequence on which the small items are placed are studied: larger-first, random permutation and weight sorted. The proposed algorithm is suited for non-convex small items and large objects.\ndownloadDownload free PDF[View PDFchevron\\_right](https://www.academia.edu/58884840/Rotational_Placement_of_Irregular_Polygons_over_Containers_with_Fixed_Dimensions_using_Simulated_Annealing_and_No_Fit_Polygons)\n[An effective heuristic for the two-dimensional irregular bin packing problem](https://www.academia.edu/69875946/An_effective_heuristic_for_the_two_dimensional_irregular_bin_packing_problem)\n[Gabriela Ochoa](https://independent.academia.edu/GabrielaOchoa10)\nAnnals of Operations Research, 2013\nThis paper proposes an adaptation, to the two-dimensional irregular bin packing problem of the Djang and Finch heuristic (DJD), originally designed for the one-dimensional bin packing problem. In the two-dimensional case, not only is it the case that the piece&#39;s size is important but its shape also has a significant influence. Therefore, DJD as a selection heuristic has to be paired with a placement heuristic to completely construct a solution to the underlying packing problem. A successful adaptation of the DJD requires a routine to reduce computational costs, which is also proposed and successfully tested in this paper. Results, on a wide variety of instance types with convex polygons, are found to be significantly better than those produced by more conventional selection heuristics.\ndownloadDownload free PDF[View PDFchevron\\_right](https://www.academia.edu/69875946/An_effective_heuristic_for_the_two_dimensional_irregular_bin_packing_problem)\n[Irregular rotational placement of shapes over non-convex containers with fixed dimensions](https://www.academia.edu/104990568/Irregular_rotational_placement_of_shapes_over_non_convex_containers_with_fixed_dimensions)\n[Thiago de Castro Martins](https://independent.academia.edu/ThiagodeCastroMartins)\n8th IFAC International Workshop on Intelligent Manufacturing Systems, 2007, 2007\nThis work deals with the problem of minimize the waste of space that occurs on a placement of a set of bi-dimensional items inside a bi-dimensional container with fixed dimensions.

It adopts two neighborhoods, swapping two given polygons in a placement and placing one polygon into a new position. The local search algorithm is used to minimize the overlap on the basis of the neighborhoods mentioned above and the unconstrained[nonlinear programming](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/nonlinear-programming)model is adopted to further minimize the overlap during the search process. Moreover, the[tabu](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/tabu)search algorithm is used to avoid[local minima](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/local-minimum), and a compact algorithm is presented to improve the result. The results of standard test instances indicate that when compared with other existing algorithms, the presented algorithm does not only show some signs of competitive power but also updates several best known results.\n## Introduction\nThe irregular strip packing problem, also known as the nesting problem, has a wide area of applications. Given a set of irregular shapes and a rectangular strip with a fixed width and an arbitrary length, the target of the two-dimensional irregular strip packing problem is to place all shapes within the strip such that the length of the strip is minimized and the irregular shapes do not overlap. A classic example application is clothing industry. Several pieces of clothes will be cut from a roll of fabric and the objective is to minimize the waste of fabric. The fabric has a fixed width and its length can be generally assumed infinite; so the problem is to minimize the length required for producing the specified number of irregular shapes.\nThe irregular strip packing problem is a NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem [1]. Numerous papers on nesting problem have been published since the first paper by Art [2]. Meta-heuristics are often used to solve this problem. Hopper and Turton [3] reviewed these methods, and a summary of geometric methods was published by Bennell and Oliveira [4]. As research progressed, further breakthroughs in algorithms for this problem have achieved in recent years. When compared with the previous years, these solutions have markedly improved the effect and speed of nesting results. The typical methods include Burke et al. [5], Gomes and Oliveira [6], Egeblad et al. [7], Imamichi et al. [8], etc.\nAlbano and Sapuppo [9] proposed an algorithm that places each shape at the bottom-left position, and the sequence of places is obtained by tree search. Jakobs [10] proposed a two-stage solution which first generates the rectangular enclosure of each irregular shape, and then finds the placement for these enclosures through a genetic algorithm. Secondly, a shrinking algorithm moves the shapes to another one as close as possible using the idea of the bottom-left heuristic. Gomes and Oliveira [11] based on bottom-left heuristic and find a good placement by exchanging two shapes in the layout. Dowsland et al. [12] developed a compact algorithm to improve the bottom-left heuristic algorithm. The algorithm first gets the initial placement by the bottom-left heuristic, and then uses a shaking process to compact the placement. Burke et al. [5] presented a new bottom-left heuristic algorithm based on discretization, and combination with hill climbing or tabu search to get a high quality solution. This algorithm can also pack the shapes with circular arcs and holes. Egeblad et al. [7] proposed an efficient fast local search method whose neighborhood is any horizontal or vertical translation of a given shape. They also formulated a polynomial time algorithm to find a translation with minimum overlap area between the given polygon and the other polygons in the current placement. Gomes and Oliveira [6] presented a separation algorithm to locally optimize the placement based on linear programming models, and used simulated annealing to guide the search. A new separation algorithm based on unconstrained nonlinear programming is proposed by Imamichi et al. [8]. They also designed an algorithm that swaps two polygons in a placement, and then the algorithms are combined as a component into an iterated local search algorithm for the overlap minimization problem. This method yielded several best known results on the standard test instances. Our algorithm is based on a separation algorithm presented by Imamichi et al. [8], and local search is adopted to guide the search. Moreover, a tabu search algorithm is used to avoid local minima and a compacted algorithm is used to improve the packing results.\n## Section snippets\n## Formulation\nIn this section, some fundamental elements of geometry are first defined, before formulation of the irregular strip packing problem algorithm is given.\n**Definition 1 (point)**\nA point*p*in two-dimensional space is represented by a pair:p=(px,py)\u2208R2.\n**Definition 2 (line segment)**\nA line segment*s*is a point set defined by two endpoints*p**a*and*p**b*:s={p\u2208R2,t\u2208[0,1]|p=pa+t(pb\u2212pa)}.\n**Definition 3 (polygon)**\nA polygon is a plane figure bounded by a closed path composes of a finite sequence of line segments denoted by*S*.

In the two-dimensional case, not only is it the case that the piece\u2019s size is important but its shape also has a significant influence. Therefore, DJD as a selection heuristic has to be paired with a placement heuristic to completely construct a solution to the underlying packing problem. A successful adaptation of the DJD requires a routine to reduce computational costs, which is also proposed and successfully tested in this paper. Results, on a wide variety of instance types with convex polygons, are found to be significantly better than those produced by more conventional selection heuristics.\n\nThis is a preview of

It explores the procedure of applying the bottom-left strategy to a given order the bottom-left algorithm. The chapter explains the irregular strip packing problem and introduces some practical algorithms for irregular packing problems. It focuses on the problem of packing irregular shapes represented in bitmap format and analyses the rectilinear block packing problem and also introduces various schemes used to represent solutions to the rectilinear block packing problem and algorithms based on such coding schemes. The chapter considers two-dimensional irregular packing problems, which have been actively studied in the last decade. It provides some basic techniques including bottom-left strategy, clustering strategy, and no-fit polygons. The chapter shows that various algorithms proposed for the irregular strip packing and bin packing problems and their variants. T. Imamichi et al. proposed an iterated local search based on nonlinear programming for the irregular strip packing problem.\n\n[Taylor & Francis Group Logo![Taylor & Francis Group Logo](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/assets/images/tfgroup-logo-white.svg)](https://www.taylorfrancis.com)\n\n- PoliciesPolicies\n\n- [Privacy Policy](https://informa.com/privacy-policy/)\n- [Terms & Conditions](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/terms-and-conditions/)\n- [Cookie Policy](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/cookie-policy/)\n\n- JournalsJournals\n\n- [Taylor & Francis Online](https://www.tandfonline.com)\n\n- CorporateCorporate\n\n- [Taylor & Francis Group](https://taylorandfrancis.com/)\n\n- Help & ContactHelp & Contact\n\n- [Students/Researchers](https://help.taylorfrancis.com/students_researchers)\n- [Librarians/Institutions](https://help.taylorfrancis.com/librarians_institutions)\n\n- Connect with us\n\n\nRegistered in England & Wales No. 3099067\n\n5 Howick Place \\| London \\| SW1P 1WG\u00a9 2024 Informa UK Limited\n\nBack to Top",
