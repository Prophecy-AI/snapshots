      "finding": "2\u2011D polygon packing \u2013 often called irregular\u2011shape nesting \u2013 asks for the placement of a set of non\u2011convex polygons (with or without rotation) inside the smallest possible axis\u2011aligned rectangle or strip.  It is a classic NP\u2011hard problem that appears in sheet\u2011metal cutting, textile layout, ship\u2011building and many other manufacturing processes, so both exact and fast\u2011approximate methods are actively researched.  Recent work has pushed the theoretical frontier for *translational* packing of convex polygons by using height\u2011based sorting and shelf\u2011packing ideas, which give polynomial\u2011time algorithms with improved constant\u2011factor guarantees for area, perimeter, strip\u2011 and bin\u2011packing objectives ([arxiv.org](https://export.arxiv.org/pdf/2308.08523v1.pdf)).  For the fully general case (arbitrary non\u2011convex shapes, holes, and unrestricted rotations) an exact nesting algorithm builds on a novel relaxation: each polygon is approximated by a small set of inscribed circles, turning the non\u2011overlap ",
