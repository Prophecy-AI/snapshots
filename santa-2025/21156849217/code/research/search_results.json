One particular category of these packing problems is\ntwo-dimensional packing, which is encountered in everyday scenarios like arranging items\non a shelf and in industrial applications such as cutting cookies from rolled-out dough\nor manufacturing sets of tiles from standard-sized panels made of wood, glass, or metal.\nAnother intriguing example involves cutting fabric pieces for clothing production. In this\ncase, the pieces often cannot be rotated freely, as they must adhere to a desired pattern\nin the final product, which is tailored of multiple elements. The widespread applicability\nof two-dimensional packing problems has led to a surge of interest in designing efficient\nalgorithms to address them. In this paper, we follow the line of research and study the\nproblem of packing convex polygons without rotations in various settings depending on the\ntype of containers used.\nPast research focusing on theoretical considerations of two-dimensional packings mainly\nconcentrates on the scenario when all objects are axis-parallel rectangles. In this paper, we\nwill discuss packing without rotations, in which only translations are permitted. There are\ntwo main classes of the problem depending on whether the size of the container is fixed and\nwe want to minimize the number of containers used or whether we want to minimize the\ncontainer\u2019s size with respect to some objective function.\nA seminal example of the first class is the Geometric Bin Packing problem in which\na number of unit size squared bins to pack is to be minimized. The problem is arguably\nthe most natural generalization of the regular (1D) Bin Packing to two dimensions, and\nits absolute approximability has been fully understood. Unless P = N P, the best possible\nefficient constant factor approximation is 2 [15], and such an algorithm is known [10].\nIn the second class, there are several variants to be considered. An example is the\nStrip Packing Problem which is concerned with packing objects into a strip of width\n1 and infinite height in such a way that the maximum of all the heights of the placed\nobjects is minimized. Like Geometric Bin Packing, Strip Packing generalizes (1D)\nBin Packing. The best known efficient constant factor approximation for Strip Packing\nhas approximation factor (5/3 + \u03f5) [9]. It is known that there can not exist a polynomial\ntime algorithm with an approximation ratio of (3/2 \u2212 \u03f5) for any \u03f5 > 0 unless P = N P, which\nfollows directly from the approximation hardness of (1D) Bin Packing. Both classes of\nproblems have been also considered in the asymptotic setting, see e.g. [11, 5, 12].\nIn younger time, there was also an increase of interest in cases where the objects in\nquestion are general convex polygons. Alt, de Berg and Knauer [2, 3] considered the problem\nof packing an instance consisting of a number of convex polygons of the form p \u2282 [0, 1]2into\na minimum area axis-parallel rectangular container. We refer to this problem as Polygon\nArea Minimization throughout this paper. In the special case where the instance consists\nof rectangles only, the problem is known to admit a PTAS [4]. They proved the existence of\nthe following efficient algorithm:\nA 23.78-approximation for Polygon Area Minimization.\nRecently, Aamand, Abrahamsen, Beretta and Kleist [1] showed that the algorithm of Alt,\nde Berg and Knauer can be leveraged to obtain also efficient approximation algorithms of\nfurther problems:\nA 7-approximation for Polygon Perimeter Minimization.\nA 51-approximation for Polygon Strip Packing.\nAn 11-approximation for Polygon Bin Packing for polygons with diameter at most 1\n10 .\nA. Kurpisz and S. Suter 3\n1.1 Our results\nThe results of Alt, de Berg and Knauer [2, 3] and Aamand et al. [1] are heavily based on\nso-called shelf packing algorithms. In shelf packing algorithms, the objects are first placed\non the shelves, possibly ordered by height, which are later stacked on one another to build\na final solution. Compared to axis-parallel rectangles, the main challenge in designing an\napproximation algorithm for polygon packing problems is that objects cannot be sorted by\nheight and orientation simultaneously. As a result, the algorithm and its analysis in [2, 3]\nhave such a large approximation guarantee. In this paper, we provide new insight into how\nshelf packing algorithms should be applied to polygon packing problems. We introduce a\nsequence of transformations of the objects that allow us first to sort them by height and later\nby orientation to build a solution of a much better approximation guarantee. More precisely,\nwe design polynomial-time algorithms with the following factors:\nA 9.45-approximation for Polygon Area Minimization.\nUsing this algorithm as a subroutine, we build upon the methods from Aamand et al.

Furthermore, in Section 8\nwe show the following results, which make progress towards solving an open question of a\nO(1)-approximation algorithm for Polygon Bin Packing for arbitrary polygons.\nThere is an efficient O(\n1\n\u03b4\n)-approximation algorithm for Polygon Bin Packing for\ninstances where each polygon has width or height at most 1 \u2212 \u03b4.\nThere is an efficient O(1)-approximation algorithm for Polygon Bin Packing for\ninstances with the property that all polygons share a spine (up to translation) with height\nat least 3\n4\n.\n2 Preliminaries\nWe start out considerations by recalling a classical and well-known problem in theoretical\ncomputer science, the Bin Packing problem: Given a list of numbers s1, . . . , sn \u2208 (0, 1] \u2229 Q,\nrepresenting the sizes of n objects, the goal is to find the minimum number of bins of size 1,\nso that we can pac...",

Introduction\nPacking optimization is an important problem class that concerns various disciplines including warehouse \nmanagement, shipping, and design of engineering products. The widespread nature of this problem requires\nrobust and efficient algorithms that are easy to utilize.\nVarious techniques have been developed to solve different packing optimization problems. A large amount \nof available studies addresses the problem of packing two-dimensional rectangular objects into rectangular \nbins while keeping the object edges orthogonal to the domain boundaries. For instance, Chen and Huang (2007) \ncomputed solutions for two-dimensional rectangle packing problems by introducing a search algorithm that \nplaces the rectangles into the container one by one using a corner occupation strategy. Later, Leung, Zhang, \nZhou, and Wu (2012) proposed a hybrid heuristic algorithm that combines greedy strategy and simulated \nannealing methods to solve the rectangular knapsack packing problem. Recently, Chen et al. (2019) developed \na deterministic heuristic algorithm for solving the two-dimensional rectangular packing problems that require \nmaximizing the filled portion of the rectangular domain.\nPacking problems concerning nonrectangular objects and domains were also prevalently investigated. For \nexample, Del Valle, Queiroz, Miyazawa, and Xavier (2012) developed heuristic approaches for solving 2D \ncutting/packing problems involving irregular objects. Later, Chen et al. (2018) proposed a heuristic algorithm \nfor solving circle packing problems for placing multiple identical circles into the smallest circular container.\nLately, Bouzid and Salhi (2020) investigated orthogonal packing of rectangular objects into a circular space of \nfixed radius.\n \n* Email address: serhat@is.mpg.de (Gokhan Serhat)\nPreprint submitted to Elsevier\n2\nThe complexity of the packing problems notably increases when the nonorthogonal rotation of the objects \nis allowed in addition to the translation (Cherri et al., 2016). These problems received relatively lesser attention\ncompared to the problems involving fixed object orientations or orthogonal rotations. In one study, Zhang and \nZhang (2009) introduced a 2D packing optimization technique called finite-circle method, which approximates \npolygons with a set of circles and converts the non-overlapping constraints into simple constraints between \ncircles. Martins and Tsuzuki (2010) used a heuristic approach to minimize the waste space during the rotational\nplacement of two-dimensional polygons into irregular containers. In another study by Martinez-Sykora et al. \n(2017), a strategy was proposed to solve bin packing problems with irregular pieces that can be freely rotated.\nThe difficulties in the formulations for packing problems involving irregular objects have led to the \ndevelopment of raster point methods, which rely on approximating the objects on a discretized grid. With \nthese methods, packing configurations can be represented by assigning zeroes to the free domain cells and \ndifferent values to the cells where a single object is present or multiple objects overlap. The key advantage of \nraster techniques is their applicability to the problems involving objects with complex shapes, where the main \ndrawback is their resolution-dependent precision (Leao et al., 2019). In the literature, the research on packing \noptimization with raster methods is limited compared to the available work based on other techniques. In a\nparticular study, Toledo et al. (2013) proposed a discrete modeling approach called the Dotted-Board Model, \nwhich relies on representing the bin with a two-dimensional grid and using the plausible grid points for the\nplacement of arbitrary polygons. Later, Mundim, Andretta, and de Queiroz (2017) extended the Dotted-Board \nModel for packing non-polygonal objects with curved edges and used it within a heuristic approach based on\ngenetic algorithms. Recently, Sato, Martins, Gomes, and Tsuzuki (2019) developed the raster overlap \nminimization algorithm to solve the irregular strip packing problem using a raster method that limits the \nsolution space.\nThis study presents the new Concurrent or Ordered Matrix-based Packing Arrangement Computation \nTechnique (COMPACT). In this framework, the object shapes are approximated by matrix-based (raster)\nrepresentations. The objects can be rotated by angles that are not necessarily restricted to be right-angle \nmultiples, unlike the conditions imposed in many existing packing optimization studies relying on raster \nmethods. The raster approximations are obtained through loop-free operations that improve efficiency.\nBesides, a novel performance metric is introduced, which aids efficient filling of the available space by \nmaximizing the internal contact between the objects as well as the contact between the objects and domain \nboundaries. Moreover, the possibility of exploiting the objective functions for discarding overlap and overflow\nconstraints is explored to enable the use of unconstrained optimization methods. As case studies, the \ndeveloped technique is utilized to pack multiple rectangular and circular objects in square domains using \nconcurrent and ordered placement strategies. The results show that the proposed technique performs\neffectively in determining the packing arrangements. The organization of the study is as follows: The matrix\u0002based object representation that forms the backbone of the developed technique is described in the following \nsection. Section 3 covers the details regarding the formulation of the optimization problem. Section 4 covers \nthe results from various case studies. In Section 5, the conclusions are stated and the directions for future \nstudies are outlined.\n2.

In addition, the generation of the no-fit polygon only involves three main steps based on the proposed concept. The proposed algorithm has a mechanism that searches other start positions to generate a complete no-fit polygon for handling complex cases. To improve the efficiency, many acceleration strategies have been proposed, such as point exclusion strategy and point inclusion test. The robust and efficient performance of the algorithm is tested by well-known benchmark instances and degenerate and complex cases, such as holes, interlocking concavities and jigsaw-type pieces. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can produce complete no-fit polygons for complex cases, and acceleration strategies can reduce the creation time of no-fit polygon on benchmark instances by more than sixteen percent on average.\nKeywords:\n[no-fit polygon](https://www.mdpi.com/search?q=no-fit+polygon);[irregular packing problem](https://www.mdpi.com/search?q=irregular+packing+problem);[sliding algorithm](https://www.mdpi.com/search?q=sliding+algorithm);[cutting](https://www.mdpi.com/search?q=cutting);[configuration space obstacle](https://www.mdpi.com/search?q=configuration+space+obstacle)\nMSC:\n90; 68; 51\n## 1. Introduction\nIn the field of cutting and packing problems, there is a kind of problem known as the two-dimensional (2D) irregular packing problem or the nesting problem. It is commonly encountered in many industries and applications, such as metal sheet cutting [1,2], leather [3], clothing [4], paper [5] and spatial arrangement [6]. Through excellent algorithms to optimize the packing, even a one percent increase in the material utilization rate will save lots of resource costs for enterprises and generate huge economic benefits for the whole society. Despite the many practical applications and benefits, the problem has received relatively little attention in the literature when compared to the regular packing problem [7,8,9]. One of the main reasons is that researchers have to deal with the geometry problem, which is the first obstacle they encounter. This means that satisfying the constraint of having all irregular pieces without overlapping is much harder than regular pieces.\nDirect trigonometry involving line intersection and point inclusion testing is the classic method to identify the positional relationship between two polygons. However, the optimization algorithms will become inefficient when it adopts this method, which results in the slightly poor performance of the algorithms. The alternative used in irregular packing problems is the no-fit polygon (NFP), which is also used in the field of engineering and robot motion planning and the aircraft parking stand allocation problem [10]. The no-fit polygon facilitates the research of irregular packing problems [11,12,13,14]. It is an increasingly popular option since it is more efficient than direct trigonometry, particularly when using an iterative search. Determining whether polygons overlap, touch, or are separated only needs to conduct a simple test to identify whether the reference point is inside the NFP. Essentially, the no-fit polygon describes the region in which two polygons intersect. The computational efficiency gained by utilizing this method is very attractive. Hence, it is important to develop an algorithm for creating NFP for the research of irregular packing problems. The algorithm can enrich the application in 2D geometrical computer software.\nHowever, there are few published works on algorithms for generating NFP. Note the fact that developing a robust geometry library is still needed, and this task is very time-consuming and difficult. Furthermore, it is difficult to develop a robust NFP generator because of the complexity of irregular piece shapes. Thus, we propose an improved sliding algorithm for the generation of NFP and give an implementation in detail of our algorithm. Such an algorithm can become good preparation for applying more strategies to solve the irregular packing problem. For instance, in the work published by Costa et al. [15], if the NFP algorithm is efficient, it can directly calculate the new merged piece instead of approximating by one already computed because of this time-consuming operation. In other words, the more efficient the algorithm is, the better.\nThe proposed algorithm only involves two simple geometric stages. The first is generating the external NFP between two polygons, which includes three main steps: finding the touching group, determining the translation vector from all touching groups and computing the translation distance. The second stage is searching on the unvisited edges to determine whether there is a feasible starting point that can be found. If the starting point is available, then return to the first stage to generate the NFP.\nThe contributions of this study are:\n* To address the problem of the efficient and robust creation of the no-fit polygon;\n* To propose an improved sliding algorithm and provide a detailed implementation;\n* To present the concept of touching group, resulting in the number of cases to consider being reduced by half when determining the feasible translation vector;\n* To develop many acceleration strategies to improve the algorithm\u2019s efficiency, such as the point exclusion strategy, the right side test, and the point inclusion test;\n* To assess the performance of the proposed alg...",

An efficient 2D irregular packing algorithm can effectively improve material utilization and reduce processing costs. The reduction in material consumption will also have a beneficial impact on the environment ([Ke et al., 2020](#B76)). Therefore, research of the packing problem is of great significance for technology and social interest.\nThe 2D packing problem is a type of combinatorial optimization problems to locate parts with different shapes compactly in one or more master sheet material to minimize the occupied space or maximize the utilization of the material. The 2D packing problem is currently recognized as a NP problem, which is mainly solved by heuristic algorithms. In recent years, many scholars have conducted research on 2D irregular packing problems with a verity of solutions.\nThere exists a number of review articles on packing and cutting problems. We have summarized the main review literature in the field of 2D packing and cutting as shown in[Table 1](#T1). Brown ([Brown, 1971](#B17)) introduced an optimum packing and depletion problem with optimization of space and resource usage. Harvey ([Salkin and De Kluyver, 1975](#B116)) surveyed the application of mathematical optimization models such as linear programming to the knapsack problem. Bruce ([Golden, 1976](#B50)) surveyed various approaches to the cutting stock problem. Hinxman ([Hinxman, 1980](#B65)) surveyed the trim-loss and assortment problems, this research paid more attention to cutting and packaging problems in practical applications, and did not mention much about theoretical methods. Garey and Coffman ([Garey and Johnson, 1981](#B47);[Coffman et al., 1984](#B27)) surveyed the approximation algorithms for bin packing problems. Israni ([Israni and Sanders, 1982](#B72)) reviewed the 2D cutting stock problem including almost all 2D packaging problems. The author also proposed a rectangular layout method.

Both the shapes and material resource can be arbitrary nonconvex polygons. Moreover, the shapes can have holes and the material can have defective areas. Finally, the shapes can be arranged using both translations and*arbitrary*rotations (as opposed to a finite set of rotation angles, such as 0\\\\(^\\\\circ \\\\)and 180\\\\(^\\\\circ \\\\)). The insight that has made all this possible is a novel way to relax the constraint that the shapes not overlap. The key idea is to inscribe a few circles in each irregular shape and then relax the non-overlap constraints for the*shapes*by replacing them with non-overlap constraints for the*inscribed circles*. These relaxed problems have the form of quadratic programming problems (QPs) and can be solved to optimality to provide valid lower bounds. Valid upper bounds can be found via local search with strict non-overlap constraints. If the shapes overlap in the solution to the relaxed problem, new circles are inscribed in the shapes to prevent this overlapping configuration from recurring, and the QP is then resolved to obtain improved lower bounds. Convergence to any fixed tolerance is guaranteed in a finite number of iterations. A specialized branch-and-bound algorithm, together with some heuristics, are introduced to find the initial inscribed circles that approximate the shapes. The new approach, called \u201cQP-Nest,\u201d is applied to three problems as proof of concept. The most complicated of these is a problem due to Milenkovic that has four nonconvex polygons with 94, 72, 84, and 74 vertices, respectively. QP-Nest is able prove global optimality when nesting the first*two*or the first*three*of these shapes. When all*four*shapes are considered, QP-Nest finds the best known solution, but cannot prove optimality.\nThis is a preview of subscription content,[log in via an

In*two-dimensional bin packing problems*these units are finite rectangles, and the objective is to pack all the items into the minimum number of units, while in*two-dimensional strip packing problems*there is a single standardized unit of given width, and the objective is to pack all the items within the minimum height. We discuss mathematical models, and survey lower bounds, classical approximation algorithms, recent heuristic and metaheuristic methods and exact enumerative approaches. The relevant special cases where the items have to be packed into rows forming levels are also discussed in detail.\n## Introduction\nIn several industrial applications one is required to allocate a set of rectangular items to larger rectangular standardized stock units by minimizing the waste. In wood or glass industries, rectangular components have to be cut from large sheets of material. In warehousing contexts, goods have to be placed on shelves. In newspapers paging, articles and advertisements have to be arranged in pages. In these applications, the standardized stock units are rectangles, and a common objective function is to pack all the requested items into the minimum number of units: the resulting optimization problems are known in the literature as two-dimensional bin packing problems. In other contexts, such as paper or cloth industries, we have instead a single standardized unit (a roll of material), and the objective is to obtain the items by using the minimum roll length: the problems are then referred to as two-dimensional strip packing problems. As we will see in the following, the two problems have a strict relation in almost all algorithmic approaches to their solution.\nMost of the contributions in the literature are devoted to the case where the items to be packed have a fixed orientation with respect to the stock unit(s), i.e., one is not allowed to rotate them. This case, which is the object of the present article, reflects a number of practical contexts, such as the cutting of corrugated or decorated material (wood, glass, cloth industries), or the newspapers paging. For variants allowing rotations (usually by 90\u00b0) and/or constraints on the items placement (such as the \u201cguillotine cuts\u201d), the reader is referred to Lodi et al. [41], [42], where a three-field classification of the area is also introduced. General surveys on cutting and packing problems can be found in Dyckhoff and Finke [17], Dowsland and Dowsland [16] and Dyckhoff et al. [18]. Results on the probabilistic analysis of packing algorithms can be found in Coffman and Shor [12] and Coffman and Lueker [11].\nLet us introduce the problems in a more formal way. We are given a set of*n*rectangular*items**j*\u2208*J*={1,\u2026,*n*}, each defined by a*width*,*w**j*, and a*height*,*h**j*:\n* (i)\nin the*Two-Dimensional Bin Packing Problem*(2BP), we are further given an unlimited number of identical rectangular*bins*of width*W*and height*H*, and the objective is to allocate all the items to the minimum number of bins;\n* (ii)\nin the*Two-Dimensional Strip Packing Problem*(2SP), we are further given a bin of width*W*and infinite height (hereafter called*strip*), and the objective is to allocate all the items to the strip by minimizing the height to which the strip is used.\nIn both cases, the items have to be packed with their*w*-edges parallel to the*W*-edge of the bins (or strip). We will assume, with no loss of generality, that all input data are positive integers, and that*w**j*\u2a7d*W*and*h**j*\u2a7d*H*(*j*=1,\u2026,*n*).\nBoth problems are strongly NP-hard, as is easily seen by transformation from the strongly NP-hard (one-dimensional)*Bin Packing Problem*(1BP), in which*n*items, each having an associated size*h**j*, have to be partitioned into the minimum number of subsets so that the sum of the sizes in each subset does not exceed a given capacity*H*.\nA third relevant case of rectangle packing is the following. Each item*j*has an associated profit*p**j*&gt;0, and the problem is to select a subset of items, to be packed in a single finite bin, which maximizes the total selected profit. This problem is usually denoted as (*Two-Dimensional*)*Cutting Stock*, although it had been introduced by Gilmore and Gomory [29] as (*Two-Dimensional*)*Cutting Knapsack*.\nIn this survey we concentrate on two-dimensional problems in which all items have to be packed, i.e., on 2SP and 2BP. The reader is referred to Dyckhoff et al. [18, Section 5] for an annotated bibliography on two-dimensional cutting stock problems. For both 2SP and 2BP, we also consider the special case where the items have to be packed into rows forming levels.\nIn Section 2 we discuss mathematical models for the various problems introduced above. In Section 3 we survey classical approximation algorithms as well as more recent heuristic and metaheuristic methods. In Section 4 we introduce lower bounding techniques, while in Section 5 we describe exact enumerative approaches.\n## Section snippets\n## Modeling two-dimensional problems\nThe first attempt to model two-dimensional packing problems was made by Gilmore and Gomory [29], through an extension of their approach to 1BP (see [27], [28]). They proposed a column generation approach (see [53] for a recent survey) based on the enumeration of all subsets of items (*patterns*) that can be packed into a single bin. Let*A**j*be a binary column vector of*n*elements*a**ij*(*i*=1,\u2026,*n*) taking the value 1 if item*i*belongs to the*j*th pattern, and the value 0 otherwise. The set of all\n## Approximation algorithms\nIn this section we concentrate on*off-line*algorithms, i.e., algorithms which have full knowledge of the input. For*on-line*algorithms, which pack the i...",
