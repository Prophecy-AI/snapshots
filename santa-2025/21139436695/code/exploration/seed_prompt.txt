# Christmas Tree Packing Optimization - Seed Prompt

## Problem Overview
This is a 2D irregular polygon bin packing optimization problem. The goal is to pack Christmas tree-shaped polygons (15-vertex non-convex shapes) into the smallest possible square bounding box for each configuration of n trees (n = 1 to 200).

**Scoring**: score = Σ(side_length² / n) for n=1 to 200. Lower is better.
**Target**: Beat 68.922808

## Tree Geometry (CRITICAL)
Each tree is a 15-vertex polygon with:
- Trunk: 0.15 width × 0.2 height (bottom)
- Base tier: 0.7 width at y=0
- Middle tier: 0.4 width at y=0.25
- Top tier: 0.25 width at y=0.5
- Tip: at y=0.8
- Reference point: center of trunk top (0, 0)

The tree shape has notches/indentations between tiers, making interlocking possible.

## Key Techniques from Public Kernels

### 1. bbox3 C++ Optimizer (Primary Approach)
From `../research/kernels/jazivxt_why-not/why-not.ipynb`:
- Uses simulated annealing with complex number vector coordination
- Features: fluid dynamics, hinge pivot, density gradient flow, global boundary tension
- Compiled C++ for speed with OpenMP parallelization
- Parameters: `-n` (iterations), `-r` (random seed)
- Multi-phase optimization: short runs → medium runs → long runs on best candidates

### 2. Rotation Optimization (fix_direction)
From `../research/kernels/saspav_santa-submission/santa-submission.ipynb`:
- After placing trees, rotate entire configuration to minimize bounding box
- Uses scipy.optimize.minimize_scalar with bounds (0, 90) degrees
- Computes convex hull of all tree points for efficiency
- Can reduce bounding box significantly (especially for non-square configurations)

### 3. Greedy Placement with Collision Detection
From `../research/kernels/inversion_santa-2025-getting-started/santa-2025-getting-started.ipynb`:
- Start with weighted random angle (favors diagonal orientations for corner packing)
- Move tree from far away toward center until collision
- Back up until no overlap
- Use Shapely STRtree for efficient spatial queries
- Check intersects() but not touches() to allow touching

### 4. Multi-Phase Runner Strategy
From `../research/kernels/yongsukprasertsuk_santa-2025-best-keeping-bbox3-runner/`:
- Phase A: Short 2-min runs with various n,r parameters to find promising settings
- Phase B: Medium 10-min runs on top candidates
- Phase C: Long 20-min runs on best few
- Always keep best submission, revert on regressions
- Overlap repair: replace failed configurations from known-good baseline

## Recommended Optimization Approaches

### Approach 1: Simulated Annealing (Primary)
- Temperature schedule: start high, cool slowly
- Moves: translate tree, rotate tree, swap two trees
- Accept worse solutions with probability exp(-ΔE/T)
- Use fast overlap detection with bounding box pre-filtering

### Approach 2: Local Search with Compaction
- Start with greedy placement
- Iteratively try to move each tree closer to center
- Apply rotation optimization after each improvement
- Use tabu search to avoid cycling

### Approach 3: Genetic Algorithm Hybrid
- Encode as permutation (placement order) + angles
- Crossover: order crossover for permutation
- Mutation: swap positions, perturb angles
- Local search on best individuals

### Approach 4: Gradient-Based Refinement
- Treat overlapping as soft constraint with penalty
- Use nonlinear programming to minimize overlap + bounding box
- Apply separation vectors to push apart overlapping trees

## Implementation Details

### Collision Detection (CRITICAL for speed)
```python
# Use Shapely with STRtree for O(log n) queries
from shapely.strtree import STRtree
tree_index = STRtree([t.polygon for t in placed_trees])
candidates = tree_index.query(new_polygon)
for idx in candidates:
    if new_polygon.intersects(placed[idx]) and not new_polygon.touches(placed[idx]):
        return True  # Overlap!
```

### Bounding Box Calculation
```python
from shapely.ops import unary_union
all_polygons = [t.polygon for t in trees]
bounds = unary_union(all_polygons).bounds
side = max(bounds[2]-bounds[0], bounds[3]-bounds[1])
```

### Rotation Optimization
```python
from scipy.optimize import minimize_scalar
from scipy.spatial import ConvexHull

def optimize_rotation(trees):
    points = np.array([list(t.polygon.exterior.coords) for t in trees]).reshape(-1, 2)
    hull_points = points[ConvexHull(points).vertices]
    
    def bbox_at_angle(angle):
        c, s = np.cos(np.radians(angle)), np.sin(np.radians(angle))
        rotated = hull_points @ [[c, s], [-s, c]]
        return max(rotated.max(0) - rotated.min(0))
    
    result = minimize_scalar(bbox_at_angle, bounds=(0, 90), method='bounded')
    return result.x, result.fun
```

## Validation Requirements
- No overlapping trees (intersects but not touches)
- Coordinates must be in range [-100, 100]
- Values prefixed with 's' in submission CSV
- Format: id,x,y,deg where id = "NNN_idx"

## Optimization Strategy for Competition

1. **Start with good baseline**: Use existing best submission as starting point
2. **Focus on high-n configurations**: They contribute more to score (n=100-200)
3. **Exploit tree symmetry**: Trees can interlock when rotated 180° apart
4. **Use crystalline patterns**: For large n, regular lattice-like arrangements work well
5. **Post-process with rotation**: Always apply fix_direction after optimization
6. **Validate before submitting**: Check for overlaps, repair from baseline if needed

## Key Insights from Research

1. **Meta-heuristics dominate**: GA, SA, tabu search are most effective for irregular packing
2. **Local search + NLP hybrid**: Combining local search with nonlinear programming for overlap minimization shows strong results
3. **Bottom-left heuristic**: Classic placement strategy, but needs refinement for non-convex shapes
4. **Separation vectors**: Use Minimum Translation Vector (MTV) to push apart overlapping polygons
5. **Unrestricted rotation**: Allowing continuous rotation angles (not just 0/90/180/270) improves packing density
