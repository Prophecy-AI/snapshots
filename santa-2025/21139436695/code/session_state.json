Because the search space grows exponentially with the number of pieces, exact methods are only feasible for very small instances; most state\u2011of\u2011the\u2011art solvers rely on sophisticated heuristics and approximation schemes that balance solution quality with computational speed\u202f([frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmech.2022.966691/full)).\n\nThe most effective approaches reported in recent literature fall into three families:\n\n* **Meta\u2011heuristics** \u2013 Genetic algorithms (GA), simulated annealing (SA), tabu search (TS) and hybrid neuro\u2011evolutionary methods dominate practical implementations.
