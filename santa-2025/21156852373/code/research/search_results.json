      "text": "Escaping local optima in two\u2011dimensional polygon\u2011packing problems is most reliably achieved by coupling a constructive packing heuristic with a meta\u2011heuristic that can deliberately perturb the current solution.  A widely used approach is to embed the **four\u2011corners (FC) heuristic** inside a self\u2011adaptive evolutionary algorithm; the heuristic quickly builds feasible placements while the evolutionary operators (mutation, crossover) and self\u2011adaptation of parameters continually inject diversity, allowing the search to jump out of stagnant regions of the solution space\u30101\u3011.  Similar hybridisations combine bottom\u2011left stability heuristics with meta\u2011heuristics such as tabu search, simulated annealing or genetic algorithms, which provide systematic diversification and intensification cycles that are effective at breaking out of local minima\u30102\u3011.\n\nAnother powerful class of techniques is **adaptive neighbourhood search**.  Fast neighbourhood search (FNS) explores a rich set of local moves (e.g., item swaps, rotations, jostles) and dynamically adjusts the neighbourhood size to balance exploitation and exploration, thereby preventing premature convergence\u30104\u3011.  **Simulated annealing with an adaptive neighbourhood** further strengthens this capability by gradually lowering a temperature parameter while simultaneously reshaping the neighbourhood, giving the algorithm a controlled ability to accept worsening moves early on and to focus on refinement later\u30105\u3011.  **Iterated Local Search (ILS) / Monotonic Basin Hopping** explicitly applies strong perturbation moves between successive local\u2011search phases, a strategy shown to be especially effective for packing rectangles in convex regions and readily extendable to irregular polygons\u30109\u3011.\n\nFinally, **extended local\u2011search frameworks that incorporate nonlinear programming** can solve sub\u2011problems (e.g., precise placement of a subset of polygons) to optimality before re\u2011injecting the result into the global search, creating a powerful escape mechanism from shallow basins\u30103\u3011.  When combined with a genetic algorithm or other population\u2011based meta\u2011heuristic, these local refinements yield a hybrid method that consistently outperforms pure heuristics on heterogeneous bin\u2011size and unrestricted\u2011orientation instances\u30107\u3011.  In practice, the most robust escape strategies therefore blend a fast constructive heuristic, adaptive or multi\u2011neighbourhood moves, and a higher\u2011level meta\u2011heuristic (evolutionary algorithms, simulated annealing, ILS) that can deliberately perturb and re\u2011optimize the packing layout.",

The four corners\u2019 (FC) heuristic is specifically designed to increase the search efficiency of EAs. Experiments with the FC heuristic are conducted on 31 problems from the literature both with rotations permitted and without rotations permitted, using two different EA algorithms: a self-adaptive parallel recombinative simulated annealing (PRSA) algorithm, and a self-adaptive genetic algorithm (GA). Results on bin packing problems yield the smallest trim losses we have seen in the published literature; with the FC heuristic, zero trim loss was achieved on problems of up to 97 rectangles. A comparison of the self-adaptive GA to fixed-parameter GAs is presented and the benefits of self-adaption are highlighted.\n\n## Introduction\n\nTwo-dimensional (2D) packing problems occur in a wide range of industries. The goal is simply the optimal utilization of space or material available. In the garment and paper industries the problem is often to cut smaller pieces from a large roll of cloth or paper while reducing the scrap. In the wood, glass, and metal industries the task is not to cut from a roll, but to cut from a fixed size sheet or plate. In the semiconductor industry the task is VLSI floor planning with the goal being to optimize the use of space on the chip.\n\nThere are two major variants of the 2D packing problem: bin packing and strip packing. In the 2D bin packing variant, rectangles are to be packed in bins of given width and height, the goal being to minimize the number of bins used. In the 2D strip packing variant, rectangles must be packed in a fixed width, infinite height strip, the goal being to minimize the height. The bin packing variant is most suitable for the wood, glass, metal, and semiconductor industries, while the strip packing variant will generally apply to the paper and garment industries.\n\nAn important consideration is whether or not the rectangles can be rotated as they are placed. In the wood and garment industries one may care about the grain of the material and rotations may not be permitted. While in the paper, glass, and semiconductor industries there may be no particular restrictions. Allowing rotations adds flexibility and can result in a better packing, while at the same time apparently complicating the task.\n\nGiven the many permutations of 2D packing problems, most research focuses on a particular type of the packing problem: either bin packing or strip packing, with or without rotations. A recent survey of 2D packing problems is given by Lodi et al. (2002). A typology of cutting and packing problems is defined in W\u00e4scher et al. (2006).\n\nBeing NP-hard, the 2D packing problems are an attractive challenge for evolutionary algorithms (EA). For application to strip packing problems, Jakobs (1996) developed a genetic algorithm (GA) using the bottom-left (BL) packing method with support for rotation of rectangles. Hopper and Turton (2001) provide a comprehensive comparison of GA, simulated annealing (SA), na\u00efve evolution, and simple hill-climbing for the strip packing problem with rotations and for various BL methods. A recent paper by Lesh et al. (2004) gives a method to find strip packing solutions using an exact branch and bounds exhaustive search. They successfully find perfect packings (zero trim loss) for problem sizes up to 30 rectangles. In regards to bin packing problems, Babu and Babu (1999) use a GA and a BL packing heuristic. Recently, Leung et al. (2003) developed a mixed simulated annealing-genetic algorithm.\n\nIn this paper, we design the four corners\u2019 (FC) packing heuristic with the aim to increase the search efficiency of EAs when applied to bin packing problems. By the nature of the FC heuristic, the packings produced are non-guillotineable and bottom-left stability is not preserved. In this research we study only orthogonal packing problems, consisting of one bin with the goal to seek minimum trim loss. In the typology of cutting and packing problems as defined by W\u00e4scher et al. (2006), we deal with a two-dimensional, output maximization problem: we have one large rectangle of fixed dimensions, into which the value of the placed smaller rectangles (assumed proportional to area of the rectangle) must be maximized. The smaller rectangles are strongly heterogeneous and must be laid out orthogonally. Specifically, we study the two-dimensional single orthogonal knapsack problem.\n\nThe FC heuristic is tested with two different self-adapting EAs: a self-adapting parallel recombinative simulated annealing (PRSA) algorithm and a self-adapting GA. The results are presented both with and without support for rotations. The FC heuristic combined with the self-adapting PRSA algorithm is found to produce tighter packings than any of the methods we have seen published in the literature.\n\nThis paper is outlined as follows. In Section 2, an analysis on how EAs work on packing problems is performed and the EA-friendly four corners\u2019 packing heuristic is introduced. In Section 3, a detailed description of the EA components developed in this study is given. Section 4 describes details of the PRSA implementation. Section 5 describes the GA implementation. The remaining sections cover the experimental settings, results, and conclusions.\n\n## Section snippets\n\n## Designing the four corners\u2019 heuristic\n\nIn this section, we analyze how EAs commonly function on packing problems and propose a four corners\u2019 heuristic designed specifically for EAs. GAs are chosen as the representative EA for this discussion, however most of the principles apply in general to the many types of EAs. For example, SA can be implemented using the genome encoding and the mutation operators of a GA. An implementation of PRSA (see Section 4) could use both the mutation and crossover operators of a GA as is done in this\n\n## Common components of a self-adapting evolutionary algorithm\n\nThe PRSA and GA algorithms implemented in this paper share the genome structure, the crossover operators, mutation operators, and the fitness function.\n\n## Self-adaptive parallel recombinative simulate...",

Two heuristics, which belong to the class of packing procedures that preserve bottom-left (BL) stability, are hybridised with three meta-heuristic algorithms (genetic algorithms (GA), simulated annealing (SA), na\u0131\u0308ve evolution (NE)) and local search heuristic (hill-climbing). This study compares the hybrid algorithms in terms of solution quality and computation time on a number of packing problems of different size. In order to show the effectiveness of the design of the different algorithms, their performance is compared to random search (RS) and heuristic packing routines.\n\n## Introduction\n\nCutting and packing problems are encountered in many industries, with different industries incorporating different constraints and objectives. The wood-, glass- and paper industry are mainly concerned with the cutting of regular figures, whereas in the ship building, textile and leather industry irregular, arbitrary shaped items are to be packed.\n\nPacking problems are optimisation problems that are concerned with finding a _good_ arrangement of multiple _items_ in larger containing regions ( _objects_). The usual objective of the allocation process is to maximise the material utilisation and hence to minimise the \u201cwasted\u201d area. This is of particular interest to industries involved with mass-production as small improvements in the layout can result in savings of material and a considerable reduction in production costs.\n\nOur work is concerned with a 2D rectangular packing problem. The problem consists of packing a collection of items onto a rectangular object while minimising the used object space. The packing process has to ensure that there is no overlap between the items. The specific problem that is addressed in this paper has the following characteristics:\n\n- \u2022\na set of items, which may contain identical items;\n\n- \u2022\none single object of fixed width and infinite height;\n\n- \u2022\nall pieces are of rectangular shape;\n\n- \u2022\nitems can be rotated by 90\u00b0;\n\n- \u2022\nnon-guillotineable (Dyckhoff, 1990).\n\n\nThe 2D stock cutting problem occurs as an industrial problem where a number of rectangular items need to be cut from a roll of material. Since the order (set of items) is small compared to the stock material, the height of the object can be regarded as infinite. Processor allocation can also be treated as a 2D packing problem (Hwang, 1997).\n\n## Section snippets\n\n## A review of meta-heuristic packing algorithms\n\nMany heuristic packing algorithms have been suggested in the literature. Surveys on solution methodologies for various types of the 2D rectangle packing problem can be found in Hinxman, 1980, Sarin, 1983, H\u00e4ssler and Sweeney, 1991. In comparison to the great quantity of literature on heuristic algorithms to the packing problem, only a few researchers have experimented with meta-heuristic algorithms.\n\n## Heuristic placement algorithms\n\nIn this paper we turn our attention to the class of BL heuristics (Baker et al., 1980). These packing procedures preserve BL stability in the layout. An item is allocated in a BL stable position if it cannot be moved any further to the left or downwards. Two implementations of a BL heuristic are combined in our study with meta-heuristic algorithms.\n\n## Heuristic search techniques\n\nThe quality of the layout which is constructed using the above placement algorithms depends on the sequence in which the rectangles are presented to the routine. Since the number of combinations is too large to be explored exhaustively in a reasonable amount of time, meta-heuristic algorithms are used as a more efficient search strategy. In the following hybrid approaches the task of the meta-heuristic is to search for a good ordering of the items. A placement routine is then needed to\n\n## Implementation of the search algorithms\n\nA number of problem-specific and generic decisions have to be made for the implementation of the meta-heuristic search algorithms. The problem-specific choices concern the objective function, initial solution, representation scheme as well as the operators applied to manipulate the search space. Generic decisions include the probabilities at which the search space manipulators such as crossover and mutation are applied, the cooling schedule in the case of SA and the population and generation\n\n## Comparison between the heuristic algorithms BL and BLF\n\nThe comparison of the two heuristic packing algorithms shows that the more sophisticated placement routine (BLF) achieves better layouts. Table 2. summarises the relative distances between the lowest packing height found and the height of the optimal solution. Using random input sequences the layouts generated by the BLF algorithm are between 10 and 30% better than the ones obtained with the BL rule.\n\nPre-ordering the input sequences according to decreasing width (DW) or height (DH) of the items\n\n## Packing heuristics\n\nThe BLF packing algorithm achieves better packing patterns than the BL heuristic for our example problems. Since the BLF routine first attempts to fill the gaps in the layout, the majority of the small items will be \\`absorbed' within the existing partial layout and does not contribute further to the packing height, which is mainly determined by the larger items (Fig. 6). With the BL-rule, however, unused regions in layout cannot be accessed and smaller rectangles also contribute to the height.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nTwo types of hybrid algorithms for the rectangle packing problem have been implemented consisting of a combination of a meta-heuristic algorithm (GA, NE and SA) and heuristic packing routine to allocate the items on the object. The heuristic packing routine generates the layouts in a BL justified manner. Whereas one of the techniques (BL) is a time-efficient implementation based on a sliding principle, the second one (BLF) is able to fill enclosures in the layouts, however, at higher\n\nRecommended articles\n\n- K.A.

It adopts two neighborhoods, swapping two given polygons in a placement and placing one polygon into a new position. The local search algorithm is used to minimize the overlap on the basis of the neighborhoods mentioned above and the unconstrained[nonlinear programming](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/nonlinear-programming)model is adopted to further minimize the overlap during the search process. Moreover, the[tabu](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/tabu)search algorithm is used to avoid[local minima](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/local-minimum), and a compact algorithm is presented to improve the result. The results of standard test instances indicate that when compared with other existing algorithms, the presented algorithm does not only show some signs of competitive power but also updates several best known results.\n## Introduction\nThe irregular strip packing problem, also known as the nesting problem, has a wide area of applications. Given a set of irregular shapes and a rectangular strip with a fixed width and an arbitrary length, the target of the two-dimensional irregular strip packing problem is to place all shapes within the strip such that the length of the strip is minimized and the irregular shapes do not overlap. A classic example application is clothing industry. Several pieces of clothes will be cut from a roll of fabric and the objective is to minimize the waste of fabric. The fabric has a fixed width and its length can be generally assumed infinite; so the problem is to minimize the length required for producing the specified number of irregular shapes.\nThe irregular strip packing problem is a NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem [1]. Numerous papers on nesting problem have been published since the first paper by Art [2]. Meta-heuristics are often used to solve this problem. Hopper and Turton [3] reviewed these methods, and a summary of geometric methods was published by Bennell and Oliveira [4]. As research progressed, further breakthroughs in algorithms for this problem have achieved in recent years. When compared with the previous years, these solutions have markedly improved the effect and speed of nesting results. The typical methods include Burke et al. [5], Gomes and Oliveira [6], Egeblad et al. [7], Imamichi et al. [8], etc.\nAlbano and Sapuppo [9] proposed an algorithm that places each shape at the bottom-left position, and the sequence of places is obtained by tree search. Jakobs [10] proposed a two-stage solution which first generates the rectangular enclosure of each irregular shape, and then finds the placement for these enclosures through a genetic algorithm. Secondly, a shrinking algorithm moves the shapes to another one as close as possible using the idea of the bottom-left heuristic. Gomes and Oliveira [11] based on bottom-left heuristic and find a good placement by exchanging two shapes in the layout. Dowsland et al. [12] developed a compact algorithm to improve the bottom-left heuristic algorithm. The algorithm first gets the initial placement by the bottom-left heuristic, and then uses a shaking process to compact the placement. Burke et al. [5] presented a new bottom-left heuristic algorithm based on discretization, and combination with hill climbing or tabu search to get a high quality solution. This algorithm can also pack the shapes with circular arcs and holes. Egeblad et al. [7] proposed an efficient fast local search method whose neighborhood is any horizontal or vertical translation of a given shape. They also formulated a polynomial time algorithm to find a translation with minimum overlap area between the given polygon and the other polygons in the current placement. Gomes and Oliveira [6] presented a separation algorithm to locally optimize the placement based on linear programming models, and used simulated annealing to guide the search. A new separation algorithm based on unconstrained nonlinear programming is proposed by Imamichi et al. [8]. They also designed an algorithm that swaps two polygons in a placement, and then the algorithms are combined as a component into an iterated local search algorithm for the overlap minimization problem. This method yielded several best known results on the standard test instances. Our algorithm is based on a separation algorithm presented by Imamichi et al. [8], and local search is adopted to guide the search. Moreover, a tabu search algorithm is used to avoid local minima and a compacted algorithm is used to improve the packing results.\n## Section snippets\n## Formulation\nIn this section, some fundamental elements of geometry are first defined, before formulation of the irregular strip packing problem algorithm is given.\n**Definition 1 (point)**\nA point*p*in two-dimensional space is represented by a pair:p=(px,py)\u2208R2.\n**Definition 2 (line segment)**\nA line segment*s*is a point set defined by two endpoints*p**a*and*p**b*:s={p\u2208R2,t\u2208[0,1]|p=pa+t(pb\u2212pa)}.\n**Definition 3 (polygon)**\nA polygon is a plane figure bounded by a closed path composes of a finite sequence of line segments denoted by*S*.

It is based on a simple local search scheme in which the neighborhood is any horizontal or vertical translation of a given polygon from its current position. To escape local minima we apply the meta-heuristic method*Guided Local Search*.\nThe strength of our solution method comes from a new algorithm which is capable of searching the neighborhood in polynomial time. More precisely, given a single polygon with*m*edges and a set of polygons with*n*edges the algorithm can find a translation with minimum overlap in time O(*mn*log(*mn*)). Solutions for standard test instances are generated by an implementation and a comparison is done with recent results from the literature. The solution method is very robust and most of the best solutions found are also the currently best results published.\nOur approach to the problem is*very*flexible regarding problem variations and special constraints, and as an example we describe how it can handle materials with quality regions.\nFinally, we generalize the algorithm for the fast neighborhood search and present a solution method for three-dimensional nesting problems.\n## Introduction\nNesting is a term used for many related problems. The most common problem is strip-packing where a number of irregular shapes must be placed within a rectangular strip such that the strip-length is minimized and no shapes overlap. The clothing industry is a classical example of an application for this problem. Normally, pieces of clothes are cut from a roll of fabric. A high utilization is desirable and it requires that as little of the roll is used as possible. The width of the roll is fixed, hence the problem is to minimize the length of the fabric. Other nesting problem variations exist, but in the following the focus is on the strip-packing variant. Using the typology of W\u00e4scher et al. (2006) this is a two-dimensional irregular open dimension problem (ODP).\nIn the textile industry the shapes of the pieces of clothes are usually referred to as*markers*or*stencils*. In the following we will use the latter term except when the pieces need to be defined more precisely e.g. as polygons.\nIn order to state the problem formally we first define the associated decision problem:\n**Nesting Decision Problem**\nGiven a set of stencilsSand a piece of material, position the stencilsSsuch that\n* \u2022No pair of stencils overlap.\n* \u2022All stencils are contained within the boundaries of the material.\nThe strip-packing variant can now be stated as\n**Strip Nesting Problem**\nGiven a set of stencilsSand a strip (the material) with width*w*find the minimal length*l*for which the Nesting Decision Problem can be solved (Fig. 1).\nThe Strip Nesting Problem is NP-hard (e.g. Nielsen and Odgaard, 2003).\nIn this paper we present a new solution method for the Strip Nesting Problem. After a short analysis of some of the existing approaches to the problem (Section 2) we present a short outline of the new solution method in Section 3. In short, the approach is a local search method (Section 4) using the meta-heuristic*Guided Local Search*(Section 5) to escape local minima. A very efficient search of the neighborhood in the local search is the subject of Section 6.\nIn the definitions above we have ignored the additional constraints which are often given for a nesting problem e.g. whether rotating and/or flipping the stencils is allowed. In Section 7 a discussion on how we handle such problem variations emphasizes the flexibility of our solution method.\nExperiments show that our solution method is very efficient compared with other published methods. Results are presented in Section 8. Finally, in Section 9, it is shown that our solution method is quite easily generalized to three-dimensional nesting problems.\n## Section snippets\n## Existing approaches to nesting problems\nThere exists numerous solution methods for nesting problems. A thorough survey by Dowsland and Dowsland (1995) exists, but a more recent survey has also been done by Nielsen and Odgaard (2003). Meta-heuristics are one of the most popular tools for solving nesting problems. A detailed discussion of these can be found in the introductory sections of Bennell and Dowsland (1999).\nThe following is a brief discussion of some of the most interesting approaches to nesting problems previously presented\n## Solution method outline\nIn this section we will give a brief outline of our solution method. Our method is a relaxed placement method and it can handle irregular polygons with holes. A new geometric approach is utilized and the*Guided Local Search*meta-heuristic is used to escape local minima. This approach is inspired by a paper by Faroe et al. (2003) which presented a similar approach for the two-dimensional Bin Packing Problem for rectangles.\nThe following describes the basic algorithm for the Strip Nesting Problem.\n* (1)\n## Placement\nFirst we define a*placement*formally. LetS={s1,\u2026,sn}be a set of polygons. A placement ofs\u2208Scan be described by the tuple(sx,sy,s\u03b8,sf)\u2208R\u00d7R\u00d7[0,2\u03c0)\u00d7{false,true}where (*s**x*,*s**y*) is the position,*s**\u03b8*is the rotation angle and*s**f*states whether*s*is flipped. Now the mapp:S\u2192R\u00d7R\u00d7[0,2\u03c0)\u00d7{false,true}is a placement of the polygonsS.\n## Objective function\nGiven a set of polygonsS={s1,\u2026,sn}and a fixed-length strip with length*l*and width*w*, letPbe the space of possible placements. We now wish to minimize the objective\n## Guided local search\nTo escape local minima encountered during local search we apply the meta-heuristic*Guided Local Search*(*GLS*). GLS was introduced by Voudouris and Tsang (1995) and has previously been successfully applied to e.g. the*Traveling Salesman Problem*(Voudouris and Tsang, 1999) and two- and thre...",

This problem is approached with an heuristic based on Simulated Annealing (SA) with adaptive neighborhood. Traditional \u201cexternal penalization\u201d techniques are avoided through the application of the no\u2013fit polygon, that determinates the collision-free area for each polygon before its placement. The SA controls continuous and discrete parameters. The rotation applied and the translation of the polygon are continuous parameters, and the sequence of placement is represented as a set of discrete parameters. For each non\u2013placed item, a limited depth binary search is performed to find a scale factor that when applied to the item, would allow it to be fitted in the container.\n\n- [Previous article in issue](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1474667015355488)\n- [Next article in issue](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1474667015355506)\n\n## Keywords\n\nSimulated Annealing\n\nPlacement Problems\n\nOptimization\n\nProbabilistic Heuristics\n\n[View PDF](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S147466701535549X/pdf?md5=7bca88c33d2daef044751913b4156e2b&pid=1-s2.0-S147466701535549X-main.pdf)\n\nSpecial issue articlesRecommended articles\n\n## References\n\n01.

The concepts of inner-fit raster and no-fit raster are used to search for a feasible positioning of items on a rectangular container. The first method is a Biased Random Key [Genetic Algorithm](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/genetic-algorithm), which is a population method, while the other is a [Variable Neighborhood Search](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/variable-neighborhood-search), which is a single trajectory method. In the proposed methods, a solution is represented by a vector of items, and the positioning of items is achieved with three rules inspired by the bottom-left strategy. When positioning items, feasible positions can be skipped as a strategy to diversify the search and escape from local optima solutions. Numerical experiments performed on literature instances show that the methods are better than the current state-of-the-art method since they obtained equal or better solutions for all the instances. On average, the occupied area increased 6.44%, and the known optimal solution was obtained for 60% of the instances. The population-based method performed better overall, obtaining solutions with better-occupied areas.\n\n## Introduction\n\nCutting and packing problems are related to cutting objects or packing items to optimize some objective. These problems are of great practical importance, as they are commonly found in companies and industries, such as metalworking, automotive and agricultural machinery, textiles, furniture production, and logistic transportation\u00a0\\[1\\]. Besides, many cutting and packing problems are NP-hard\u00a0\\[2\\], which justify the application of heuristics.\n\nIn this work, we solve the Two-Dimensional Irregular Knapsack Problem (2IKP)\u00a0\\[3\\]. In this problem, a set of irregular items and a rectangular, two-dimensional container of fixed dimensions are given. The purpose is to determine a feasible cutting pattern that has the largest occupied area. A feasible cutting pattern corresponds to a positioning of a subset of items where there is no overlap between any item, and such items are entirely within the container.\n\nSome applications the 2IKP may have are: automotive industry, on the production of seats; agricultural industry, on the cutting of steel plates; textile and leather garment industry, on the creation of clothes, bags, and shoes; sports industry, on the production of balls; logistic sector, on the loading of vehicles; furniture industry, on the cutting of wood plates\u00a0\\[4\\], \\[5\\], \\[6\\]. Besides that, the irregular knapsack problem also appears as a subproblem of others when solving the irregular bin packing and cutting stock problems with column generation based methods\u00a0\\[7\\], \\[8\\].\n\nDue to the geometry of items, to check the overlapping between items is a frequent topic of study in the literature of cutting problems with irregular shaped items\u00a0\\[9\\], \\[10\\], \\[11\\]. According to\u00a0Bennell and Oliveira \\[12\\], the most common tools for ensuring non-overlapping are the methods: raster, which discretizes items and containers; phi-function, which uses mathematical expressions that provide the relative position between items; direct trigonometry, which tests the intersection between line segments and the inclusion of points; and no-fit polygon, which is a polygon constructed for each pair of items, indicating where such items are separated, touching, or overlapping. Other tools arise from combining these methods, such as the no-fit raster, which combines the raster method with the no-fit polygon\u00a0\\[13\\], \\[14\\].\n\nIn the literature of problems with irregular shaped items, there are few results involving the 2IKP, according to\u00a0\\[15\\]. The majority of works are about problems with one (or two) open dimension, namely the nesting problem (or strip packing problem). In this problem, a set of items and a container with an open dimension are given.

This report represents the final project of my studies at the University of Twente,\nwhere I have been enrolled in the Master\u2019s program in Industrial Engineering & Management since\nSeptember 2022. My work on this thesis spanned from February to August 2024. Prior to this, I\ncompleted a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Mathematics at Utrecht University and a pre-master course in\nOR Models in 2021 as preparation for my master with a specialization in Production & Logistics\nManagement.\nIn this thesis, I tackled the two-dimensional irregular bin packing problem, a subject I had no\nknowledge of. The choice to focus on this topic stems from my desire to integrate my mathemati\u0002cal background with practical industrial applications. This project not only allowed me to apply\nmathematical theories to real-world problems but also pushed me to improve my programming\nskills, an area I have always found challenging. Additionally, this thesis provided valuable expe\u0002rience in documentation, communication, and understanding of what it is like to work within a\ncompany. The combination of theoretical and applied mathematics, coupled with the opportunity\nto integrate my interest in problem-solving and my hobby of tackling complex puzzles with pro\u0002fessional work, made this topic an ideal fit.\nI would like to thank Dr. Alessio Trivella for his excellent guidance and support throughout\nthe process. His feedback and brainstorming sessions maximized my learning opportunities. I\nwould also like to thank Dr. Breno Alves Beirigo for his constructive feedback and ideas, which\nhelped to improve my thesis. Furthermore, I want to thank my company supervisor, Luc Stoverink,\nwhose willingness to assist, brainstorm about certain ideas, and collaborative approach made my\ntime at the company both enjoyable and educational.\nFinally, I want to express my gratitude to my family, my boyfriend, and my friends for being\nthere for me and helping me get through the rougher parts of this thesis process. To you, the\nreader, I hope you find this work engaging and insightful.\nBritt van Oosten\nEnschede, August 2024\ni\nManagement Summary\nCompany C is a family-owned business that has specialized in the construction of steel structures\nand steel processing machines since 1970. Over the past fifty years, it has become a leading ma\u0002chine builder in the industry, focusing on designing and developing Computer Numerical Controlled\n(CNC) machines and software solutions tailored to the steel construction and manufacturing sector.\nThis focus aligns with company C\u2019s goal of being a total supplier, offering comprehensive solutions\nthat encompass both hardware and software. To support this vision, company C established\nDepartment D, dedicated to creating software that seamlessly integrates design and production\nprocesses.\nIn today\u2019s competitive manufacturing environment, industries strive to enhance productivity while\nreducing costs and lead times. For company C\u2019s CNC metal-cutting machines, which cut 2D parts\nfrom metal sheets, a key challenge is optimizing the layout of diverse-shaped, mostly irregular\n2D parts on available metal sheets to maximize material utilization and minimize waste. This\noptimization process, known as 2D nesting, requires an algorithm/software that can determine the\noptimal layout for cutting orders on metal sheets. While some existing algorithms show promise\nin nesting complex parts, none fully meet the company\u2019s specific objectives, restrictions and re\u0002quirements, leading to inefficiencies and a reliance on manual interventions.\nAdditionally, the company aims to reduce its dependence on third-party nesting software, which\noften lacks the flexibility to be customized according to their own or their client\u2019s needs. This\nhas created a need for the company to develop its own nesting algorithm, enabling the creation\nof proprietary nesting software that can, in the future, fully incorporate all necessary restrictions\nand requirements. However, the company\u2019s reliance on external solutions has created a knowledge\ngap in plate nesting, particularly in developing its own nesting algorithm.\nAs a result, the following research objective has been defined:\n\"Research and develop a foundational plate nesting algorithm that generates nesting layouts, opti\u0002mizes item placements on metal sheets, and minimizes unusable scrap, all within a reasonable time\nframe while incorporating the company\u2019s requirements.\"\nBefore developing the plate nesting algorithm, it is essential to understand the general nesting\nprocess and identify specific restrictions and requirements that the company wants to incorporate.\nAdditionally, the theory behind the nesting problem itself must be identified and understood. The\nprimary restrictions for the algorithm include part rotation, product spacing, and an efficient crop\nline to separate the used portion of the sheet from the unused portion. The company also has\nseveral other desires, such as incorporating lead-ins and lead-outs, bevel cutting, and zoning of\nparts on the sheets. However, these features are not essential for the basic functioning of a nesting\nalgorithm and thus left out of scope.\nWe have developed a plate nesting algorithm designed to automatically generate efficient nest\u0002ing layouts for cutting operations. The algorithm addresses the 2D Irregular Bin Packing Problem\nby determining an optimal arrangement of irregularly shaped parts on identical rectangular sheets,\naiming to minimize the number of sheets used and reduce material waste. The solution employs a\nthree-phase heuristic algorithm that strategically places and orients each part, according to some\nallowed fixed rotation angle set, to maximize sheet utilization and distinguishes between solutions\nthat use the same number of sheets. It adheres to constraints such as part orientation, sheet\nii\ndimensions, and non-overlapping requirements while also allowing for optional product spacing.\nThe core objective is to achieve the most efficient nesting layout, utilizing the minimum number\nof sheets to lower material costs and improve operational efficiency.\nIn the first phase, parts are placed on sheets using the Bottom Left Fill (BLF) heuristic, which\nprioritizes positioning items at the bottom-leftmost available positions on the sheet without over\u0002lapping the sheet\u2019s boundaries or other placed items. This allows for the quick generation of initial\nfeasible layouts. Multiple iterations of the BLF are performed using different assignment orderings.\nThe first iteration always follows an assignment order that prioritizes placing larger items first,\nallowing smaller items to fill the gaps. Subsequent orderings are randomized based on a probability\nfunction to escape local optima and explore significantly different packing layouts, considering that\nthe BLF heuristic is quite sensitive to initial assignment ordering.\nIn the second phase, layouts that use the fewest whole sheets are selected, and an overall utilization\nefficiency metric, known as F-values, is computed using the following formulas:\nUj =\nPn\nj\njm=1 sjm\nL \u00d7 W\nand F =\nPN\nj=1 U\n2\nj\nN\n,\nwhere Uj denotes the utilization rate of the jth sheet, and sjm the area of the mth piece within\nthe jth sheet. Layouts with the highest utilization rates are chosen as potential optimal solutions.\nThis phase ensures that only the most efficient found configurations are considered for further\nrefinement.\nThe third and final phase focuse...",
