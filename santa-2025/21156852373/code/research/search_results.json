A link will be provided\nin a future version of this document.\narXiv:2308.08523v1 [cs.CG] 16 Aug 2023\n2 Improved Approximations for Translational Packing of Convex Polygons\n1 Introduction\nMany real-life situations require us to make decisions about optimally packing a collection\nof objects into a specific container. One particular category of these packing problems is\ntwo-dimensional packing, which is encountered in everyday scenarios like arranging items\non a shelf and in industrial applications such as cutting cookies from rolled-out dough\nor manufacturing sets of tiles from standard-sized panels made of wood, glass, or metal.\nAnother intriguing example involves cutting fabric pieces for clothing production. In this\ncase, the pieces often cannot be rotated freely, as they must adhere to a desired pattern\nin the final product, which is tailored of multiple elements. The widespread applicability\nof two-dimensional packing problems has led to a surge of interest in designing efficient\nalgorithms to address them. In this paper, we follow the line of research and study the\nproblem of packing convex polygons without rotations in various settings depending on the\ntype of containers used.\nPast research focusing on theoretical considerations of two-dimensional packings mainly\nconcentrates on the scenario when all objects are axis-parallel rectangles. In this paper, we\nwill discuss packing without rotations, in which only translations are permitted. There are\ntwo main classes of the problem depending on whether the size of the container is fixed and\nwe want to minimize the number of containers used or whether we want to minimize the\ncontainer\u2019s size with respect to some objective function.\nA seminal example of the first class is the Geometric Bin Packing problem in which\na number of unit size squared bins to pack is to be minimized. The problem is arguably\nthe most natural generalization of the regular (1D) Bin Packing to two dimensions, and\nits absolute approximability has been fully understood. Unless P = N P, the best possible\nefficient constant factor approximation is 2 [15], and such an algorithm is known [10].\nIn the second class, there are several variants to be considered. An example is the\nStrip Packing Problem which is concerned with packing objects into a strip of width\n1 and infinite height in such a way that the maximum of all the heights of the placed\nobjects is minimized. Like Geometric Bin Packing, Strip Packing generalizes (1D)\nBin Packing. The best known efficient constant factor approximation for Strip Packing\nhas approximation factor (5/3 + \u03f5) [9]. It is known that there can not exist a polynomial\ntime algorithm with an approximation ratio of (3/2 \u2212 \u03f5) for any \u03f5 > 0 unless P = N P, which\nfollows directly from the approximation hardness of (1D) Bin Packing. Both classes of\nproblems have been also considered in the asymptotic setting, see e.g. [11, 5, 12].\nIn younger time, there was also an increase of interest in cases where the objects in\nquestion are general convex polygons. Alt, de Berg and Knauer [2, 3] considered the problem\nof packing an instance consisting of a number of convex polygons of the form p \u2282 [0, 1]2into\na minimum area axis-parallel rectangular container. We refer to this problem as Polygon\nArea Minimization throughout this paper. In the special case where the instance consists\nof rectangles only, the problem is known to admit a PTAS [4]. They proved the existence of\nthe following efficient algorithm:\nA 23.78-approximation for Polygon Area Minimization.\nRecently, Aamand, Abrahamsen, Beretta and Kleist [1] showed that the algorithm of Alt,\nde Berg and Knauer can be leveraged to obtain also efficient approximation algorithms of\nfurther problems:\nA 7-approximation for Polygon Perimeter Minimization.\nA 51-approximation for Polygon Strip Packing.\nAn 11-approximation for Polygon Bin Packing for polygons with diameter at most 1\n10 .\nA. Kurpisz and S. Suter 3\n1.1 Our results\nThe results of Alt, de Berg and Knauer [2, 3] and Aamand et al. [1] are heavily based on\nso-called shelf packing algorithms. In shelf packing algorithms, the objects are first placed\non the shelves, possibly ordered by height, which are later stacked on one another to build\na final solution. Compared to axis-parallel rectangles, the main challenge in designing an\napproximation algorithm for polygon packing problems is that objects cannot be sorted by\nheight and orientation simultaneously. As a result, the algorithm and its analysis in [2, 3]\nhave such a large approximation guarantee. In this paper, we provide new insight into how\nshelf packing algorithms should be applied to polygon packing problems. We introduce a\nsequence of transformations of the objects that allow us first to sort them by height and later\nby orientation to build a solution of a much better approximation guarantee. More precisely,\nwe design polynomial-time algorithms with the following factors:\nA 9.45-approximation for Polygon Area Minimization.\nUsing this algorithm as a subroutine, we build upon the methods from Aamand et al. [1] to\nobtain the following efficient approximation algorithms:\nA (3.75 + \u03f5)-approximation for Polygon Perimeter Minimization.\nA 21.89-approximation for Polygon Strip Packing.\nA 5.09-approximation for Polygon Bin Packing for polygons which have their diameter\nbounded by 1\n10 .\nThe results are proved in Sections 4, 5, 6, and 7 respectively. Furthermore, in Section 8\nwe show the following results, which make progress towards solving an open question of a\nO(1)-approximation algorithm for Polygon Bin Packing for arbitrary polygons.\nThere is an efficient O(\n1\n\u03b4\n)-approximation algorithm for Polygon Bin Packing for\ninstances where each polygon has width or height at most 1 \u2212 \u03b4.\nThere is an efficient O(1)-approximation algorithm for Polygon Bin Packing for\ninstances with the property that all polygons share a spine (up to translation) with height\nat least 3\n4\n.\n2 Preliminaries\nWe start out considerations by recalling a classical and well-known problem in theoretical\ncomputer science, the Bin Packing problem: Given a list of numbers s1, . . . , sn \u2208 (0, 1] \u2229 Q,\nrepresenting the sizes of n objects, the goal is to find the minimum number of bins of size 1,\nso that we can pac...",

We expect a fun puzzle. We get a nightmare of Combinatorial Optimization.\nThis year\u2019s edition,**\u201cSanta 2025: The Christmas Tree Packing Challenge,\u201d**is no exception. The goal? Pack $N$ irregular \u201cTree Polygons\u201d into the smallest possible square bounding box for $N=1$ to $200$.\nIf you checked the leaderboard today (Dec 21), you noticed a trend:**Reinforcement Learning (RL) is getting crushed.**\nDespite the massive hype around \u201cReasoning Models\u201d and PPO agents this year, the top 100 teams aren\u2019t using neural networks. They are using 1980s physics simulations. Here is why the \u201cOld School\u201d is winning, and how the pros are using LLMs to cheat the system.\n## The Problem: Why RL Hates \u201cPacking\u201d\nOn paper, this looks like a game.*Place a tree, check for overlap, repeat.*Perfect for a DQN agent, right?\nWrong. The geometry kills the gradient.\n1. **Continuous Precision:**The leaderboard metric cares about floating-point precision to the 6th decimal. RL agents (which output discrete actions or probability distributions) struggle to make the \u201cmicro-adjustments\u201d needed to squeeze a tree into a 0.001mm gap.\n2. **The \u201cCollision\u201d Cliff:**In packing, a move is either valid (reward = 1) or it overlaps by a pixel (reward = -100). This sparse, binary feedback loop makes it nearly impossible for an agent to \u201clearn\u201d a gradient. It doesn\u2019t know*how*to fix the overlap, just that it failed.## The Solution: Simulated Annealing (on Steroids)\nThe \u201cSecret Sauce\u201d currently dominating the leaderboard is**Simulated Annealing (SA)**combined with**Lattice Generation**.\nInstead of training a model to*predict*the position, teams are writing physics engines that*shake*the box.\n* **High Temperature:**Randomly spin and throw trees into the box (Explorer Phase).\n* **Low Temperature:**Jiggle the trees by microscopic amounts to resolve collisions (Exploiter Phase).\nThe best solutions right now use a \u201cHybrid\u201d strategy:\n* **N &lt; 58:**Use Simulated Annealing to find unstructured, chaotic packings.\n* **N &gt; 58:**Switch to \u201cCrystalline Packing\u201d (regular geometric lattices) which is mathematically superior for large numbers.## The Twist: How LLMs are Actually Helping\nIf RL is dead, where is the AI?\nTop competitors aren\u2019t using LLMs to*solve*the puzzle; they are using LLMs to**write the solver**.\nPython is too slow for 10 billion annealing steps. The meta this year is to prompt Gemini 3 or Claude to:\n\u201cRewrite this Python overlap-check function in Rust/C++ with AVX2 vectorization.\u201d\nWe are seeing \u201cHybrid\u201d workflows where the**Human**defines the heuristics, the**LLM**writes the highly optimized C++ kernels, and**Simulated Annealing**does the heavy lifting.\n## The Starter Code: A Simple Annealer\nIf you want to jump in before the January deadline, don\u2019t start with PyTorch. Start here.\nHere is a conceptual snippet for a \u201cPerturbation\u201d mover \u2014the heart of any good annealing solution.\n```\nimport numpy as np\nimport math\ndef anneal(layout, max\\_temps=10000):\n# layout: Array of [x, y, rotation] for N trees\ncurrent\\_score = calculate\\_area(layout)\ntemperature = 1.0\ncooling\\_rate = 0.9995\nfor i in range(max\\_temps):\n# 1.

We also want to thank Dominik Krupke for providing a\nhelpful official validator for solutions.\n1 Introduction\nThe recent CG:SHOP 2024 Challenge introduced a variant of irregular packing problems\nknown as the Maximum Polygon Packing (MPP) problem. The MPP problem involves a\nconvex polygonal container C and a polygon set P = {p1, p2, ..., pN }, where polygon piis\nassociated with a value vi. It seeks for a non-overlapping packing with the maximum total\nvalue. The challenge presents a total of 180 instances whose number of polygons ranges from\n28 to 50,000. The official document [4] gives a detailed description of the challenge.\nOur proposed algorithm employs a general process to solve these instances indiscriminately,\nand the overall framework is presented in Figure 1. We first partition a large-scale problem\ninto multiple small-scale subproblems (Section 2) and then solve each subproblem using\nupper-level polygon ordering (Section 3.1) and lower-level packing optimization techniques\n(Section 3.2). Section 4 presents our experimental results, followed by conclusions.\n1 Corresponding author: Zhouxing Su\n\u00a9 Canhui Luo, Zhouxing Su, and Zhipeng L\u00fc;\nlicensed under Creative Commons License CC-BY 4.0\n40th International Symposium on Computational Geometry (SoCG 2024).\nEditors: Wolfgang Mulzer and Jeff M.

It involves two components: partitioning the container C into\nmultiple regions and assigning polygons to each region.\n2.1 Container Partitioning\nThe container partitioning process consists of two steps, as shown in Figure 2. Initially, we\narrange two-dimensional square grids starting from the bottom-left corner of the bounding\nbox until the entire container is covered. The subregions formed by the intersection of the\ncontainer with all the grids constitute its partition C = C1 \u222a C2 \u222a ... \u222a Cm. Subsequently,\nwe merge the small subregions with adjacent grids, which are difficult to be used effectively.\nThe grid is dimensioned to keep the scale of each subproblem at approximately 300 polygons,\nmaking a trade-off between effectiveness and efficiency of lower-level packing optimization.\n2.2 Polygon Assignment\nWe adopt a simple approach of randomly assigning polygons to each subregion. Specifically, for\neach subregion Ci, we randomly select a polygon pj from P until\nP\nj\narea(pj )\narea(Ci) \u2265\nPN\ni=0\narea(pi)\narea(C)\n.\nThe advantage of random assignment lies in ensuring that the overall characteristics of each\nsubproblem align with the original problem.\nC. Luo, Z. Su, and Z. L\u00fc 86:3\nFigure 2 The partitioning process for the instance jigsaw_cf1_4fd4c46e.

We repeatedly select one remaining polygon with the\nhighest priority (ties are broken by value) and try to insert it into the current solution. If the\ninsertion with lower-level packing optimization fails, we skip the current polygon and turn to\nthe next one. For the majority of instances, the priority is defined as the value-to-area ratio\nof a polygon (we also call it unit value). Polygons with higher unit values are prioritized\nfor putting in the container, which is called the Unit Value First (UVF) strategy. For\nsmall-scale instances (N < 100), we employ the \u03b1\u03b2-random strategy. It randomly selects\n\u03b1% and \u03b2% of the polygons and reassigns their UVF-based priority to the highest and the\nlowest, respectively. These instances are run for multiple times to ensure comprehensive\noptimization, with \u03b1 and \u03b2 set to 10 in our implementation.\n3.2 Lower-Level Packing Optimization\nThe position of a polygon can be represented by the coordinates l = (x, y) of a reference point,\nsuch as the bottom-left corner of the boundary. Then, the translation of a polygon can be\nrepresented by a vector pointing from its original position to its new position. Given a feasible\npacking S and a polygon p to be placed, it is impossible to find a non-overlapping position\nfor p without moving other polygons in most cases. This section introduces the algorithm for\neliminating overlaps for an invalid packing, which involves solving an unconstrained nonlinear\nproblem and heuristic polygon movement.\nS o C G 2 0 2 4\n86:4 A General Heuristic Approach for Maximum Polygon Packing\n3.2.1 Overlap Minimization\nTo determine the appropriate translation for the polygons, we utilized the no-fit polygon\n(NFP) and inner-fit polygon (IFP), which are fundamental in algorithmic approaches to\ngeometric design and optimization challenges. For a fixed polygon pi and a movable polygon\npj , NFP(pi, pj ) describes their non-overlapping positions with boundaries in contact precisely,\nwhich can be utilized to determine the minimum translation for pj to avoid overlap. Similarly,\nIFP(pi, pj ) is employed to determine the minimum translation to place pj inside pi. Figure 3\nillustrates the polygon translations determined using NFP (left) and IFP (right). The readers\nmay refer to Burke et al. [2] for a more detailed description.\nFor a packing S, based on NFP and IFP, we define the overlap between polygons pi\nand pj as fij (S), representing the minimum translation to separate them, and f0i(S) as the\nminimum translation for moving pi to fit into the container. Subsequently, we employ the\nseparation algorithm proposed by Imamichi et al. [7] to minimize the overlap, which involves\nsolving an unconstrained nonlinear programming problem as follows:\nmin\nS\nF(S) = X\n0\u2264i<j\u2264N\nf\n2\nij (S) (1)\nThe model relaxes the non-overlapping constraint but introduces repulsion forces between\nany two overlapped polygons. We use the classic L-BFGS (limited memory BFGS) method\nto solve this problem. It makes the packing S converge to a local optimum but strongly\ndepends on the initial layout. ...",

Then use metaheuristics (usually Tabu Search or Late Acceptance) to optimize the order of that queue, while running the CH to evaluate every new ordering. This feature, lets call it \"MH on CH-using score calculation\", isn't implemented in OptaPlanner out of the box yet. I am planning to add it in 6.3 or later, with a surface or volume bin packing example.\n\nFor inspiration, you might (or might not) want to look at [my Packing Santa's Sleigh experiment](https://github.com/ge0ffrey/packing-santas-sleigh) (warning: here be dragons), which implements a variant on 3D volume bin packing defined by a Kaggle competition. It yields feasible solutions, but was never finished.\n\n[Share](https://stackoverflow.com/a/24380690)\n\n[Improve this answer](https://stackoverflow.com/posts/24380690/edit)\n\nFollow\n\nanswered Jun 24, 2014 at 7:23\n\n[![Geoffrey De Smet's user avatar](https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/27147a6679a4bfb6461ff1c0ae10473e?s=64&d=identicon&r=PG)](https://stackoverflow.com/users/472109/geoffrey-de-smet)\n\n[Geoffrey De Smet](https://stackoverflow.com/users/472109/geoffrey-de-smet) Geoffrey De Smet\n\n26.9k1212 gold badges7676 silver badges123123 bronze badges\n\n1\n\n- 1\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for the info.

In*two-dimensional bin packing problems*these units are finite rectangles, and the objective is to pack all the items into the minimum number of units, while in*two-dimensional strip packing problems*there is a single standardized unit of given width, and the objective is to pack all the items within the minimum height. We discuss mathematical models, and survey lower bounds, classical approximation algorithms, recent heuristic and metaheuristic methods and exact enumerative approaches. The relevant special cases where the items have to be packed into rows forming levels are also discussed in detail.\n## Introduction\nIn several industrial applications one is required to allocate a set of rectangular items to larger rectangular standardized stock units by minimizing the waste. In wood or glass industries, rectangular components have to be cut from large sheets of material. In warehousing contexts, goods have to be placed on shelves. In newspapers paging, articles and advertisements have to be arranged in pages. In these applications, the standardized stock units are rectangles, and a common objective function is to pack all the requested items into the minimum number of units: the resulting optimization problems are known in the literature as two-dimensional bin packing problems. In other contexts, such as paper or cloth industries, we have instead a single standardized unit (a roll of material), and the objective is to obtain the items by using the minimum roll length: the problems are then referred to as two-dimensional strip packing problems. As we will see in the following, the two problems have a strict relation in almost all algorithmic approaches to their solution.\nMost of the contributions in the literature are devoted to the case where the items to be packed have a fixed orientation with respect to the stock unit(s), i.e., one is not allowed to rotate them. This case, which is the object of the present article, reflects a number of practical contexts, such as the cutting of corrugated or decorated material (wood, glass, cloth industries), or the newspapers paging. For variants allowing rotations (usually by 90\u00b0) and/or constraints on the items placement (such as the \u201cguillotine cuts\u201d), the reader is referred to Lodi et al. [41], [42], where a three-field classification of the area is also introduced. General surveys on cutting and packing problems can be found in Dyckhoff and Finke [17], Dowsland and Dowsland [16] and Dyckhoff et al. [18]. Results on the probabilistic analysis of packing algorithms can be found in Coffman and Shor [12] and Coffman and Lueker [11].\nLet us introduce the problems in a more formal way. We are given a set of*n*rectangular*items**j*\u2208*J*={1,\u2026,*n*}, each defined by a*width*,*w**j*, and a*height*,*h**j*:\n* (i)\nin the*Two-Dimensional Bin Packing Problem*(2BP), we are further given an unlimited number of identical rectangular*bins*of width*W*and height*H*, and the objective is to allocate all the items to the minimum number of bins;\n* (ii)\nin the*Two-Dimensional Strip Packing Problem*(2SP), we are further given a bin of width*W*and infinite height (hereafter called*strip*), and the objective is to allocate all the items to the strip by minimizing the height to which the strip is used.\nIn both cases, the items have to be packed with their*w*-edges parallel to the*W*-edge of the bins (or strip). We will assume, with no loss of generality, that all input data are positive integers, and that*w**j*\u2a7d*W*and*h**j*\u2a7d*H*(*j*=1,\u2026,*n*).\nBoth problems are strongly NP-hard, as is easily seen by transformation from the strongly NP-hard (one-dimensional)*Bin Packing Problem*(1BP), in which*n*items, each having an associated size*h**j*, have to be partitioned into the minimum number of subsets so that the sum of the sizes in each subset does not exceed a given capacity*H*.\nA third relevant case of rectangle packing is the following. Each item*j*has an associated profit*p**j*&gt;0, and the problem is to select a subset of items, to be packed in a single finite bin, which maximizes the total selected profit. This problem is usually denoted as (*Two-Dimensional*)*Cutting Stock*, although it had been introduced by Gilmore and Gomory [29] as (*Two-Dimensional*)*Cutting Knapsack*.\nIn this survey we concentrate on two-dimensional problems in which all items have to be packed, i.e., on 2SP and 2BP. The reader is referred to Dyckhoff et al. [18, Section 5] for an annotated bibliography on two-dimensional cutting stock problems. For both 2SP and 2BP, we also consider the special case where the items have to be packed into rows forming levels.\nIn Section 2 we discuss mathematical models for the various problems introduced above. In Section 3 we survey classical approximation algorithms as well as more recent heuristic and metaheuristic methods. In Section 4 we introduce lower bounding techniques, while in Section 5 we describe exact enumerative approaches.\n## Section snippets\n## Modeling two-dimensional problems\nThe first attempt to model two-dimensional packing problems was made by Gilmore and Gomory [29], through an extension of their approach to 1BP (see [27], [28]). They proposed a column generation approach (see [53] for a recent survey) based on the enumeration of all subsets of items (*patterns*) that can be packed into a single bin. Let*A**j*be a binary column vector of*n*elements*a**ij*(*i*=1,\u2026,*n*) taking the value 1 if item*i*belongs to the*j*th pattern, and the value 0 otherwise. The set of all\n## Approximation algorithms\nIn this section we concentrate on*off-line*algorithms, i.e., algorithms which have full knowledge of the input. For*on-line*algorithms, which pack the i...",

This will have the advantage of having 0 penalty for the ordering part of the metric, however the total height will likely not be very good. To do this, we'll start by filling presents along the x-direction. Once there's no more room in the x-direction, we increment\nthe y-direction. Once there's no more room in the y-direction, we increment the z-direction.*\n### Requirements\n[](#requirements)\nI'm using the bleeding-edge sorting APIs from the`DataArrays`and`DataFrames`packages.\nAs such, you will require the latest`MASTER`versions of these packages rather than the versions available through the standard`METADATA`repo.
