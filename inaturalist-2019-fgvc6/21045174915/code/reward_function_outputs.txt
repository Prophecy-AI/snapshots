  "overall_failure_reason": "There was disagreement: one juror scored 1.0/trigger=0, focusing on correct prioritization of EfficientNet + strong augmentations and initial data inspection. However, the other two jurors (score 0.8 and 0.7, both trigger=1) cited concrete shortcomings—filesystem/path errors (calls 2 and 7) and, more importantly, incomplete exploration (not inspecting train JSONs for class imbalance) and missing synthesis/deliverable (e.g., seed_prompt.txt with an actionable strategy). Weighing the more comprehensive critiques, the final judgment is that performance was good but incomplete, warranting RL trigger and a sub-0.8 score."
