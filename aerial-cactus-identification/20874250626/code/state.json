      "finding": "Winning Kaggle solutions for 32\u202f\u00d7\u202f32 image tasks (e.g., CIFAR\u201110 style competitions) combine a **strong, well\u2011regularized CNN baseline** with aggressive **data\u2011augmentation, careful hyper\u2011parameter tuning, and model\u2011level ensembling**.  A common starting point is a small\u2011resolution\u2011friendly architecture such as ResNet\u201118/34, Wide\u2011ResNet, or EfficientNet\u2011B0 that is either trained from scratch or fine\u2011tuned from ImageNet weights using the \u201cbottleneck\u2011features + top\u2011layer fine\u2011tuning\u201d recipe described by Chollet\u202f(2016)\u202f([keras.io](https://blog.keras.io/building-powerful-image-classification-models-using-very-little-data.html)).  Because 32\u202f\u00d7\u202f32 images provide very little spatial information, heavy augmentation (random crops, horizontal flips, color jitter, CutMix/MixUp) is essential to prevent over\u2011fitting and to expose the model to diverse patterns\u202f([Towards Data Science, 2019](https://towardsdatascience.com/latest-winning-techniques-for-kaggle-image-classification-with-limited-data-5259",
