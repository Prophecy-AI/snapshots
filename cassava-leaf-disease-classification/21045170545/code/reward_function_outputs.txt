There was disagreement: one juror scored 1.0 and did not trigger RL, but that assessment cited fewer calls and did not address the missing synthesis/output; the majority view (and fuller evidence) supports TRIGGER=1 with a high-but-not-perfect score."

There was mild disagreement on severity: one juror scored higher (0.6) due to effective debugging and recovery steps, while two scored lower (0.4) emphasizing the strategic mismatch and persistent failures. I resolved this by weighting the shared strategic critique and repeated preventable errors more heavily while still crediting the strong diagnosis/fix in call_12, yielding an overall score of 0.45 with RL trigger enabled."
