  ],
  "overall_failure_reason": "Consensus: the agent’s exploration is strong (competition + top solutions + basic data inspection) but it has not produced the primary deliverable (a synthesized seed_prompt/strategy) and missed key EDA follow-through (e.g., class distribution, image characteristics). There was disagreement: one juror scored 1.0 and did not trigger RL, but that assessment cited fewer calls and did not address the missing synthesis/output; the majority view (and fuller evidence) supports TRIGGER=1 with a high-but-not-perfect score."
