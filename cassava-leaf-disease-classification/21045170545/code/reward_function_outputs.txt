There was mild disagreement on severity: one juror scored higher (0.6) due to effective debugging and recovery steps, while two scored lower (0.4) emphasizing the strategic mismatch and persistent failures. I resolved this by weighting the shared strategic critique and repeated preventable errors more heavily while still crediting the strong diagnosis/fix in call_12, yielding an overall score of 0.45 with RL trigger enabled."
