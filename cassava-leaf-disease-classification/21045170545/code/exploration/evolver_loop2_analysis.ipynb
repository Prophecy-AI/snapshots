    "## Objective\n",
    "Analyze the winning solutions and create a strategic plan to close the 13.95-point gap from 77.37% to 91.32%.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Findings from Winning Solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1st Place (Golddiggaz) - 91.32% private LB\n",
    "- **Ensemble of 4 models**: ResNeXt50, ViT-B/16, EfficientNet-B4 (NoisyStudent), CropNet (MobileNetV3)\n",
    "- **Key insight**: CropNet from TF Hub (pretrained on cassava) added crucial diversity\n",
    "- **Heavy augmentation**: RandomResizedCrop, Transpose, flips, ShiftScaleRotate, color transforms, CoarseDropout, Cutout\n",
    "- **Advanced loss**: Bit Tempered Logistic Loss, label smoothing\n",
    "- **TTA**: Overlapping patches with multiple augmentations\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2nd Place (Devon Stanfield) - 90.25% public LB  \n",
    "- **Simple approach**: Just CropNet from TF Hub\n",
    "- **Shows power of domain-specific pretrained model**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Current State\n",
    "- **Best CV**: 77.37% (exp_000, baseline CNN)\n",
    "- **Target**: 91.32%\n",
    "- **Gap**: 13.95 points\n",
    "- **Class imbalance**: CMD (class 3) = 61.5%, CBB (class 0) = 5.1%\n",
    "\n",
    "## Strategic Priorities\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Transfer Learning (Immediate - 8-12 point gain expected)\n",
    "- Custom CNN from scratch → Pretrained models\n",
    "- Start with CropNet (domain-specific) + EfficientNet-B4\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Heavy Augmentation (2-3 point gain)\n",
    "- Current: basic flips/rotations\n",
    "- Target: RandAugment, CutMix, MixUp, color transforms\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Class Imbalance Handling (1-2 point gain)\n",
    "- Current: None\n",
    "- Target: Class weights, focal loss, oversampling\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Ensembling (2-3 point gain)\n",
    "- Single model → Multiple diverse architectures\n",
    "- CropNet + EfficientNet + ResNeXt/ViT\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Advanced Training (1-2 point gain)\n",
    "- Current: Fixed LR, 10 epochs\n",
    "- Target: Cosine annealing, warmup, 30-50 epochs"
