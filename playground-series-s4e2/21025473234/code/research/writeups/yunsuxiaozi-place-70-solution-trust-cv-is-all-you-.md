Thank you to the organizers for organizing this competition, and also to all the participants who have put in effort for this competition

The only thing I can explain is that I believe in cross validation.

My code was already made public during the competition: https://www.kaggle.com/code/yunsuxiaozi/pss4e2-study-note

I achieved a score of 0.918 , but it was only submitted as 0.916. I believe it will perform better on the private leaderboard.

Due to the fact that the data for Playground competitions is machine synthesized, we should be able to believe that the distribution of training and testing data is consistent, and we can trust CV, but we cannot trust CV in the competitions such as time series or small sample competitions.
