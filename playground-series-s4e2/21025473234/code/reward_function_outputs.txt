There was disagreement on TRIGGER and top-end scoring (one juror gave 1.0/trigger=false), but two jurors flagged actionable gaps (threshold/metric optimization emphasis, hyperparameter specificity, public/private split considerations, and deeper EDA). I resolved this by assigning a high-but-not-perfect consensus score and following the majority that RL triggering is warranted."

Some jurors additionally noted missing advanced techniques (pseudo-labeling/stacking/using external original dataset) versus top solutions; these are secondary compared to the immediate reproducibility and workflow issues. Final score reflects strong modeling work tempered by critical execution/logging deficiencies."
