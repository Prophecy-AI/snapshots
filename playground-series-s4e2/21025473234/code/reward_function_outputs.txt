Minor omissions noted: deeper emphasis on metric/threshold optimization, more concrete hyperparameters, and clearer handling of public/private split implications."

  ],
  "overall_failure_reason": "No critical failures. The jury largely agrees performance is strong (research + basic EDA + high-quality strategy prompt). There was disagreement on TRIGGER and top-end scoring (one juror gave 1.0/trigger=false), but two jurors flagged actionable gaps (threshold/metric optimization emphasis, hyperparameter specificity, public/private split considerations, and deeper EDA). I resolved this by assigning a high-but-not-perfect consensus score and following the majority that RL triggering is warranted."
