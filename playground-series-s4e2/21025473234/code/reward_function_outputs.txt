I resolved this by assigning a high-but-not-perfect consensus score and following the majority that RL triggering is warranted."

Some jurors additionally noted missing advanced techniques (pseudo-labeling/stacking/using external original dataset) versus top solutions; these are secondary compared to the immediate reproducibility and workflow issues. Final score reflects strong modeling work tempered by critical execution/logging deficiencies."
