VENTILATOR PRESSURE PREDICTION - ANALYSIS FINDINGS
==================================================

1. DATA SCALE: 5.4M training samples, 603K test samples - large dataset
2. BASELINE SCORE: 0.4589 MAE - far from gold threshold (0.1119)
3. TARGET RANGE: Pressure ranges from ~5 to ~60, MAE of 0.4589 is ~1-2% error
4. LUNG ATTRIBUTES: R (5-50) and C (10-50) significantly affect pressure patterns
5. TEMPORAL DYNAMICS: Clear time series patterns within each breath
6. PHASES: ~80% inspiratory (u_out=0, scored), ~20% expiratory (u_out=1, not scored)
7. CONTROL INPUT: u_in is the primary control variable affecting pressure
8. SYSTEM RESPONSE: Pressure lags behind u_in changes (system dynamics)
9. FEATURE IMPORTANCE: Baseline showed u_out_lag_2 and u_in_cumsum as top features

IMPROVEMENT NEEDED: 75.6% reduction in MAE
