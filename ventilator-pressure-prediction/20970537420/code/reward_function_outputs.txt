There was disagreement on severity (one juror scored ~0.7 vs another ~0.4); I resolved this by crediting the solid exploratory groundwork while penalizing the major miss on competition-defining strategy and the ineffective web retrieval, yielding a mid score and triggering RL."

I resolve this by crediting baseline competence but weighting more heavily the decisive evidence: the LightGBM/tabular approach (even with basic physics-inspired features) is substantially misaligned with winning methods (sequence models and/or PID/physics-driven reconstruction), leading to a highly uncompetitive score and compounded by a training timeout. Consensus supports triggering RL."
