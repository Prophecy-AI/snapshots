  "overall_failure_reason": "The jury largely agrees the agent performed competent basic EDA (file discovery, schema checks, baseline statistics) but failed at the most important competitive insight-gathering: it did not surface or prioritize the PID-controller/physics-based reverse-engineering approach (often reported to perfectly predict a large fraction of cases) nor the discrete-pressure 'snap-to-grid' postprocessing cue. There was disagreement on severity (one juror scored ~0.7 vs another ~0.4); I resolved this by crediting the solid exploratory groundwork while penalizing the major miss on competition-defining strategy and the ineffective web retrieval, yielding a mid score and triggering RL."
