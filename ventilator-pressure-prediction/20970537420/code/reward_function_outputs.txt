The agent also showed inefficiency via redundant checks and an attempted read of a non-existent file. Given the consistently poor hidden score cited by jurors and the lack of actionable strategic redirection, an RL update is warranted.

This strategic omission makes the proposed 'more features/better models' path unlikely to close the large performance gap.
