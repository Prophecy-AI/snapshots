  "overall_failure_reason": "There is strong consensus across the jury (no substantive disagreement): the agent performed well at extracting high-level strategy from winning writeups, but failed to locate or access the actual dataset, spending many steps in repetitive filesystem searches and making a few avoidable tool/path errors. The late pivot to inspecting kernel notebooks was correct but not leveraged deeply enough to recover a usable data-loading path, leaving the task incomplete; thus RL triggering is warranted."
