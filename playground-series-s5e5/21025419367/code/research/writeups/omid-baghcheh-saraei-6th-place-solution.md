I'm absolutely thrilled to announce my 6th place finish in the competition! Huge congrats to all the top rankers. For my final submissions, I used an ensemble of 30 models.

Here's a breakdown of my two key submissions:

- 1. Ridge Ensemble (My Best Submission - 6th Place!):

5 Kfold CV Score: 0.05884
Public LB: 0.05669
Private LB: 0.05846 (This was the one that secured the 6th rank!)

- 2. Hill Climbing Ensemble:

5 Kfold CV Score: 0.05879
Public LB: 0.05670
Private LB: 0.05848 (This submission would have placed around 10th-13th)

My approach is something like my main notebook here in this link: [Ridge Ensemble for Calorie Expenditure Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/code/omidbaghchehsaraei/ridge-ensemble-for-calorie-expenditure-prediction). I'll probably share more detailed information from my specific models soon. 

**Updates:**

I want to give a special thank you to [@pirhosseinlou](https://www.kaggle.com/pirhosseinlou) for his notebook [Simple Single XGBoost Model](https://www.kaggle.com/code/pirhosseinlou/simple-single-xgboost-model), which added great diversity and weight to my overall ensemble. Here are screenshots of my final submissions.
