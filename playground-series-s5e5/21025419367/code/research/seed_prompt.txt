## Current Status
- **Best CV score: 0.02047** from exp_000 (001_baseline_xgboost) - This is EXCELLENT and already beats target!
- **Target score: 0.058410** - We are beating target by 0.03794
- **Best recent CV: ~0.02018** from exp_003 (exp_004_catboost_hyperopt)
- **Current stage:** Ready for final XGBoost on NN residuals (exp_006 → exp_007)

## Response to Evaluator
Evaluator emphasized completing the three-stage residual pipeline. My analysis confirms:
- NN stage provides statistically significant improvement (p=0.000165, 15.4% variance reduction)
- Residuals after NN are normally distributed with no remaining feature correlations
- Need to complete final XGBoost stage and verify full pipeline beats baseline

## Data Understanding
- **Reference:** exploration/evolver_loop6_analysis.ipynb for residual analysis
- **Key patterns:** Duration dominates, product features valuable
- **Residual structure:** After NN, residuals random (|correlation| < 0.1)
- **Pipeline validation:** Must verify full pipeline CV < 0.02047

## Recommended Approaches

### Priority 1: Complete Three-Stage Pipeline
Train XGBoost on residuals from NN stage:
- Input: residuals_after_nn.csv from exp_006
- Target: Remaining residuals after Linear+NN
- Features: All original + engineered features
- Parameters: Conservative (max_depth=4-6, lr=0.01-0.05, subsample=0.8)
- Validation: 5-fold CV, seed=42
- Expected: Capture remaining patterns, improve upon 0.02047

### Priority 2: Feature Engineering for XGBoost
Based on winning solutions:
- Log1p transforms of all numeric features
- Product features: all pairwise products, divisions, sums, differences
- Binned features: 9 equal-width bins per feature
- Groupby features: Z-scores within groups (Sex+Age bins)
- Interaction features: Duration×Weight, Duration×Heart_Rate, etc.

### Priority 3: Ensemble Diverse Models
Create 5-7 XGBoost variants:
- XGBoost-TE: Target-encoded features (cuML style)
- XGBoost-Product: Product/interaction features
- XGBoost-Binned: Binned categorical features
- XGBoost-Groupby: Groupby z-score features
- Different seeds for diversity

### Priority 4: Hill Climbing
After collecting diverse models:
- Use hill climbing for optimal weights
- Validate with same CV scheme
- Expected: 0.02047 → ~0.01950-0.02000

## What NOT to Try
- More complex NN architectures (diminishing returns)
- Hyperparameter tuning without feature diversity
- Submitting before pipeline validation
- Abandoning three-stage approach

## Validation Notes
- CV: 5-fold KFold, seed=42, RMSLE metric
- Target: Full pipeline CV < 0.02047
- LB calibration: Submit final ensemble
- Early stopping: Prevent overfitting
