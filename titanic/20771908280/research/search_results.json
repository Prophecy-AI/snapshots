The titanic data frame does not contain information from the crew, but it\ndoes contain actual ages of half of the passengers. The principal source for data about\nTitanic passengers is the Encyclopedia Titanica. The datasets used here were begun by\na variety of researchers. One of the original sources is Eaton & Haas (1994) Titanic:\nTriumph and Tragedy, Patrick Stephens Ltd, which includes a passenger list created by\nmany researchers and edited by Michael A. Findlay.\nThe variables on our extracted dataset are pclass, survived, name, age, embarked,\nhome.dest, room, ticket, boat, and sex. pclass refers to passenger class (1st, 2nd, 3rd),\nand is a proxy for socio-economic class. Age is in years, and some infants had\nfractional values. The titanic2 data frame has no missing data and includes records for\nthe crew, but age is dichotomized at adult vs. child. These data were obtained from\nRobert Dawson, Saint Mary's University, E-mail. The variables are pclass, age, sex,\nsurvived. These data frames are useful for demonstrating many of the functions in\nHmisc as well as demonstrating binary logistic regression analysis using the Design\nlibrary. For more details and references see Simonoff, Jeffrey S (1997): The \"unusual\nepisode\" and a second statistics course. J Statistics Education, Vol. 5 No. 1. Thomas\nCason of UVa has greatly updated and improved the titanic data frame using the\nEncyclopedia Titanica and created a new dataset called titanic3. These datasets\nreflects the state of data available as of 2 August 1999. Some duplicate passengers\nhave been dropped, many errors corrected, many missing ages filled in, and new\nvariables created.

Some children travelled only with a nanny, therefore parch=0\nfor them. As well, some travelled with very close friends or neighbors in a village,\nhowever, the definitions do not support such relations.\nBio150 / ML Frank\nfrank@lakeforest.edu Page 3 of 3\nAn interesting result may be obtained using functions from the Hmisc library.\nattach (titanic3)\nplsmo (age, survived, group=sex, datadensity=T) # or group=pclass\nplot (naclus (titanic3)) # study patterns of missing values\nsummary (survived ~ age + sex + pclass + sibsp + parch, data=titanic3)\nSUBMITTED BY: Thomas E.
