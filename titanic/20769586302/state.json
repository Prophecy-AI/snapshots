      "finding": "Feature engineering is the process of turning raw passenger data into richer, model\u2011friendly variables that capture the underlying patterns driving survival. In the Titanic competition, simple transformations such as handling missing values and one\u2011hot encoding categorical fields (e.g.,\u202fSex,\u202fEmbarked,\u202fPclass) are essential, but the biggest gains come from creating new attributes that combine or extract information from existing columns\u202f([xiangyutang2](https://xiangyutang2.github.io/feature-engineering)).\n\nThe most effective techniques reported by recent Kaggle\u2011focused tutorials include:  \n\n* **Family\u2011size features** \u2013 sum\u202f`SibSp`\u202fand\u202f`Parch`\u202fto get total family members (`family_size`) and derive a binary\u202f`IsAlone`\u202fflag for passengers traveling solo\u202f([codesignal](https://codesignal.com/learn/courses/data-cleaning-and-preprocessing-in-machine-learning/lessons/feature-engineering-enhancing-the-titanic-dataset-for-survival-predictions),\u202f[GitHub](https://github.com/SamanthaZhang25/Kaggle-Ti",

Recent open\u2011source notebooks that cracked the leaderboard report that:\n\n* **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** achieved the highest average F1 score (\u2248\u202f80\u202f%) among five tested algorithms, edging out other models by a small margin\u3010https://amyrmahdy.medium.com/titanic-survival-prediction-comparing-5-machine-learning-models-d1d451a9e558\u3011.  \n* **Random Forests** consistently rank near the top, delivering the best single\u2011model accuracy in several repos (84.35\u202f% on a hold\u2011out set) and outperforming baseline logistic regression in ensemble pipelines\u3010https://github.com/alicevillar/titanic-kaggle\u3011, \u3010https://github.com/engalaagabr/Titanic\u3011.  \n* **Gradient\u2011boosting (XGBoost)** is a core component of the highest\u2011scoring pipelines, often combined with other learners in stacked ensembles that push public scores into the top\u202f10\u202f% of the competition\u3010https://github.com",
