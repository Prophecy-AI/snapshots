In the Titanic competition, simple transformations such as handling missing values and one\u2011hot encoding categorical fields (e.g.,\u202fSex,\u202fEmbarked,\u202fPclass) are essential, but the biggest gains come from creating new attributes that combine or extract information from existing columns\u202f([xiangyutang2](https://xiangyutang2.github.io/feature-engineering)).\n\nThe most effective techniques reported by recent Kaggle\u2011focused tutorials include:  \n\n* **Family\u2011size features** \u2013 sum\u202f`SibSp`\u202fand\u202f`Parch`\u202fto get total family members (`family_size`) and derive a binary\u202f`IsAlone`\u202fflag for passengers traveling solo\u202f([codesignal](https://codesignal.com/learn/courses/data-cleaning-and-preprocessing-in-machine-learning/lessons/feature-engineering-enhancing-the-titanic-dataset-for-survival-predictions),\u202f[GitHub](https://github.com/SamanthaZhang25/Kaggle-Ti",
