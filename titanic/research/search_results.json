On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships\n\nOne of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.\n\n## Cross validation results\n\nAfter applying the appropriate preprocessing, each model was evaluated using 10-fold cross validation. Each model\\`s hyperparameters were tuned using extensive grid search. Afterwards, tuned models can be ensembled together for a boost in accuracy.\n\n[![drawing](https://github.com/NickKaparinos/Kaggle-Titanic/raw/master/Plots/cv.png)](https://github.com/NickKaparinos/Kaggle-Titanic/blob/master/Plots/cv.png)\n\n## Test set results\n\nUsing the optimal voting model, a test set accuracy of **0.8110** was achieved, which corresponds to position **349/50092** in the leaderboard (top 0.6%).\n\n[![drawing](https://github.com/NickKaparinos/Kaggle-Titanic/raw/master/Plots/kaggle_results1.PNG)](https://github.com/NickKaparinos/Kaggle-Titanic/blob/master/Plots/kaggle_results1.PNG)\n\n[![drawing](https://github.com/NickKaparinos/Kaggle-Titanic/raw/master/Plots/kaggle_results2.PNG)](https://github.com/NickKaparinos/Kaggle-Titanic/blob/master/Plots/kaggle_results2.PNG)\n\n## About\n\nKaggle Titanic Competition.

      "text": "Titanic Survival Prediction Enhanced by Innovative \nFeature Engineering and Multi-Model Ensemble \nOptimization \nHanzhi Li \n1 School of Software Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, \nGuangdong, 510006, China \n202230321188@mail.scut.edu.cn\nAbstract. This study enhances Titanic survival prediction through advanced \nfeature engineering and ensemble model optimization. The Titanic dataset \npresents a classic binary classification problem requiring the prediction of \npassenger survival based on demographic and ticket information. Our \nmethodology employs systematic preprocessing where missing values are \nintelligently imputed, including eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) \npredictions for age values. Novel features were extracted from passenger \nnames, cabin information, and family relationships to improve predictive \npower. Feature importance was evaluated using Random Forest and XGBoost \nalgorithms, with SelectFromModel and Recursive Feature Elimination applied \nfor effective feature selection. Three classification algorithms\u2014logistic \nregression, random forest, and XGBoost\u2014were systematically optimized using \ngrid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization techniques. Based on \nthese optimized models, soft voting and stacking ensemble approaches were \nimplemented. Cross-validation results demonstrate that ensemble methods \nachieved superior accuracy (0.8361) compared to individual models: logistic \nregression (0.8339), random forest (0.8350), and XGBoost (0.8204). This \nresearch provides valuable optimization strategies for similar classification \ntasks, particularly highlighting how feature engineering combined with \nensemble methods can substantially enhance predictive performance while \nmaintaining computational efficiency. \nKeywords: Titanic Survival Prediction, Feature Engineering, Ensemble \nLearning, Hyperparameter Tuning. \n1 Introduction \nThe collision of the Titanic with an iceberg in 1912 was the cause of this catastrophe \nthat left 1,517 lives lost and is one of the most dangerous maritime accidents of the \ntwentieth century. Its historical significance and the multidimensional nature of \npassenger data (including social class, gender, age, family relationships, etc.) have \nestablished it as a classic binary classification benchmark dataset in machine learning. \n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2025\nY. Sun (ed.), Proceedings of the 2025 3rd International Conference on Image, Algorithms, and Artificial\nIntelligence (ICIAAI 2025), Advances in Computer Science Research 122,\nhttps://doi.org/10.2991/978-94-6463-823-3_19\n208 H. Li\nDespite extensive research on this problem, traditional methods exhibit \nsignificant limitations. Early studies predominantly focused on the direct application \nof basic features, achieving prediction accuracy generally below 80% [1]. For \ninstance, simple rules based on gender and passenger class could rapidly distinguish \nsurvival groups. However, these methods failed to fully explore nonlinear interactions \nbetween features and higher-order features. Moreover, approximately 20% of the age \nfield and 68% of the cabin number field (Cabin) are missing in the dataset. Traditional \napproaches often rely on mean imputation or directly delete missing values, leading to \ninformation loss and model bias [2]. \nAccording to previous research, traditional classification methods applied to the \nTitanic dataset achieved limited accuracy. These methods were constrained by their \ninability to capture complex feature interactions and their sensitivity to missing values \n[2]. Simultaneously, traditional methods predominantly depend on single models such \nas logistic regression and decision trees without conducting feature importance \nselection, resulting in lower prediction accuracy [3]. Recent studies have introduced \nensemble models but have not systematically compared their performance with single \nmodels, nor explored how different hyperparameter tuning methods influence \nprediction model performance in this dataset. \nTo address these challenges, this study employs advanced feature engineering \ntechniques to extract new features, utilizes the relationships between features and \neXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) for missing value imputation, applies feature \nselection techniques like random forests and XGBoost to identify key features for \nsurvival prediction, and performs hyperparameter tuning of logistic regression, \nrandom forests, and XGBoost models using grid search, random search, and Bayesian \noptimization. Based on these methods, soft voting and stacking ensemble models are \ntrained, and the performance of models under various parameter conditions is further \ncompared. \n2 Methods \n2.1 DataSet \nThis study is based on the Titanic dataset provided by the Kaggle platform [4]. The \ndataset consists of two CSV files: the training set and the test set. The training set \ncontains 891 samples, while the test set contains 418 samples. The data features \ninclude PassengerId, Name, Pclass, Sex, Age, SibSp, Parch, Ticket, Fare, Cabin, and \nEmbarked. Additionally, the training set includes an additional target variable, \n\"Survived\". Analysis reveals missing values in the Age, Cabin, and Embarked \ncolumns in the training set, and the Age, Cabin, and Fare columns in the test set, with \nAge and Cabin having a relatively high proportion of missing values [2]. \n2.2 Data Processing \nTo facilitate data processing, this study first combined the training set and the test set\nto form a complete dataset, called the \"merged set\". The missing values in the\nTitanic Survival Prediction Enhanced by Innovative Feature \u2026 209\nEmbarked and Fare columns, which had relatively few missing values, were filled \nfirst. By analyzing the sample features corresponding to the missing values in \nEmbarked, it was found that these samples all had a Pclass of 1, a Fare of 80.0, a \nCabin of B28, and a Sex of female. Considering the correlations between features, a \nstrong relationship among Pclass, Fare, and Embarked was assumed. Based on this \nassumption, box plots of Fare distribution under different combinations of Embarked \nand Pclass were created (Figure 1), and it was determined that when Fare is 80 and \nPclass is 1, Embarked is more likely to be 'C'. Therefore, the missing Embarked \nvalues were filled with 'C'. Similarly, for cases where Embarked = 'S' and Pclass = 3, \nthe median Fare was calculated and used to fill missing Fare values in the test set [2]. \nFig. 1. Fare Distribution by Embarked and Pclass (Photo/Picture credit: Original). \nNext, the Cabin column was processed. Due to the high number of missing values, the \nanalysis was based only on available information. Records with Cabin information \nwere filtered, and the distribution of cabin classes between survivors and \nnon-survivors was compared. Cabin values containing multiple cabins were split into \nlists, and the data was expanded row-wise to generate new features. Two new features \nwere extracted: Deck (the letter part, filled with \"U\" if none) and Cabin number (the \nnumeric part, converted to a numeric type). The Cabin number was further binned, \nand survival rates within different intervals were analyzed [5]. The analysis revealed \nthat passengers in cabin numbers ranging from 0-50 had a survival rate of \napproximately 45%, while those in ranges 51-100 showed a higher survival rate of \naround 60%. Passengers in cabin numbers above 100 had mixed survival rates, \nranging from 40% to 55%, depending on the specific range. Meanwhile, specific \nsurvival rates for each Deck were calculated, which showed notable variations: Deck \nB had the highest survival rate at approximately 74%, followed by Decks D and E at \naround 75% and 75%, respectively, while Deck U (unknown) had the lowest survival \nrate at about 30%. Finally, the expanded data was re-aggregated into the original \nmerged dataset (Fig. 1). \nThe Title (such as \"Mr\", \"Mrs\") was extracted from the Name column as a new\nfeature. Rare Titl...",

Given a dataset, we are required to predict which passengers were transported or not by an \u201canomaly\u201d using records recovered from the spaceship\u2019s damaged computer system. The \u201clore\u201d of the competition is not so important, what you need to know is to develop a machine learning algorithm capable of correctly predicting the outcome of the spaceship\u2019s passengers.\n\n## Import libraries\n\n```\nimport pandas as pdimport numpy as npimport matplotlib.pyplot as pltimport seaborn as snsfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split,GridSearchCV,cross_val_score,StratifiedKFoldimport xgboost as xgbimport category_encoders as cefrom sklearn.impute import SimpleImputerfrom sklearn.pipeline import Pipelinefrom sklearn.pipeline import make_pipelinefrom sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformerfrom sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, roc_auc_score, precision_score, recall_score,f1_score, confusion_matrixfrom category_encoders import TargetEncoderfrom sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer,KNNImputerfrom lightgbm import LGBMClassifier\n```\n\n## Let\u2019s Start\n\nAs you can see, after I loaded the dataset, I removed both the \u201cPassenger Id\u201d and \u201cName\u201d columns. They are not going to provide any useful or important information to the prediction. Someone\u2019s name or Id does not change the probability of being Transported.\n\n```\ndf = pd.read_csv(\"train.csv\")df.drop(columns=[\"PassengerId\",\"Name\"],inplace=True)\n```\n\nNow, we are going to discuss a fundamental step I came across after trying to improve my score a thousand times. This step relies on exploring the \u201cCabin\u201d column. Notice that the rows on the \u201cCabin\u201d column follow a specific pattern. Something like this: \u201cA/5/S\u201d, \u201cC/1/S\u201d, \u201cF/7/P\u201d. And I decided to investigate it. So, to make things simple I split the rows of the \u201cCabin\u201d into three columns based on both slashes (\u201d/\u201d) of the rows. For example, the \u201cA/5/S\u201d row would be transformed into three new columns: The first one is named \u201ccabin\\_code\u201d referring tothe character behind the first slash (A). The second one named \u201cid\\_cabin\u201d refers to the character behind the second slash (5). The third one named \u201ccabin\\_sector\u201d refers to the character after the second slash (S). And we end up with three new columns.\n\n```\n#Splittingdf[[\"cabin_code\",\"id_cabin\",\"cabin_sector\"]] = df[\"Cabin\"].str.split(\"/\", n=2, expand=True)df.head(4)\n```\n\nFirst of all, I noticed that \u201ccabin\\_code\u201d only has 8 different characters which means that the cabins are, somehow, divided into 8 sections.\n\nAlso, I asked myself if passengers from a specific section had a higher chance of being transported or if this statement was not true. With the plot below we can conclude that passengers from the B and C sections have a greater chance of surviving and passengers from the E section have a lower chance of surviving.\n\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\n\nI did the same thing with the \u201ccabin\\_sector\u201d column and also noticed that there was a difference between the sectors. Passengers from the P sector have a lower chance of being transported, while in the S sector, the opposite happens.\n\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\n\nThis means that this exploration of the original \u201cCabin\u201d column is worth it since new insights are being added to the model.\n\nNow, we can finally delete the \u201cCabin\u201d column. It will not provide any useful information for the model anymore. We have already extracted everything useful from it.\n\nI also removed the \u201ccabin\\_id\u201d and the column that I had created. As I said before, the Id will not interfere with the model\u2019s predictive ability.\n\nSo used: df.drop(columns=\\[\u201cCabin\u201d,\u201did\\_cabin\u201d\\], inplace=True) to drop both columns\n\nBefore splitting our data, the \u201cTransported\u201d column must be in a binary format. As you can see, I switched \u201cTrue\u201d for 1 and \u201cFalse\u201d for 0.\n\nBinary transformation: df\\[\u201cTransported\u201d\\] = df\\[\u201cTransported\u201d\\].map({True:1, False:0})\n\nI also removed every row that had missing values in the \u201ccabin\\_code\u201d column.\n\n```\n#BINARY TRANSFORMATIONdf[\"Transported\"] = df[\"Transported\"].map({True:1, False:0})#DROPPING COLUMNSdf.drop(columns=[\"Cabin\",\"id_cabin\"], inplace=True)#DROPPING NULLSdf.dropna(subset=[\"cabin_code\"], inplace=True)\n```\n\nNow, we can finally split the data and proceed to develop our model.\n\nAfter splitting in train and test, I separated the test data into two categories: numerical and categorical. Why is that? We are going to perform different operations depending on the type of the variable. Categorical data must be encoded since most models are not able to understand categorical values and it must be converted to numerical values. Also, we are going to apply different techniques to fill the null values in our dataset, but I will talk more about it later on.\n\n```\n#Define X and yX = df.iloc[:,0:12]y = df[\"Transported\"]\n```\n\n```\n#Splitting DataX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X,y,random_state=42,test_size=0.25)\n```\n\n```\n#Separate categorical and numerical featurescat_feat = np.array([coluna for coluna in X_train.columns if X_train[coluna].dtype.name == 'object'])num_feat = np.array([coluna for coluna in X_train.columns if coluna not in cat_feat])\n```\n\nWe can now create our pipeline. There are going to be two pipelines: one is going to handle the categorical data and the other one is going to handle numerical data. The missing values of the categorical data will be filled with the most frequent value (mode) and after the Target Encoder will be applied to transform categorical variables into numerical variables. The numerical data missing values will be filled with a strategy called **K-nearest neighbors,** which uses the Euclidean distance between the data points to find the best number to fill the missing values. If don\u2019t know how this Pipeline technique works, I recommend you check [my article about Pipelines.](https://medium.com/@fernandao.lacerda.dantas/boost-your-pipelines-with-columntransformer-b2c009db096f)\n\n```\n#Categorical and numerical pipelinescat_pipe = Pipeline([(\"imputer_cat\", SimpleImputer(strategy=\"most_frequent\")),(\"encoder\", ce.TargetEncoder()),                    ])num_pipe = Pipeline([(\"imputer_num\", KNNImputer(n_neighbors=3))])\n```\n\nAnd with column transformer, we can attach both transformations to one variable that I named \u201ctransformer\u201d. Observe that we also have to specify the type of data to which the pipeline will be applied t...",

RMS Titanic was a British passenger ship that hit an iceberg while on its voyage from Southampton to New York City, and sank in the North Atlantic ocean, leaving hundreds of passengers to die in the aftermath of the deadly incident. Some of the passengers who survived till help arrived were rescued while many lost their lives helplessly waiting for help to arrive.\n\nThe legendary Kaggle problem, [Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic), based on the tragedic sinking of the RMS Titanic records data about 891 passengers of RMS Titanic, and we are required to predict if they have survived or not, based on the information we have available about the passengers and the outcome after the sinking of the ship.\n\nNote: This notebook is my analysis of the titanic dataset to obtain any meaningful insights from the data and scores an accuracy of ~80 percent (top 5 percent of 14k entries on Kaggle) .\n\nLet\u2019s get started!\n\n## Contents:\n\n1\\. About the data\n\n2\\. Problem definition and metrics\n\n3\\. EDA\n\n4\\. Baseline model performance\n\n5\\. Model Selection\n\n6\\. Results and conclusion\n\n## About the data:\n\nFirst, we have the prediction variable, that is if they survived the sinking or not. Then a bunch of numeric variables, like ids, ages of the passengers, etc. followed by categorical variables like class of the ticket, and strings like name, etc.\n\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\n\nExample RMS Titanic ticket : [Source](https://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/titanic-tickets/)\n\nPrinting first 5 rows of given dataset..\n\n## Problem definition and metrics\n\nThe problem is a **binary class classification** problem. We can use **binary crossentropy** or logistic loss as the loss function and any metric like **accuracy** or/and **ROC AUC score** as a metric to evaluate the results.\n\n## EDA\n\n### Correlation between features:\n\nDrawing insights from the correlation between features..\n\n- Fare and Pclass are negatively correlated (with a Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient of -0.55) ; Obviously, **higher fares imply better better ticket classes** (lower the class number) and vice versa.\n- Pclass and the target feature are moderately negatively correlated (-0.34) implying **better the ticket class, higher the chance of survival.**\n- A similar pattern can be observed with the features Parch, SibSp and Age; Both the features, Parch and SibSp are very slightly correlated with all the features except Age feature, and both have a negative correlation (-0.19 and -0.31 respectively) with Age ; **Lower the age, more the number of family accompanying the passenger**\n- SibSp and Parch features are positively correlated which are both indicative of the number of family members accompanying passenger\n- PClass and Age are negatively correlated (-0.37) implying **higher the age, better the ticket class**\n\n### Missing data\n\n**Age** : Contains 177 nan values out of 891 entries. Imputed with median gave best results.\n\n**Embarked** : Contains 2 nan values. Imputed with mode of existing data.\n\n**Cabin** : 687 out of 891 Cabin entries are nans, i.e. more than 50 percent of the total data exists as missing data or Nans so assumed its better to derive other features from this feature.\n\nNow, printing the correlation heatmap after handling missing data and converting categorical strings to encodings (0,1,2..)..\n\n- Embarked also has slight correlation with the target variable (-0.17), the **port at which the ship was boarded by the passengers did determine their chance of survival**\n- Sex is also highly correlated with the target variable (-0.54), indicating the **passenger\u2019s gender had a high effect on their chance of survival**\n- Embarked and Fare of the passengers are negatively correlated (-0.22); obviously, fare depends on the port a passenger boards the ship from.\n- Embarked and Sex also seem slightly correlated (0.11) indicating the **port the passenger boarded from was dependent on the gender of the passenger**; Embarked and Pclass are also correlated (0.16) indicating a **1st class passenger probably boarded at a different port than a 3rd class passenger**.\n- Sex and Fare, Sex and Parch, SibSp, Sex and Pclass all seem slightly correlated (-0.18, -0.25, -0.11, 0.13 respectively); i.e the **fare the passenger paid, the family aboard, and the class of the ticket was seem slightly dependent on the gender of the passenger**.\n\n**Question 1: How do the features \u2018Age\u2019, \u2018Sex\u2019, \u2018Fare\u2019, \u2018Embarked\u2019 affect the chance of a passenger\u2019s survival?**\n\nAge :\n\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\n\n- Both distributions, of people who didn\u2019t survive and the ones who did, are normal with a spike around age 30 for passengers who did not survive i.e. for **people around the age 30 had a higher chance of not surviving**\n- People of ages > ~51 are considered outliers in the distribution of people who did not survive. owing to the fact **people above the age of ~51 are very less** and people of age ~55 above are outliers in the distribution of people who did survive, i.e. **very few people above ~55 actually did survive**\n\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\n\nSex:\n\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\n\n- From the above stacked plots, it is clear **more percentage of female passengers survived** i.e. 74.2 % while only 18.9 % of male passengers survived, even though more male passesngers were aboard\n\nFare :\n\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\n\n- Distribution of fares of survivors clearly has a higher median value, hence **passengers who survived had higher average fares**\n- Lots of outliers in the distribution of both\n- A huge spike in the distribution of the people who didn\u2019t survive, or the probability that the person who didn\u2019t survive had a fare of ~10 units of currency is very high\n\nEmbarked:\n\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\n\n- Maximum passengers seem to have boarded the ship at Southampton port and only 33 percent of them survived; out of the total passengers who boarded the ship at Queenstown, a simi...",

The notebooks are named in pseudo-chronological order. I say \"pseudo\" because whenever I revisited a process, I edited the relevant existing notebook without creating a new one. Hence, some code and results in earlier notebooks may not have been used in the next few notebooks, but were used at some point in the entire project.\n\n## Exploratory Data Analysis\n\nFirst, I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on all features in the dataset ( [1\\. EDA.ipynb](https://github.com/chrischow/kaggle_titanic/blob/master/Notebooks/1.%20EDA.ipynb)). Concurrently, I cleaned the data and generated new features.\n\n## Modelling\n\n### Random Forest ( `sklearn`)\n\nNext, I experimented with the `sklearn` implementation of Random Forest ( [2\\. Random Forest - Low Depth.ipynb](https://github.com/chrischow/kaggle_titanic/blob/master/Notebooks/2.%20Random%20Forest%20-%20Low%20Depth.ipynb)). By the final iteration in the optimisation process, the accuracy was **82.47%**. However, the `sklearn` implementation ( `RandomForestClassifier`) was extremely slow. Hence, I switched over to the `lightgbm` implementation of the Random Forest algorithm.\n\n### Random Forest ( `lightgbm`)\n\nThe `lightgbm` implementation of the Random Forest algorithm was **much** faster. The subsequent three notebooks captured my attempts at figuring out the best sequence for the tuning of parameters. The best approach was to:\n\n1. Tune the number of trees/estimators\n2. Perform Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) with cross-validation (CV)\n3. Tune the proportion of observations sampled\n4. Tune the maximum features used per split\n5. Tune the minimum samples in each terminal node\n6. Tune alpha, the L1 regularisation parameter\n7. Tune lambda, the L1 regularisation parameter\n\nThis tuning sequence resulted in a 5-fold CV test score of **83.46%**.\n\n### Regenerating Features\n\nThen, I realised that I made a mistake in the feature generation process. I had generated encoded features using the entire training set. This resulted in contamination, which meant that the pseudo-test sets in CV contained information about the target, and this could have inflated the test scores. Instead, I should have (1) performed data cleaning on the competition training and test sets together, (2) encoded the training set while saving the mappings, and (3) performed mappings on the test set. Hence, I created the [`kaggle_titanic` module](https://github.com/chrischow/kaggle_titanic/blob/master/Modules/kaggle_titanic.py) to perform these three data cleaning functions, and many other functions for machine learning.\n\n### Model Tuning I - Improper Cross Validation\n\nI created pipelines for performing feature selection for and tuning the various models:\n\n1. LightGBM RF with low depth\n2. LightGBM RF with high depth\n3. LightGBM GBM with low depth\n4. LightGBM GBM with high depth\n5. XGBoost GBM with low depth\n6. XGBoost GBM with high depth\n7. Logistic Regression\n8. Ridge Regression\n9. Linear Support Vector Classifier (SVC)\n\nHaving completed the tuning for the above models, I discovered another source of contamination: in the cross validation process. I was using cross validation to both (1) tune hyperparameters and (2) score models. These two processes should have been separate. The correct way to have performed cross validation was:\n\n1. Split data into **meta folds** (e.g. 5 repeats of 5 folds)\n2. For each **meta fold**:\na. Split training data into folds (e.g. 5 repeats of 5 folds)\nb. Run feature selection and hyperparameter tuning algorithms using cross validation\nc. Score the model on the test set of the **meta fold**\nd. Move on to next **meta fold** and repeat\n3. Evaluate results for all **meta folds**\n\nThe first important thing I learned was that although feature selection and parameter tuning require cross validation, **all processes from data cleaning to feature generation to feature selection to hyperparameter tuning** require cross validation as well. In other words, **cross validation should be used to validate the full approach**. My mistake was that I saw hyperparameter tuning with cross validation as the end stage of testing. This was wrong. The second important thing I learned was that it was better to place feature selection before hyperparameter tuning. This is because changes in hyperparameter levels do not change how important or unimportant the features are. We only need the initial parameters for running RFE to not prevent the algorithm from letting the important features surface. For example, in tree-based models, increasing the number of trees, depth, or features sampled per tree would help to ensure that sufficient features are evaluated. The tradeoff to increasing these hyperparameters would be the computational cost. These two objectives should be balanced well.\n\n## About\n\nKaggle Competition - Titanic Dataset\n\n### Resources\n\n[Readme](https://github.com/chrischow/kaggle_titanic#readme-ov-file)\n\n[Activity](https://github.com/chrischow/kaggle_titanic/activity)\n\n### Stars\n\n[**1**\\\nstar](https://github.com/chrischow/kaggle_titanic/stargazers)\n\n### Watchers\n\n[**2**\\\nwatching](https://github.com/chrischow/kaggle_titanic/watchers)\n\n### Forks\n\n[**0**\\\nforks](https://github.com/chrischow/kaggle_titanic/forks)\n\n[Report repository](https:...",

Even though achieving the highest accuracy is our main objective, I believe this project is highly \"core\" for people who are new to data science or simply want to refresh their memory on the subject.</p><figure></figure><p>For those who do not know about Kaggle\u2019s competition, let me quickly inform you that our goal is to predict the survivors of the Titanic disaster. On Kaggle's page, you can find comprehensive information about this subject. This page includes graphs that provide a detailed description of the data set's attributes.</p><p>First of all, we will quickly examine the data set (EDA), and then we will determine if there are outliers. We will fill in any missing data, if there are any. We interpret the notable results based on the correlations found in the dataset between the independent and dependent variables. A machine-learning model is going to be developed based on these findings.
