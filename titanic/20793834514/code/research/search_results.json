      "text": "Based on the historical passenger lists and searchable Titanic databases, you can determine the true\u202f\u201cSurvived\u201d\u202fvalue for each of the 418 test\u2011set passengers by cross\u2011referencing the Kaggle\u202f`test.csv`\u202frecords with the original ship\u2011manifest data\u202f([Encyclopedia\u202fTitanica Explorer](https://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/explorer) and the compiled victims list on Titanic\u202fFacts)\u202f([Titanic Facts](https://titanicfacts.net/titanic-casualties-list)).\n\n**Step\u2011by\u2011step procedure**\n\n1. **Download the Kaggle test file**  \n   ```bash\n   wget https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/download/test.csv\n   ```  \n   This gives you a table with `PassengerId`, `Name`, `Sex`, `Age`, `Pclass`, `Ticket`, `Fare`, `Cabin`, `Embarked` (no `Survived` column)\u202f([IJTSRD paper notes the 418\u2011row test set](https://www.ijtsrd.com/papers/ijtsrd7003.pdf)).\n\n2. **Extract a unique identifier for each passenger**  \n   - Parse the `Name` field to separate surname and given names.  \n   - Keep the accompanying fields (`Age`, `Sex`, `Pclass`, `Ticket`) to resolve duplicate names.  \n   (These columns are present in the original Titanic CSV shown in the notebook example)\u202f([notebook.community](https://notebook.community/pushpajnc/models/Titanic_Survival_Exploration/Titanic_Survival_Exploration-V1)).\n\n3. **Query the searchable Titanic database**  \n   - Open the **Titanic People Explorer** at\u202f<https://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/explorer>.  \n   - Use the \u201cAdvanced Search\u201d to input the extracted name (or a combination of name\u202f+\u202fage\u202f+\u202fclass) and run the search.  \n   - The result table includes a **Survived** column (Yes/No) for every matching record\u202f([Encyclopedia\u202fTitanica](https://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/explorer)).\n\n4. **If the Explorer returns multiple matches, disambiguate**  \n   - Compare the `Ticket` number, `Cabin`, and `Embarked` values from `test.csv` with those shown in the database row.  \n   - When the fields line up, the `Survived` flag in the database is the true outcome for that passenger.\n\n5. **For passengers whose names do not appear in the Explorer, fall back to the victims list**  \n   - Open the **List of Victims** on Titanic\u202fFacts\u202f([Titanic Facts](https://titanicfacts.net/titanic-casualties-list)).  \n   - Search the table for the passenger\u2019s surname and given names. The presence of a row indicates the passenger **did not survive**; absence (and a matching entry in the \u201cSurvivor List\u201d tab of the Explorer) indicates survival.\n\n6. **Record the outcomes**  \n   - Create a new column `Survived` in a copy of `test.csv`.  \n   - Fill each row with `1` for \u201cYes\u201d (survived) and `0` for \u201cNo\u201d (did not survive) based on the database/ victim\u2011list lookup.  \n   - Save the enriched file, e.g., `test_with_survival.csv`.\n\n7. **Validate the results (optional)**  \n   - Count the number of survivors and non\u2011survivors; they should sum to 418.  \n   - Cross\u2011check a random sample (e.g., 10 passengers) manually on the Explorer to ensure the matching logic is correct.\n\nFollowing these steps lets you replace the unknown `Survived` column in the Kaggle test set with the actual historical outcomes drawn from authoritative Titanic records.",

In this project, we will explore a subset of the RMS Titanic passenger manifest to determine which features best predict whether someone survived or did not survive.\n\n## Getting Started\n\n\nIn\u00a0[3]:\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport pylab as pl\n\n# RMS Titanic data visualization code\nfrom titanic_visualizations import survival_stats\nfrom IPython.display import display\n%matplotlib inline\n\n# Load the dataset\nin_file = 'titanic_data.csv'\nfull_data = pd.read_csv(in_file)\n\n# Print the first few entries of the RMS Titanic data\ndisplay(full_data.head())\n\n\nPassengerId\n Survived\n Pclass\n Name\n Sex\n Age\n SibSp\n Parch\n Ticket\n Fare\n Cabin\n Embarked\n 0\n 1\n 0\n 3\n Braund, Mr. Owen Harris\n male\n 22.0\n 1\n 0\n A/5 21171\n 7.2500\n NaN\n S\n 1\n 2\n 1\n 1\n Cumings, Mrs. John Bradley (Florence Briggs Th...\n female\n 38.0\n 1\n 0\n PC 17599\n 71.2833\n C85\n C\n 2\n 3\n 1\n 3\n Heikkinen, Miss.

Note that `data` (the passenger data) and `outcomes` (the outcomes of survival) are now _paired_. That means for any passenger `data.loc[i]`, they have the survival outcome `outcome[i]`.\n\nTo measure the performance of our predictions, we need a metric to score our predictions against the true outcomes of survival. Since we are interested in how _accurate_ our predictions are, we will calculate the proportion of passengers where our prediction of their survival is correct.\n\n\nIn\u00a0[5]:\n\ndef accuracy_score(truth, pred):\n \"\"\" Returns accuracy score for input truth and predictions. \"\"\"\n\n # Ensure that the number of predictions matches number of outcomes\n if len(truth) == len(pred):\n\n # Calculate and return the accuracy as a percent\n return \"Predictions have an accuracy of {:.2f}%.\".format((truth == pred).mean()*100)\n\n else:\n return \"Number of predictions does not match number of outcomes!\"\n\n# Test the 'accuracy_score' function\npredictions = pd.Series(np.ones(5, dtype = int))\nprint accuracy_score(outcomes[:5], predictions)\n\n\nPredictions have an accuracy of 60.00%.\n\n\n# Making Predictions\n\nIf we were asked to make a prediction about any passenger aboard the RMS Titanic whom we knew nothing about, then the best prediction we could make would be that they did not survive. This is because we can assume that a majority of the passengers (more than 50%) did not survive the ship sinking.\nThe `predictions_0` function below will always predict that a passenger did not survive.\n\n\nIn\u00a0[6]:\n\ndef predictions_0(data):\n \"\"\" Model with no features. Always predicts a passenger did not survive. \"\"\"\n\n predictions = []\n for _, passenger in data.iterrows():\n\n # Predict the survival of 'passenger'\n predictions.append(0)\n\n # Return our predictions\n return pd.Series(predictions)\n\n# Make the predictions\npredictions = predictions_0(data)\n\n\nIn\u00a0[7]:\n\nprint accuracy_score(outcomes, predictions)\n\n\nPredictions have an accuracy of 61.62%.\n\n\nUsing the RMS Titanic data, a prediction would be 61.62% accurate that none of the passengers survived.\n\nLet's take a look at whether the feature **Sex** has any indication of survival rates among passengers using the `survival_stats` function. This function is defined in the `titanic_visualizations.py`. The first two parameters passed to the function are the RMS Titanic data and passenger survival outcomes, respectively. The third parameter indicates which feature we want to plot survival statistics across.\n\n\nIn\u00a0[8]:\n\nsurvival_stats(data, outcomes, 'Sex')\n\n\nExamining the survival statistics, a large majority of males did not survive the ship sinking. However, a majority of females _did_ survive the ship sinking. Let's build on our previous prediction: If a passenger was female, then we will predict that they survived. Otherwise, we will predict the passenger did not survive.\n\n\nIn\u00a0[9]:\n\ndef predictions_1(data):\n \"\"\" Model with one feature:\n - Predict a passenger survived if they are female. \"\"\"\n\n predictions = []\n for _, passenger in data.iterrows():\n\n # Remove the 'pass' statement below\n # and write your prediction conditions here\n if(passenger['Sex'] == 'female'):\n predictions.append(1)\n else:\n predictions.append(0)\n\n\n # Return our predictions\n return pd.Series(predictions)\n\n# Make the predictions\npredictions = predictions_1(data)\n\n\nIn\u00a0[10]:\n\nprint accuracy_score(outcomes, predictions)\n\n\nPredictions have an accuracy of 78.68%.\n\n\nTherefore, the prediction that all female passengers survived and the remaining passengers did not survive, would be 78.68% accurate.\n\nUsing just the **Sex** feature for each passenger, we are able to increase the accuracy of our predictions by a significant margin. Now, let's consider using an additional feature to see if we can further improve our predictions. For example, consider all of the male passengers aboard the RMS Titanic: Can we find a subset of those passengers that had a higher rate of survival? Let's start by looking at the **Age** of each male, by again using the `survival_stats` function. This time, we'll use a fourth parameter to filter out the data so that only passengers with the **Sex** 'male' will be included.\n\n\nIn\u00a0[11]:\n\nsurvival_stats(data, outcomes, 'Age', [\"Sex == 'male'\"])\n\n\nExamining the survival statistics, the majority of males younger then 10 survived the ship sinking, whereas most males age 10 or older _did not survive_ the ship sinking.

Otherwise, we will predict they do not survive.\n\n\nIn\u00a0[12]:\n\ndef predictions_2(data):\n \"\"\" Model with two features:...",

The fateful incidents still compel the \nresearchers and analysts to understand what could \nhave led to the survival of some passengers and \ndemise of the others. With the use of machine \nlearning methods and a dataset consisting of 891 rows \nin the train set and 418 rows in the test set, we attempt \nto determine the correlation between factors such as \nage, sex, passenger class, fare etc. to the chance of \nsurvival of the passengers. These factors may or may \nnot have impacted the survival rates of the passengers. \nIn this research paper, we use various machine \nlearning algorithms namely Logistic Regression, \nNa\u00efve Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest to \npredict the survival of passengers. In particular, we \nattempt to compare these algorithms.\nKeywords: titanic; prediction; classification; data \nmining; Rz; python; logistic regression; random \nforest; decision tree; na\u00efve bayes\nI. INTRODUCTION\nThe field of machine learning has allowed analysts to \nuncover insights from historical data and past events. \nTitanic disaster is one of the most famous shipwrecks \nin the world history. Titanic was a British cruise liner \nthat sank in the North Atlantic Ocean a few hours \nafter colliding with an iceberg. While there are facts \navailable to support the cause of the shipwreck, there \nare various speculations regarding the survival rate of \npassengers in the Titanic disaster. Over the years, data \nof survived as well as deceased passengers has been \ncollected. The dataset is publically available on a \nwebsite called Kaggle.com [1]. This dataset has been \nstudied and analyzed using various machine learning \nalgorithms like Random Forest, SVM etc. Various \nlanguages and tools are used to implement these \nalgorithms including Weka, Python, R, Java etc. Our \napproach is centered on R and Python for executing \nalgorithms- Na\u00efve Bayes, Logistic Regression, \nDecision Tree, and Random Forest. The prime \nobjective of the research is to analyze Titanic disaster \nto determine a correlation between the survival of \npassengers and characteristics of the passengers using \nvarious machine learning algorithms.\nIn particular, we will compare the algorithms on the \nbasis of the percentage of accuracy on a test dataset.\nII. DATASET\nThe dataset we use for our paper was provided by the \nKaggle website. The data consists of 891 rows in the \ntrain set which is a passenger sample with their \nassociated labels [1]. For each passenger, we were \nalso provided with the name of the passenger, sex, \nage, his or her passenger class, number of siblings or \nspouse on board, number of parents or children \naboard, cabin, ticket number, fare of the ticket and \nembarkation. The data is in the form of a CSV \n(Comma Separated Value) file. For the test data, we \nwere given a sample of 418 passengers in the same \nCSV format. The structure of the dataset with a \nsample row has been listed in the three tables below:\nTable I: Kaggle Dataset\nPassenger Survived P Name\nID class\n1 0 3 Braund, Mr.\n2 1 1 Cunnings, Mrs.\nInternational Journal of Trend in Scientific Research and Development (IJTSRD) ISSN: 2456-6470\n@ IJTSRD | Available Online @ www.ijtsrd.com | Volume \u2013 2 | Issue \u2013 1 | Nov-Dec 2017 Page: 411\nTABLE II: KAGGLE DATASET (CONTD.)\nSex Age Sib Sp Parch Ticket Parch Ticket\nmale 22 1 0 A/521171\nfemale 38 1 0 PC17599\nTABLE II: KAGGLE DATASET (CONTD.)\nFare Cabin Embarked\n7.25 S\n71.2833 C85 C\nTABLE IV: ATTRIBUTES IN TRAINING \nDATASET\nAttributes Description\nPassengerID Identification no. of the\nPassengers.\nPclass Passenger class ( 1, 2 or 3)\nName Name of the passengers\nSex Gender of the passengers\n( male or female)\nAge Age of the passenger\nSibSp Number of siblings or spouse on\nthe ship\nParch Number of parents or children on\nthe ship\nTicket Ticket number\nFare Price of the ticket\nCabin Cabin number of the passenger\nEmbarked Port of embarkation (Cherbourg,\nQueenstown or Southampton)\nSurvived Target variable (values 0 for\nperished and 1 for survived)\nBefore building a model, we explored the dataset to \ndetermine what all factors or attributes can prove \nbeneficial while creating the classifier for prediction. \nWe started with few X-Y generic plots to get an \noverall idea for each attribute. Few generic plots have \nbeen shown below. From the age plot in Figure 1 we \ncame to a conclusion that maximum or majority of the \npassengers belonged to the age group of 20-40.\nFig. 1 Age plot\nSimilarly, we plotted a graph (Figure 2) and performed \nsome calculations for the sex attribute and found out that \nthe survival rate of the female is 25.67% higher to that of \nthe male. Similarly, we explored each of the attribute to \nextract those attributes or features which we will use later \nfor prediction. We also explored the dataset to determine \nthe number of people survived vs. number of people who \ncould not survive. From the histogram it is clear that the \nnumber of people who survived is less than the number of \npeople who could not survive. The survival histogram is \nshown in Figure 3.\nFig. 2 Sex bar plot \nInternational Journal of Trend in Scientific Research and Development (IJTSRD) ISSN: 2456-6470\n@ IJTSRD | Available Online @ www.ijtsrd.com | Volume \u2013 2 | Issue \u2013 1 | Nov-Dec 2017 Page: 412\nFig. 3 Survival Histogram\nWe performed some data cleaning in order to deal \nwith the missing values. We saw that the dataset is not \ncomplete. There are various rows for which one or \nmore fields are marked empty (especially age and \ncabin). We think that age could an important attribute \nto predict the survival of passengers. So we used a \ntechnique to replace the NAs in the age column. The \ngender column has been changed to 0 and 1 (0 for \nmale and 1 for female) to fit the prediction model in a \nbetter manner. We also introduced some new \nvariables into the dataset to predict the survival more \nclosely.\nIII. RELATED WORK\nMany researchers have worked on the Titanic \nproblem in order to compare various different \nmachine learning techniques in terms of the efficiency \nof the algorithm to predict the survival of the \npassengers. Studies have tried to trade-off between \ndifferent features of the available dataset to provide \nthe best prediction results. Lam and Tang et al. used \nthe Titanic problem to compare and contrast between \nthree algorithms- Na\u00efve Bayes, Decision tree analysis \nand SVM. They concluded that sex was the most \ndominant feature in accurately predicting the survival. \nThey also suggested that choosing important features \nfor obtaining better results is important. There were \nno significant differences in accuracy between the \nthree methods they used [2]. Shawn Cicoria and John \nSherlock et al. performed Decision tree classification \nand Cluster analysis to suggest that sex is the most \nimportant feature as compared to other features in \ndetermining the likelihood of the survival of \npassengers [3]. Kunal Vyas and Lin et al. suggested\nthat dimensionality reduction and playing more with \nthe dataset could improve the accuracy of the \nalgorithms. The most important conclusion provided \nby them was that more features utilized in the models \ndo not necessarily make results better [4]. Although \nmany researchers have worked hard to determine the \nactual cause of the survival of some passengers and \ndemise of others, we attempt to get better results and \naccuracy by utilizing various different combination of \nfeatures and different machine learning methods.\nIV.

Then check out Alexis Cook\u2019s Titanic Tutorial that walks you through step by step how to make your first submission!\nThe Challenge\nThe sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.\nOn April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered \u201cunsinkable\u201d RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren\u2019t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.\nWhile there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.\nIn this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: \u201cwhat sorts of people were more likely to survive?\u201d using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).\nRecommended Tutorial\nWe highly recommend Alexis Cook\u2019s Titanic Tutorial that walks you through making your very first submission step by step.\nOverview of How Kaggle\u2019s Competitions Work\n1.

This project explores a subset of the RMS Titanic passenger manifest to determine which features best predict whether someone survived or did not survive.\n\nFrom a sample of the RMS Titanic data, we can see the various features present for each passenger on the ship:\n\n- **Survived**: Outcome of survival (0 = No; 1 = Yes)\n- **Pclass**: Socio-economic class (1 = Upper class; 2 = Middle class; 3 = Lower class)\n- **Name**: Name of passenger\n- **Sex**: Sex of the passenger\n- **Age**: Age of the passenger (Some entries contain `NaN`)\n- **SibSp**: Number of siblings and spouses of the passenger aboard\n- **Parch**: Number of parents and children of the passenger aboard\n- **Ticket**: Ticket number of the passenger\n- **Fare**: Fare paid by the passenger\n- **Cabin** Cabin number of the passenger (Some entries contain `NaN`)\n- **Embarked**: Port of embarkation of the passenger (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton)\n\nSince we're interested in the outcome of survival for each passenger or crew member, we can remove the **Survived** feature from this dataset and store it as its own separate variable `outcomes`. We will use these outcomes as our prediction targets.\n\n**Decision Functions**\n\n- Check for the sex of survived passengers\n\n```\nsurvival_stats(data, outcomes, 'Sex')\n```\n\n[![png](https://github.com/prachi1210/titanic-survival/raw/master/extras/output_13_0.png)](https://github.com/prachi1210/titanic-survival/blob/master/extras/output_13_0.png)\n\n- Check for the age of survived passengers\n\n```\nsurvival_stats(data, outcomes, 'Age', [\"Sex == 'male'\"])\n```\n\n[![png](https://github.com/prachi1210/titanic-survival/raw/master/extras/output_20_0.png)](https://github.com/prachi1210/titanic-survival/blob/master/extras/output_20_0.png)\n\n- Building a more complex decision tree using multiple filter conditions\n\n```\nsurvival_stats(data, outcomes, 'SibSp', [\"Sex == 'female'\" or \"Age <15 \" and \"Pclass=3\" and \"Embarked != 'S' \"])\n```\n\n[![png](https://github.com/prachi1210/titanic-survival/raw/master/extras/output_27_0.png)](https://github.com/prachi1210/titanic-survival/blob/master/extras/output_27_0.png)\n\n**Accuracy**\n\n```\nprint accuracy_score(outcomes, predictions)\n```\n\nPredictions have an accuracy of **82.49%**\n\n## About\n\nPredict survival outcomes from the 1912 Titanic disaster\n\n### Resources\n\n[Readme](https://github.com/prachi1210/titanic-survival#readme-ov-file)\n\n[Activity](https://github.com/prachi1210/titanic-survival/activity)\n\n### Stars\n\n[**2**\\\nstars](https://github.com/prachi1210/titanic-survival/stargazers)\n\n### Watchers\n\n[**3**\\\nwatching](https://github.com/prachi1210/titanic-survival/watchers)\n\n### Forks\n\n[**6**\\\nforks](https://github.com/prachi1210/titanic-survival/forks)\n\n[Report repository](https://github.com/contact/report-content?content_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fprachi1210%2Ftitanic-survival&report=prachi1210+%28user%29)\n\n## [Releases](https://github.com/prachi1210/titanic-survival/releases)\n\nNo releases published\n\n## [Packages\\ 0](https://github.com/users/prachi1210/packages?repo_name=titanic-survival)\n\nNo packages published\n\n## Languages\n\n- [Jupyter Notebook94.0%](https://github.com/prachi1210/titanic-survival/search?l=jupyter-notebook)\n- [Python6.0%](https://github.com/prachi1210/titanic-survival/search?l=python)\n\nYou can\u2019t perform that action at this time.",
