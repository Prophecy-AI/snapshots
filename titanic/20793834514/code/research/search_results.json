Unfortunately, there weren\u2019t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.\n\nWhile there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.\n\nIn this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: \u201cwhat sorts of people were more likely to survive?\u201d using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).\n\nThe data has been split into two groups:\n\ntraining set (train.csv)\ntest set (test.csv)\nThe training set should be used to build your machine learning models. For the training set, we provide the outcome (also known as the \u201cground truth\u201d) for each passenger. Your model will be based on \u201cfeatures\u201d like passengers\u2019 gender and class. You can also use feature engineering to create new features.\n\nThe test set should be used to see how well your model performs on unseen data. For the test set, we do not provide the ground truth for each passenger. It is your job to predict these outcomes. For each passenger in the test set, use the model you trained to predict whether or not they survived the sinking of the Titanic.\\\n\nVariable Notes:\n\npclass: A proxy for socio-economic status (SES)\n1st = Upper\n2nd = Middle\n3rd = Lower\n\nage: Age is fractional if less than 1. If the age is estimated, is it in the form of xx.5\n\nsibsp: The dataset defines family relations in this way...\nSibling = brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister\nSpouse = husband, wife (mistresses and fianc\u00e9s were ignored)\n\nparch: The dataset defines family relations in this way...\nParent = mother, father\nChild = daughter, son, stepdaughter, stepson\nSome children travelled only with a nanny, therefore parch=0 for them.\n\n## About\n\nNo description, website, or topics provided.\n\n### Resources\n\n[Readme](https://github.com/Mohnish4533/Titanic---Survival-Prediction-kaggle-#readme-ov-file)\n\n[Activity](https://github.com/Mohnish4533/Titanic---Survival-Prediction-kaggle-/activity)\n\n### Stars\n\n[**1**\\\nstar](https://github.com/Mohnish4533/Titanic---Survival-Prediction-kaggle-/stargazers)\n\n### Watchers\n\n[**1**\\\nwatching](https://github.com/Mohnish4533/Titanic---Survival-Prediction-kaggle-/watchers)\n\n### Forks\n\n[**0**\\\nforks](https://github.com/Mohnish4533/Titanic---Survival-Prediction-kaggle-/forks)\n\n[Report repository](https://github.com/contact/report-content?content_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FMohnish4533%2FTitanic---Survival-Prediction-kaggle-&report=Mohnish4533+%28user%29)\n\n## [Releases](https://github.com/Mohnish4533/Titanic---Survival-Prediction-kaggle-/releases)\n\nNo releases published\n\n## [Packages\\ 0](https://github.com/users/Mohnish4533/packages?repo_name=Titanic---Survival-Prediction-kaggle-)\n\nNo packages published\n\n## Languages\n\n- [Jupyter Notebook100.0%](https://github.com/Mohnish4533/Titanic---Survival-Prediction-kaggle-/search?l=jupyter-notebook)\n\nYou can\u2019t perform that action at this time.",

On April 15, 1912, during\nher maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of\n2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international\ncommunity and led to better safety regulations for ships.\nWhat particularly we need do in this challange ?\nIn this challenge, we need to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to\nsurvive. In particular, we apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers\nsurvived the tragedy.\nOverview\nThe data has been split into two groups:\n\u2022 training set (train.csv)\n\u2022 test set (test.csv)\nThe training set should be used to build your machine learning models. For the training\nset, we provide the outcome (also known as the \u201cground truth\u201d) for each passenger. Your\nmodel will be based on \u201cfeatures\u201d like passengers\u2019 gender and class. You can also use\nfeature engineering to create new features.\nThe test set should be used to see how well your model performs on unseen data. For\nthe test set, we do not provide the ground truth for each passenger. It is your job to\npredict these outcomes. For each passenger in the test set, use the model you trained to\npredict whether or not they survived the sinking of the Titanic.\nWe also include gender\\_submission.csv, a set of predictions that assume all and only\nfemale passengers survive, as an example of what a submission file should look like.\nWhat does this data set mean?\nThe data has been split into two groups:\n\u2022 training set (train.csv)\n\u2022 test set(test.csv)\n\nThe training set includes passengers survival status(also know as the ground truth from\nthe titanic tragedy) which along with other features like gender, class, fare and pclass is\nused to create machine learning model.\nThe test set should be used to see how well my model performs on unseen data. The test\nset does not provide passengers survival status. We are going to use our model to predict\npassenger survival status.\nLets describe whats the meaning of the features given the both train & test datasets.\nVariable Definition Key.\n\u2022 Survival\n\u2022 0= No\n\u2022 1= Yes\n\u2022 pclass (Ticket class)\n\u2022 1=1st\n\u2022 2=2nd\n\u2022 3=3rd\n\u2022 sex\n\u2022 age\n\u2022 sibsp (# of siblings / spouses aboard the Titanic)\n\u2022 parch (# of parents / children aboard the Titanic)\n\u2022 tickets\n\u2022 fare\n\u2022 cabin\n\u2022 embarked Port of Embarkation.\n\u2022 C = Cherbourg,\n\u2022 Q = Queenstown,\n\u2022 S = Southampton\n\u2022 pclass: A proxy for socio-economic status (SES)\n\u2022 This is important to remember and will come in handy for later analysis.\n\u2022 1st = Upper\n\u2022 2nd = Middle\n\u2022 3rd = Lower\n\n## About\n\nNo description, website, or topics provided.\n\n### Resources\n\n[Readme](https://github.com/abhiee1898/Titanic-Survival-Prediction#readme-ov-file)\n\n[Activity](https://github.com/abhiee1898/Titanic-Survival-Prediction/activity)\n\n### Stars\n\n[**1**\\\nstar](https://github.com/abhiee1898/Titanic-Survival-Prediction/stargazers)\n\n### Watchers\n\n[**1**\\\nwatching](https://github.com/abhiee1898/Titanic-Survival-Prediction/watchers)\n\n### Forks\n\n[**0**\\\nforks](https://github.com/abhiee1898/Titanic-Survival-Prediction/forks)\n\n[Report repository](https://github.com/contact/report-content?content_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fabhiee1898%2FTitanic-Survival-Prediction&report=abhiee1898+%28user%29)\n\n## [Releases](https://github.com/abhiee1898/Titanic-Survival-Prediction/releases)\n\nNo releases published\n\n## [Packages\\ 0](https://github.com/users/abhiee1898/packages?repo_name=Titanic-Survival-Prediction)\n\nNo packages published\n\n## Languages\n\n- [Jupyter Notebook100.0%](https://github.com/abhiee1898/Titanic-Survival-Prediction/search?l=jupyter-notebook)\n\nYou can\u2019t perform that action at this time.",

Unfortunately, there weren\u2019t enough lifeboats \\#\\#\\#\\#for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.\n\n#### While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.\n\n### In this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: \u201cwhat sorts of people were more likely to survive?\u201d using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).\n\n## What Data Will I Use in This Competition?\n\n#### In this competition, you\u2019ll gain access to two similar datasets that include passenger information like name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc. One dataset is titled `train.csv` and the other is titled `test.csv`.\n\n#### Train.csv will contain the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 to be exact) and importantly, will reveal whether they survived or not, also known as the \u201cground truth\u201d.\n\n#### The `test.csv` dataset contains similar information but does not disclose the \u201cground truth\u201d for each passenger. It\u2019s your job to predict these outcomes.\n\n### Using the patterns you find in the train.csv data, predict whether the other 418 passengers on board (found in test.csv) survived.\n\n# Overview\n\n## The data has been split into two groups:\n\n### training set (train.csv)\n\n#### test set (test.csv)\n\n#### The training set should be used to build your machine learning models. For the training set, we provide the outcome (also known as the \u201cground truth\u201d) for each passenger. Your model will be based on \u201cfeatures\u201d like passengers\u2019 gender and class. You can also use feature engineering to create new features.\n\n##### The test set should be used to see how well your model performs on unseen data. For the test set, we do not provide the ground truth for each passenger. It is your job to predict these outcomes. For each passenger in the test set, use the model you trained to predict whether or not they survived the sinking of the Titanic.\n\n## About\n\nTitanic Kaggle Challenge\n\n### Resources\n\n[Readme](https://github.com/github.com#readme-ov-file)\n\n### Uh oh!\n\nThere was an error while loading.
