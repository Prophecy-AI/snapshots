Unfortunately, there weren\u2019t enough lifeboats \\#\\#\\#\\#for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.\n\n#### While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.\n\n### In this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: \u201cwhat sorts of people were more likely to survive?\u201d using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).\n\n## What Data Will I Use in This Competition?\n\n#### In this competition, you\u2019ll gain access to two similar datasets that include passenger information like name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc. One dataset is titled `train.csv` and the other is titled `test.csv`.\n\n#### Train.csv will contain the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 to be exact) and importantly, will reveal whether they survived or not, also known as the \u201cground truth\u201d.\n\n#### The `test.csv` dataset contains similar information but does not disclose the \u201cground truth\u201d for each passenger. It\u2019s your job to predict these outcomes.\n\n### Using the patterns you find in the train.csv data, predict whether the other 418 passengers on board (found in test.csv) survived.\n\n# Overview\n\n## The data has been split into two groups:\n\n### training set (train.csv)\n\n#### test set (test.csv)\n\n#### The training set should be used to build your machine learning models. For the training set, we provide the outcome (also known as the \u201cground truth\u201d) for each passenger. Your model will be based on \u201cfeatures\u201d like passengers\u2019 gender and class. You can also use feature engineering to create new features.\n\n##### The test set should be used to see how well your model performs on unseen data. For the test set, we do not provide the ground truth for each passenger. It is your job to predict these outcomes. For each passenger in the test set, use the model you trained to predict whether or not they survived the sinking of the Titanic.\n\n## About\n\nTitanic Kaggle Challenge\n\n### Resources\n\n[Readme](https://github.com/github.com#readme-ov-file)\n\n### Uh oh!\n\nThere was an error while loading.

On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.\n\nOne of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.\n\nIn this challenge, we ask you to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular, we ask you to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.\n\n## Evaluation [\u00b6](https://nbviewer.org/github/donnemartin/data-science-ipython-notebooks/blob/master/kaggle/titanic.ipynb\\#Evaluation)\n\nThe historical data has been split into two groups, a 'training set' and a 'test set'. For the training set, we provide the outcome ( 'ground truth' ) for each passenger. You will use this set to build your model to generate predictions for the test set.\n\nFor each passenger in the test set, you must predict whether or not they survived the sinking ( 0 for deceased, 1 for survived ). Your score is the percentage of passengers you correctly predict.\n\nThe Kaggle leaderboard has a public and private component. 50% of your predictions for the test set have been randomly assigned to the public leaderboard ( the same 50% for all users ). Your score on this public portion is what will appear on the leaderboard. At the end of the contest, we will reveal your score on the private 50% of the data, which will determine the final winner. This method prevents users from 'overfitting' to the leaderboard.\n\n## Data Set [\u00b6](https://nbviewer.org/github/donnemartin/data-science-ipython-notebooks/blob/master/kaggle/titanic.ipynb\\#Data-Set)\n\n| File Name | Available Formats |\n| --- | --- |\n| train | .csv (59.76 kb) |\n| gendermodel | .csv (3.18 kb) |\n| genderclassmodel | .csv (3.18 kb) |\n| test | .csv (27.96 kb) |\n| gendermodel | .py (3.58 kb) |\n| genderclassmodel | .py (5.63 kb) |\n| myfirstforest | .py (3.99 kb) |\n\n```\nVARIABLE DESCRIPTIONS:\nsurvival        Survival\n                (0 = No; 1 = Yes)\npclass          Passenger Class\n                (1 = 1st; 2 = 2nd; 3 = 3rd)\nname            Name\nsex             Sex\nage             Age\nsibsp           Number of Siblings/Spouses Aboard\nparch           Number of Parents/Children Aboard\nticket          Ticket Number\nfare            Passenger Fare\ncabin           Cabin\nembarked        Port of Embarkation\n                (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton)\n\nSPECIAL NOTES:\nPclass is a proxy for socio-economic status (SES)\n 1st ~ Upper; 2nd ~ Middle; 3rd ~ Lower\n\nAge is in Years; Fractional if Age less than One (1)\n If the Age is Estimated, it is in the form xx.5\n\nWith respect to the family relation variables (i.e. sibsp and parch)\nsome relations were ignored.

Unfortunately, there weren\u2019t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.\n\nWhile there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.\n\nIn this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: \u201cwhat sorts of people were more likely to survive?\u201d using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).\n\nThe data has been split into two groups:\n\ntraining set (train.csv)\ntest set (test.csv)\nThe training set should be used to build your machine learning models. For the training set, we provide the outcome (also known as the \u201cground truth\u201d) for each passenger. Your model will be based on \u201cfeatures\u201d like passengers\u2019 gender and class. You can also use feature engineering to create new features.\n\nThe test set should be used to see how well your model performs on unseen data. For the test set, we do not provide the ground truth for each passenger. It is your job to predict these outcomes. For each passenger in the test set, use the model you trained to predict whether or not they survived the sinking of the Titanic.\\\n\nVariable Notes:\n\npclass: A proxy for socio-economic status (SES)\n1st = Upper\n2nd = Middle\n3rd = Lower\n\nage: Age is fractional if less than 1. If the age is estimated, is it in the form of xx.5\n\nsibsp: The dataset defines family relations in this way...\nSibling = brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister\nSpouse = husband, wife (mistresses and fianc\u00e9s were ignored)\n\nparch: The dataset defines family relations in this way...\nParent = mother, father\nChild = daughter, son, stepdaughter, stepson\nSome children travelled only with a nanny, therefore parch=0 for them.\n\n## About\n\nNo description, website, or topics provided.\n\n### Resources\n\n[Readme](https://github.com/Mohnish4533/Titanic---Survival-Prediction-kaggle-#readme-ov-file)\n\n[Activity](https://github.com/Mohnish4533/Titanic---Survival-Prediction-kaggle-/activity)\n\n### Stars\n\n[**1**\\\nstar](https://github.com/Mohnish4533/Titanic---Survival-Prediction-kaggle-/stargazers)\n\n### Watchers\n\n[**1**\\\nwatching](https://github.com/Mohnish4533/Titanic---Survival-Prediction-kaggle-/watchers)\n\n### Forks\n\n[**0**\\\nforks](https://github.com/Mohnish4533/Titanic---Survival-Prediction-kaggle-/forks)\n\n[Report repository](https://github.com/contact/report-content?content_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FMohnish4533%2FTitanic---Survival-Prediction-kaggle-&report=Mohnish4533+%28user%29)\n\n## [Releases](https://github.com/Mohnish4533/Titanic---Survival-Prediction-kaggle-/releases)\n\nNo releases published\n\n## [Packages\\ 0](https://github.com/users/Mohnish4533/packages?repo_name=Titanic---Survival-Prediction-kaggle-)\n\nNo packages published\n\n## Languages\n\n- [Jupyter Notebook100.0%](https://github.com/Mohnish4533/Titanic---Survival-Prediction-kaggle-/search?l=jupyter-notebook)\n\nYou can\u2019t perform that action at this time.",

For each passenger in the test set, you must predict whether or not they survived the sinking ( 0 for deceased, 1 for survived ). Your score is the percentage of passengers you correctly predict.  The leaderboard has a public and private component. 50% of your predictions for the test set have been randomly assigned to the public leaderboard ( the same 50% for all users ). Your score on this public portion is what will appear on the leaderboard. At the end of the contest, we will reveal your score on the private 50% of the data, which will determine the final winner. This method prevents users from 'overfitting' to the leaderboard.  Data Description  Overview The data has been split into two groups: training set (train.csv) test set (test.csv)  The training set should be used to build your machine learning models. For the training set, we provide the outcome (also known as the \u201cground truth\u201d) for each passenger. Your model will be based on \u201cfeatures\u201d like passengers\u2019 gender and class. You can also use feature engineering to create new features.  The test set should be used to see how well your model performs on unseen data. For the test set, we do not provide the ground truth for each passenger. It is your job to predict these outcomes. For each passenger in the test set, use the model you trained to predict whether or not they survived the sinking of the Titanic.
