  "overall_failure_reason": "The jury largely agrees performance is competent but merits RL signal due to (1) a concrete tool-usage mistake (off-by-one/invalid notebook cell execution range) and (2) a strategic inefficiency highlighted by one juror: not sufficiently leveraging pre-fetched top kernel notebooks/winning patterns for Titanic. Where jurors disagreed (EDA adequacy and recovery quality), I weighted the shared evidence: solid general exploration but suboptimal kernel utilization, resulting in a mid-high score with trigger_rl=true."
