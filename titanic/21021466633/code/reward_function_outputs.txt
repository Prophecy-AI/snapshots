      "score": 0.75,

      "call_id": "5",
      "score": 0.33,
      "reasoning": "Clear consensus negative: off-by-one/invalid notebook cell range execution (0-based indexing mistake / invalid range) causing a tool error and interrupting flow."

      "call_id": "6",
      "score": 0.6,
      "reasoning": "Reading the notebook after the error is a sensible recovery/verification step; jurors differed on impact (neutral vs. good recovery), resolved as modestly positive."

      "call_id": "8",
      "score": 0.8,
      "reasoning": "Good continuation of EDA: target distribution and missingness checks are relevant; remaining critique is that the agent still hasn’t leveraged top kernels for established high-signal Titanic features."
    }
  ],
  "overall_failure_reason": "The jury largely agrees performance is competent but merits RL signal due to (1) a concrete tool-usage mistake (off-by-one/invalid notebook cell execution range) and (2) a strategic inefficiency highlighted by one juror: not sufficiently leveraging pre-fetched top kernel notebooks/winning patterns for Titanic. Where jurors disagreed (EDA adequacy and recovery quality), I weighted the shared evidence: solid general exploration but suboptimal kernel utilization, resulting in a mid-high score with trigger_rl=true."
