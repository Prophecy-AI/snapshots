  "overall_failure_reason": "There is broad jury consensus that the agent’s overall exploration strategy was sound, but execution suffered from avoidable file I/O mistakes (incorrect filename/path) and a misunderstanding/ignoring of Jupyter notebook JSON formatting (minified single-line notebook leading to invalid line-range reads). One juror (Gemini) was harsher (0.5) while two others rated 0.7; I resolve this disagreement by averaging toward the consensus but weighting the specific, well-supported tool-feedback failures as materially impactful, yielding a mid score (~0.63). Trigger is set because all jurors agreed issues warrant RL attention (efficiency/robustness in file handling and better recording of extracted insights)."
