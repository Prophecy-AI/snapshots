One juror (Gemini) was harsher (0.5) while two others rated 0.7; I resolve this disagreement by averaging toward the consensus but weighting the specific, well-supported tool-feedback failures as materially impactful, yielding a mid score (~0.63). Trigger is set because all jurors agreed issues warrant RL attention (efficiency/robustness in file handling and better recording of extracted insights)."

However, there is (1) a minor but real operational/tooling mistake (invalid notebook cell range) and (2) the modeling/feature set is more baseline-level than top-competitive for Titanic (lacking richer ticket/cabin/group features and/or ensembling). Jury disagreement on baseline strength (0.7 vs 1.0) was resolved by adopting a middle-ground score reflecting strong baseline but not SOTA."
