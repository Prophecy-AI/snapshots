## Current Status
- **Best CV Score**: 84.17% from exp_000 (Gradient Boosting baseline)
- **Best LB Score**: Not yet submitted
- **CV-LB Gap**: Unknown (no LB feedback yet)
- **Remaining Submissions**: 9/10

## Response to Evaluator

**Technical verdict was CONCERNS**. I agree the data leakage needs addressing, but my analysis shows the impact is minimal (0.23% difference: clean CV 84.40% vs leaky 84.17%). However, I accept the evaluator's priority - we must fix preprocessing before optimizing further. This is about building good habits, not just this competition.

**Evaluator's top priority**: Fix data leakage in preprocessing. **I agree completely** - this is non-negotiable. The next experiment must implement proper train/test separation in preprocessing using sklearn pipelines.

**Key concerns raised and my responses**:
1. **Data leakage**: Will fix with proper preprocessing pipeline
2. **Unclear target score**: Session state shows target is 1.0 (placeholder). For Titanic, competitive LB scores are 78-82%, so we're already performing well. But we should aim for 85%+ CV to be safe.
3. **Conservative model config**: Absolutely correct - we'll move to XGBoost with proper hyperparameter tuning
4. **Feature engineering depth**: Valid point - we have 8 untapped techniques identified from competitive intelligence

## Data Understanding

**Reference notebooks**: 
- `exploration/evolver_loop1_analysis.ipynb` - leakage impact analysis, feature importance, statistical validation
- `exploration/evolver_loop2_analysis.ipynb` - gap analysis vs competitive solutions
- `research/kernels/ldfreeman3_a-data-science-framework-to-achieve-99-accuracy/` - winning solution patterns
- `research/kernels/startupsci_titanic-data-science-solutions/` - tutorial with proven techniques

**Key patterns to exploit**:
1. **Sex dominates** (46.2% feature importance) - any engineering must respect this
2. **Family structure matters** - IsAlone flag proven effective in winning solutions
3. **Age needs binning** - Child/Teen/Adult/Senior categories capture non-linear effects
4. **Fare per person** - More informative than raw Fare for families
5. **Title refinement** - "Other" category lumps 29 rare titles; some (Dr, Rev, etc.) may have distinct patterns

**What NOT to do**:
- Don't extract cabin deck letters - my statistical analysis shows p=0.172 (not significant)
- Don't over-engineer Ticket - complex parsing with low expected ROI
- Don't drop Sex interactions - this is the dominant signal

## Recommended Approaches (Priority Order)

### Priority 1: Fix Preprocessing Pipeline (Evaluator's Top Priority)
- Implement sklearn pipelines with fit on train only, transform on both
- Use ColumnTransformer for mixed data types
- This is blocking all other improvements - must be done first
- Expected impact: Minimal score change (0.23% based on analysis), but ensures valid results

### Priority 2: High-ROI Feature Engineering
1. **IsAlone flag** (FamilySize == 1) - Proven in 99% accuracy solution
2. **Age binning** (Child: <18, Adult: 18-60, Senior: >60) - Captures non-linear survival patterns
3. **FarePerPerson** (Fare / FamilySize) - Better than raw Fare for families
4. **Title refinement** - Split "Other" into meaningful groups (Dr, Rev, Military, etc.)

### Priority 3: Model Upgrade & Hyperparameter Tuning
1. **Switch to XGBoost** - More modern than sklearn GB, better performance
2. **Hyperparameter search**: 
   - n_estimators: 500-1000
   - max_depth: 3-7
   - learning_rate: 0.01-0.1
   - Use RandomizedSearchCV with 5-fold CV
3. **Try Random Forest** as complementary model for ensembling

### Priority 4: Ensemble Strategy
1. **GB + Logistic Regression blend** - Proven pattern in winning solutions
2. **Weighted averaging** (0.75 GB + 0.25 LR typical)
3. **Stacking with meta-learner** if time permits

### Priority 5: Validation Enhancement
1. **Create holdout set** (20% stratified) for final validation
2. **Track CV-LB correlation** after first submission
3. **Adversarial validation** if CV-LB gap emerges

## What NOT to Try
- **Cabin deck letters**: Statistically insignificant (p=0.172), won't help
- **Complex Ticket parsing**: Low ROI, high complexity
- **Neural networks**: Overkill for this tabular problem
- **Excessive feature interactions**: Risk overfitting given small dataset
- **Target encoding**: Leakage risk with small dataset

## Validation Notes
- **CV scheme**: 5-fold stratified CV (proven effective)
- **Holdout set**: Create 20% stratified holdout for final validation
- **First submission**: Use improved single model to establish CV-LB correlation
- **Target CV**: Aim for 85%+ before ensembling
- **Leakage check**: After fixing preprocessing, re-run leakage analysis to confirm clean pipeline

## Success Criteria for Next Experiment
1. ✅ Preprocessing pipeline fixed (no combined train/test fitting)
2. ✅ At least 2 new features added (IsAlone + one more)
3. ✅ Model upgraded to XGBoost with basic hyperparameter tuning
4. ✅ CV score improves by >0.5% (target: 84.7%+)
5. ✅ Ready for first LB submission to establish CV-LB correlation
