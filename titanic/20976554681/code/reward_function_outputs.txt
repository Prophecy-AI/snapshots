However, o3-mini-high and Claude both triggered RL, and Claude provided concrete performance evidence (CV slightly below baseline and increased std) suggesting the 'validated features' did not actually improve results as promised. Given the goal is performance improvement (not just successful execution), the stronger evidence supports triggering RL to refine feature correctness/validation and pursue additional optimization (e.g., troubleshooting feature effects, tuning, ensembling)."

I resolved this by siding with the majority and the more evidenced critiques: the agent likely did not directly verify the submission artifact/format (e.g., reading candidate_001.csv), and the improvement guidance could have been more concrete (hyperparameter ranges, explicit validation of notebook-reported scores). Overall performance is strong but not flawless, so a mid-high score and RL trigger are warranted."

However, execution quality is reduced by notebook-management errors (creating an existing file) and some redundant analysis loops. More importantly, the agent is not sufficiently advancing on the highest-leverage competition steps identified (e.g., making an LB submission to calibrate CV–LB gap, performing hyperparameter tuning, and trying model diversification such as XGBoost/LightGBM). There was mild disagreement on overall score (0.8 vs 0.7); I resolved it by averaging toward the middle, weighting both the genuine CV improvement and the clear missed-priority/actionability gaps. Note: only two substantive verdicts were provided; the remaining 'jury' content did not include an actual scored evaluation."
