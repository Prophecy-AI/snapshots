Jurors largely agree this warrants RL triggering; where they disagreed on whether call 6 or 7 contained the first error, I followed the majority that the error occurred at call 6 and treated call 7 as a mixed recovery step."

The final score discounts the outlier because its justification was less evidence-based and conflicted with the specific, actionable shortcomings cited by the other jurors. Net: a solid but not competition-optimized baseline, with enough room for improvement to trigger RL."
