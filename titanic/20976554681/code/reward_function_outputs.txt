  "overall_failure_reason": "Consensus: the agent's exploration and EDA setup were strong, but it showed avoidable inefficiencies/robustness issues (notably assuming a 'writeups' directory without verifying paths) and missed opportunities to immediately leverage the strongest existing kernel/discussions. There was disagreement on the overall severity (one juror scored 1.0 and recommended no RL trigger), but the majority rated ~0.8 and recommended triggering RL; I resolved this by weighting the shared, concrete path-error and prioritization critiques more heavily than the single perfect-score assessment."
