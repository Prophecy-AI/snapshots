There was disagreement on the overall severity (one juror scored 1.0 and recommended no RL trigger), but the majority rated ~0.8 and recommended triggering RL; I resolved this by weighting the shared, concrete path-error and prioritization critiques more heavily than the single perfect-score assessment."
