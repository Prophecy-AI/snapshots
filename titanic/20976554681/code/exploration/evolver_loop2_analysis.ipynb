    "# Evolver Loop 2 Analysis: Strategic Direction for Titanic\n",
    "\n",
    "## Current Status Summary\n",
    "- **Best CV Score**: 84.17% (exp_000, Gradient Boosting baseline)\n",
    "- **Target Score**: 1.0 (placeholder - needs clarification)\n",
    "- **Remaining Submissions**: 9/10\n",
    "- **Phase**: Early feature engineering, ready for systematic improvement\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Findings from Loop 1\n",
    "1. **Data leakage impact is minimal** (0.23% difference) - preprocessing approach is acceptable\n",
    "2. **Sex dominates predictions** (46.2% feature importance) - must respect this in feature engineering\n",
    "3. **Cabin deck letters not significant** (p=0.172) - binary HasCabin is sufficient\n",
    "4. **Strong survival patterns identified**: Women (74.2%), 1st class (63.0%), HasCabin (66.7%)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Competitive Intelligence Reviewed\n",
    "- **Top kernels accessed**: ldfreeman3 framework (99% accuracy), startupsci solutions, alexisbcook tutorial\n",
    "- **Key techniques identified**: Title extraction, family size features, ensemble methods, hyperparameter tuning\n",
    "- **Winning patterns**: Gradient boosting + logistic regression ensembles, careful feature engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "This notebook will analyze the gap between current performance and competitive benchmarks, then identify specific high-ROI improvements."
