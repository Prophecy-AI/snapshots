    "## Key Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Hyperparameter Tuning Failed\n",
    "1. **Mixed regularization effects**: While we added regularization (min_child_weight, gamma, colsample_bytree), we also increased model capacity (max_depth: 4→5) and learning rate (0.05→0.1)\n",
    "2. **Overfitting to training patterns**: The model learned patterns specific to the training data that don't generalize\n",
    "3. **Distribution shift not addressed**: The 7.85% shift in Embarked was ignored\n",
    "4. **Feature concentration risk**: 65% of importance from gender/title features creates overfitting risk\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why CV-LB Gap Persists\n",
    "1. **Distribution shift in Embarked**: Test set has different port distribution\n",
    "2. **Overfitting to male patterns**: Title_Mr dominance suggests overfitting to training male passengers\n",
    "3. **No ensemble diversity**: Single model can't capture all patterns\n",
    "4. **Hyperparameter tuning can't fix structural issues**: Gap is not a hyperparameter problem\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Hasn't Been Tried\n",
    "1. **Ensemble methods** (highest priority): XGBoost + Logistic Regression blending\n",
    "2. **Distribution shift correction**: Stratified sampling, sample weights\n",
    "3. **Title refinement**: Split Mr into sub-categories or add interactions\n",
    "4. **Interaction features**: Pclass×Sex, Age×Sex\n",
    "5. **Advanced ensembles**: Stacking with multiple base models\n",
    "6. **Feature selection**: Reduce reliance on Title_Mr\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommended Next Steps\n",
    "1. **Implement ensemble immediately**: XGBoost + Logistic Regression weighted averaging\n",
    "2. **Address Embarked shift**: Use stratified sampling or add Embarked interactions\n",
    "3. **Refine Title features**: Reduce concentration risk\n",
    "4. **Add interaction features**: Capture non-linear relationships\n",
    "5. **Try stacking**: If simple ensemble helps, advance to stacking\n",
    "\n",
    "The key insight: **Stop hyperparameter tuning, start ensembling**. The gap is a generalization problem, not a hyperparameter problem."
