      "strategy": "# Titanic Survival Prediction - Techniques Guide\n\n## Data Understanding\n**Reference notebooks for data characteristics:**\n- `exploration/eda.ipynb` - Contains EDA: feature distributions, missing values, target distribution\n- Key findings: 891 train samples, 418 test samples, binary classification (Survived 0/1)\n- Target imbalanced: 61.6% died, 38.4% survived\n- Missing values: Age (20%), Cabin (77%), Embarked (2 samples)\n\n## Feature Engineering (Critical for High Accuracy)\n\n### Title Extraction from Name (MOST IMPORTANT)\nExtract titles from passenger names using regex pattern ` ([A-Za-z]+)\\.`:\n- Common titles: Mr, Mrs, Miss, Master\n- Rare titles (group together): Lady, Countess, Capt, Col, Don, Dr, Major, Rev, Sir, Jonkheer, Dona\n- Map: Mlle \u2192 Miss, Ms \u2192 Miss, Mme \u2192 Mrs\n- Title is highly predictive: Master (children) and Miss/Mrs (women) have higher survival\n\n### Family Features\n- **FamilySize** = SibSp + Parch + 1\n- **IsAlone** = 1 if FamilySize == 1, else 0\n- Family size categories: Single (1), Small (2-4), Large (5+) have different survival rates\n- Medium-sized families had better survival (could help each other but not too many to manage)\n\n### Cabin Features (Advanced)\n- **Has_Cabin** = 1 if Cabin is not null, else 0 (indicates higher class passengers)\n- **Deck** = First character of Cabin (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, T), fill missing with \"U\" (Unknown)\n- Deck survival rates vary: B (74%), D/E (~75%), U (30%)\n- **Cabin_Number** = Numeric part of cabin, can be binned (0-50: 45%, 51-100: 60%)\n\n### Age Handling (Advanced)\n- **Best approach**: Use XGBoost to predict missing Age values based on other features\n- **Alternative**: Fill missing Age using median by Pclass and Sex groups\n- **Simple**: Use random values within (mean - std, mean + std)\n- Create **AgeBand** with 5 bins: 0-16, 16-32, 32-48, 48-64, 64+\n- Children (Age <= 16) had higher survival priority\n\n### Fare Handling\n- Fill missing Fare with median (or median by Pclass and Embarked)\n- Create **FareBand** with 4 quantile bins\n- Higher fare correlates with higher class and better survival\n\n### Additional Features\n- **Name_length** = len(Name) - longer names may indicate nobility/higher status\n- **Ticket_Prefix** = Extract prefix from Ticket (letters before numbers)\n- **Ticket_Len** = Length of ticket number\n\n## Models to Use\n\n### Ensemble Methods (Best Performance - 81-84% accuracy)\nBased on top solutions and research:\n\n1. **Stacking (Recommended - achieves ~0.808-0.84)**\n   - First level: RandomForest, ExtraTrees, AdaBoost, GradientBoosting, SVC\n   - Second level: XGBoost as meta-learner\n   - Use out-of-fold predictions to avoid leakage\n   - Key: Use uncorrelated base models for better ensemble\n\n2. **Soft Voting Classifier (achieves ~0.81)**\n   - Average predicted probabilities from multiple classifiers\n   - Combine: LogisticRegression, SVC, RandomForest, GradientBoosting, XGBoost\n   - Better than hard voting for this problem\n\n3. **Gradient Boosting Models**\n   - XGBoost: n_estimators=2000, max_depth=4, min_child_weight=2, gamma=0.9, subsample=0.8\n   - LightGBM: Fast training, good for small datasets\n   - CatBoost: Handles categorical features natively\n\n### Individual Models (Baseline ~0.77-0.80)\n- RandomForestClassifier: n_estimators=100, good baseline\n- GradientBoostingClassifier: Often best single model\n- SVC: Works well with proper scaling\n- LogisticRegression: Good interpretability\n\n## Preprocessing\n\n### Feature Encoding\n- Sex: female=0, male=1 (or vice versa)\n- Embarked: S=0, C=1, Q=2 (or one-hot encoding)\n- Title: Numerical mapping (Mr=1, Miss=2, Mrs=3, Master=4, Rare=5)\n- Deck: Numerical mapping or one-hot encoding\n\n### Features to Drop\n- PassengerId (identifier only)\n- Name (after extracting Title and Name_length)\n- Ticket (after extracting prefix if used)\n- Cabin (after extracting Has_Cabin, Deck, Cabin_Number)\n\n### Final Feature Set (Recommended)\n- Pclass, Sex, Age (binned), Fare (binned), Embarked\n- Title, FamilySize, IsAlone, Has_Cabin, Deck\n\n## Validation Strategy\n\n### Cross-Validation\n- Use StratifiedKFold with k=5 or k=10 (10-fold recommended for small dataset)\n- Stratification important due to class imbalance\n- CV score may differ from LB score due to train/test distribution differences\n\n### Hyperparameter Tuning\n- **Bayesian Optimization** (recommended) - more efficient than grid search\n- GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV as alternatives\n- Focus on: n_estimators, max_depth, learning_rate, min_samples_split\n\n### Feature Selection\n- Use SelectFromModel with RandomForest or XGBoost\n- Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) with cross-validation\n- Feature importance analysis to identify key predictors\n\n## Key Insights from Top Solutions\n\n1. **Feature engineering matters more than model selection** for this dataset\n2. **Simple models with good features** can match complex ensembles\n3. **Title extraction** is one of the most important engineered features\n4. **Family size** features capture important survival dynamics\n5. **Stacking with diverse base models** achieves best results (~0.808-0.84 LB)\n6. **Soft voting classifier** with tuned models achieves ~0.81 LB\n7. **XGBoost for Age imputation** improves predictions vs simple median\n\n## Realistic Expectations\n\n- **Top public LB scores**: 0.81-0.84 (81-84% accuracy)\n- **Target score of 1.0 (100%)** is extremely challenging\n- Best approach: Comprehensive feature engineering + ensemble methods\n- Focus on maximizing accuracy through:\n  1. All feature engineering techniques mentioned\n  2. Multiple diverse models in ensemble\n  3. Careful hyperparameter tuning with Bayesian optimization\n  4. Multiple random seeds and averaging predictions\n\n## Implementation Priority\n\n1. **First**: Implement all feature engineering (Title, FamilySize, IsAlone, Has_Cabin, Deck, Age/Fare bins)\n2. **Second**: Train multiple diverse models (RF, XGB, LGB, CatBoost, SVC, LogReg)\n3. **Third**: Create stacking ensemble with XGBoost meta-learner\n4. **Fourth**: Tune hyperparameters with Bayesian optimization or GridSearchCV\n5. **Fifth**: Try soft voting ensemble as alternative\n6. **Sixth**: Experiment with different random seeds and average predictions\n",
