The most widely\u2011used tricks\u2014validated by recent Kaggle notebooks such as the 2025 Random\u2011Forest repo\u2014include:  \n\n* **Missing\u2011value handling** \u2013 fill missing\u202fAge\u202fwith the median age of passengers sharing the same\u202fTitle\u202for\u202fPclass\u202fand impute missing\u202fEmbarked\u202fwith the mode; replace missing\u202fFare\u202fwith the median of the corresponding\u202fPclass\u202fand\u202fEmbarked\u202fgroup.  \n* **Categorical encoding** \u2013 convert\u202fSex,\u202fEmbarked,\u202fPclass\u202fto numeric codes or one\u2011hot vectors; extract the **Title** (Mr,\u202fMrs,\u202fMiss,\u202fMaster,\u202fRare) from the\u202fName\u202ffield and encode it as a categorical feature.  \n* **Family\u2011based features** \u2013 compute **FamilySize**\u202f=\u202fSibSp\u202f+\u202fParch\u202f+\u202f1, create a binary **IsAlone** flag (FamilySize\u202f==\u202f1), and optionally a **FamilyID** that groups passengers with the same surname ",
