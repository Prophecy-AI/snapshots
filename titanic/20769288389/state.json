The most widely\u2011used tricks\u2014validated by recent Kaggle notebooks such as the 2025 Random\u2011Forest repo\u2014include:  \n\n* **Missing\u2011value handling** \u2013 fill missing\u202fAge\u202fwith the median age of passengers sharing the same\u202fTitle\u202for\u202fPclass\u202fand impute missing\u202fEmbarked\u202fwith the mode; replace missing\u202fFare\u202fwith the median of the corresponding\u202fPclass\u202fand\u202fEmbarked\u202fgroup.  \n* **Categorical encoding** \u2013 convert\u202fSex,\u202fEmbarked,\u202fPclass\u202fto numeric codes or one\u2011hot vectors; extract the **Title** (Mr,\u202fMrs,\u202fMiss,\u202fMaster,\u202fRare) from the\u202fName\u202ffield and encode it as a categorical feature.  \n* **Family\u2011based features** \u2013 compute **FamilySize**\u202f=\u202fSibSp\u202f+\u202fParch\u202f+\u202f1, create a binary **IsAlone** flag (FamilySize\u202f==\u202f1), and optionally a **FamilyID** that groups passengers with the same surname ",

      "query": "What are the best machine learning models and ensembling strategies for Titanic survival prediction to achieve high accuracy?",
      "finding": "Titanic survival is a classic binary\u2011classification task that rewards careful feature engineering, robust hyper\u2011parameter tuning, and the use of powerful learners such as gradient\u2011boosted trees.  In recent Kaggle\u2011style notebooks the single best performing model is an XGBoost classifier that, after extensive tuning, reaches roughly\u202f93\u202f% accuracy on the held\u2011out test set\u202f([github.com](https://github.com/mrankitgupta/titanic-survival-prediction-93-xgboost)).  Comparable results are obtained with Random\u202fForest and Support\u202fVector\u202fMachines when they are tuned and combined with engineered variables (e.g., family size, title extraction, age imputation)\u202f([medium.com](https://amyrmahdy.medium.com/titanic-survival-prediction-comparing-5-machine-learning-models-d1d451a9e558)).  Logistic regression remains a strong baseline when limited to a small, well\u2011chosen subset of features (Pclass, Sex, Age, SibSp, etc.) and can be boosted with gradient\u2011boosting (GBM) to improve stability\u202f([rstudio\u2011pubs\u2011stati",
