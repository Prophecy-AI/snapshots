Despite strong EDA, these process gaps justify triggering RL and yield a consensus score around 0.85."

I resolve this by following the majority and the more forward-looking critique: the agent met baseline expectations well, but there is clear headroom in execution granularity and optimization to reach stronger, more consistent leaderboard-level performance—warranting an RL update."
