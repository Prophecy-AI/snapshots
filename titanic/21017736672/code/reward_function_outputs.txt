  ],
  "overall_failure_reason": "There is disagreement among jurors: one rated the performance as complete (1.0, no RL trigger), while two flagged issues warranting RL (0.8 and 0.75 with trigger). I resolve this by weighing the more specific failure evidence: a concrete tool misuse during directory reading and incomplete kernel/content synthesis (and missing/unfinished final deliverable per one juror). Despite strong EDA, these process gaps justify triggering RL and yield a consensus score around 0.85."
