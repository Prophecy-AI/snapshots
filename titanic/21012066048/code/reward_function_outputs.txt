  ],
  "overall_failure_reason": "The jury largely agrees the agent demonstrated strong strategic research behavior (reading competition materials and a high-performing kernel), but performance was meaningfully reduced by avoidable tool-usage mistakes—especially repeating an invalid notebook execution range—and by producing EDA that was somewhat superficial and did not fully leverage the feature-engineering insights discovered. There was minor disagreement on how weak the EDA was; I resolved it by crediting the correct direction while penalizing the lack of depth and integration."
