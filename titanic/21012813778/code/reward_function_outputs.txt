The jury also notes the primary deliverable (a fully formed seed_prompt.txt) was not produced in this segment. Minor disagreements (mainly around call 7–8 scoring) were resolved by averaging and weighting toward the shared critique: correct progress, inefficient extraction."

  "overall_failure_reason": "Across jurors, there is strong agreement the baseline modeling work was competent and successfully executed, but a notable workflow flaw occurred during experiment logging due to an uncreated/incorrect directory path. One juror (Claude) scored lower (0.75) due to additional critique that the approach was not pushed toward medal-level performance (missing advanced Titanic features, tuning, ensembles). Others emphasized the issue as minor operational friction (0.8–0.9). I resolved this disagreement by taking a weighted middle ground: crediting the strong baseline while penalizing the reproducibility/logging error and the lack of optimization beyond baseline, resulting in a moderate-high score and triggering RL to improve path validation and experiment organization (and, secondarily, iterative optimization practices)."
