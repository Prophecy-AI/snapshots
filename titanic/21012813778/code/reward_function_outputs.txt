  "overall_failure_reason": "Across jurors there is broad agreement (scores clustered at 0.6–0.7) that the agent’s research direction is reasonable (competition brief + top kernels), but execution is hindered by avoidable path/filename assumptions and suboptimal notebook parsing (head/grep on minified JSON). The jury also notes the primary deliverable (a fully formed seed_prompt.txt) was not produced in this segment. Minor disagreements (mainly around call 7–8 scoring) were resolved by averaging and weighting toward the shared critique: correct progress, inefficient extraction."
