      "strategy": "# Titanic Survival Prediction - Techniques Guide\n\n## Data Understanding\n**Reference notebooks for data characteristics:**\n- `exploration/eda.ipynb` - Contains full EDA: feature distributions, missing values, target distribution, survival rates by features\n\n## Problem Overview\n- Binary classification task: predict survival (0/1)\n- Evaluation metric: Accuracy\n- Small dataset: 891 training samples, 418 test samples\n- Target distribution: ~38% survived, ~62% did not survive\n- Target score: 1.0 (100% accuracy) - extremely challenging, typical best scores are 80-82%\n\n## Critical Feature Engineering (from top Kaggle kernels)\n\n### 1. Title Extraction from Name (MOST IMPORTANT)\nExtract titles from passenger names using regex pattern ` ([A-Za-z]+)\\.`:\n- Common titles: Mr (15.7% survival), Miss (69.8%), Mrs (79.2%), Master (57.5%)\n- Group rare titles (Lady, Countess, Capt, Col, Don, Dr, Major, Rev, Sir, Jonkheer, Dona) into 'Rare'\n- Map Mlle/Ms \u2192 Miss, Mme \u2192 Mrs\n- Title is highly predictive of survival (Master = young boys, Miss = unmarried women)\n\n### 2. Family Features\n- **FamilySize** = SibSp + Parch + 1\n- **IsAlone** = 1 if FamilySize == 1, else 0\n- **FamilySize_Category**: Small (2-4) has best survival (55-72%), Alone (30%), Large (5+) poor (0-33%)\n- Non-linear relationship - consider binning: Alone, Small, Large\n\n### 3. Cabin Features\n- **Has_Cabin** = 1 if Cabin is not null, else 0 (indicates higher class)\n- **Deck** = first character of Cabin (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, T)\n- Deck can indicate location on ship and proximity to lifeboats\n\n### 4. Ticket Features\n- **Ticket_Prefix** = extract alphabetic prefix from ticket\n- **Ticket_Frequency** = count of passengers with same ticket (family/group travel)\n- Shared tickets may indicate family groups\n\n### 5. Age and Fare Binning\n- Bin Age into categories: Child (0-16), Young (16-32), Middle (32-48), Senior (48-64), Elder (64+)\n- Bin Fare into quartiles or categories based on thresholds (7.91, 14.454, 31)\n- Children have higher survival rates\n\n### 6. Interaction Features\n- **Sex_Pclass** = Sex + '_' + str(Pclass) - captures class-gender interaction\n- **Age_Class** = Age_bin + Pclass interaction\n- Female in 1st/2nd class have very high survival\n\n## Missing Value Handling\n\n### Age (20% missing in train, 20% in test)\n- **Best approach**: Fill with median by Title (Master \u2192 young, Mr \u2192 adult male, etc.)\n- Alternative: Fill with median by Pclass and Sex\n- Alternative: Random values within mean \u00b1 std\n\n### Cabin (77% missing)\n- Create Has_Cabin binary feature\n- Can impute deck based on Pclass (1st class \u2192 upper decks)\n\n### Embarked (2 missing in train)\n- Fill with mode ('S' - Southampton)\n\n### Fare (1 missing in test)\n- Fill with median by Pclass\n\n## Models to Use\n\n### Single Models (baseline ~78% accuracy)\n1. **Random Forest** - Most robust, handles feature interactions well\n   - n_estimators: 100-500\n   - max_depth: 4-8 (prevent overfitting on small dataset)\n   - min_samples_split: 2-10\n   \n2. **Gradient Boosting** - Strong performance\n   - learning_rate: 0.01-0.1\n   - n_estimators: 100-300\n   - max_depth: 2-4\n\n3. **XGBoost** - Often best single model\n   - learning_rate: 0.01-0.05\n   - max_depth: 4-6\n   - n_estimators: 200-500\n   - reg_alpha, reg_lambda for regularization\n\n4. **LightGBM** - Fast and effective\n   - num_leaves: 20-50\n   - learning_rate: 0.01-0.1\n   - n_estimators: 100-500\n\n5. **CatBoost** - Handles categorical features natively\n   - Good for this dataset with many categorical features\n\n6. **SVM** - Works well with proper scaling\n   - Use RBF kernel\n   - Tune C and gamma\n   - Requires feature scaling\n\n7. **Logistic Regression** - Good baseline, interpretable\n   - Use regularization (C parameter)\n\n### Ensemble Methods (can achieve ~80-82% accuracy)\n\n#### Voting Classifier\n- Combine 5-7 diverse models\n- Hard voting often outperforms soft voting for this dataset\n- Use: RF, ExtraTrees, AdaBoost, GradientBoosting, SVC\n\n#### Stacking (achieved 80.8% in top kernels)\n**Two-level stacking:**\n- Level 1 (base models): RandomForest, ExtraTrees, AdaBoost, GradientBoosting, SVC\n- Level 2 (meta-learner): XGBoost or Logistic Regression\n- Use out-of-fold predictions to prevent leakage\n- Uncorrelated base models produce better results\n\n#### Blending\n- Simple average or weighted average of predictions\n- Weight based on CV performance\n\n## Feature Selection\n**Drop these columns before modeling:**\n- PassengerId (identifier)\n- Name (after extracting Title)\n- Ticket (after extracting features)\n- Cabin (after extracting Has_Cabin/Deck)\n\n**Keep/Create:**\n- Pclass, Sex, Age (binned), SibSp, Parch, Fare (binned), Embarked\n- Title, FamilySize, IsAlone, Has_Cabin\n- Interaction features\n\n## Validation Strategy\n- Use Stratified K-Fold (k=5 or k=10) to maintain class distribution\n- Small dataset means high variance in CV scores\n- Focus on robust features rather than complex models\n- Consider repeated K-fold for more stable estimates\n\n## Key Insights from Top Solutions\n1. **Feature engineering is more important than model selection** for this dataset\n2. Simple models with good features often beat complex models\n3. Title extraction is one of the most powerful features\n4. Family size features capture important survival patterns\n5. Avoid overfitting - use regularization and limit tree depth\n6. The train/test distributions may differ slightly, causing CV-LB gap\n7. Women and children first - Sex and Age are critical features\n8. Class matters - 1st class passengers had priority for lifeboats\n\n## Hyperparameter Tuning\n- Use GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV\n- Tune on cross-validation, not single train/test split\n- Key parameters to tune:\n  - Tree models: max_depth, n_estimators, min_samples_split\n  - Boosting: learning_rate, n_estimators, max_depth\n  - SVM: C, gamma, kernel\n\n## Submission Strategy\n1. Start with baseline Random Forest (~78%)\n2. Add feature engineering (Title, FamilySize, IsAlone) \u2192 ~80%\n3. Try ensemble/stacking \u2192 ~80-82%\n4. Tune hyperparameters carefully\n5. Consider multiple submissions with different random seeds\n6. Ensemble multiple models for final submission\n\n## Advanced Techniques\n\n### Feature Importance Analysis\n- Use permutation importance or SHAP values\n- Remove low-importance features to reduce overfitting\n\n### Pseudo-labeling (if allowed)\n- Use high-confidence predictions on test set as additional training data\n\n### Cross-validation Averaging\n- Train multiple models with different random seeds\n- Average predictions for more stable results\n\n## Code Patterns\n\n### Feature Engineering Pipeline\n```python\ndef engineer_features(df):\n    # Title extraction\n    df['Title'] = df['Name'].str.extract(' ([A-Za-z]+)\\.', expand=False)\n    df['Title'] = df['Title'].replace(['Lady', 'Countess','Capt', 'Col','Don', 'Dr', 'Major', 'Rev', 'Sir', 'Jonkheer', 'Dona'], 'Rare')\n    df['Title'] = df['Title'].replace(['Mlle', 'Ms'], 'Miss')\n    df['Title'] = df['Title'].replace('Mme', 'Mrs')\n    \n    # Family features\n    df['FamilySize'] = df['SibSp'] + df['Parch'] + 1\n    df['IsAlone'] = (df['FamilySize'] == 1).astype(int)\n    \n    # Cabin\n    df['Has_Cabin'] = df['Cabin'].notna().astype(int)\n    \n    # Age imputation by Title\n    title_age_median = df.groupby('Title')['Age'].median()\n    df['Age'] = df.apply(lambda x: title_age_median[x['Title']] if pd.isna(x['Age']) else x['Age'], axis=1)\n    \n    return df\n```\n\n### Stacking Implementation\nUse sklearn's StackingClassifier or implement custom out-of-fold stacking:\n- Split data into K folds\n- For each fold, train base models on K-1 folds, predict on held-out fold\n- Concatenate predictions as features for meta-learner\n",

Agreed - the leakage is minor but should be fixed.\n- Evaluator's top priority: Submit to get LB feedback. **DONE** - we now have LB score of 77.99%.\n- Key concerns raised:\n  1. Target of 1.0 is unrealistic \u2192 **ACKNOWLEDGED** - focusing on incremental improvements toward 80%+\n  2. Minor data leakage in Age imputation \u2192 **WILL FIX** in next experiment\n  3. Features not yet explored \u2192 **PRIORITIZING** in next experiments\n- Evaluator recommended stacking/ensemble after submission \u2192 **AGREE** - this is next priority\n\n## Critical Finding: Distribution Shift\n**Adversarial Validation AUC: 0.7025** - indicates SIGNIFICANT distribution shift between train and test.\n\nFeatures that distinguish train from test (by importance):\n1. **Age: 56.9%** - Primary source of shift! Train/test have different Age distributions\n2. Fare: 14.3%\n3. Embarked: 6.8%\n4. FamilySize: 4.8%\n\n**Implications:**\n- Our model may be overfitting to Age patterns in training data that don't generalize\n- The minor data leakage (using combined train+test for Age imputation) may have helped CV but hurt generalization\n- Need to reduce reliance on Age or use more robust features\n\n## Data Understanding\n**Reference notebooks:**\n- `exploration/eda.ipynb` - Full EDA with survival rates by features\n- `exploration/evolver_loop1_lb_feedback.ipynb` - Distribution shift analysis\n\n**Key patterns to exploit:**\n1. Sex is most predictive (30% importance) - Female 74.2% vs Male 18.9% survival\n2. Title extraction is highly valuable (19.3% importance) - Mrs 79.2%, Mr 15.7%\n3. Pclass matters - 1st: 63%, 2nd: 47%, 3rd: 24% survival\n4. FamilySize has non-linear relationship - medium families (2-4) survive best\n\n## Recommended Approaches (Priority Order)\n\n### Priority 1: Fix Data Leakage & Reduce Age Dependence\n**Why:** Age is causing distribution shift. Fix leakage and reduce model's reliance on Age.\n```python\n# Compute Age imputation from TRAINING data only\ntitle_age_median = train_df.groupby('Title')['Age'].median()\n# Apply to both train and test\n```\n- Consider binning Age into broad categories (Child/Adult/Senior) to reduce sensitivity\n- Or use Age only for creating robust features (e.g., IsChild = Age < 16)\n\n### Priority 2: Implement Stacking/Ensemble\n**Why:** Research shows stacking achieved 80.8% LB (top 9%). Our single RF got 78%.\n**Approach:**\n- Level 1 base models: RandomForest, ExtraTrees, GradientBoosting, SVC, AdaBoost\n- Level 2 meta-learner: XGBoost or LogisticRegression\n- Use out-of-fold predictions to prevent leakage\n- Ensure base models are diverse (different algorithms, not just different hyperparameters)\n\n### Priority 3: Add More Features\n**Why:** Several promising features from strategy haven't been tried yet.\nFeatures to add:\n1. **Ticket_Frequency** - count of passengers with same ticket (family/group travel)\n2. **Deck** - extract from Cabin first character (indicates location on ship)\n3. **Age_Bin** - broad categories: Child (0-16), Adult (16-50), Senior (50+)\n4. **Fare_Bin** - quartile-based binning\n5. **Sex_Pclass** - interaction feature (Female_1, Female_2, etc.)\n6. **Name_Length** - mentioned in stacking kernel as useful\n\n### Priority 4: Try Different Models\n**Why:** Model diversity is important for ensembling.\nModels to try:\n1. XGBoost - often best single model for tabular data\n2. LightGBM - fast and effective\n3. GradientBoosting - strong baseline\n4. SVC with RBF kernel - works well with proper scaling\n\n## What NOT to Try\n- Chasing 100% accuracy - impossible for Titanic\n- Complex neural networks - dataset too small (891 samples)\n- Hyperparameter tuning before fixing distribution shift issue\n- Adding more Age-related features without addressing shift\n\n## Validation Notes\n- Use Stratified 5-Fold CV (already doing this)\n- **IMPORTANT:** CV score of 83.4% is likely inflated due to distribution shift\n- Expect LB scores to be 3-5% lower than CV\n- Focus on LB improvement, not CV inflation\n- Consider using adversarial validation to identify and down-weight drifting features\n\n## Submission Strategy\n- Current LB: 77.99% (4 submissions remaining)\n- Target: 80%+ (realistic goal for Titanic)\n- Submit when CV improves by >0.5% AND approach is fundamentally different\n- Save submissions for ensemble/stacking experiments\n\n## Code Patterns\n\n### Proper Age Imputation (no leakage)\n```python\n# Compute from training data only\ntitle_age_median = train_df.groupby('Title')['Age'].median()\n\n# Apply to train\nfor title in train_df['Title'].unique():\n    mask = (train_df['Title'] == title) & (train_df['Age'].isna())\n    train_df.loc[mask, 'Age'] = title_age_median.get(title, train_df['Age'].median())\n\n# Apply same values to test\nfor title in test_df['Title'].unique():\n    mask = (test_df['Title'] == title) & (test_df['Age'].isna())\n    test_df.loc[mask, 'Age'] = title_age_median.get(title, train_df['Age'].median())\n```\n\n### Simple Stacking Implementation\n```python\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import StackingClassifier\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\n\nbase_models = [\n    ('rf', RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, max_depth=6, random_state=42)),\n    ('et', ExtraTreesClassifier(n_estimators=100, max_depth=6, random_state=42)),\n    ('gb', GradientBoostingClassifier(n_estimators=100, max_depth=3, random_state=42)),\n    ('svc', SVC(kernel='rbf', probability=True, random_state=42))\n]\n\nstacking_clf = StackingClassifier(\n    estimators=base_models,\n    final_estimator=LogisticRegression(),\n    cv=5\n)\n```\n\n## Next Experiment Recommendation\n**Experiment 002: Stacking Ensemble with Fixed Data Leakage**\n1. Fix Age imputation to use training data only\n2. Add Ticket_Frequency and Sex_Pclass features\n3. Implement stacking with diverse base models\n4. Target: CV ~82%, LB ~79-80%",

    {
      "feedback": "## What I Understood\n\nThe junior researcher implemented a baseline Random Forest model with solid feature engineering following the established strategy. They extracted Title from Name (the most predictive feature according to research), created FamilySize and IsAlone features, and added Has_Cabin. They used Stratified 5-Fold CV and achieved 83.4% CV accuracy with reasonable variance (std=0.0093). This is a strong first experiment that establishes a baseline above the expected ~78%.\n\n## Technical Execution Assessment\n\n**Validation**: Sound. Stratified 5-Fold CV is appropriate for this binary classification with imbalanced classes (~38% positive). The variance across folds (0.82-0.84) is reasonable and doesn't suggest obvious leakage.\n\n**Leakage Risk**: POTENTIAL CONCERN - In `fill_missing_values()`, the code combines train and test data to compute `title_age_median`:\n```python\ncombined = pd.concat([train_df, test_df], sort=False)\ntitle_age_median = combined.groupby('Title')['Age'].median()\n```\nThis means test set Age values influence the imputation of training set Age values. While this is a minor form of leakage (Age is not the target), it's technically impure. The impact is likely small since Age is only ~8% of feature importance, but it's worth noting for best practices.\n\nSimilarly, in `prepare_features()`, LabelEncoders are fit on combined train+test data. This is acceptable practice for categorical encoding (ensures consistent encoding) but worth being aware of.\n\n**Score Integrity**: VERIFIED. The CV scores are clearly printed in the notebook output:\n- CV Scores: [0.84357542, 0.82022472, 0.8258427, 0.83707865, 0.84269663]\n- Mean: 0.83388 (+/- 0.00931)\nThe submission file has correct format (419 lines including header, 418 predictions).\n\n**Code Quality**: Good. Random seed is set (42), code is well-organized with clear functions, no silent failures observed. The notebook executed cleanly.\n\nVerdict: **TRUSTWORTHY** (with minor leakage caveat that likely doesn't materially affect results)\n\n## Strategic Assessment\n\n**Approach Fit**: GOOD. The approach follows the established strategy well. Title extraction, family features, and Has_Cabin are exactly what the research suggested. Random Forest is a sensible baseline for tabular data.\n\n**Effort Allocation**: APPROPRIATE for a first experiment. Building a solid baseline with good feature engineering before trying complex models is the right order of operations.\n\n**Assumptions Being Made**:\n1. That 83.4% CV will translate to similar test accuracy (reasonable assumption)\n2. That the current feature set captures the main signal (partially validated by feature importance)\n3. That Random Forest hyperparameters are reasonable (max_depth=6 is conservative, which is good for small data)\n\n**Blind Spots / What's Missing**:\n1. **The target score is 1.0 (100% accuracy)** - This is essentially impossible for Titanic. Typical best scores are 80-82% on the leaderboard. The researcher achieved 83.4% CV which is excellent, but the target of 1.0 is unrealistic. This needs to be acknowledged.\n\n2. **No actual Kaggle submission yet** - The candidate file exists but hasn't been submitted. With 5 remaining submissions today, it would be valuable to get actual leaderboard feedback.\n\n3. **Features not yet explored**:\n   - Ticket features (prefix, frequency) mentioned in strategy\n   - Deck extraction from Cabin\n   - Age/Fare binning\n   - Sex_Pclass interaction features\n   - Name length (mentioned in stacking kernel)\n\n4. **Model diversity not explored** - Strategy mentions XGBoost, LightGBM, stacking often achieve 80-82%. Worth trying.\n\n**Trajectory**: PROMISING. The baseline is strong (83.4% vs expected 78%). The feature engineering is solid. The next steps should focus on:\n1. Getting actual leaderboard feedback\n2. Trying ensemble/stacking approaches (research shows 80.8% achievable)\n3. Adding more features\n\n## What's Working\n\n1. **Feature engineering approach is correct** - Title extraction is indeed the most important engineered feature (19.3% importance), validating the strategy\n2. **Validation methodology is sound** - Stratified K-Fold with reasonable variance\n3. **Code organization is clean** - Separate functions for feature engineering, missing value handling, and feature preparation\n4. **Hyperparameters are sensible** - max_depth=6 prevents overfitting on small dataset\n5. **Following the established strategy** - Not reinventing the wheel\n\n## Key Concerns\n\n1. **Observation**: The target score of 1.0 (100% accuracy) is unrealistic for Titanic\n   **Why it matters**: This could lead to frustration or wasted effort chasing an impossible goal. Typical best scores are 80-82%.\n   **Suggestion**: Acknowledge this reality. Focus on achieving competitive scores (80%+) rather than perfect accuracy. The current 83.4% CV is already excellent.\n\n2. **Observation**: No Kaggle submission has been made yet\n   **Why it matters**: CV score may not perfectly correlate with leaderboard score. Real feedback is valuable.\n   **Suggestion**: Submit the current candidate to get actual leaderboard feedback before iterating further.\n\n3. **Observation**: Minor data leakage in Age imputation (using combined train+test)\n   **Why it matters**: While impact is likely small, it's technically impure and could slightly inflate CV scores.\n   **Suggestion**: For future experiments, compute imputation statistics from training data only, then apply to test.\n\n4. **Observation**: Several promising features from the strategy haven't been tried yet\n   **Why it matters**: Additional features could improve performance\n   **Suggestion**: Consider adding: Ticket frequency, Deck from Cabin, Age/Fare bins, Sex_Pclass interaction\n\n## Top Priority for Next Experiment\n\n**Submit the current candidate to Kaggle to get real leaderboard feedback.** With 5 submissions remaining today and a strong 83.4% CV score, getting actual test set performance is the highest-value next step. This will:\n1. Validate whether CV correlates with leaderboard\n2. Establish a real baseline to improve upon\n3. Inform whether to focus on more features vs. model improvements\n\nAfter submission, the next priority should be implementing stacking/ensemble approaches (research shows 80.8% achievable with stacking) and adding the remaining features from the strategy (Ticket features, Deck, interaction features).\n",
