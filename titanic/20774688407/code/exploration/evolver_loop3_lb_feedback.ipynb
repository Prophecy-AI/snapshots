    "## Critical Finding: Removing Age WORSENED LB Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "**Submission Results:**\n",
    "- exp_000 (RF with Age): CV 0.8339 → LB 0.7799 (gap: 5.4%)\n",
    "- exp_001 (Stacking): CV 0.8271 → LB 0.7727 (gap: 5.4%)\n",
    "- exp_002 (RF no Age): CV 0.8361 → LB 0.7703 (gap: 6.6%) ← WORST LB!\n",
    "\n",
    "**The hypothesis was WRONG:**\n",
    "- We thought removing Age would narrow the CV-LB gap\n",
    "- Instead, LB dropped by 0.96% while CV improved by 0.22%\n",
    "- The gap WIDENED from 5.4% to 6.6%\n",
    "\n",
    "**What this tells us:**\n",
    "1. Age IS important for test set predictions, despite distribution shift\n",
    "2. The adversarial validation finding (Age = 56.9% shift) was misleading\n",
    "3. We need to use Age, but in a more robust way"
