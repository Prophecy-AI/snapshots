## What I Understood

The junior researcher followed my previous feedback well. They:
1. Fixed the data leakage issue by computing Age imputation statistics from training data only
2. Added new features (Name_Length, Ticket_Frequency, Sex_Pclass, Age_Bin, IsChild, FamilySize_Cat)
3. Implemented a stacking ensemble with 5 base models (RF, ExtraTrees, GradientBoosting, AdaBoost, SVC) and LogisticRegression meta-learner
4. Aimed to reduce reliance on Age (identified as primary source of distribution shift via adversarial validation)

The hypothesis was that fixing leakage + stacking + new features would improve LB performance despite potentially lower CV.

## Technical Execution Assessment

**Validation**: Sound. Stratified 5-Fold CV is appropriate. The variance across folds (0.809-0.844) is reasonable. The CV drop from 83.4% to 82.7% after fixing leakage is expected and actually a good sign - it suggests the previous CV was inflated.

**Leakage Risk**: FIXED. The `fill_missing_values_no_leakage()` function now correctly computes `title_age_median` from training data only:
```python
title_age_median = train_df.groupby('Title')['Age'].median()
```
This is the correct approach. Well done.

**Minor remaining concern**: In `add_new_features()`, Ticket_Frequency is computed from combined train+test:
```python
combined = pd.concat([train_df, test_df], sort=False)
ticket_counts = combined['Ticket'].value_counts()
```
This is technically impure but acceptable - it's not target-related and ensures consistent encoding. The impact is minimal.

**Score Integrity**: VERIFIED. CV scores clearly printed:
- CV Scores: [0.84357542, 0.8258427, 0.80898876, 0.83146067, 0.8258427]
- Mean: 0.82714 (+/- 0.01115)
- Individual models: SVC 0.8361 (best), GB 0.8305, ET 0.8294, RF 0.8294, AdaBoost 0.8215

**Code Quality**: Good. Seeds set, clean execution, proper scaling for SVC. The submission file has correct format (418 predictions, PassengerId 892-1309).

Verdict: **TRUSTWORTHY**

## Strategic Assessment

**Approach Fit**: MIXED. The stacking approach is reasonable for Titanic, but the results reveal an important insight: **stacking did NOT improve over the best individual model (SVC at 83.6% vs stacking at 82.7%)**. This is a common pattern when base models are too correlated or when the dataset is too small for the meta-learner to learn meaningful combinations.

**Effort Allocation**: APPROPRIATE. The researcher correctly prioritized:
1. Fixing data leakage (high priority)
2. Adding features recommended by strategy
3. Trying stacking (mentioned in research as achieving 80.8%)

However, the stacking underperformed. This is valuable learning.

**Key Insight from Results**:
- SVC alone: 83.6% CV
- Stacking: 82.7% CV
- This suggests the meta-learner is adding noise, not signal. The base models may be too correlated.

**Assumptions Being Validated**:
1. ✅ Fixing leakage would lower CV (confirmed: 83.4% → 82.7%)
2. ❌ Stacking would improve over individual models (NOT confirmed - SVC alone is better)
3. ❓ Lower CV with fixed leakage will generalize better to LB (untested - no submission yet)

**Blind Spots / What's Missing**:

1. **No submission of this experiment yet** - We have 4 remaining submissions today. The key question is whether the fixed-leakage model generalizes better despite lower CV. This MUST be tested.

2. **SVC alone might be the better choice** - The individual SVC achieved 83.6% CV, higher than stacking. Consider submitting SVC predictions instead of stacking.

3. **Age_Bin vs raw Age tradeoff** - The researcher used Age_Bin to reduce sensitivity to Age distribution shift. But they also kept raw Age in the feature set. This might be redundant or counterproductive. Consider:
   - Using ONLY Age_Bin (no raw Age) to fully address distribution shift
   - Or using raw Age with more robust binning

4. **Features not yet explored**:
   - Deck extraction from Cabin (mentioned in strategy)
   - Fare binning (similar to Age binning for distribution shift)
   - More sophisticated ticket features (prefix extraction)

5. **The target of 1.0 is still impossible** - Typical best LB scores are 80-82%. Current best LB is 77.99%. Focus should be on incremental improvements.

**Trajectory**: LEARNING. The experiment revealed that stacking doesn't help here. This is valuable information. The next step should be:
1. Submit to validate if fixed-leakage model generalizes better
2. Consider simpler models (SVC alone) over complex ensembles
3. Focus on feature engineering that addresses distribution shift

## What's Working

1. **Data leakage fix is correct** - Age imputation now uses training data only
2. **New features are sensible** - Ticket_Frequency, Sex_Pclass, Age_Bin all make sense
3. **Adversarial validation analysis was excellent** - Identified Age as primary source of shift
4. **Individual model evaluation** - Comparing base models revealed SVC is strongest
5. **Reasonable hyperparameters** - Conservative tree depths, proper scaling for SVC

## Key Concerns

1. **Observation**: Stacking (82.7%) underperformed best individual model SVC (83.6%)
   **Why it matters**: Complex ensembles aren't always better. On small datasets, simpler models often generalize better.
   **Suggestion**: Consider submitting SVC alone instead of stacking. Or try a simpler voting ensemble.

2. **Observation**: No submission has been made for this experiment
   **Why it matters**: The key hypothesis (fixed leakage → better LB generalization) remains untested. With 4 submissions remaining, this is the most important next step.
   **Suggestion**: Submit candidate_001.csv immediately to get LB feedback. Also consider creating and submitting SVC-only predictions.

3. **Observation**: Both raw Age and Age_Bin are in the feature set
   **Why it matters**: This might be redundant. If Age is the primary source of distribution shift (56.9% in adversarial validation), using Age_Bin INSTEAD of raw Age might help more.
   **Suggestion**: Try an experiment with Age_Bin only (drop raw Age) to fully address the distribution shift issue.

4. **Observation**: The CV-LB gap was 5.4% in experiment 1 (83.4% CV → 78.0% LB)
   **Why it matters**: If the same gap applies, 82.7% CV would give ~77.3% LB - worse than before. But if fixing leakage reduces the gap, we might see improvement.
   **Suggestion**: This is exactly why we need to submit - to understand if fixing leakage actually helps LB performance.

## Top Priority for Next Experiment

**SUBMIT IMMEDIATELY to validate the hypothesis that fixed leakage improves LB generalization.**

With 4 submissions remaining today, the highest-value action is:
1. Submit candidate_001.csv (stacking with fixed leakage) to get LB score
2. Compare to previous LB of 77.99%

If LB improves despite lower CV, the leakage fix worked. If LB stays same or worsens, the distribution shift is the bigger problem.

**Secondary priority**: Given that SVC alone (83.6% CV) outperformed stacking (82.7% CV), consider creating a SVC-only submission. This simpler model might generalize better.

**Strategic note**: The target of 1.0 (100% accuracy) is impossible for Titanic. Typical best scores are 80-82%. Current best LB is 77.99%. Focus on incremental improvements (getting to 79-80%) rather than chasing perfection.
