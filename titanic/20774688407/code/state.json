Title Extraction from Name (MOST IMPORTANT)\nExtract titles from passenger names using regex pattern ` ([A-Za-z]+)\\.`:\n- Common titles: Mr (15.7% survival), Miss (69.8%), Mrs (79.2%), Master (57.5%)\n- Group rare titles (Lady, Countess, Capt, Col, Don, Dr, Major, Rev, Sir, Jonkheer, Dona) into 'Rare'\n- Map Mlle/Ms \u2192 Miss, Mme \u2192 Mrs\n- Title is highly predictive of survival (Master = young boys, Miss = unmarried women)\n\n### 2. Family Features\n- **FamilySize** = SibSp + Parch + 1\n- **IsAlone** = 1 if FamilySize == 1, else 0\n- **FamilySize_Category**: Small (2-4) has best survival (55-72%), Alone (30%), Large (5+) poor (0-33%)\n- Non-linear relationship - consider binning: Alone, Small, Large\n\n### 3. Cabin Features\n- **Has_Cabin** = 1 if Cabin is not null, else 0 (indicates higher class)\n- **Deck** = first character of Cabin (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, T)\n- Deck can indicate location on ship and proximity to lifeboats\n\n### 4. Ticket Features\n- **Ticket_Prefix** = extract alphabetic prefix from ticket\n- **Ticket_Frequency** = count of passengers with same ticket (family/group travel)\n- Shared tickets may indicate family groups\n\n### 5. Age and Fare Binning\n- Bin Age into categories: Child (0-16), Young (16-32), Middle (32-48), Senior (48-64), Elder (64+)\n- Bin Fare into quartiles or categories based on thresholds (7.91, 14.454, 31)\n- Children have higher survival rates\n\n### 6. Interaction Features\n- **Sex_Pclass** = Sex + '_' + str(Pclass) - captures class-gender interaction\n- **Age_Class** = Age_bin + Pclass interaction\n- Female in 1st/2nd class have very high survival\n\n## Missing Value Handling\n\n### Age (20% missing in train, 20% in test)\n- **Best approach**: Fill with median by Title (Master \u2192 young, Mr \u2192 adult male, etc.)\n- Alternative: Fill with median by Pclass and Sex\n- Alternative: Random values within mean \u00b1 std\n\n### Cabin (77% missing)\n- Create Has_Cabin binary feature\n- Can impute deck based on Pclass (1st class \u2192 upper decks)\n\n### Embarked (2 missing in train)\n- Fill with mode ('S' - Southampton)\n\n### Fare (1 missing in test)\n- Fill with median by Pclass\n\n## Models to Use\n\n### Single Models (baseline ~78% accuracy)\n1. **Random Forest** - Most robust, handles feature interactions well\n   - n_estimators: 100-500\n   - max_depth: 4-8 (prevent overfitting on small dataset)\n   - min_samples_split: 2-10\n   \n2. **Gradient Boosting** - Strong performance\n   - learning_rate: 0.01-0.1\n   - n_estimators: 100-300\n   - max_depth: 2-4\n\n3. **XGBoost** - Often best single model\n   - learning_rate: 0.01-0.05\n   - max_depth: 4-6\n   - n_estimators: 200-500\n   - reg_alpha, reg_lambda for regularization\n\n4. **LightGBM** - Fast and effective\n   - num_leaves: 20-50\n   - learning_rate: 0.01-0.1\n   - n_estimators: 100-500\n\n5. **CatBoost** - Handles categorical features natively\n   - Good for this dataset with many categorical features\n\n6. **SVM** - Works well with proper scaling\n   - Use RBF kernel\n   - Tune C and gamma\n   - Requires feature scaling\n\n7. **Logistic Regression** - Good baseline, interpretable\n   - Use regularization (C parameter)\n\n### Ensemble Methods (can achieve ~80-82% accuracy)\n\n#### Voting Classifier\n- Combine 5-7 diverse models\n- Hard voting often outperforms soft voting for this dataset\n- Use: RF, ExtraTrees, AdaBoost, GradientBoosting, SVC\n\n#### Stacking (achieved 80.8% in top kernels)\n**Two-level stacking:**\n- Level 1 (base models): RandomForest, ExtraTrees, AdaBoost, GradientBoosting, SVC\n- Level 2 (meta-learner): XGBoost or Logistic Regression\n- Use out-of-fold predictions to prevent leakage\n- Uncorrelated base models produce better results\n\n#### Blending\n- Simple average or weighted average of predictions\n- Weight based on CV performance\n\n## Feature Selection\n**Drop these columns before modeling:**\n- PassengerId (identifier)\n- Name (after extracting Title)\n- Ticket (after extracting features)\n- Cabin (after extracting Has_Cabin/Deck)\n\n**Keep/Create:**\n- Pclass, Sex, Age (binned), SibSp, Parch, Fare (binned), Embarked\n- Title, FamilySize, IsAlone, Has_Cabin\n- Interaction features\n\n## Validation Strategy\n- Use Stratified K-Fold (k=5 or k=10) to maintain class distribution\n- Small dataset means high variance in CV scores\n- Focus on robust features rather than complex models\n- Consider repeated K-fold for more stable estimates\n\n## Key Insights from Top Solutions\n1. **Feature engineering is more important than model selection** for this dataset\n2. Simple models with good features often beat complex models\n3. Title extraction is one of the most powerful features\n4. Family size features capture important survival patterns\n5. Avoid overfitting - use regularization and limit tree depth\n6. The train/test distributions may differ slightly, causing CV-LB gap\n7. Women and children first - Sex and Age are critical features\n8. Class matters - 1st class passengers had priority for lifeboats\n\n## Hyperparameter Tuning\n- Use GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV\n- Tune on cross-validation, not single train/test split\n- Key parameters to tune:\n  - Tree models: max_depth, n_estimators, min_samples_split\n  - Boosting: learning_rate, n_estimators, max_depth\n  - SVM: C, gamma, kernel\n\n## Submission Strategy\n1. Start with baseline Random Forest (~78%)\n2. Add feature engineering (Title, FamilySize, IsAlone) \u2192 ~80%\n3. Try ensemble/stacking \u2192 ~80-82%\n4. Tune hyperparameters carefully\n5. Consider multiple submissions with different random seeds\n6. Ensemble multiple models for final submission\n\n## Advanced Techniques\n\n### Feature Importance Analysis\n- Use permutation importance or SHAP values\n- Remove low-importance features to reduce overfitting\n\n### Pseudo-labeling (if allowed)\n- Use high-confidence predictions on test set as additional training data\n\n### Cross-validation Averaging\n- Train multiple models with different random seeds\n- Average predictions for more stable results\n\n## Code Patterns\n\n### Feature Engineering Pipeline\n```python\ndef engineer_features(df):\n    # Title extraction\n    df['Title'] = df['Name'].str.extract(' ([A-Za-z]+)\\.', expand=False)\n    df['Title'] = df['Title'].replace(['Lady', 'Countess','Capt', 'Col','Don', 'Dr', 'Major', 'Rev', 'Sir', 'Jonkheer', 'Dona'], 'Rare')\n    df['Title'] = df['Title'].replace(['Mlle', 'Ms'], 'Miss')\n    df['Title'] = df['Title'].replace('Mme', 'Mrs')\n    \n    # Family features\n    df['FamilySize'] = df['SibSp'] + df['Parch'] + 1\n    df['IsAlone'] = (df['FamilySize'] == 1).astype(int)\n    \n    # Cabin\n    df['Has_Cabin'] = df['Cabin'].notna().astype(int)\n    \n    # Age imputation by Title\n    title_age_median = df.groupby('Title')['Age'].median()\n    df['Age'] = df.apply(lambda x: title_age_median[x['Title']] if pd.isna(x['Age']) else x['Age'], axis=1)\n    \n    return df\n```\n\n### Stacking Implementation\nUse sklearn's StackingClassifier or implement custom out-of-fold stacking:\n- Split data into K folds\n- For each fold, train base models on K-1 folds, predict on held-out fold\n- Concatenate predictions as features for meta-learner\n",
