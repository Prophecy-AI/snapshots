The competition provides a **train.csv** with known outcomes and a **test.csv** without labels; the only way to obtain 100\u202f% accuracy on the test set is to have access to those hidden labels.  Participants who download the test file after the competition ends, or who augment the training data with an external dataset that already contains the true survival values, can train a model that simply memorises the answers and then submit a flawless prediction file.  As one Reddit user observed, the only way to reach scores above ~0.85 is to \u201cdownload the test set with the info about who survived,\u201d implying illicit use of the answer key\u30102](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/lpyfwe/d_kaggle_titanic_challenge_maximum_legit)\u3011.  \n\nA related explanation appears in a Medium post that notes many top\u2011scorers \u201ctrain their model on an external datase",
