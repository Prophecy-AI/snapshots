  "overall_failure_reason": "There is explicit jury disagreement: one juror (Gemini) rated the agent as fully successful (1.0, no RL trigger), while two jurors (o3-mini-high and Claude Opus) flagged a substantive gap (scores 0.6–0.7, RL trigger) because the agent did not synthesize findings into the required comprehensive seed prompt/strategy, despite solid exploration and EDA. I resolve the disagreement by weighting the more detailed critiques and the task’s stated deliverable (synthesis/seed prompt) as decisive: exploration was generally good, but the missing synthesis is a meaningful failure, so RL should trigger and the final score is moderated accordingly."
