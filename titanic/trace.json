You’re in the right place. \\nThis is the legendary Titanic ML competition – the best, first challenge for you to dive into ML competitions and familiarize yourself with how the Kaggle platform works.\\n\\n**If you want to talk with other users about this competition, come join our Discord! We've got channels for competitions, job postings and career discussions, resources, and socializing with your fellow data scientists. Follow the link here:** https://discord.gg/kaggle\\n\\nThe competition is simple: use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.\\n\\nRead on or watch the video below to explore more details. Once you’re ready to start competing, click on the <a href=\\\"https://www.kaggle.com/account/login?returnUrl=%2Fc%2Ftitanic\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">\\\"Join Competition button</a> to create an account and gain access to the <a href=\\\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">competition data</a>. Then check out <a href=\\\"https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/titanic-tutorial\\\">Alexis Cook’s Titanic Tutorial</a> that walks you through step by step how to make your first submission!\\n\\n<iframe width=\\\"699\\\" height=\\\"368\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8yZMXCaFshs\\\" title=\\\"YouTube video | How to Get Started with Kaggle’s Titanic Competition | Kaggle\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allow=\\\"encrypted-media\\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n\\n## The Challenge\\nThe sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.\\n\\nOn April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.\\n\\nWhile there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.\\n\\nIn this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).\\n\\n> #### Recommended Tutorial\\n> We highly recommend [Alexis Cook’s Titanic Tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/titanic-tutorial) that walks you through making your very first submission step by step and [this starter notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/gusthema/titanic-competition-w-tensorflow-decision-forests) to get started.\\n\\n## How Kaggle’s Competitions Work\\n1. **Join the Competition**\\nRead about the challenge description, accept the Competition Rules and gain access to the competition dataset.\\n1.  **Get to Work**\\nDownload the data, build models on it locally or on Kaggle Notebooks (our no-setup, customizable Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs) and generate a prediction file.\\n1.  **Make a Submission**\\nUpload your prediction as a submission on Kaggle and receive an accuracy score.\\n1.  **Check the Leaderboard**\\nSee how your model ranks against other Kagglers on our leaderboard. \\n1.  **Improve Your Score**\\nCheck out the <a href=\\\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">discussion forum</a> to find lots of tutorials and insights from other competitors.\\n\\n> #### Kaggle Lingo Video\\n> You may run into unfamiliar lingo as you dig into the Kaggle discussion forums and public notebooks. Check out  Dr. Rachael Tatman’s [video on Kaggle Lingo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEJHyuWKd-s) to get up to speed!\\n\\n## What Data Will I Use in This Competition?\\nIn this competition, you’ll gain access to two similar datasets that include passenger information like name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc. One dataset is titled `train.csv` and the other is titled `test.csv`.\\n\\n`Train.csv` will contain the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 to be exact) and importantly, will reveal whether they survived or not, also known as the “ground truth”.\\n\\nThe `test.csv` dataset contains similar information but does not disclose the “ground truth” for each passenger. It’s your job to predict these outcomes.\\n\\nUsing the patterns you find in the `train.csv` data, predict whether the other 418 passengers on board (found in `test.csv`) survived.\\n\\nCheck out the <a href=\\\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data\\\">“Data” tab</a> to explore the datasets even further. Once you feel you’ve created a competitive model, submit it to Kaggle to see where your model stands on our leaderboard against other Kagglers.\\n\\n## How to Submit your Prediction to Kaggle\\nOnce you’re ready to make a submission and get on the leaderboard:\\n\\n1. Click on the “Submit Predictions” button\\n<img width=\\\"699\\\" align=\\\"center\\\" src=\\\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen1.png\\\">\\n1. Upload a CSV file in the submission file format. You’re able to submit 10 submissions a day.\\n<img width=\\\"699\\\" align=\\\"center\\\" src=\\\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen2.png\\\">\\n\\n## Submission File Format:\\nYou should submit a csv file with exactly 418 entries plus a header row. Your submission will show an error if you have extra columns (beyond `PassengerId` and `Survived`) or rows.\\n\\nThe file should have exactly 2 columns:\\n- `PassengerId` (sorted in any order)\\n- `Survived` (contains your binary predictions: 1 for survived, 0 for deceased)\\n\\n## Got it! I’m ready to get started. Where do I get help if I need it?\\n- For Competition Help: <a href=\\\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\\\">Titanic Discussion Forum</a>\\n\\nKaggle doesn’t have a dedicated team to help troubleshoot your code so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. The forums are full of useful information on the data, metric, and different approaches. We encourage you to use the forums often. If you share your knowledge, you'll find that others will share a lot in turn!\\n\\n## A Last Word on Kaggle Notebooks\\nAs we mentioned before, Kaggle Notebooks is our no-setup, customizable, Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs and a huge repository of community published data &amp; code.\\n\\nIn every competition, you’ll find many Notebooks shared with incredible insights. It’s an invaluable resource worth becoming familiar with. Check out this competition’s Notebooks <a href=\\\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/notebooks\\\">here</a>.\\n\\n## 🏃‍♀Ready to Compete? <a href=\\\"https://www.kaggle.com/account/login?returnUrl=%2Fc%2Ftitanic\\\">Join the Competition Here!</a>\\n\\n## Evaluation\\n\\n<h2>Goal</h2>\\n<p>It is your job to predict if a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic or not. <br>For each  in the test set, you must predict a 0 or 1 value for the  variable.</p>\\n<h2>Metric</h2>\\n<p>Your score is the percentage of passengers you correctly predict. This is known as <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision#In_binary_classification\\\">accuracy</a>.</p>\\n<h2>Submission File Format</h2>\\n<p>You should submit a csv file with exactly 418 entries <b>plus</b> a header row. Your submission will show an error if you have extra columns (beyond PassengerId and Survived) or rows.<br><br>The file should have exactly 2 columns:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>PassengerId (sorted in any order)</li>\\n<li>Survived (contains your binary predictions: 1 for survived, 0 for deceased)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<pre><b>PassengerId,Survived</b><br>892,0<br>893,1<br>894,0<br>Etc.</pre>\\n<p>You can download an example submission file (gender_submission.csv) on the <a href=\\\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data\\\">Data page</a>.</p>\\n\\n## data-description\\n\\n<h3>Overview</h3>\\n<p>The data has been split into two groups:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>training set (train.csv)</li>\\n<li>test set (test.csv)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><b> The training set </b>should be used to build your machine learning models. For the training set, we provide the outcome (also known as the “ground truth”) for each passenger. Your model will be based on “features” like passengers’ gender and class. You can also use <a href=\\\"https://triangleinequality.wordpress.com/2013/09/08/basic-feature-engineering-with-the-titanic-data/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"> feature engineering </a>to create new features.</p>\\n<p><b>The test set </b>should be used to see how well your model performs on unseen data. For the test set, we do not provide the ground truth for each passenger. It is your job to predict these outcomes. For each passenger in the test set, use the model you trained to predict whether or not they survived the sinking of the Titanic.</p>\\n<p>We also include <b>gender_submission.csv</b>, a set of predictions that assume all and only female passengers survive, as an example of what a submission file should look like.</p>\\n<h3>Data Dictionary</h3>\\n<table style=\\\"width: 100%;\\\">\\n<tbody>\\n<tr><th><b>Variable</b></th><th><b>Definition</b></th><th><b>Key</b></th></tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>survival</td>\\n<td>Survival</td>\\n<td>0 = No, 1 = Yes</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>pclass</td>\\n<td>Ticket class</td>\\n<td>1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>sex</td>\\n<td>Sex</td>\\n<td></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Age</td>\\n<td>Age in years</td>\\n<td></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>sibsp</td>\\n<td># of siblings / spouses aboard the Titanic</td>\\n<td></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>parch</td>\\n<td># of parents / children aboard the Titanic</td>\\n<td></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>ticket</td>\\n<td>Ticket number</td>\\n<td></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>fare</td>\\n<td>Passenger fare</td>\\n<td></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>cabin</td>\\n<td>Cabin number</td>\\n<td></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>embarked</td>\\n<td>Port of Embarkation</td>\\n<td>C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton</td>\\n</tr>\\n</tbody>\\n</table>\\n<h3>Variable Notes</h3>\\n<p><b>pclass</b>: A proxy for socio-economic status (SES)<br /> 1st = Upper<br /> 2nd = Middle<br /> 3rd = Lower<br /><br /> <b>age</b>: Age is fractional if less than 1.

They are a great place to begin if you are new to data science or just finished a MOOC and want to get involved in Kaggle.</p>\\n<p>Getting Started competitions are a non-competitive way to get familiar with Kaggle’s platform, learn basic machine learning concepts, and start meeting people in the community. They have no cash prize and are on a rolling timeline.</p>\\n<h2>How do I create and manage a team?</h2>\\n<p>When you accept the competition rules, a team will be created for you. You can invite others to your team, accept a merger with another team, and update basic information like team name by going to the More &gt; <a href=\\\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/team\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Team</a> page.</p>\\n<p>We've heard from many Kagglers that teaming up is the best way to learn new skills AND have fun. If you don't have a teammate already, consider asking if anyone wants to team up in the <a href=\\\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">discussion forum</a>.</p>\\n<h2>What are Notebooks?</h2>\\n<p>Kaggle Notebooks is a cloud computational environment that enables reproducible and collaborative analysis. Notebooks support scripts in Python and R, Jupyter Notebooks, and RMarkdown reports. You can visit the <a href=\\\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/notebooks\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Notebooks</a> tab to view all of the publicly shared code for the Titanic competition. For more on how to use Notebooks to learn data science, check out our <a href=\\\"https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview\\\" target=\\\"&quot;_blank\\\">Courses</a>!</p>\\n<h2>Why did my team disappear from the leaderboard?</h2>\\n<p>To keep with the spirit of getting-started competitions, we have implemented a two month rolling window on submissions. Once a submission is more than two months old, it will be invalidated and no longer count towards the leaderboard.</p>\\n<p>If your team has no submissions in the previous two months, the team will also drop from the leaderboard. This will keep the leaderboard at a manageable size, freshen it up, and prevent newcomers from getting lost in a sea of abandoned scores.</p>\\n<p><i>\\\"I worked so hard to get that score! Give it back!\\\"</i> Read more about our decision to implement a rolling leaderboard <a href=\\\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion/6240\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">here</a>.</p>\\n<h2>How do I contact Support?</h2>\\n<p>Kaggle does not have a dedicated support team so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. (For this competition, you’ll want to use the <a href=\\\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Titanic discussion forum)</a>.</p>\\n<p>Support is only able to help with issues that are being experienced by all participants. Before contacting support, please check the discussion forum for information on your problem. If you can’t find it, you can post your problem in the forum so a fellow participant or a Kaggle team member can provide help. The forums are full of useful information on the data, metric, and different approaches. We encourage you to use the forums often. If you share your knowledge, you'll find that others will share a lot in turn!</p>\\n<p>If your problem persists or it seems to be effective all participants then please <a href=\\\"https://www.kaggle.com/contact\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">contact us</a>.</p>\", \"is_error\": false}",

You’re in the right place. \nThis is the legendary Titanic ML competition – the best, first challenge for you to dive into ML competitions and familiarize yourself with how the Kaggle platform works.\n\n**If you want to talk with other users about this competition, come join our Discord! We've got channels for competitions, job postings and career discussions, resources, and socializing with your fellow data scientists. Follow the link here:** https://discord.gg/kaggle\n\nThe competition is simple: use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.\n\nRead on or watch the video below to explore more details. Once you’re ready to start competing, click on the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/account/login?returnUrl=%2Fc%2Ftitanic\" target=\"_blank\">\"Join Competition button</a> to create an account and gain access to the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data\" target=\"_blank\">competition data</a>. Then check out <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/titanic-tutorial\">Alexis Cook’s Titanic Tutorial</a> that walks you through step by step how to make your first submission!\n\n<iframe width=\"699\" height=\"368\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8yZMXCaFshs\" title=\"YouTube video | How to Get Started with Kaggle’s Titanic Competition | Kaggle\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n## The Challenge\nThe sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.\n\nOn April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.\n\nWhile there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.\n\nIn this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).\n\n> #### Recommended Tutorial\n> We highly recommend [Alexis Cook’s Titanic Tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/titanic-tutorial) that walks you through making your very first submission step by step and [this starter notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/gusthema/titanic-competition-w-tensorflow-decision-forests) to get started.\n\n## How Kaggle’s Competitions Work\n1. **Join the Competition**\nRead about the challenge description, accept the Competition Rules and gain access to the competition dataset.\n1.  **Get to Work**\nDownload the data, build models on it locally or on Kaggle Notebooks (our no-setup, customizable Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs) and generate a prediction file.\n1.  **Make a Submission**\nUpload your prediction as a submission on Kaggle and receive an accuracy score.\n1.  **Check the Leaderboard**\nSee how your model ranks against other Kagglers on our leaderboard. \n1.  **Improve Your Score**\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a> to find lots of tutorials and insights from other competitors.\n\n> #### Kaggle Lingo Video\n> You may run into unfamiliar lingo as you dig into the Kaggle discussion forums and public notebooks. Check out  Dr. Rachael Tatman’s [video on Kaggle Lingo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEJHyuWKd-s) to get up to speed!\n\n## What Data Will I Use in This Competition?\nIn this competition, you’ll gain access to two similar datasets that include passenger information like name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc. One dataset is titled `train.csv` and the other is titled `test.csv`.\n\n`Train.csv` will contain the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 to be exact) and importantly, will reveal whether they survived or not, also known as the “ground truth”.\n\nThe `test.csv` dataset contains similar information but does not disclose the “ground truth” for each passenger. It’s your job to predict these outcomes.\n\nUsing the patterns you find in the `train.csv` data, predict whether the other 418 passengers on board (found in `test.csv`) survived.\n\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data\">“Data” tab</a> to explore the datasets even further. Once you feel you’ve created a competitive model, submit it to Kaggle to see where your model stands on our leaderboard against other Kagglers.\n\n## How to Submit your Prediction to Kaggle\nOnce you’re ready to make a submission and get on the leaderboard:\n\n1. Click on the “Submit Predictions” button\n<img width=\"699\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen1.png\">\n1. Upload a CSV file in the submission file format. You’re able to submit 10 submissions a day.\n<img width=\"699\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen2.png\">\n\n## Submission File Format:\nYou should submit a csv file with exactly 418 entries plus a header row. Your submission will show an error if you have extra columns (beyond `PassengerId` and `Survived`) or rows.\n\nThe file should have exactly 2 columns:\n- `PassengerId` (sorted in any order)\n- `Survived` (contains your binary predictions: 1 for survived, 0 for deceased)\n\n## Got it! I’m ready to get started. Where do I get help if I need it?\n- For Competition Help: <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\">Titanic Discussion Forum</a>\n\nKaggle doesn’t have a dedicated team to help troubleshoot your code so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. The forums are full of useful information on the data, metric, and different approaches. We encourage you to use the forums often. If you share your knowledge, you'll find that others will share a lot in turn!\n\n## A Last Word on Kaggle Notebooks\nAs we mentioned before, Kaggle Notebooks is our no-setup, customizable, Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs and a huge repository of community published data &amp; code.\n\nIn every competition, you’ll find many Notebooks shared with incredible insights. It’s an invaluable resource worth becoming familiar with. Check out this competition’s Notebooks <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/notebooks\">here</a>.\n\n## 🏃‍♀Ready to Compete? <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/account/login?returnUrl=%2Fc%2Ftitanic\">Join the Competition Here!</a>\n\n## Evaluation\n\n<h2>Goal</h2>\n<p>It is your job to predict if a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic or not. <br>For each  in the test set, you must predict a 0 or 1 value for the  variable.</p>\n<h2>Metric</h2>\n<p>Your score is the percentage of passengers you correctly predict.

They are a great place to begin if you are new to data science or just finished a MOOC and want to get involved in Kaggle.</p>\n<p>Getting Started competitions are a non-competitive way to get familiar with Kaggle’s platform, learn basic machine learning concepts, and start meeting people in the community. They have no cash prize and are on a rolling timeline.</p>\n<h2>How do I create and manage a team?</h2>\n<p>When you accept the competition rules, a team will be created for you. You can invite others to your team, accept a merger with another team, and update basic information like team name by going to the More &gt; <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/team\" target=\"_blank\">Team</a> page.</p>\n<p>We've heard from many Kagglers that teaming up is the best way to learn new skills AND have fun. If you don't have a teammate already, consider asking if anyone wants to team up in the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a>.</p>\n<h2>What are Notebooks?</h2>\n<p>Kaggle Notebooks is a cloud computational environment that enables reproducible and collaborative analysis. Notebooks support scripts in Python and R, Jupyter Notebooks, and RMarkdown reports. You can visit the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/notebooks\" target=\"_blank\">Notebooks</a> tab to view all of the publicly shared code for the Titanic competition. For more on how to use Notebooks to learn data science, check out our <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview\" target=\"&quot;_blank\">Courses</a>!</p>\n<h2>Why did my team disappear from the leaderboard?</h2>\n<p>To keep with the spirit of getting-started competitions, we have implemented a two month rolling window on submissions. Once a submission is more than two months old, it will be invalidated and no longer count towards the leaderboard.</p>\n<p>If your team has no submissions in the previous two months, the team will also drop from the leaderboard. This will keep the leaderboard at a manageable size, freshen it up, and prevent newcomers from getting lost in a sea of abandoned scores.</p>\n<p><i>\"I worked so hard to get that score! Give it back!\"</i> Read more about our decision to implement a rolling leaderboard <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion/6240\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n<h2>How do I contact Support?</h2>\n<p>Kaggle does not have a dedicated support team so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. (For this competition, you’ll want to use the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">Titanic discussion forum)</a>.</p>\n<p>Support is only able to help with issues that are being experienced by all participants. Before contacting support, please check the discussion forum for information on your problem. If you can’t find it, you can post your problem in the forum so a fellow participant or a Kaggle team member can provide help. The forums are full of useful information on the data, metric, and different approaches. We encourage you to use the forums often. If you share your knowledge, you'll find that others will share a lot in turn!</p>\n<p>If your problem persists or it seems to be effective all participants then please <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/contact\" target=\"_blank\">contact us</a>.</p>\ntool: Not a directory: /home/code/exploration/../research/writeups\ntool: /home/code/exploration/../research/kernels:\n[DIR]  alexisbcook_exercise-arithmetic-and-variables/\n[DIR]  alexisbcook_titanic-tutorial/\n[DIR]  arthurtok_introduction-to-ensembling-stacking-in-python/\n[DIR]  ldfreeman3_a-data-science-framework-to-achieve-99-accuracy/\n[FILE] metadata.json (1.7KB)\n[DIR]  startupsci_titanic-data-science-solutions/\ntool: /home/data:\n[FILE] description.md (13.6KB)\n[FILE] gender_submission.csv (3.2KB)\n[FILE] test.csv (28.0KB)\n[FILE] train.csv (59.8KB)",

They are a great place to begin if you are new to data science or just finished a MOOC and want to get involved in Kaggle.</p>\\n<p>Getting Started competitions are a non-competitive way to get familiar with Kaggle’s platform, learn basic machine learning concepts, and start meeting people in the community. They have no cash prize and are on a rolling timeline.</p>\\n<h2>How do I create and manage a team?</h2>\\n<p>When you accept the competition rules, a team will be created for you. You can invite others to your team, accept a merger with another team, and update basic information like team name by going to the More &gt; <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/team\" target=\"_blank\">Team</a> page.</p>\\n<p>We\\'ve heard from many Kagglers that teaming up is the best way to learn new skills AND have fun. If you don\\'t have a teammate already, consider asking if anyone wants to team up in the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a>.</p>\\n<h2>What are Notebooks?</h2>\\n<p>Kaggle Notebooks is a cloud computational environment that enables reproducible and collaborative analysis. Notebooks support scripts in Python and R, Jupyter Notebooks, and RMarkdown reports.

Once you’re ready to start competing, click on the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/account/login?returnUrl=%2Fc%2Ftitanic\" target=\"_blank\">\"Join Competition button</a> to create an account and gain access to the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data\" target=\"_blank\">competition data</a>. Then check out <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/titanic-tutorial\">Alexis Cook’s Titanic Tutorial</a> that walks you through step by step how to make your first submission!\n\n<iframe width=\"699\" height=\"368\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8yZMXCaFshs\" title=\"YouTube video | How to Get Started with Kaggle’s Titanic Competition | Kaggle\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n## The Challenge\nThe sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.\n\nOn April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.\n\nWhile there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.\n\nIn this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).\n\n> #### Recommended Tutorial\n> We highly recommend [Alexis Cook’s Titanic Tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/titanic-tutorial) that walks you through making your very first submission step by step and [this starter notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/gusthema/titanic-competition-w-tensorflow-decision-forests) to get started.\n\n## How Kaggle’s Competitions Work\n1. **Join the Competition**\nRead about the challenge description, accept the Competition Rules and gain access to the competition dataset.\n1.  **Get to Work**\nDownload the data, build models on it locally or on Kaggle Notebooks (our no-setup, customizable Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs) and generate a prediction file.\n1.  **Make a Submission**\nUpload your prediction as a submission on Kaggle and receive an accuracy score.\n1.  **Check the Leaderboard**\nSee how your model ranks against other Kagglers on our leaderboard. \n1.  **Improve Your Score**\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a> to find lots of tutorials and insights from other competitors.\n\n> #### Kaggle Lingo Video\n> You may run into unfamiliar lingo as you dig into the Kaggle discussion forums and public notebooks. Check out  Dr. Rachael Tatman’s [video on Kaggle Lingo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEJHyuWKd-s) to get up to speed!\n\n## What Data Will I Use in This Competition?\nIn this competition, you’ll gain access to two similar datasets that include passenger information like name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc. One dataset is titled `train.csv` and the other is titled `test.csv`.\n\n`Train.csv` will contain the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 to be exact) and importantly, will reveal whether they survived or not, also known as the “ground truth”.\n\nThe `test.csv` dataset contains similar information but does not disclose the “ground truth” for each passenger. It’s your job to predict these outcomes.\n\nUsing the patterns you find in the `train.csv` data, predict whether the other 418 passengers on board (found in `test.csv`) survived.\n\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data\">“Data” tab</a> to explore the datasets even further. Once you feel you’ve created a competitive model, submit it to Kaggle to see where your model stands on our leaderboard against other Kagglers.\n\n## How to Submit your Prediction to Kaggle\nOnce you’re ready to make a submission and get on the leaderboard:\n\n1. Click on the “Submit Predictions” button\n<img width=\"699\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen1.png\">\n1. Upload a CSV file in the submission file format. You’re able to submit 10 submissions a day.\n<img width=\"699\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen2.png\">\n\n## Submission File Format:\nYou should submit a csv file with exactly 418 entries plus a header row. Your submission will show an error if you have extra columns (beyond `PassengerId` and `Survived`) or rows.\n\nThe file should have exactly 2 columns:\n- `PassengerId` (sorted in any order)\n- `Survived` (contains your binary predictions: 1 for survived, 0 for deceased)\n\n## Got it! I’m ready to get started. Where do I get help if I need it?\n- For Competition Help: <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\">Titanic Discussion Forum</a>\n\nKaggle doesn’t have a dedicated team to help troubleshoot your code so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. The forums are full of useful information on the data, metric, and different approaches. We encourage you to use the forums often. If you share your knowledge, you'll find that others will share a lot in turn!\n\n## A Last Word on Kaggle Notebooks\nAs we mentioned before, Kaggle Notebooks is our no-setup, customizable, Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs and a huge repository of community published data &amp; code.\n\nIn every competition, you’ll find many Notebooks shared with incredible insights. It’s an invaluable resource worth becoming familiar with.

Once you’re ready to start competing, click on the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/account/login?returnUrl=%2Fc%2Ftitanic\" target=\"_blank\">\"Join Competition button</a> to create an account and gain access to the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data\" target=\"_blank\">competition data</a>. Then check out <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/titanic-tutorial\">Alexis Cook’s Titanic Tutorial</a> that walks you through step by step how to make your first submission!\\n\\n<iframe width=\"699\" height=\"368\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8yZMXCaFshs\" title=\"YouTube video | How to Get Started with Kaggle’s Titanic Competition | Kaggle\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n\\n## The Challenge\\nThe sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.\\n\\nOn April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.\\n\\nWhile there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.\\n\\nIn this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).\\n\\n> #### Recommended Tutorial\\n> We highly recommend [Alexis Cook’s Titanic Tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/titanic-tutorial) that walks you through making your very first submission step by step and [this starter notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/gusthema/titanic-competition-w-tensorflow-decision-forests) to get started.\\n\\n## How Kaggle’s Competitions Work\\n1. **Join the Competition**\\nRead about the challenge description, accept the Competition Rules and gain access to the competition dataset.\\n1.  **Get to Work**\\nDownload the data, build models on it locally or on Kaggle Notebooks (our no-setup, customizable Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs) and generate a prediction file.\\n1.  **Make a Submission**\\nUpload your prediction as a submission on Kaggle and receive an accuracy score.\\n1.  **Check the Leaderboard**\\nSee how your model ranks against other Kagglers on our leaderboard. \\n1.  **Improve Your Score**\\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a> to find lots of tutorials and insights from other competitors.\\n\\n> #### Kaggle Lingo Video\\n> You may run into unfamiliar lingo as you dig into the Kaggle discussion forums and public notebooks. Check out  Dr. Rachael Tatman’s [video on Kaggle Lingo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEJHyuWKd-s) to get up to speed!\\n\\n## What Data Will I Use in This Competition?\\nIn this competition, you’ll gain access to two similar datasets that include passenger information like name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc. One dataset is titled `train.csv` and the other is titled `test.csv`.\\n\\n`Train.csv` will contain the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 to be exact) and importantly, will reveal whether they survived or not, also known as the “ground truth”.\\n\\nThe `test.csv` dataset contains similar information but does not disclose the “ground truth” for each passenger. It’s your job to predict these outcomes.\\n\\nUsing the patterns you find in the `train.csv` data, predict whether the other 418 passengers on board (found in `test.csv`) survived.\\n\\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data\">“Data” tab</a> to explore the datasets even further. Once you feel you’ve created a competitive model, submit it to Kaggle to see where your model stands on our leaderboard against other Kagglers.\\n\\n## How to Submit your Prediction to Kaggle\\nOnce you’re ready to make a submission and get on the leaderboard:\\n\\n1. Click on the “Submit Predictions” button\\n<img width=\"699\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen1.png\">\\n1. Upload a CSV file in the submission file format. You’re able to submit 10 submissions a day.\\n<img width=\"699\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen2.png\">\\n\\n## Submission File Format:\\nYou should submit a csv file with exactly 418 entries plus a header row. Your submission will show an error if you have extra columns (beyond `PassengerId` and `Survived`) or rows.\\n\\nThe file should have exactly 2 columns:\\n- `PassengerId` (sorted in any order)\\n- `Survived` (contains your binary predictions: 1 for survived, 0 for deceased)\\n\\n## Got it! I’m ready to get started. Where do I get help if I need it?\\n- For Competition Help: <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\">Titanic Discussion Forum</a>\\n\\nKaggle doesn’t have a dedicated team to help troubleshoot your code so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. The forums are full of useful information on the data, metric, and different approaches. We encourage you to use the forums often. If you share your knowledge, you\\'ll find that others will share a lot in turn!\\n\\n## A Last Word on Kaggle Notebooks\\nAs we mentioned before, Kaggle Notebooks is our no-setup, customizable, Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs and a huge repository of community published data &amp; code.\\n\\nIn every competition, you’ll find many Notebooks shared with incredible insights. It’s an invaluable resource worth becoming familiar with. Check out this competition’s Notebooks <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/notebooks\">here</a>.\\n\\n## 🏃\\u200d♀Ready to Compete? <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/account/login?returnUrl=%2Fc%2Ftitanic\">Join the Competition Here!</a>\\n\\n## Evaluation\\n\\n<h2>Goal</h2>\\n<p>It is your job to predict if a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic or not. <br>For each  in the test set, you must predict a 0 or 1 value for the  variable.</p>\\n<h2>Metric</h2>\\n<p>Your score is the percentage of passengers you correctly predict. This is known as <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision#In_binary_classification\">accuracy</a>.</p>\\n<h2>Submission File Format</h2>\\n<p>You should submit a csv file with exactly 418 entries <b>plus</b> a header row. Your submission will show an error if you have extra columns (beyond PassengerId and Survived) or rows.<br><br>The file should have exactly 2 columns:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>PassengerId (sorted in any order)</li>\\n<li>Survived (contains your binary predictions: 1 for survived, 0 for deceased)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<pre><b>PassengerId,Survived</b><br>892,0<br>893,1<br>894,0<br>Etc.</pre>\\n<p>You can download an example submission file (gender_submission.csv) on the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data\">Data page</a>.</p>\\n\\n## data-description\\n\\n<h3>Overview</h3>\\n<p>The data has been split into two groups:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>training set (train.csv)</li>\\n<li>test set (test.csv)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><b> The training set </b>should be used to build your machine learning models. For the training set, we provide the outcome (also known as the “ground truth”) for each passenger. Your model will be based on “features” like passengers’ gender and class. You can also use <a href=\"https://triangleinequality.wordpress.com/2013/09/08/basic-feature-engineering-with-the-titanic-data/\" target=\"_blank\"> feature engineering </a>to create new features.</p>\\n<p><b>The test set </b>should be used to see how well your model performs on unseen data. For the test set, we do not provide the ground truth for each passenger. It is your job to predict these outcomes. For each passenger in the test set, use the model you trained to predict whether or not they survived the sinking of the Titanic.</p>\\n<p>We also include <b>gender_submission.csv</b>, a set of predictions that assume all and only female passengers survive, as an example of what a submission file should look like.</p>\\n<h3>Data Dictionary</h3>\\n<table style=\"width: 100%;\">\\n<tbody>\\n<tr><th><b>Variable</b></th><th><b>Definition</b></th><th><b>Key</b></th></tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>survival</td>\\n<td>Survival</td>\\n<td>0 = No, 1 = Yes</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>pclass</td>\\n<td>Ticket class</td>\\n<td>1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>sex</td>\\n<td>Sex</td>\\n<td></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Age</td>\\n<td>Age in years</td>\\n<td></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>sibsp</td>\\n<td># of siblings / spouses aboard the Titanic</td>\\n<td></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>parch</td>\\n<td># of parents / children aboard the Titanic</td>\\n<td></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>ticket</td>\\n<td>Ticket number</td>\\n<td></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>fare</td>\\n<td>Passenger fare</td>\\n<td></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>cabin</td>\\n<td>Cabin number</td>\\n<td></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>embarked</td>\\n<td>Port of Embarkation</td>\\n<td>C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton</td>\\n</tr>\\n</tbody>\\n</table>\\n<h3>Variable Notes</h3>\\n<p><b>pclass</b>: A proxy for socio-economic status (SES)<br /> 1st = Upper<br /> 2nd = Middle<br /> 3rd = Lower<br /><br /> <b>age</b>: Age is fractional if less than 1.

They are a great place to begin if you are new to data science or just finished a MOOC and want to get involved in Kaggle.</p>\\n<p>Getting Started competitions are a non-competitive way to get familiar with Kaggle’s platform, learn basic machine learning concepts, and start meeting people in the community. They have no cash prize and are on a rolling timeline.</p>\\n<h2>How do I create and manage a team?</h2>\\n<p>When you accept the competition rules, a team will be created for you. You can invite others to your team, accept a merger with another team, and update basic information like team name by going to the More &gt; <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/team\" target=\"_blank\">Team</a> page.</p>\\n<p>We\\'ve heard from many Kagglers that teaming up is the best way to learn new skills AND have fun. If you don\\'t have a teammate already, consider asking if anyone wants to team up in the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a>.</p>\\n<h2>What are Notebooks?</h2>\\n<p>Kaggle Notebooks is a cloud computational environment that enables reproducible and collaborative analysis. Notebooks support scripts in Python and R, Jupyter Notebooks, and RMarkdown reports. You can visit the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/notebooks\" target=\"_blank\">Notebooks</a> tab to view all of the publicly shared code for the Titanic competition. For more on how to use Notebooks to learn data science, check out our <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview\" target=\"&quot;_blank\">Courses</a>!</p>\\n<h2>Why did my team disappear from the leaderboard?</h2>\\n<p>To keep with the spirit of getting-started competitions, we have implemented a two month rolling window on submissions. Once a submission is more than two months old, it will be invalidated and no longer count towards the leaderboard.</p>\\n<p>If your team has no submissions in the previous two months, the team will also drop from the leaderboard. This will keep the leaderboard at a manageable size, freshen it up, and prevent newcomers from getting lost in a sea of abandoned scores.</p>\\n<p><i>\"I worked so hard to get that score! Give it back!\"</i> Read more about our decision to implement a rolling leaderboard <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion/6240\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\\n<h2>How do I contact Support?</h2>\\n<p>Kaggle does not have a dedicated support team so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. (For this competition, you’ll want to use the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">Titanic discussion forum)</a>.</p>\\n<p>Support is only able to help with issues that are being experienced by all participants. Before contacting support, please check the discussion forum for information on your problem. If you can’t find it, you can post your problem in the forum so a fellow participant or a Kaggle team member can provide help. The forums are full of useful information on the data, metric, and different approaches. We encourage you to use the forums often. If you share your knowledge, you\\'ll find that others will share a lot in turn!</p>\\n<p>If your problem persists or it seems to be effective all participants then please <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/contact\" target=\"_blank\">contact us</a>.</p>'}, {'role': 'tool', 'content': 'Not a directory: /home/code/exploration/../research/writeups'}, {'role': 'tool', 'content': '/home/code/exploration/../research/kernels:\\n[DIR]  alexisbcook_exercise-arithmetic-and-variables/\\n[DIR]  alexisbcook_titanic-tutorial/\\n[DIR]  arthurtok_introduction-to-ensembling-stacking-in-python/\\n[DIR]  ldfreeman3_a-data-science-framework-to-achieve-99-accuracy/\\n[FILE] metadata.json (1.7KB)\\n[DIR]  startupsci_titanic-data-science-solutions/'}, {'role': 'tool', 'content': '/home/data:\\n[FILE] description.md (13.6KB)\\n[FILE] gender_submission.csv (3.2KB)\\n[FILE] test.csv (28.0KB)\\n[FILE] train.csv (59.8KB)'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': \"REASONING: This is the classic Titanic survival prediction problem - binary classification with accuracy as the metric.

We've got channels for competitions, job postings and career discussions, resources, and socializing with your fellow data scientists. Follow the link here:** https://discord.gg/kaggle\n\nThe competition is simple: use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.\n\nRead on or watch the video below to explore more details. Once you’re ready to start competing, click on the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/account/login?returnUrl=%2Fc%2Ftitanic\" target=\"_blank\">\"Join Competition button</a> to create an account and gain access to the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data\" target=\"_blank\">competition data</a>. Then check out <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/titanic-tutorial\">Alexis Cook’s Titanic Tutorial</a> that walks you through step by step how to make your first submission!\n\n<iframe width=\"699\" height=\"368\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8yZMXCaFshs\" title=\"YouTube video | How to Get Started with Kaggle’s Titanic Competition | Kaggle\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n## The Challenge\nThe sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.\n\nOn April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.\n\nWhile there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.\n\nIn this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).\n\n> #### Recommended Tutorial\n> We highly recommend [Alexis Cook’s Titanic Tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/titanic-tutorial) that walks you through making your very first submission step by step and [this starter notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/gusthema/titanic-competition-w-tensorflow-decision-forests) to get started.\n\n## How Kaggle’s Competitions Work\n1. **Join the Competition**\nRead about the challenge description, accept the Competition Rules and gain access to the competition dataset.\n1.  **Get to Work**\nDownload the data, build models on it locally or on Kaggle Notebooks (our no-setup, customizable Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs) and generate a prediction file.\n1.  **Make a Submission**\nUpload your prediction as a submission on Kaggle and receive an accuracy score.\n1.  **Check the Leaderboard**\nSee how your model ranks against other Kagglers on our leaderboard. \n1.  **Improve Your Score**\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a> to find lots of tutorials and insights from other competitors.\n\n> #### Kaggle Lingo Video\n> You may run into unfamiliar lingo as you dig into the Kaggle discussion forums and public notebooks. Check out  Dr. Rachael Tatman’s [video on Kaggle Lingo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEJHyuWKd-s) to get up to speed!\n\n## What Data Will I Use in This Competition?\nIn this competition, you’ll gain access to two similar datasets that include passenger information like name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc. One dataset is titled `train.csv` and the other is titled `test.csv`.\n\n`Train.csv` will contain the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 to be exact) and importantly, will reveal whether they survived or not, also known as the “ground truth”.\n\nThe `test.csv` dataset contains similar information but does not disclose the “ground truth” for each passenger. It’s your job to predict these outcomes.\n\nUsing the patterns you find in the `train.csv` data, predict whether the other 418 passengers on board (found in `test.csv`) survived.\n\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data\">“Data” tab</a> to explore the datasets even further. Once you feel you’ve created a competitive model, submit it to Kaggle to see where your model stands on our leaderboard against other Kagglers.\n\n## How to Submit your Prediction to Kaggle\nOnce you’re ready to make a submission and get on the leaderboard:\n\n1. Click on the “Submit Predictions” button\n<img width=\"699\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen1.png\">\n1. Upload a CSV file in the submission file format. You’re able to submit 10 submissions a day.\n<img width=\"699\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen2.png\">\n\n## Submission File Format:\nYou should submit a csv file with exactly 418 entries plus a header row. Your submission will show an error if you have extra columns (beyond `PassengerId` and `Survived`) or rows.\n\nThe file should have exactly 2 columns:\n- `PassengerId` (sorted in any order)\n- `Survived` (contains your binary predictions: 1 for survived, 0 for deceased)\n\n## Got it! I’m ready to get started. Where do I get help if I need it?\n- For Competition Help: <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\">Titanic Discussion Forum</a>\n\nKaggle doesn’t have a dedicated team to help troubleshoot your code so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. The forums are full of useful information on the data, metric, and different approaches. We encourage you to use the forums often. If you share your knowledge, you'll find that others will share a lot in turn!\n\n## A Last Word on Kaggle Notebooks\nAs we mentioned before, Kaggle Notebooks is our no-setup, customizable, Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs and a huge repository of community published data &amp; code.\n\nIn every competition, you’ll find many Notebooks shared with incredible insights. It’s an invaluable resource worth becoming familiar with.

They are a great place to begin if you are new to data science or just finished a MOOC and want to get involved in Kaggle.</p>\n<p>Getting Started competitions are a non-competitive way to get familiar with Kaggle’s platform, learn basic machine learning concepts, and start meeting people in the community. They have no cash prize and are on a rolling timeline.</p>\n<h2>How do I create and manage a team?</h2>\n<p>When you accept the competition rules, a team will be created for you. You can invite others to your team, accept a merger with another team, and update basic information like team name by going to the More &gt; <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/team\" target=\"_blank\">Team</a> page.</p>\n<p>We've heard from many Kagglers that teaming up is the best way to learn new skills AND have fun. If you don't have a teammate already, consider asking if anyone wants to team up in the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a>.</p>\n<h2>What are Notebooks?</h2>\n<p>Kaggle Notebooks is a cloud computational environment that enables reproducible and collaborative analysis. Notebooks support scripts in Python and R, Jupyter Notebooks, and RMarkdown reports. You can visit the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/notebooks\" target=\"_blank\">Notebooks</a> tab to view all of the publicly shared code for the Titanic competition. For more on how to use Notebooks to learn data science, check out our <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview\" target=\"&quot;_blank\">Courses</a>!</p>\n<h2>Why did my team disappear from the leaderboard?</h2>\n<p>To keep with the spirit of getting-started competitions, we have implemented a two month rolling window on submissions. Once a submission is more than two months old, it will be invalidated and no longer count towards the leaderboard.</p>\n<p>If your team has no submissions in the previous two months, the team will also drop from the leaderboard. This will keep the leaderboard at a manageable size, freshen it up, and prevent newcomers from getting lost in a sea of abandoned scores.</p>\n<p><i>\"I worked so hard to get that score! Give it back!\"</i> Read more about our decision to implement a rolling leaderboard <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion/6240\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n<h2>How do I contact Support?</h2>\n<p>Kaggle does not have a dedicated support team so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. (For this competition, you’ll want to use the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">Titanic discussion forum)</a>.</p>\n<p>Support is only able to help with issues that are being experienced by all participants. Before contacting support, please check the discussion forum for information on your problem. If you can’t find it, you can post your problem in the forum so a fellow participant or a Kaggle team member can provide help. The forums are full of useful information on the data, metric, and different approaches. We encourage you to use the forums often.

They are a great place to begin if you are new to data science or just finished a MOOC and want to get involved in Kaggle.</p>\\n<p>Getting Started competitions are a non-competitive way to get familiar with Kaggle’s platform, learn basic machine learning concepts, and start meeting people in the community. They have no cash prize and are on a rolling timeline.</p>\\n<h2>How do I create and manage a team?</h2>\\n<p>When you accept the competition rules, a team will be created for you. You can invite others to your team, accept a merger with another team, and update basic information like team name by going to the More &gt; <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/team\" target=\"_blank\">Team</a> page.</p>\\n<p>We\\'ve heard from many Kagglers that teaming up is the best way to learn new skills AND have fun. If you don\\'t have a teammate already, consider asking if anyone wants to team up in the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a>.</p>\\n<h2>What are Notebooks?</h2>\\n<p>Kaggle Notebooks is a cloud computational environment that enables reproducible and collaborative analysis. Notebooks support scripts in Python and R, Jupyter Notebooks, and RMarkdown reports. You can visit the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/notebooks\" target=\"_blank\">Notebooks</a> tab to view all of the publicly shared code for the Titanic competition. For more on how to use Notebooks to learn data science, check out our <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview\" target=\"&quot;_blank\">Courses</a>!</p>\\n<h2>Why did my team disappear from the leaderboard?</h2>\\n<p>To keep with the spirit of getting-started competitions, we have implemented a two month rolling window on submissions. Once a submission is more than two months old, it will be invalidated and no longer count towards the leaderboard.</p>\\n<p>If your team has no submissions in the previous two months, the team will also drop from the leaderboard. This will keep the leaderboard at a manageable size, freshen it up, and prevent newcomers from getting lost in a sea of abandoned scores.</p>\\n<p><i>\"I worked so hard to get that score! Give it back!\"</i> Read more about our decision to implement a rolling leaderboard <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion/6240\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\\n<h2>How do I contact Support?</h2>\\n<p>Kaggle does not have a dedicated support team so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. (For this competition, you’ll want to use the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">Titanic discussion forum)</a>.</p>\\n<p>Support is only able to help with issues that are being experienced by all participants. Before contacting support, please check the discussion forum for information on your problem. If you can’t find it, you can post your problem in the forum so a fellow participant or a Kaggle team member can provide help. The forums are full of useful information on the data, metric, and different approaches. We encourage you to use the forums often. If you share your knowledge, you\\'ll find that others will share a lot in turn!</p>\\n<p>If your problem persists or it seems to be effective all participants then please <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/contact\" target=\"_blank\">contact us</a>.</p>'}, {'role': 'tool', 'content': 'Not a directory: /home/code/exploration/../research/writeups'}, {'role': 'tool', 'content': '/home/code/exploration/../research/kernels:\\n[DIR]  alexisbcook_exercise-arithmetic-and-variables/\\n[DIR]  alexisbcook_titanic-tutorial/\\n[DIR]  arthurtok_introduction-to-ensembling-stacking-in-python/\\n[DIR]  ldfreeman3_a-data-science-framework-to-achieve-99-accuracy/\\n[FILE] metadata.json (1.7KB)\\n[DIR]  startupsci_titanic-data-science-solutions/'}, {'role': 'tool', 'content': '/home/data:\\n[FILE] description.md (13.6KB)\\n[FILE] gender_submission.csv (3.2KB)\\n[FILE] test.csv (28.0KB)\\n[FILE] train.csv (59.8KB)'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': \"REASONING: This is the classic Titanic survival prediction problem - binary classification with accuracy as the metric.

Not only will you be able to submit your first competition, but you’ll be able to solve any problem thrown your way. I provide clear explanations, clean code, and plenty of links to resources. *Please Note: This Kernel is still being improved. So check the Change Logs below for updates.

If you don't understand something in the code the print() function is your best friend. In coding, it's okay to try, fail, and try again. If you do run into problems, Google is your second best friend, because 99.99% of the time, someone else had the same question/problem and already asked the coding community. If you've exhausted all your resources, the Kaggle Community via forums and comments can help too.\\\",\\\"cell_type\\\":\\\"markdown\\\",\\\"metadata\\\":{\\\"_cell_guid\\\":\\\"ea24845a-4a15-4235-9ed2-4823acbf4317\\\",\\\"_uuid\\\":\\\"89022d89e1603ef3869a96b9da78da38b0b33b14\\\"}},{\\\"source\\\":\\\"<a id=\\\\\\\"ch1\\\\\\\"></a>\\\\n# How a Data Scientist Beat the Odds\\\\nIt's the classical problem, predict the outcome of a binary event. In laymen terms this means, it either occurred or did not occur. For example, you won or did not win, you passed the test or did not pass the test, you were accepted or not accepted, and you get the point. A common business application is churn or customer retention. Another popular use case is, healthcare's mortality rate or survival analysis. Binary events create an interesting dynamic, because we know statistically, a random guess should achieve a 50% accuracy rate, without creating one single algorithm or writing one single line of code. However, just like autocorrect spellcheck technology, sometimes we humans can be too smart for our own good and actually underperform a coin flip. In this kernel, I use Kaggle's Getting Started Competition, Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster, to walk the reader through, how-to use the data science framework to beat the odds.\\\\n   \\\\n*What happens when technology is too smart for its own good?*\\\\n![Funny Autocorrect](http://15858-presscdn-0-65.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/hilarious-autocorrect-fails-20x.jpg)\\\",\\\"cell_type\\\":\\\"markdown\\\",\\\"metadata\\\":{\\\"_cell_guid\\\":\\\"ec31d549-537e-4f35-8594-22ef03079081\\\",\\\"_uuid\\\":\\\"ff6c70c884a8a5fb3258e7f3fefc9e55261df1df\\\"}},{\\\"source\\\":\\\"<a id=\\\\\\\"ch2\\\\\\\"></a>\\\\n# A Data Science Framework\\\\n1. **Define the Problem:** If data science, big data, machine learning, predictive analytics, business intelligence, or any other buzzword is the solution, then what is the problem? As the saying goes, don't put the cart before the horse. Problems before requirements, requirements before solutions, solutions before design, and design before technology. Too often we are quick to jump on the new shiny technology, tool, or algorithm before determining the actual problem we are trying to solve.\\\\n2. **Gather the Data:** John Naisbitt wrote in his 1984 (yes, 1984) book Megatrends, we are “drowning in data, yet staving for knowledge.\\\\\\\" So, chances are, the dataset(s) already exist somewhere, in some format. It may be external or internal, structured or unstructured, static or streamed, objective or subjective, etc. As the saying goes, you don't have to reinvent the wheel, you just have to know where to find it. In the next step, we will worry about transforming \\\\\\\"dirty data\\\\\\\" to \\\\\\\"clean data.\\\\\\\"\\\\n3. **Prepare Data for Consumption:** This step is often referred to as data wrangling, a required process to turn “wild” data into “manageable” data. Data wrangling includes implementing data architectures for storage and processing, developing data governance standards for quality and control, data extraction (i.e. ETL and web scraping), and data cleaning to identify aberrant, missing, or outlier data points.\\\\n4. **Perform Exploratory Analysis:** Anybody who has ever worked with data knows, garbage-in, garbage-out (GIGO). Therefore, it is important to deploy descriptive and graphical statistics to look for potential problems, patterns, classifications, correlations and comparisons in the dataset. In addition, data categorization (i.e. qualitative vs quantitative) is also important to understand and select the correct hypothesis test or data model.\\\\n5. **Model Data:** Like descriptive and inferential statistics, data modeling can either summarize the data or predict future outcomes. Your dataset and expected results, will determine the algorithms available for use. It's important to remember, algorithms are tools and not magical wands or silver bullets. You must still be the master craft (wo)man that knows how-to select the right tool for the job. An analogy would be asking someone to hand you a Philip screwdriver, and they hand you a flathead screwdriver or worst a hammer. At best, it shows a complete lack of understanding. At worst, it makes completing the project impossible. The same is true in data modelling. The wrong model can lead to poor performance at best and the wrong conclusion (that’s used as actionable intelligence) at worst.\\\\n6. **Validate and Implement Data Model:** After you've trained your model based on a subset of your data, it's time to test your model. This helps ensure you haven't overfit your model or made it so specific to the selected subset, that it does not accurately fit another subset from the same dataset. In this step we determine if our [model overfit, generalize, or underfit our dataset](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/latest/dg/model-fit-underfitting-vs-overfitting.html).\\\\n7. **Optimize and Strategize:** This is the \\\\\\\"bionic man\\\\\\\" step, where you iterate back through the process to make it better...stronger...faster than it was before. As a data scientist, your strategy should be to outsource developer operations and application plumbing, so you have more time to focus on recommendations and design. Once you're able to package your ideas, this becomes your “currency exchange\\\\\\\" rate.\\\",\\\"cell_type\\\":\\\"markdown\\\",\\\"metadata\\\":{\\\"_cell_guid\\\":\\\"8514a868-6816-494a-9e9c-dba14cb36f42\\\",\\\"_uuid\\\":\\\"bd2a68dcaace0c1371f2994f0204dce65800cc20\\\"}},{\\\"source\\\":\\\"<a id=\\\\\\\"ch3\\\\\\\"></a>\\\\n# Step 1: Define the Problem\\\\nFor this project, the problem statement is given to us on a golden plater, develop an algorithm to predict the survival outcome of passengers on the Titanic.\\\\n\\\\n......\\\\n\\\\n**Project Summary:**\\\\nThe sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.\\\\n\\\\nOne of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.\\\\n\\\\nIn this challenge, we ask you to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular, we ask you to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.\\\\n\\\\nPractice Skills\\\\n* Binary classification\\\\n* Python and R basics\\\\n\\\\n# Step 2: Gather the Data\\\\n\\\\nThe dataset is also given to us on a golden plater with test and train data at [Kaggle's Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)\\\\n\\\",\\\"cell_type\\\":\\\"markdown\\\",\\\"metadata\\\":{\\\"_cell_guid\\\":\\\"22ba49b5-b3b6-4129-8c57-623e0d863ab3\\\",\\\"_uuid\\\":\\\"ff014109d795c5d1bfcc66c9761730406124ebe4\\\"}},{\\\"source\\\":\\\"<a id=\\\\\\\"ch4\\\\\\\"></a>\\\\n# Step 3: Prepare Data for Consumption\\\\nSince step 2 was provided to us on a golden plater, so is step 3.

Using the same dataset and different implementation of a decision tree (adaboost, random forest, gradient boost, xgboost, etc.) with tuning does not exceed the 0.77990 submission accuracy. Interesting for this dataset, the simple decision tree algorithm had the best default submission score and with tuning achieved the same best accuracy score.\\\\n\\\\nWhile no general conclusions can be made from testing a handful of algorithms on a single dataset, there are several observations on the mentioned dataset. \\\\n1. The train dataset has a different distribution than the test/validation dataset and population. This created wide margins between the cross validation (CV) accuracy score and Kaggle submission accuracy score.\\\\n2.

Once you’re ready to start competing, click on the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/account/login?returnUrl=%2Fc%2Ftitanic\" target=\"_blank\">\"Join Competition button</a> to create an account and gain access to the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data\" target=\"_blank\">competition data</a>. Then check out <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/titanic-tutorial\">Alexis Cook’s Titanic Tutorial</a> that walks you through step by step how to make your first submission!\n\n<iframe width=\"699\" height=\"368\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8yZMXCaFshs\" title=\"YouTube video | How to Get Started with Kaggle’s Titanic Competition | Kaggle\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n## The Challenge\nThe sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.\n\nOn April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.\n\nWhile there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.\n\nIn this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).\n\n> #### Recommended Tutorial\n> We highly recommend [Alexis Cook’s Titanic Tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/titanic-tutorial) that walks you through making your very first submission step by step and [this starter notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/gusthema/titanic-competition-w-tensorflow-decision-forests) to get started.\n\n## How Kaggle’s Competitions Work\n1. **Join the Competition**\nRead about the challenge description, accept the Competition Rules and gain access to the competition dataset.\n1.  **Get to Work**\nDownload the data, build models on it locally or on Kaggle Notebooks (our no-setup, customizable Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs) and generate a prediction file.\n1.  **Make a Submission**\nUpload your prediction as a submission on Kaggle and receive an accuracy score.\n1.  **Check the Leaderboard**\nSee how your model ranks against other Kagglers on our leaderboard. \n1.  **Improve Your Score**\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a> to find lots of tutorials and insights from other competitors.\n\n> #### Kaggle Lingo Video\n> You may run into unfamiliar lingo as you dig into the Kaggle discussion forums and public notebooks. Check out  Dr. Rachael Tatman’s [video on Kaggle Lingo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEJHyuWKd-s) to get up to speed!\n\n## What Data Will I Use in This Competition?\nIn this competition, you’ll gain access to two similar datasets that include passenger information like name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc. One dataset is titled `train.csv` and the other is titled `test.csv`.\n\n`Train.csv` will contain the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 to be exact) and importantly, will reveal whether they survived or not, also known as the “ground truth”.\n\nThe `test.csv` dataset contains similar information but does not disclose the “ground truth” for each passenger. It’s your job to predict these outcomes.\n\nUsing the patterns you find in the `train.csv` data, predict whether the other 418 passengers on board (found in `test.csv`) survived.\n\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data\">“Data” tab</a> to explore the datasets even further. Once you feel you’ve created a competitive model, submit it to Kaggle to see where your model stands on our leaderboard against other Kagglers.\n\n## How to Submit your Prediction to Kaggle\nOnce you’re ready to make a submission and get on the leaderboard:\n\n1. Click on the “Submit Predictions” button\n<img width=\"699\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen1.png\">\n1. Upload a CSV file in the submission file format. You’re able to submit 10 submissions a day.\n<img width=\"699\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen2.png\">\n\n## Submission File Format:\nYou should submit a csv file with exactly 418 entries plus a header row. Your submission will show an error if you have extra columns (beyond `PassengerId` and `Survived`) or rows.\n\nThe file should have exactly 2 columns:\n- `PassengerId` (sorted in any order)\n- `Survived` (contains your binary predictions: 1 for survived, 0 for deceased)\n\n## Got it! I’m ready to get started. Where do I get help if I need it?\n- For Competition Help: <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\">Titanic Discussion Forum</a>\n\nKaggle doesn’t have a dedicated team to help troubleshoot your code so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. The forums are full of useful information on the data, metric, and different approaches. We encourage you to use the forums often. If you share your knowledge, you'll find that others will share a lot in turn!\n\n## A Last Word on Kaggle Notebooks\nAs we mentioned before, Kaggle Notebooks is our no-setup, customizable, Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs and a huge repository of community published data &amp; code.\n\nIn every competition, you’ll find many Notebooks shared with incredible insights. It’s an invaluable resource worth becoming familiar with. Check out this competition’s Notebooks <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/notebooks\">here</a>.\n\n## 🏃‍♀Ready to Compete? <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/account/login?returnUrl=%2Fc%2Ftitanic\">Join the Competition Here!</a>\n\n## Evaluation\n\n<h2>Goal</h2>\n<p>It is your job to predict if a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic or not. <br>For each  in the test set, you must predict a 0 or 1 value for the  variable.</p>\n<h2>Metric</h2>\n<p>Your score is the percentage of passengers you correctly predict.

They are a great place to begin if you are new to data science or just finished a MOOC and want to get involved in Kaggle.</p>\n<p>Getting Started competitions are a non-competitive way to get familiar with Kaggle’s platform, learn basic machine learning concepts, and start meeting people in the community. They have no cash prize and are on a rolling timeline.</p>\n<h2>How do I create and manage a team?</h2>\n<p>When you accept the competition rules, a team will be created for you. You can invite others to your team, accept a merger with another team, and update basic information like team name by going to the More &gt; <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/team\" target=\"_blank\">Team</a> page.</p>\n<p>We've heard from many Kagglers that teaming up is the best way to learn new skills AND have fun. If you don't have a teammate already, consider asking if anyone wants to team up in the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a>.</p>\n<h2>What are Notebooks?</h2>\n<p>Kaggle Notebooks is a cloud computational environment that enables reproducible and collaborative analysis. Notebooks support scripts in Python and R, Jupyter Notebooks, and RMarkdown reports. You can visit the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/notebooks\" target=\"_blank\">Notebooks</a> tab to view all of the publicly shared code for the Titanic competition. For more on how to use Notebooks to learn data science, check out our <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview\" target=\"&quot;_blank\">Courses</a>!</p>\n<h2>Why did my team disappear from the leaderboard?</h2>\n<p>To keep with the spirit of getting-started competitions, we have implemented a two month rolling window on submissions. Once a submission is more than two months old, it will be invalidated and no longer count towards the leaderboard.</p>\n<p>If your team has no submissions in the previous two months, the team will also drop from the leaderboard. This will keep the leaderboard at a manageable size, freshen it up, and prevent newcomers from getting lost in a sea of abandoned scores.</p>\n<p><i>\"I worked so hard to get that score! Give it back!\"</i> Read more about our decision to implement a rolling leaderboard <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion/6240\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n<h2>How do I contact Support?</h2>\n<p>Kaggle does not have a dedicated support team so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. (For this competition, you’ll want to use the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">Titanic discussion forum)</a>.</p>\n<p>Support is only able to help with issues that are being experienced by all participants. Before contacting support, please check the discussion forum for information on your problem. If you can’t find it, you can post your problem in the forum so a fellow participant or a Kaggle team member can provide help. The forums are full of useful information on the data, metric, and different approaches. We encourage you to use the forums often. If you share your knowledge, you'll find that others will share a lot in turn!</p>\n<p>If your problem persists or it seems to be effective all participants then please <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/contact\" target=\"_blank\">contact us</a>.</p>\ntool: Not a directory: /home/code/exploration/../research/writeups\ntool: /home/code/exploration/../research/kernels:\n[DIR]  alexisbcook_exercise-arithmetic-and-variables/\n[DIR]  alexisbcook_titanic-tutorial/\n[DIR]  arthurtok_introduction-to-ensembling-stacking-in-python/\n[DIR]  ldfreeman3_a-data-science-framework-to-achieve-99-accuracy/\n[FILE] metadata.json (1.7KB)\n[DIR]  startupsci_titanic-data-science-solutions/\ntool: /home/data:\n[FILE] description.md (13.6KB)\n[FILE] gender_submission.csv (3.2KB)\n[FILE] test.csv (28.0KB)\n[FILE] train.csv (59.8KB)\ntool: Error: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/home/code/exploration/../research/kernels/ldfreeman3_a-data-science-framework-to-achieve-99-accuracy/ldfreeman3_a-data-science-framework-to-achieve-99-accuracy.py'\ntool: Error: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/home/code/exploration/../research/kernels/arthurtok_introduction-to-ensembling-stacking-in-python/arthurtok_introduction-to-ensembling-stacking-in-python.py'\ntool: /home/code/exploration/../research/kernels/ldfreeman3_a-data-science-framework-to-achieve-99-accuracy:\n[FILE] a-data-science-framework-to-achieve-99-accuracy.ipynb (107.1KB)\n[FILE] kernel-metadata.json (732.0B)\ntool: /home/code/exploration/../research/kernels/arthurtok_introduction-to-ensembling-stacking-in-python:\n[FILE] introduction-to-ensembling-stacking-in-python.ipynb (39.3KB)\n[FILE] kernel-metadata.json (687.0B)\ntool: /home/code/exploration/../research/kernels/startupsci_titanic-data-science-solutions:\n[FILE] kernel-metadata.json (661.0B)\n[FILE] titanic-data-science-solutions.ipynb (55.5KB)\ntool: {\"cells\":[{\"source\":\"\\n>Hello and Welcome to Kaggle, the online Data Science Community to learn, share, and compete.

In laymen terms this means, it either occurred or did not occur. For example, you won or did not win, you passed the test or did not pass the test, you were accepted or not accepted, and you get the point. A common business application is churn or customer retention. Another popular use case is, healthcare's mortality rate or survival analysis. Binary events create an interesting dynamic, because we know statistically, a random guess should achieve a 50% accuracy rate, without creating one single algorithm or writing one single line of code. However, just like autocorrect spellcheck technology, sometimes we humans can be too smart for our own good and actually underperform a coin flip. In this kernel, I use Kaggle's Getting Started Competition, Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster, to walk the reader through, how-to use the data science framework to beat the odds.\\n   \\n*What happens when technology is too smart for its own good?*\\n![Funny Autocorrect](http://15858-presscdn-0-65.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/hilarious-autocorrect-fails-20x.jpg)\",\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"metadata\":{\"_cell_guid\":\"ec31d549-537e-4f35-8594-22ef03079081\",\"_uuid\":\"ff6c70c884a8a5fb3258e7f3fefc9e55261df1df\"}},{\"source\":\"<a id=\\\"ch2\\\"></a>\\n# A Data Science Framework\\n1. **Define the Problem:** If data science, big data, machine learning, predictive analytics, business intelligence, or any other buzzword is the solution, then what is the problem? As the saying goes, don't put the cart before the horse. Problems before requirements, requirements before solutions, solutions before design, and design before technology. Too often we are quick to jump on the new shiny technology, tool, or algorithm before determining the actual problem we are trying to solve.\\n2. **Gather the Data:** John Naisbitt wrote in his 1984 (yes, 1984) book Megatrends, we are “drowning in data, yet staving for knowledge.\\\" So, chances are, the dataset(s) already exist somewhere, in some format. It may be external or internal, structured or unstructured, static or streamed, objective or subjective, etc. As the saying goes, you don't have to reinvent the wheel, you just have to know where to find it. In the next step, we will worry about transforming \\\"dirty data\\\" to \\\"clean data.\\\"\\n3. **Prepare Data for Consumption:** This step is often referred to as data wrangling, a required process to turn “wild” data into “manageable” data. Data wrangling includes implementing data architectures for storage and processing, developing data governance standards for quality and control, data extraction (i.e. ETL and web scraping), and data cleaning to identify aberrant, missing, or outlier data points.\\n4. **Perform Exploratory Analysis:** Anybody who has ever worked with data knows, garbage-in, garbage-out (GIGO). Therefore, it is important to deploy descriptive and graphical statistics to look for potential problems, patterns, classifications, correlations and comparisons in the dataset. In addition, data categorization (i.e. qualitative vs quantitative) is also important to understand and select the correct hypothesis test or data model.\\n5. **Model Data:** Like descriptive and inferential statistics, data modeling can either summarize the data or predict future outcomes. Your dataset and expected results, will determine the algorithms available for use. It's important to remember, algorithms are tools and not magical wands or silver bullets. You must still be the master craft (wo)man that knows how-to select the right tool for the job. An analogy would be asking someone to hand you a Philip screwdriver, and they hand you a flathead screwdriver or worst a hammer. At best, it shows a complete lack of understanding. At worst, it makes completing the project impossible. The same is true in data modelling. The wrong model can lead to poor performance at best and the wrong conclusion (that’s used as actionable intelligence) at worst.\\n6. **Validate and Implement Data Model:** After you've trained your model based on a subset of your data, it's time to test your model. This helps ensure you haven't overfit your model or made it so specific to the selected subset, that it does not accurately fit another subset from the same dataset. In this step we determine if our [model overfit, generalize, or underfit our dataset](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/latest/dg/model-fit-underfitting-vs-overfitting.html).\\n7. **Optimize and Strategize:** This is the \\\"bionic man\\\" step, where you iterate back through the process to make it better...stronger...faster than it was before. As a data scientist, your strategy should be to outsource developer operations and application plumbing, so you have more time to focus on recommendations and design. Once you're able to package your ideas, this becomes your “currency exchange\\\" rate.\",\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"metadata\":{\"_cell_guid\":\"8514a868-6816-494a-9e9c-dba14cb36f42\",\"_uuid\":\"bd2a68dcaace0c1371f2994f0204dce65800cc20\"}},{\"source\":\"<a id=\\\"ch3\\\"></a>\\n# Step 1: Define the Problem\\nFor this project, the problem statement is given to us on a golden plater, develop an algorithm to predict the survival outcome of passengers on the Titanic.\\n\\n......\\n\\n**Project Summary:**\\nThe sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.\\n\\nOne of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.\\n\\nIn this challenge, we ask you to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular, we ask you to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.\\n\\nPractice Skills\\n* Binary classification\\n* Python and R basics\\n\\n# Step 2: Gather the Data\\n\\nThe dataset is also given to us on a golden plater with test and train data at [Kaggle's Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)\\n\",\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"metadata\":{\"_cell_guid\":\"22ba49b5-b3b6-4129-8c57-623e0d863ab3\",\"_uuid\":\"ff014109d795c5d1bfcc66c9761730406124ebe4\"}},{\"source\":\"<a id=\\\"ch4\\\"></a>\\n# Step 3: Prepare Data for Consumption\\nSince step 2 was provided to us on a golden plater, so is step 3.

Using the same dataset and different implementation of a decision tree (adaboost, random forest, gradient boost, xgboost, etc.) with tuning does not exceed the 0.77990 submission accuracy. Interesting for this dataset, the simple decision tree algorithm had the best default submission score and with tuning achieved the same best accuracy score.\\n\\nWhile no general conclusions can be made from testing a handful of algorithms on a single dataset, there are several observations on the mentioned dataset. \\n1. The train dataset has a different distribution than the test/validation dataset and population. This created wide margins between the cross validation (CV) accuracy score and Kaggle submission accuracy score.\\n2. Given the same dataset, decision tree based algorithms, seemed to converge on the same accuracy score after proper tuning.\\n3. Despite tuning, no machine learning algorithm, exceeded the homemade algorithm. The author will theorize, that for small datasets, a manmade algorithm is the bar to beat. \\n\\nWith that in mind, for iteration two, I would spend more time on preprocessing and feature engineering. In order to better align the CV score and Kaggle score and improve the overall accuracy.\\n\\n\",\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"metadata\":{\"_cell_guid\":\"a6d34edc-1265-41e8-b163-0b817cd3b6a5\",\"_uuid\":\"c476df95925d67809975caca4ea4dcb4b2a0b277\"}},{\"source\":\"<a id=\\\"ch90\\\"></a>\\n## Change Log:\\n11/22/17 Please note, this kernel is currently in progress, but open to feedback.

It’s your job to predict these outcomes.\\n\\nUsing the patterns you find in the `train.csv` data, predict whether the other 418 passengers on board (found in `test.csv`) survived.\\n\\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data\">“Data” tab</a> to explore the datasets even further. Once you feel you’ve created a competitive model, submit it to Kaggle to see where your model stands on our leaderboard against other Kagglers.\\n\\n## How to Submit your Prediction to Kaggle\\nOnce you’re ready to make a submission and get on the leaderboard:\\n\\n1. Click on the “Submit Predictions” button\\n<img width=\"699\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen1.png\">\\n1. Upload a CSV file in the submission file format.

This is known as <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision#In_binary_classification\">accuracy</a>.</p>\\n<h2>Submission File Format</h2>\\n<p>You should submit a csv file with exactly 418 entries <b>plus</b> a header row. Your submission will show an error if you have extra columns (beyond PassengerId and Survived) or rows.<br><br>The file should have exactly 2 columns:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>PassengerId (sorted in any order)</li>\\n<li>Survived (contains your binary predictions: 1 for survived, 0 for deceased)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<pre><b>PassengerId,Survived</b><br>892,0<br>893,1<br>894,0<br>Etc.</pre>\\n<p>You can download an example submission file (gender_submission.csv) on the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data\">Data page</a>.</p>\\n\\n## data-description\\n\\n<h3>Overview</h3>\\n<p>The data has been split into two groups:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>training set (train.csv)</li>\\n<li>test set (test.csv)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><b> The training set </b>should be used to build your machine learning models. For the training set, we provide the outcome (also known as the “ground truth”) for each passenger. Your model will be based on “features” like passengers’ gender and class. You can also use <a href=\"https://triangleinequality.wordpress.com/2013/09/08/basic-feature-engineering-with-the-titanic-data/\" target=\"_blank\"> feature engineering </a>to create new features.</p>\\n<p><b>The test set </b>should be used to see how well your model performs on unseen data. For the test set, we do not provide the ground truth for each passenger. It is your job to predict these outcomes. For each passenger in the test set, use the model you trained to predict whether or not they survived the sinking of the Titanic.</p>\\n<p>We also include <b>gender_submission.csv</b>, a set of predictions that assume all and only female passengers survive, as an example of what a submission file should look like.</p>\\n<h3>Data Dictionary</h3>\\n<table style=\"width: 100%;\">\\n<tbody>\\n<tr><th><b>Variable</b></th><th><b>Definition</b></th><th><b>Key</b></th></tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>survival</td>\\n<td>Survival</td>\\n<td>0 = No, 1 = Yes</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>pclass</td>\\n<td>Ticket class</td>\\n<td>1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>sex</td>\\n<td>Sex</td>\\n<td></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Age</td>\\n<td>Age in years</td>\\n<td></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>sibsp</td>\\n<td># of siblings / spouses aboard the Titanic</td>\\n<td></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>parch</td>\\n<td># of parents / children aboard the Titanic</td>\\n<td></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>ticket</td>\\n<td>Ticket number</td>\\n<td></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>fare</td>\\n<td>Passenger fare</td>\\n<td></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>cabin</td>\\n<td>Cabin number</td>\\n<td></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>embarked</td>\\n<td>Port of Embarkation</td>\\n<td>C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton</td>\\n</tr>\\n</tbody>\\n</table>\\n<h3>Variable Notes</h3>\\n<p><b>pclass</b>: A proxy for socio-economic status (SES)<br /> 1st = Upper<br /> 2nd = Middle<br /> 3rd = Lower<br /><br /> <b>age</b>: Age is fractional if less than 1.

They are a great place to begin if you are new to data science or just finished a MOOC and want to get involved in Kaggle.</p>\\n<p>Getting Started competitions are a non-competitive way to get familiar with Kaggle’s platform, learn basic machine learning concepts, and start meeting people in the community. They have no cash prize and are on a rolling timeline.</p>\\n<h2>How do I create and manage a team?</h2>\\n<p>When you accept the competition rules, a team will be created for you. You can invite others to your team, accept a merger with another team, and update basic information like team name by going to the More &gt; <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/team\" target=\"_blank\">Team</a> page.</p>\\n<p>We\\'ve heard from many Kagglers that teaming up is the best way to learn new skills AND have fun. If you don\\'t have a teammate already, consider asking if anyone wants to team up in the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a>.</p>\\n<h2>What are Notebooks?</h2>\\n<p>Kaggle Notebooks is a cloud computational environment that enables reproducible and collaborative analysis. Notebooks support scripts in Python and R, Jupyter Notebooks, and RMarkdown reports. You can visit the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/notebooks\" target=\"_blank\">Notebooks</a> tab to view all of the publicly shared code for the Titanic competition. For more on how to use Notebooks to learn data science, check out our <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview\" target=\"&quot;_blank\">Courses</a>!</p>\\n<h2>Why did my team disappear from the leaderboard?</h2>\\n<p>To keep with the spirit of getting-started competitions, we have implemented a two month rolling window on submissions. Once a submission is more than two months old, it will be invalidated and no longer count towards the leaderboard.</p>\\n<p>If your team has no submissions in the previous two months, the team will also drop from the leaderboard. This will keep the leaderboard at a manageable size, freshen it up, and prevent newcomers from getting lost in a sea of abandoned scores.</p>\\n<p><i>\"I worked so hard to get that score! Give it back!\"</i> Read more about our decision to implement a rolling leaderboard <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion/6240\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\\n<h2>How do I contact Support?</h2>\\n<p>Kaggle does not have a dedicated support team so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. (For this competition, you’ll want to use the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">Titanic discussion forum)</a>.</p>\\n<p>Support is only able to help with issues that are being experienced by all participants. Before contacting support, please check the discussion forum for information on your problem. If you can’t find it, you can post your problem in the forum so a fellow participant or a Kaggle team member can provide help. The forums are full of useful information on the data, metric, and different approaches. We encourage you to use the forums often. If you share your knowledge, you\\'ll find that others will share a lot in turn!</p>\\n<p>If your problem persists or it seems to be effective all participants then please <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/contact\" target=\"_blank\">contact us</a>.</p>'}, {'role': 'tool', 'content': 'Not a directory: /home/code/exploration/../research/writeups'}, {'role': 'tool', 'content': '/home/code/exploration/../research/kernels:\\n[DIR]  alexisbcook_exercise-arithmetic-and-variables/\\n[DIR]  alexisbcook_titanic-tutorial/\\n[DIR]  arthurtok_introduction-to-ensembling-stacking-in-python/\\n[DIR]  ldfreeman3_a-data-science-framework-to-achieve-99-accuracy/\\n[FILE] metadata.json (1.7KB)\\n[DIR]  startupsci_titanic-data-science-solutions/'}, {'role': 'tool', 'content': '/home/data:\\n[FILE] description.md (13.6KB)\\n[FILE] gender_submission.csv (3.2KB)\\n[FILE] test.csv (28.0KB)\\n[FILE] train.csv (59.8KB)'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': \"REASONING: This is the classic Titanic survival prediction problem - binary classification with accuracy as the metric.

In laymen terms this means, it either occurred or did not occur. For example, you won or did not win, you passed the test or did not pass the test, you were accepted or not accepted, and you get the point. A common business application is churn or customer retention. Another popular use case is, healthcare\\'s mortality rate or survival analysis. Binary events create an interesting dynamic, because we know statistically, a random guess should achieve a 50% accuracy rate, without creating one single algorithm or writing one single line of code. However, just like autocorrect spellcheck technology, sometimes we humans can be too smart for our own good and actually underperform a coin flip. In this kernel, I use Kaggle\\'s Getting Started Competition, Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster, to walk the reader through, how-to use the data science framework to beat the odds.\\\\n   \\\\n*What happens when technology is too smart for its own good?*\\\\n![Funny Autocorrect](http://15858-presscdn-0-65.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/hilarious-autocorrect-fails-20x.jpg)\",\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"metadata\":{\"_cell_guid\":\"ec31d549-537e-4f35-8594-22ef03079081\",\"_uuid\":\"ff6c70c884a8a5fb3258e7f3fefc9e55261df1df\"}},{\"source\":\"<a id=\\\\\"ch2\\\\\"></a>\\\\n# A Data Science Framework\\\\n1. **Define the Problem:** If data science, big data, machine learning, predictive analytics, business intelligence, or any other buzzword is the solution, then what is the problem? As the saying goes, don\\'t put the cart before the horse. Problems before requirements, requirements before solutions, solutions before design, and design before technology. Too often we are quick to jump on the new shiny technology, tool, or algorithm before determining the actual problem we are trying to solve.\\\\n2. **Gather the Data:** John Naisbitt wrote in his 1984 (yes, 1984) book Megatrends, we are “drowning in data, yet staving for knowledge.\\\\\" So, chances are, the dataset(s) already exist somewhere, in some format. It may be external or internal, structured or unstructured, static or streamed, objective or subjective, etc. As the saying goes, you don\\'t have to reinvent the wheel, you just have to know where to find it. In the next step, we will worry about transforming \\\\\"dirty data\\\\\" to \\\\\"clean data.\\\\\"\\\\n3. **Prepare Data for Consumption:** This step is often referred to as data wrangling, a required process to turn “wild” data into “manageable” data. Data wrangling includes implementing data architectures for storage and processing, developing data governance standards for quality and control, data extraction (i.e. ETL and web scraping), and data cleaning to identify aberrant, missing, or outlier data points.\\\\n4. **Perform Exploratory Analysis:** Anybody who has ever worked with data knows, garbage-in, garbage-out (GIGO). Therefore, it is important to deploy descriptive and graphical statistics to look for potential problems, patterns, classifications, correlations and comparisons in the dataset. In addition, data categorization (i.e. qualitative vs quantitative) is also important to understand and select the correct hypothesis test or data model.\\\\n5. **Model Data:** Like descriptive and inferential statistics, data modeling can either summarize the data or predict future outcomes. Your dataset and expected results, will determine the algorithms available for use. It\\'s important to remember, algorithms are tools and not magical wands or silver bullets. You must still be the master craft (wo)man that knows how-to select the right tool for the job. An analogy would be asking someone to hand you a Philip screwdriver, and they hand you a flathead screwdriver or worst a hammer. At best, it shows a complete lack of understanding. At worst, it makes completing the project impossible. The same is true in data modelling. The wrong model can lead to poor performance at best and the wrong conclusion (that’s used as actionable intelligence) at worst.\\\\n6. **Validate and Implement Data Model:** After you\\'ve trained your model based on a subset of your data, it\\'s time to test your model. This helps ensure you haven\\'t overfit your model or made it so specific to the selected subset, that it does not accurately fit another subset from the same dataset. In this step we determine if our [model overfit, generalize, or underfit our dataset](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/latest/dg/model-fit-underfitting-vs-overfitting.html).\\\\n7. **Optimize and Strategize:** This is the \\\\\"bionic man\\\\\" step, where you iterate back through the process to make it better...stronger...faster than it was before. As a data scientist, your strategy should be to outsource developer operations and application plumbing, so you have more time to focus on recommendations and design. Once you\\'re able to package your ideas, this becomes your “currency exchange\\\\\" rate.\",\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"metadata\":{\"_cell_guid\":\"8514a868-6816-494a-9e9c-dba14cb36f42\",\"_uuid\":\"bd2a68dcaace0c1371f2994f0204dce65800cc20\"}},{\"source\":\"<a id=\\\\\"ch3\\\\\"></a>\\\\n# Step 1: Define the Problem\\\\nFor this project, the problem statement is given to us on a golden plater, develop an algorithm to predict the survival outcome of passengers on the Titanic.\\\\n\\\\n......\\\\n\\\\n**Project Summary:**\\\\nThe sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.\\\\n\\\\nOne of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.\\\\n\\\\nIn this challenge, we ask you to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular, we ask you to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.\\\\n\\\\nPractice Skills\\\\n* Binary classification\\\\n* Python and R basics\\\\n\\\\n# Step 2: Gather the Data\\\\n\\\\nThe dataset is also given to us on a golden plater with test and train data at [Kaggle\\'s Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)\\\\n\",\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"metadata\":{\"_cell_guid\":\"22ba49b5-b3b6-4129-8c57-623e0d863ab3\",\"_uuid\":\"ff014109d795c5d1bfcc66c9761730406124ebe4\"}},{\"source\":\"<a id=\\\\\"ch4\\\\\"></a>\\\\n# Step 3: Prepare Data for Consumption\\\\nSince step 2 was provided to us on a golden plater, so is step 3.

Using the same dataset and different implementation of a decision tree (adaboost, random forest, gradient boost, xgboost, etc.) with tuning does not exceed the 0.77990 submission accuracy. Interesting for this dataset, the simple decision tree algorithm had the best default submission score and with tuning achieved the same best accuracy score.\\\\n\\\\nWhile no general conclusions can be made from testing a handful of algorithms on a single dataset, there are several observations on the mentioned dataset. \\\\n1. The train dataset has a different distribution than the test/validation dataset and population. This created wide margins between the cross validation (CV) accuracy score and Kaggle submission accuracy score.\\\\n2. Given the same dataset, decision tree based algorithms, seemed to converge on the same accuracy score after proper tuning.\\\\n3. Despite tuning, no machine learning algorithm, exceeded the homemade algorithm. The author will theorize, that for small datasets, a manmade algorithm is the bar to beat. \\\\n\\\\nWith that in mind, for iteration two, I would spend more time on preprocessing and feature engineering.

In a nutshell stacking uses as a first-level (base), the predictions of a few basic classifiers and then uses another model at the second-level to predict the output from the earlier first-level predictions.\\\\n\\\\nThe Titanic dataset is a prime candidate for introducing this concept as many newcomers to Kaggle start out here. Furthermore even though stacking has been responsible for many a team winning Kaggle competitions there seems to be a dearth of kernels on this topic so I hope this notebook can fill somewhat of that void.\\\\n\\\\nI myself am quite a newcomer to the Kaggle scene as well and the first proper ensembling/stacking script that I managed to chance upon and study was one written in the AllState Severity Claims competition by the great Faron. The material in this notebook borrows heavily from Faron's script although ported to factor in ensembles of classifiers whilst his was ensembles of regressors. Anyway please check out his script here:\\\\n\\\\n[Stacking Starter][1] : by Faron \\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNow onto the notebook at hand and I hope that it manages to do justice and convey the concept of ensembling in an intuitive and concise manner.  My other standalone Kaggle [script][2] which implements exactly the same ensembling steps (albeit with different parameters) discussed below gives a Public LB score of 0.808 which is good enough to get to the top 9% and runs just under 4 minutes. Therefore I am pretty sure there is a lot of room to improve and add on to that script. Anyways please feel free to leave me any comments with regards to how I can improve\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n  [1]: https://www.kaggle.com/mmueller/allstate-claims-severity/stacking-starter/run/390867\\\\n  [2]: https://www.kaggle.com/arthurtok/titanic/simple-stacking-with-xgboost-0-808\\\"},{\\\"metadata\\\":{\\\"_execution_state\\\":\\\"idle\\\",\\\"_cell_guid\\\":\\\"14630296-b1aa-759e-bafa-b6a73f3896ed\\\",\\\"_uuid\\\":\\\"2e37a274400cfeb472b6405d524325245588dd66\\\",\\\"trusted\\\":true},\\\"cell_type\\\":\\\"code\\\",\\\"source\\\":\\\"# Load in our libraries\\\\nimport pandas as pd\\\\nimport numpy as np\\\\nimport re\\\\nimport sklearn\\\\nimport xgboost as xgb\\\\nimport seaborn as sns\\\\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\\\\n%matplotlib inline\\\\n\\\\nimport plotly.offline as py\\\\npy.init_notebook_mode(connected=True)\\\\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\\\\nimport plotly.tools as tls\\\\n\\\\nimport warnings\\\\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\\\\n\\\\n# Going to use these 5 base models for the stacking\\\\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import (RandomForestClassifier, AdaBoostClassifier, \\\\n                              GradientBoostingClassifier, ExtraTreesClassifier)\\\\nfrom sklearn.svm import SVC\\\\nfrom sklearn.cross_validation import KFold\\\",\\\"execution_count\\\":1,\\\"outputs\\\":[]},{\\\"metadata\\\":{\\\"_uuid\\\":\\\"8b590aafe06a2ac55daae9d2456155e457914f5f\\\",\\\"_cell_guid\\\":\\\"d647b74c-099b-851a-dcd2-3a58c9e8f10c\\\"},\\\"cell_type\\\":\\\"markdown\\\",\\\"source\\\":\\\"# Feature Exploration, Engineering and Cleaning \\\\n\\\\nNow we will proceed much like how most kernels in general are structured, and that is to first explore the data on hand, identify possible feature engineering opportunities as well as numerically encode any categorical features.\\\"},{\\\"metadata\\\":{\\\"_execution_state\\\":\\\"idle\\\",\\\"_cell_guid\\\":\\\"5937fd72-d1ad-f678-cc82-f08a96e4cad0\\\",\\\"_uuid\\\":\\\"b2ad78041b69ce13d1f41bd9bc8c93cafaf7b8ac\\\",\\\"trusted\\\":true},\\\"cell_type\\\":\\\"code\\\",\\\"source\\\":\\\"# Load in the train and test datasets\\\\ntrain = pd.read_csv('../input/train.csv')\\\\ntest = pd.read_csv('../input/test.csv')\\\\n\\\\n# Store our passenger ID for easy access\\\\nPassengerId = test['PassengerId']\\\\n\\\\ntrain.head(3)\\\",\\\"execution_count\\\":2,\\\"outputs\\\":[]},{\\\"metadata\\\":{\\\"_uuid\\\":\\\"81378834770e55c76751347588322fe32acf5737\\\",\\\"_cell_guid\\\":\\\"dff1c1dd-1e59-3907-88fa-1a1d699122be\\\"},\\\"cell_type\\\":\\\"markdown\\\",\\\"source\\\":\\\"Well it is no surprise that our task is to somehow extract the information out of the categorical variables \\\\n\\\\n**Feature Engineering**\\\\n\\\\nHere, credit must be extended to Sina's very comprehensive and well-thought out notebook for the feature engineering ideas so please check out his work \\\\n\\\\n[Titanic Best Working Classfier][1] : by Sina\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n  [1]: https://www.kaggle.com/sinakhorami/titanic/titanic-best-working-classifier\\\"},{\\\"metadata\\\":{\\\"collapsed\\\":true,\\\"_execution_state\\\":\\\"idle\\\",\\\"_cell_guid\\\":\\\"e85b2a80-88a4-928f-f2b2-24895dea38f3\\\",\\\"_uuid\\\":\\\"b1c67249f91768ce8e5e2751364d32c87446cf55\\\",\\\"trusted\\\":true},\\\"cell_type\\\":\\\"code\\\",\\\"source\\\":\\\"full_data = [train, test]\\\\n\\\\n# Some features of my own that I have added in\\\\n# Gives the length of the name\\\\ntrain['Name_length'] = train['Name'].apply(len)\\\\ntest['Name_length'] = test['Name'].apply(len)\\\\n# Feature that tells whether a passenger had a cabin on the Titanic\\\\ntrain['Has_Cabin'] = train[\\\\\\\"Cabin\\\\\\\"].apply(lambda x: 0 if type(x) == float else 1)\\\\ntest['Has_Cabin'] = test[\\\\\\\"Cabin\\\\\\\"].apply(lambda x: 0 if type(x) == float else 1)\\\\n\\\\n# Feature engineering steps taken from Sina\\\\n# Create new feature FamilySize as a combination of SibSp and Parch\\\\nfor dataset in full_data:\\\\n    dataset['FamilySize'] = dataset['SibSp'] + dataset['Parch'] + 1\\\\n# Create new feature IsAlone from FamilySize\\\\nfor dataset in full_data:\\\\n    dataset['IsAlone'] = 0\\\\n    dataset.loc[dataset['FamilySize'] == 1, 'IsAlone'] = 1\\\\n# Remove all NULLS in the Embarked column\\\\nfor dataset in full_data:\\\\n    dataset['Embarked'] = dataset['Embarked'].fillna('S')\\\\n# Remove all NULLS in the Fare column and create a new feature CategoricalFare\\\\nfor dataset in full_data:\\\\n    dataset['Fare'] = dataset['Fare'].fillna(train['Fare'].median())\\\\ntrain['CategoricalFare'] = pd.qcut(train['Fare'], 4)\\\\n# Create a New feature CategoricalAge\\\\nfor dataset in full_data:\\\\n    age_avg = dataset['Age'].mean()\\\\n    age_std = dataset['Age'].std()\\\\n    age_null_count = dataset['Age'].isnull().sum()\\\\n    age_null_random_list = np.random.randint(age_avg -

Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.\n\nWhile there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.\n\nIn this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).\n\n> #### Recommended Tutorial\n> We highly recommend [Alexis Cook’s Titanic Tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/titanic-tutorial) that walks you through making your very first submission step by step and [this starter notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/gusthema/titanic-competition-w-tensorflow-decision-forests) to get started.\n\n## How Kaggle’s Competitions Work\n1. **Join the Competition**\nRead about the challenge description, accept the Competition Rules and gain access to the competition dataset.\n1.  **Get to Work**\nDownload the data, build models on it locally or on Kaggle Notebooks (our no-setup, customizable Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs) and generate a prediction file.\n1.  **Make a Submission**\nUpload your prediction as a submission on Kaggle and receive an accuracy score.\n1.  **Check the Leaderboard**\nSee how your model ranks against other Kagglers on our leaderboard. \n1.  **Improve Your Score**\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a> to find lots of tutorials and insights from other competitors.\n\n> #### Kaggle Lingo Video\n> You may run into unfamiliar lingo as you dig into the Kaggle discussion forums and public notebooks. Check out  Dr. Rachael Tatman’s [video on Kaggle Lingo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEJHyuWKd-s) to get up to speed!\n\n## What Data Will I Use in This Competition?\nIn this competition, you’ll gain access to two similar datasets that include passenger information like name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc. One dataset is titled `train.csv` and the other is titled `test.csv`.\n\n`Train.csv` will contain the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 to be exact) and importantly, will reveal whether they survived or not, also known as the “ground truth”.\n\nThe `test.csv` dataset contains similar information but does not disclose the “ground truth” for each passenger. It’s your job to predict these outcomes.\n\nUsing the patterns you find in the `train.csv` data, predict whether the other 418 passengers on board (found in `test.csv`) survived.\n\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data\">“Data” tab</a> to explore the datasets even further. Once you feel you’ve created a competitive model, submit it to Kaggle to see where your model stands on our leaderboard against other Kagglers.\n\n## How to Submit your Prediction to Kaggle\nOnce you’re ready to make a submission and get on the leaderboard:\n\n1. Click on the “Submit Predictions” button\n<img width=\"699\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen1.png\">\n1. Upload a CSV file in the submission file format. You’re able to submit 10 submissions a day.\n<img width=\"699\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen2.png\">\n\n## Submission File Format:\nYou should submit a csv file with exactly 418 entries plus a header row. Your submission will show an error if you have extra columns (beyond `PassengerId` and `Survived`) or rows.\n\nThe file should have exactly 2 columns:\n- `PassengerId` (sorted in any order)\n- `Survived` (contains your binary predictions: 1 for survived, 0 for deceased)\n\n## Got it! I’m ready to get started. Where do I get help if I need it?\n- For Competition Help: <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\">Titanic Discussion Forum</a>\n\nKaggle doesn’t have a dedicated team to help troubleshoot your code so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. The forums are full of useful information on the data, metric, and different approaches. We encourage you to use the forums often. If you share your knowledge, you'll find that others will share a lot in turn!\n\n## A Last Word on Kaggle Notebooks\nAs we mentioned before, Kaggle Notebooks is our no-setup, customizable, Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs and a huge repository of community published data &amp; code.\n\nIn every competition, you’ll find many Notebooks shared with incredible insights. It’s an invaluable resource worth becoming familiar with. Check out this competition’s Notebooks <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/notebooks\">here</a>.\n\n## 🏃‍♀Ready to Compete? <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/account/login?returnUrl=%2Fc%2Ftitanic\">Join the Competition Here!</a>\n\n## Evaluation\n\n<h2>Goal</h2>\n<p>It is your job to predict if a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic or not. <br>For each  in the test set, you must predict a 0 or 1 value for the  variable.</p>\n<h2>Metric</h2>\n<p>Your score is the percentage of passengers you correctly predict.

They are a great place to begin if you are new to data science or just finished a MOOC and want to get involved in Kaggle.</p>\n<p>Getting Started competitions are a non-competitive way to get familiar with Kaggle’s platform, learn basic machine learning concepts, and start meeting people in the community. They have no cash prize and are on a rolling timeline.</p>\n<h2>How do I create and manage a team?</h2>\n<p>When you accept the competition rules, a team will be created for you. You can invite others to your team, accept a merger with another team, and update basic information like team name by going to the More &gt; <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/team\" target=\"_blank\">Team</a> page.</p>\n<p>We've heard from many Kagglers that teaming up is the best way to learn new skills AND have fun. If you don't have a teammate already, consider asking if anyone wants to team up in the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a>.</p>\n<h2>What are Notebooks?</h2>\n<p>Kaggle Notebooks is a cloud computational environment that enables reproducible and collaborative analysis. Notebooks support scripts in Python and R, Jupyter Notebooks, and RMarkdown reports. You can visit the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/notebooks\" target=\"_blank\">Notebooks</a> tab to view all of the publicly shared code for the Titanic competition. For more on how to use Notebooks to learn data science, check out our <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview\" target=\"&quot;_blank\">Courses</a>!</p>\n<h2>Why did my team disappear from the leaderboard?</h2>\n<p>To keep with the spirit of getting-started competitions, we have implemented a two month rolling window on submissions. Once a submission is more than two months old, it will be invalidated and no longer count towards the leaderboard.</p>\n<p>If your team has no submissions in the previous two months, the team will also drop from the leaderboard. This will keep the leaderboard at a manageable size, freshen it up, and prevent newcomers from getting lost in a sea of abandoned scores.</p>\n<p><i>\"I worked so hard to get that score! Give it back!\"</i> Read more about our decision to implement a rolling leaderboard <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion/6240\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n<h2>How do I contact Support?</h2>\n<p>Kaggle does not have a dedicated support team so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. (For this competition, you’ll want to use the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">Titanic discussion forum)</a>.</p>\n<p>Support is only able to help with issues that are being experienced by all participants. Before contacting support, please check the discussion forum for information on your problem. If you can’t find it, you can post your problem in the forum so a fellow participant or a Kaggle team member can provide help.

In laymen terms this means, it either occurred or did not occur. For example, you won or did not win, you passed the test or did not pass the test, you were accepted or not accepted, and you get the point. A common business application is churn or customer retention. Another popular use case is, healthcare's mortality rate or survival analysis. Binary events create an interesting dynamic, because we know statistically, a random guess should achieve a 50% accuracy rate, without creating one single algorithm or writing one single line of code. However, just like autocorrect spellcheck technology, sometimes we humans can be too smart for our own good and actually underperform a coin flip. In this kernel, I use Kaggle's Getting Started Competition, Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster, to walk the reader through, how-to use the data science framework to beat the odds.\\n   \\n*What happens when technology is too smart for its own good?*\\n![Funny Autocorrect](http://15858-presscdn-0-65.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/hilarious-autocorrect-fails-20x.jpg)\",\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"metadata\":{\"_cell_guid\":\"ec31d549-537e-4f35-8594-22ef03079081\",\"_uuid\":\"ff6c70c884a8a5fb3258e7f3fefc9e55261df1df\"}},{\"source\":\"<a id=\\\"ch2\\\"></a>\\n# A Data Science Framework\\n1. **Define the Problem:** If data science, big data, machine learning, predictive analytics, business intelligence, or any other buzzword is the solution, then what is the problem? As the saying goes, don't put the cart before the horse. Problems before requirements, requirements before solutions, solutions before design, and design before technology. Too often we are quick to jump on the new shiny technology, tool, or algorithm before determining the actual problem we are trying to solve.\\n2. **Gather the Data:** John Naisbitt wrote in his 1984 (yes, 1984) book Megatrends, we are “drowning in data, yet staving for knowledge.\\\" So, chances are, the dataset(s) already exist somewhere, in some format. It may be external or internal, structured or unstructured, static or streamed, objective or subjective, etc. As the saying goes, you don't have to reinvent the wheel, you just have to know where to find it. In the next step, we will worry about transforming \\\"dirty data\\\" to \\\"clean data.\\\"\\n3. **Prepare Data for Consumption:** This step is often referred to as data wrangling, a required process to turn “wild” data into “manageable” data. Data wrangling includes implementing data architectures for storage and processing, developing data governance standards for quality and control, data extraction (i.e. ETL and web scraping), and data cleaning to identify aberrant, missing, or outlier data points.\\n4. **Perform Exploratory Analysis:** Anybody who has ever worked with data knows, garbage-in, garbage-out (GIGO). Therefore, it is important to deploy descriptive and graphical statistics to look for potential problems, patterns, classifications, correlations and comparisons in the dataset. In addition, data categorization (i.e. qualitative vs quantitative) is also important to understand and select the correct hypothesis test or data model.\\n5. **Model Data:** Like descriptive and inferential statistics, data modeling can either summarize the data or predict future outcomes. Your dataset and expected results, will determine the algorithms available for use. It's important to remember, algorithms are tools and not magical wands or silver bullets. You must still be the master craft (wo)man that knows how-to select the right tool for the job. An analogy would be asking someone to hand you a Philip screwdriver, and they hand you a flathead screwdriver or worst a hammer. At best, it shows a complete lack of understanding. At worst, it makes completing the project impossible. The same is true in data modelling. The wrong model can lead to poor performance at best and the wrong conclusion (that’s used as actionable intelligence) at worst.\\n6. **Validate and Implement Data Model:** After you've trained your model based on a subset of your data, it's time to test your model. This helps ensure you haven't overfit your model or made it so specific to the selected subset, that it does not accurately fit another subset from the same dataset. In this step we determine if our [model overfit, generalize, or underfit our dataset](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/latest/dg/model-fit-underfitting-vs-overfitting.html).\\n7. **Optimize and Strategize:** This is the \\\"bionic man\\\" step, where you iterate back through the process to make it better...stronger...faster than it was before. As a data scientist, your strategy should be to outsource developer operations and application plumbing, so you have more time to focus on recommendations and design. Once you're able to package your ideas, this becomes your “currency exchange\\\" rate.\",\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"metadata\":{\"_cell_guid\":\"8514a868-6816-494a-9e9c-dba14cb36f42\",\"_uuid\":\"bd2a68dcaace0c1371f2994f0204dce65800cc20\"}},{\"source\":\"<a id=\\\"ch3\\\"></a>\\n# Step 1: Define the Problem\\nFor this project, the problem statement is given to us on a golden plater, develop an algorithm to predict the survival outcome of passengers on the Titanic.\\n\\n......\\n\\n**Project Summary:**\\nThe sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.\\n\\nOne of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.\\n\\nIn this challenge, we ask you to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive.

Using the same dataset and different implementation of a decision tree (adaboost, random forest, gradient boost, xgboost, etc.) with tuning does not exceed the 0.77990 submission accuracy. Interesting for this dataset, the simple decision tree algorithm had the best default submission score and with tuning achieved the same best accuracy score.\\n\\nWhile no general conclusions can be made from testing a handful of algorithms on a single dataset, there are several observations on the mentioned dataset. \\n1. The train dataset has a different distribution than the test/validation dataset and population. This created wide margins between the cross validation (CV) accuracy score and Kaggle submission accuracy score.\\n2. Given the same dataset, decision tree based algorithms, seemed to converge on the same accuracy score after proper tuning.\\n3. Despite tuning, no machine learning algorithm, exceeded the homemade algorithm. The author will theorize, that for small datasets, a manmade algorithm is the bar to beat. \\n\\nWith that in mind, for iteration two, I would spend more time on preprocessing and feature engineering. In order to better align the CV score and Kaggle score and improve the overall accuracy.\\n\\n\",\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"metadata\":{\"_cell_guid\":\"a6d34edc-1265-41e8-b163-0b817cd3b6a5\",\"_uuid\":\"c476df95925d67809975caca4ea4dcb4b2a0b277\"}},{\"source\":\"<a id=\\\"ch90\\\"></a>\\n## Change Log:\\n11/22/17 Please note, this kernel is currently in progress, but open to feedback.

In a nutshell stacking uses as a first-level (base), the predictions of a few basic classifiers and then uses another model at the second-level to predict the output from the earlier first-level predictions.\\n\\nThe Titanic dataset is a prime candidate for introducing this concept as many newcomers to Kaggle start out here. Furthermore even though stacking has been responsible for many a team winning Kaggle competitions there seems to be a dearth of kernels on this topic so I hope this notebook can fill somewhat of that void.\\n\\nI myself am quite a newcomer to the Kaggle scene as well and the first proper ensembling/stacking script that I managed to chance upon and study was one written in the AllState Severity Claims competition by the great Faron. The material in this notebook borrows heavily from Faron's script although ported to factor in ensembles of classifiers whilst his was ensembles of regressors. Anyway please check out his script here:\\n\\n[Stacking Starter][1] : by Faron \\n\\n\\nNow onto the notebook at hand and I hope that it manages to do justice and convey the concept of ensembling in an intuitive and concise manner.  My other standalone Kaggle [script][2] which implements exactly the same ensembling steps (albeit with different parameters) discussed below gives a Public LB score of 0.808 which is good enough to get to the top 9% and runs just under 4 minutes. Therefore I am pretty sure there is a lot of room to improve and add on to that script. Anyways please feel free to leave me any comments with regards to how I can improve\\n\\n\\n  [1]: https://www.kaggle.com/mmueller/allstate-claims-severity/stacking-starter/run/390867\\n  [2]: https://www.kaggle.com/arthurtok/titanic/simple-stacking-with-xgboost-0-808\"},{\"metadata\":{\"_execution_state\":\"idle\",\"_cell_guid\":\"14630296-b1aa-759e-bafa-b6a73f3896ed\",\"_uuid\":\"2e37a274400cfeb472b6405d524325245588dd66\",\"trusted\":true},\"cell_type\":\"code\",\"source\":\"# Load in our libraries\\nimport pandas as pd\\nimport numpy as np\\nimport re\\nimport sklearn\\nimport xgboost as xgb\\nimport seaborn as sns\\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\\n%matplotlib inline\\n\\nimport plotly.offline as py\\npy.init_notebook_mode(connected=True)\\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\\nimport plotly.tools as tls\\n\\nimport warnings\\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\\n\\n# Going to use these 5 base models for the stacking\\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import (RandomForestClassifier, AdaBoostClassifier, \\n                              GradientBoostingClassifier, ExtraTreesClassifier)\\nfrom sklearn.svm import SVC\\nfrom sklearn.cross_validation import KFold\",\"execution_count\":1,\"outputs\":[]},{\"metadata\":{\"_uuid\":\"8b590aafe06a2ac55daae9d2456155e457914f5f\",\"_cell_guid\":\"d647b74c-099b-851a-dcd2-3a58c9e8f10c\"},\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"source\":\"# Feature Exploration, Engineering and Cleaning \\n\\nNow we will proceed much like how most kernels in general are structured, and that is to first explore the data on hand, identify possible feature engineering opportunities as well as numerically encode any categorical features.\"},{\"metadata\":{\"_execution_state\":\"idle\",\"_cell_guid\":\"5937fd72-d1ad-f678-cc82-f08a96e4cad0\",\"_uuid\":\"b2ad78041b69ce13d1f41bd9bc8c93cafaf7b8ac\",\"trusted\":true},\"cell_type\":\"code\",\"source\":\"# Load in the train and test datasets\\ntrain = pd.read_csv('../input/train.csv')\\ntest = pd.read_csv('../input/test.csv')\\n\\n# Store our passenger ID for easy access\\nPassengerId = test['PassengerId']\\n\\ntrain.head(3)\",\"execution_count\":2,\"outputs\":[]},{\"metadata\":{\"_uuid\":\"81378834770e55c76751347588322fe32acf5737\",\"_cell_guid\":\"dff1c1dd-1e59-3907-88fa-1a1d699122be\"},\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"source\":\"Well it is no surprise that our task is to somehow extract the information out of the categorical variables \\n\\n**Feature Engineering**\\n\\nHere, credit must be extended to Sina's very comprehensive and well-thought out notebook for the feature engineering ideas so please check out his work \\n\\n[Titanic Best Working Classfier][1] : by Sina\\n\\n\\n  [1]: https://www.kaggle.com/sinakhorami/titanic/titanic-best-working-classifier\"},{\"metadata\":{\"collapsed\":true,\"_execution_state\":\"idle\",\"_cell_guid\":\"e85b2a80-88a4-928f-f2b2-24895dea38f3\",\"_uuid\":\"b1c67249f91768ce8e5e2751364d32c87446cf55\",\"trusted\":true},\"cell_type\":\"code\",\"source\":\"full_data = [train, test]\\n\\n# Some features of my own that I have added in\\n# Gives the length of the name\\ntrain['Name_length'] = train['Name'].apply(len)\\ntest['Name_length'] = test['Name'].apply(len)\\n# Feature that tells whether a passenger had a cabin on the Titanic\\ntrain['Has_Cabin'] = train[\\\"Cabin\\\"].apply(lambda x: 0 if type(x) == float else 1)\\ntest['Has_Cabin'] = test[\\\"Cabin\\\"].apply(lambda x: 0 if type(x) == float else 1)\\n\\n# Feature engineering steps taken from Sina\\n# Create new feature FamilySize as a combination of SibSp and Parch\\nfor dataset in full_data:\\n    dataset['FamilySize'] = dataset['SibSp'] + dataset['Parch'] + 1\\n# Create new feature IsAlone from FamilySize\\nfor dataset in full_data:\\n    dataset['IsAlone'] = 0\\n    dataset.loc[dataset['FamilySize'] == 1, 'IsAlone'] = 1\\n# Remove all NULLS in the Embarked column\\nfor dataset in full_data:\\n    dataset['Embarked'] = dataset['Embarked'].fillna('S')\\n# Remove all NULLS in the Fare column and create a new feature CategoricalFare\\nfor dataset in full_data:\\n    dataset['Fare'] = dataset['Fare'].fillna(train['Fare'].median())\\ntrain['CategoricalFare'] = pd.qcut(train['Fare'], 4)\\n# Create a New feature CategoricalAge\\nfor dataset in full_data:\\n    age_avg = dataset['Age'].mean()\\n    age_std = dataset['Age'].std()\\n    age_null_count = dataset['Age'].isnull().sum()\\n    age_null_random_list = np.random.randint(age_avg -

Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.\\n\\nWhile there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.\\n\\nIn this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).\\n\\n> #### Recommended Tutorial\\n> We highly recommend [Alexis Cook’s Titanic Tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/titanic-tutorial) that walks you through making your very first submission step by step and [this starter notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/gusthema/titanic-competition-w-tensorflow-decision-forests) to get started.\\n\\n## How Kaggle’s Competitions Work\\n1. **Join the Competition**\\nRead about the challenge description, accept the Competition Rules and gain access to the competition dataset.\\n1.  **Get to Work**\\nDownload the data, build models on it locally or on Kaggle Notebooks (our no-setup, customizable Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs) and generate a prediction file.\\n1.  **Make a Submission**\\nUpload your prediction as a submission on Kaggle and receive an accuracy score.\\n1.  **Check the Leaderboard**\\nSee how your model ranks against other Kagglers on our leaderboard. \\n1.  **Improve Your Score**\\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a> to find lots of tutorials and insights from other competitors.\\n\\n> #### Kaggle Lingo Video\\n> You may run into unfamiliar lingo as you dig into the Kaggle discussion forums and public notebooks. Check out  Dr. Rachael Tatman’s [video on Kaggle Lingo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEJHyuWKd-s) to get up to speed!\\n\\n## What Data Will I Use in This Competition?\\nIn this competition, you’ll gain access to two similar datasets that include passenger information like name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc. One dataset is titled `train.csv` and the other is titled `test.csv`.\\n\\n`Train.csv` will contain the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 to be exact) and importantly, will reveal whether they survived or not, also known as the “ground truth”.\\n\\nThe `test.csv` dataset contains similar information but does not disclose the “ground truth” for each passenger. It’s your job to predict these outcomes.\\n\\nUsing the patterns you find in the `train.csv` data, predict whether the other 418 passengers on board (found in `test.csv`) survived.\\n\\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data\">“Data” tab</a> to explore the datasets even further. Once you feel you’ve created a competitive model, submit it to Kaggle to see where your model stands on our leaderboard against other Kagglers.\\n\\n## How to Submit your Prediction to Kaggle\\nOnce you’re ready to make a submission and get on the leaderboard:\\n\\n1. Click on the “Submit Predictions” button\\n<img width=\"699\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen1.png\">\\n1. Upload a CSV file in the submission file format. You’re able to submit 10 submissions a day.\\n<img width=\"699\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen2.png\">\\n\\n## Submission File Format:\\nYou should submit a csv file with exactly 418 entries plus a header row. Your submission will show an error if you have extra columns (beyond `PassengerId` and `Survived`) or rows.\\n\\nThe file should have exactly 2 columns:\\n- `PassengerId` (sorted in any order)\\n- `Survived` (contains your binary predictions: 1 for survived, 0 for deceased)\\n\\n## Got it! I’m ready to get started. Where do I get help if I need it?\\n- For Competition Help: <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\">Titanic Discussion Forum</a>\\n\\nKaggle doesn’t have a dedicated team to help troubleshoot your code so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. The forums are full of useful information on the data, metric, and different approaches. We encourage you to use the forums often. If you share your knowledge, you\\'ll find that others will share a lot in turn!\\n\\n## A Last Word on Kaggle Notebooks\\nAs we mentioned before, Kaggle Notebooks is our no-setup, customizable, Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs and a huge repository of community published data &amp; code.\\n\\nIn every competition, you’ll find many Notebooks shared with incredible insights. It’s an invaluable resource worth becoming familiar with. Check out this competition’s Notebooks <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/notebooks\">here</a>.\\n\\n## 🏃\\u200d♀Ready to Compete? <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/account/login?returnUrl=%2Fc%2Ftitanic\">Join the Competition Here!</a>\\n\\n## Evaluation\\n\\n<h2>Goal</h2>\\n<p>It is your job to predict if a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic or not. <br>For each  in the test set, you must predict a 0 or 1 value for the  variable.</p>\\n<h2>Metric</h2>\\n<p>Your score is the percentage of passengers you correctly predict.

They are a great place to begin if you are new to data science or just finished a MOOC and want to get involved in Kaggle.</p>\\n<p>Getting Started competitions are a non-competitive way to get familiar with Kaggle’s platform, learn basic machine learning concepts, and start meeting people in the community. They have no cash prize and are on a rolling timeline.</p>\\n<h2>How do I create and manage a team?</h2>\\n<p>When you accept the competition rules, a team will be created for you. You can invite others to your team, accept a merger with another team, and update basic information like team name by going to the More &gt; <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/team\" target=\"_blank\">Team</a> page.</p>\\n<p>We\\'ve heard from many Kagglers that teaming up is the best way to learn new skills AND have fun. If you don\\'t have a teammate already, consider asking if anyone wants to team up in the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a>.</p>\\n<h2>What are Notebooks?</h2>\\n<p>Kaggle Notebooks is a cloud computational environment that enables reproducible and collaborative analysis. Notebooks support scripts in Python and R, Jupyter Notebooks, and RMarkdown reports. You can visit the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/notebooks\" target=\"_blank\">Notebooks</a> tab to view all of the publicly shared code for the Titanic competition. For more on how to use Notebooks to learn data science, check out our <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview\" target=\"&quot;_blank\">Courses</a>!</p>\\n<h2>Why did my team disappear from the leaderboard?</h2>\\n<p>To keep with the spirit of getting-started competitions, we have implemented a two month rolling window on submissions. Once a submission is more than two months old, it will be invalidated and no longer count towards the leaderboard.</p>\\n<p>If your team has no submissions in the previous two months, the team will also drop from the leaderboard. This will keep the leaderboard at a manageable size, freshen it up, and prevent newcomers from getting lost in a sea of abandoned scores.</p>\\n<p><i>\"I worked so hard to get that score! Give it back!\"</i> Read more about our decision to implement a rolling leaderboard <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion/6240\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\\n<h2>How do I contact Support?</h2>\\n<p>Kaggle does not have a dedicated support team so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. (For this competition, you’ll want to use the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">Titanic discussion forum)</a>.</p>\\n<p>Support is only able to help with issues that are being experienced by all participants. Before contacting support, please check the discussion forum for information on your problem. If you can’t find it, you can post your problem in the forum so a fellow participant or a Kaggle team member can provide help. The forums are full of useful information on the data, metric, and different approaches. We encourage you to use the forums often. If you share your knowledge, you\\'ll find that others will share a lot in turn!</p>\\n<p>If your problem persists or it seems to be effective all participants then please <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/contact\" target=\"_blank\">contact us</a>.</p>'}, {'role': 'tool', 'content': 'Not a directory: /home/code/exploration/../research/writeups'}, {'role': 'tool', 'content': '/home/code/exploration/../research/kernels:\\n[DIR]  alexisbcook_exercise-arithmetic-and-variables/\\n[DIR]  alexisbcook_titanic-tutorial/\\n[DIR]  arthurtok_introduction-to-ensembling-stacking-in-python/\\n[DIR]  ldfreeman3_a-data-science-framework-to-achieve-99-accuracy/\\n[FILE] metadata.json (1.7KB)\\n[DIR]  startupsci_titanic-data-science-solutions/'}, {'role': 'tool', 'content': '/home/data:\\n[FILE] description.md (13.6KB)\\n[FILE] gender_submission.csv (3.2KB)\\n[FILE] test.csv (28.0KB)\\n[FILE] train.csv (59.8KB)'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': \"REASONING: This is the classic Titanic survival prediction problem - binary classification with accuracy as the metric.

In laymen terms this means, it either occurred or did not occur. For example, you won or did not win, you passed the test or did not pass the test, you were accepted or not accepted, and you get the point. A common business application is churn or customer retention. Another popular use case is, healthcare\\'s mortality rate or survival analysis. Binary events create an interesting dynamic, because we know statistically, a random guess should achieve a 50% accuracy rate, without creating one single algorithm or writing one single line of code. However, just like autocorrect spellcheck technology, sometimes we humans can be too smart for our own good and actually underperform a coin flip. In this kernel, I use Kaggle\\'s Getting Started Competition, Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster, to walk the reader through, how-to use the data science framework to beat the odds.\\\\n   \\\\n*What happens when technology is too smart for its own good?*\\\\n![Funny Autocorrect](http://15858-presscdn-0-65.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/hilarious-autocorrect-fails-20x.jpg)\",\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"metadata\":{\"_cell_guid\":\"ec31d549-537e-4f35-8594-22ef03079081\",\"_uuid\":\"ff6c70c884a8a5fb3258e7f3fefc9e55261df1df\"}},{\"source\":\"<a id=\\\\\"ch2\\\\\"></a>\\\\n# A Data Science Framework\\\\n1. **Define the Problem:** If data science, big data, machine learning, predictive analytics, business intelligence, or any other buzzword is the solution, then what is the problem? As the saying goes, don\\'t put the cart before the horse. Problems before requirements, requirements before solutions, solutions before design, and design before technology. Too often we are quick to jump on the new shiny technology, tool, or algorithm before determining the actual problem we are trying to solve.\\\\n2. **Gather the Data:** John Naisbitt wrote in his 1984 (yes, 1984) book Megatrends, we are “drowning in data, yet staving for knowledge.\\\\\" So, chances are, the dataset(s) already exist somewhere, in some format. It may be external or internal, structured or unstructured, static or streamed, objective or subjective, etc. As the saying goes, you don\\'t have to reinvent the wheel, you just have to know where to find it. In the next step, we will worry about transforming \\\\\"dirty data\\\\\" to \\\\\"clean data.\\\\\"\\\\n3. **Prepare Data for Consumption:** This step is often referred to as data wrangling, a required process to turn “wild” data into “manageable” data. Data wrangling includes implementing data architectures for storage and processing, developing data governance standards for quality and control, data extraction (i.e. ETL and web scraping), and data cleaning to identify aberrant, missing, or outlier data points.\\\\n4. **Perform Exploratory Analysis:** Anybody who has ever worked with data knows, garbage-in, garbage-out (GIGO). Therefore, it is important to deploy descriptive and graphical statistics to look for potential problems, patterns, classifications, correlations and comparisons in the dataset. In addition, data categorization (i.e. qualitative vs quantitative) is also important to understand and select the correct hypothesis test or data model.\\\\n5. **Model Data:** Like descriptive and inferential statistics, data modeling can either summarize the data or predict future outcomes. Your dataset and expected results, will determine the algorithms available for use. It\\'s important to remember, algorithms are tools and not magical wands or silver bullets. You must still be the master craft (wo)man that knows how-to select the right tool for the job. An analogy would be asking someone to hand you a Philip screwdriver, and they hand you a flathead screwdriver or worst a hammer. At best, it shows a complete lack of understanding. At worst, it makes completing the project impossible. The same is true in data modelling. The wrong model can lead to poor performance at best and the wrong conclusion (that’s used as actionable intelligence) at worst.\\\\n6. **Validate and Implement Data Model:** After you\\'ve trained your model based on a subset of your data, it\\'s time to test your model. This helps ensure you haven\\'t overfit your model or made it so specific to the selected subset, that it does not accurately fit another subset from the same dataset. In this step we determine if our [model overfit, generalize, or underfit our dataset](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/latest/dg/model-fit-underfitting-vs-overfitting.html).\\\\n7. **Optimize and Strategize:** This is the \\\\\"bionic man\\\\\" step, where you iterate back through the process to make it better...stronger...faster than it was before. As a data scientist, your strategy should be to outsource developer operations and application plumbing, so you have more time to focus on recommendations and design. Once you\\'re able to package your ideas, this becomes your “currency exchange\\\\\" rate.\",\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"metadata\":{\"_cell_guid\":\"8514a868-6816-494a-9e9c-dba14cb36f42\",\"_uuid\":\"bd2a68dcaace0c1371f2994f0204dce65800cc20\"}},{\"source\":\"<a id=\\\\\"ch3\\\\\"></a>\\\\n# Step 1: Define the Problem\\\\nFor this project, the problem statement is given to us on a golden plater, develop an algorithm to predict the survival outcome of passengers on the Titanic.\\\\n\\\\n......\\\\n\\\\n**Project Summary:**\\\\nThe sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.\\\\n\\\\nOne of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.\\\\n\\\\nIn this challenge, we ask you to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular, we ask you to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.\\\\n\\\\nPractice Skills\\\\n* Binary classification\\\\n* Python and R basics\\\\n\\\\n# Step 2: Gather the Data\\\\n\\\\nThe dataset is also given to us on a golden plater with test and train data at [Kaggle\\'s Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)\\\\n\",\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"metadata\":{\"_cell_guid\":\"22ba49b5-b3b6-4129-8c57-623e0d863ab3\",\"_uuid\":\"ff014109d795c5d1bfcc66c9761730406124ebe4\"}},{\"source\":\"<a id=\\\\\"ch4\\\\\"></a>\\\\n# Step 3: Prepare Data for Consumption\\\\nSince step 2 was provided to us on a golden plater, so is step 3.

Using the same dataset and different implementation of a decision tree (adaboost, random forest, gradient boost, xgboost, etc.) with tuning does not exceed the 0.77990 submission accuracy. Interesting for this dataset, the simple decision tree algorithm had the best default submission score and with tuning achieved the same best accuracy score.\\\\n\\\\nWhile no general conclusions can be made from testing a handful of algorithms on a single dataset, there are several observations on the mentioned dataset. \\\\n1. The train dataset has a different distribution than the test/validation dataset and population. This created wide margins between the cross validation (CV) accuracy score and Kaggle submission accuracy score.\\\\n2. Given the same dataset, decision tree based algorithms, seemed to converge on the same accuracy score after proper tuning.\\\\n3. Despite tuning, no machine learning algorithm, exceeded the homemade algorithm. The author will theorize, that for small datasets, a manmade algorithm is the bar to beat. \\\\n\\\\nWith that in mind, for iteration two, I would spend more time on preprocessing and feature engineering. In order to better align the CV score and Kaggle score and improve the overall accuracy.\\\\n\\\\n\",\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"metadata\":{\"_cell_guid\":\"a6d34edc-1265-41e8-b163-0b817cd3b6a5\",\"_uuid\":\"c476df95925d67809975caca4ea4dcb4b2a0b277\"}},{\"source\":\"<a id=\\\\\"ch90\\\\\"></a>\\\\n## Change Log:\\\\n11/22/17 Please note, this kernel is currently in progress, but open to feedback.

In a nutshell stacking uses as a first-level (base), the predictions of a few basic classifiers and then uses another model at the second-level to predict the output from the earlier first-level predictions.\\\\n\\\\nThe Titanic dataset is a prime candidate for introducing this concept as many newcomers to Kaggle start out here. Furthermore even though stacking has been responsible for many a team winning Kaggle competitions there seems to be a dearth of kernels on this topic so I hope this notebook can fill somewhat of that void.\\\\n\\\\nI myself am quite a newcomer to the Kaggle scene as well and the first proper ensembling/stacking script that I managed to chance upon and study was one written in the AllState Severity Claims competition by the great Faron. The material in this notebook borrows heavily from Faron\\'s script although ported to factor in ensembles of classifiers whilst his was ensembles of regressors. Anyway please check out his script here:\\\\n\\\\n[Stacking Starter][1] : by Faron \\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNow onto the notebook at hand and I hope that it manages to do justice and convey the concept of ensembling in an intuitive and concise manner.  My other standalone Kaggle [script][2] which implements exactly the same ensembling steps (albeit with different parameters) discussed below gives a Public LB score of 0.808 which is good enough to get to the top 9% and runs just under 4 minutes. Therefore I am pretty sure there is a lot of room to improve and add on to that script. Anyways please feel free to leave me any comments with regards to how I can improve\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n  [1]: https://www.kaggle.com/mmueller/allstate-claims-severity/stacking-starter/run/390867\\\\n  [2]: https://www.kaggle.com/arthurtok/titanic/simple-stacking-with-xgboost-0-808\"},{\"metadata\":{\"_execution_state\":\"idle\",\"_cell_guid\":\"14630296-b1aa-759e-bafa-b6a73f3896ed\",\"_uuid\":\"2e37a274400cfeb472b6405d524325245588dd66\",\"trusted\":true},\"cell_type\":\"code\",\"source\":\"# Load in our libraries\\\\nimport pandas as pd\\\\nimport numpy as np\\\\nimport re\\\\nimport sklearn\\\\nimport xgboost as xgb\\\\nimport seaborn as sns\\\\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\\\\n%matplotlib inline\\\\n\\\\nimport plotly.offline as py\\\\npy.init_notebook_mode(connected=True)\\\\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\\\\nimport plotly.tools as tls\\\\n\\\\nimport warnings\\\\nwarnings.filterwarnings(\\'ignore\\')\\\\n\\\\n# Going to use these 5 base models for the stacking\\\\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import (RandomForestClassifier, AdaBoostClassifier, \\\\n                              GradientBoostingClassifier, ExtraTreesClassifier)\\\\nfrom sklearn.svm import SVC\\\\nfrom sklearn.cross_validation import KFold\",\"execution_count\":1,\"outputs\":[]},{\"metadata\":{\"_uuid\":\"8b590aafe06a2ac55daae9d2456155e457914f5f\",\"_cell_guid\":\"d647b74c-099b-851a-dcd2-3a58c9e8f10c\"},\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"source\":\"# Feature Exploration, Engineering and Cleaning \\\\n\\\\nNow we will proceed much like how most kernels in general are structured, and that is to first explore the data on hand, identify possible feature engineering opportunities as well as numerically encode any categorical features.\"},{\"metadata\":{\"_execution_state\":\"idle\",\"_cell_guid\":\"5937fd72-d1ad-f678-cc82-f08a96e4cad0\",\"_uuid\":\"b2ad78041b69ce13d1f41bd9bc8c93cafaf7b8ac\",\"trusted\":true},\"cell_type\":\"code\",\"source\":\"# Load in the train and test datasets\\\\ntrain = pd.read_csv(\\'../input/train.csv\\')\\\\ntest = pd.read_csv(\\'../input/test.csv\\')\\\\n\\\\n# Store our passenger ID for easy access\\\\nPassengerId = test[\\'PassengerId\\']\\\\n\\\\ntrain.head(3)\",\"execution_count\":2,\"outputs\":[]},{\"metadata\":{\"_uuid\":\"81378834770e55c76751347588322fe32acf5737\",\"_cell_guid\":\"dff1c1dd-1e59-3907-88fa-1a1d699122be\"},\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"source\":\"Well it is no surprise that our task is to somehow extract the information out of the categorical variables \\\\n\\\\n**Feature Engineering**\\\\n\\\\nHere, credit must be extended to Sina\\'s very comprehensive and well-thought out notebook for the feature engineering ideas so please check out his work \\\\n\\\\n[Titanic Best Working Classfier][1] : by Sina\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n  [1]: https://www.kaggle.com/sinakhorami/titanic/titanic-best-working-classifier\"},{\"metadata\":{\"collapsed\":true,\"_execution_state\":\"idle\",\"_cell_guid\":\"e85b2a80-88a4-928f-f2b2-24895dea38f3\",\"_uuid\":\"b1c67249f91768ce8e5e2751364d32c87446cf55\",\"trusted\":true},\"cell_type\":\"code\",\"source\":\"full_data = [train, test]\\\\n\\\\n# Some features of my own that I have added in\\\\n# Gives the length of the name\\\\ntrain[\\'Name_length\\'] = train[\\'Name\\'].apply(len)\\\\ntest[\\'Name_length\\'] = test[\\'Name\\'].apply(len)\\\\n# Feature that tells whether a passenger had a cabin on the Titanic\\\\ntrain[\\'Has_Cabin\\'] = train[\\\\\"Cabin\\\\\"].apply(lambda x: 0 if type(x) == float else 1)\\\\ntest[\\'Has_Cabin\\'] = test[\\\\\"Cabin\\\\\"].apply(lambda x: 0 if type(x) == float else 1)\\\\n\\\\n# Feature engineering steps taken from Sina\\\\n# Create new feature FamilySize as a combination of SibSp and Parch\\\\nfor dataset in full_data:\\\\n    dataset[\\'FamilySize\\'] = dataset[\\'SibSp\\'] + dataset[\\'Parch\\'] + 1\\\\n# Create new feature IsAlone from FamilySize\\\\nfor dataset in full_data:\\\\n    dataset[\\'IsAlone\\'] = 0\\\\n    dataset.loc[dataset[\\'FamilySize\\'] == 1, \\'IsAlone\\'] = 1\\\\n# Remove all NULLS in the Embarked column\\\\nfor dataset in full_data:\\\\n    dataset[\\'Embarked\\'] = dataset[\\'Embarked\\'].fillna(\\'S\\')\\\\n# Remove all NULLS in the Fare column and create a new feature CategoricalFare\\\\nfor dataset in full_data:\\\\n    dataset[\\'Fare\\'] = dataset[\\'Fare\\'].fillna(train[\\'Fare\\'].median())\\\\ntrain[\\'CategoricalFare\\'] = pd.qcut(train[\\'Fare\\'], 4)\\\\n# Create a New feature CategoricalAge\\\\nfor dataset in full_data:\\\\n    age_avg = dataset[\\'Age\\'].mean()\\\\n    age_std = dataset[\\'Age\\'].std()\\\\n    age_null_count = dataset[\\'Age\\'].isnull().sum()\\\\n    age_null_random_list = np.random.randint(age_avg -

However many will skip some of the explanation on how the solution is developed as these notebooks are developed by experts for experts. The objective of this notebook is to follow a step-by-step workflow, explaining each step and rationale for every decision we take during solution development.\\\\n\\\\n## Workflow stages\\\\n\\\\nThe competition solution workflow goes through seven stages described in the Data Science Solutions book.\\\\n\\\\n1. Question or problem definition.\\\\n2. Acquire training and testing data.\\\\n3. Wrangle, prepare, cleanse the data.\\\\n4. Analyze, identify patterns, and explore the data.\\\\n5. Model, predict and solve the problem.\\\\n6. Visualize, report, and present the problem solving steps and final solution.\\\\n7. Supply or submit the results.\\\\n\\\\nThe workflow indicates general sequence of how each stage may follow the other. However there are use cases with exceptions.\\\\n\\\\n- We may combine mulitple workflow stages. We may analyze by visualizing data.\\\\n- Perform a stage earlier than indicated. We may analyze data before and after wrangling.\\\\n- Perform a stage multiple times in our workflow. Visualize stage may be used multiple times.\\\\n- Drop a stage altogether. We may not need supply stage to productize or service enable our dataset for a competition.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Question and problem definition\\\\n\\\\nCompetition sites like Kaggle define the problem to solve or questions to ask while providing the datasets for training your data science model and testing the model results against a test dataset. The question or problem definition for Titanic Survival competition is [described here at Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).\\\\n\\\\n> Knowing from a training set of samples listing passengers who survived or did not survive the Titanic disaster, can our model determine based on a given test dataset not containing the survival information, if these passengers in the test dataset survived or not.\\\\n\\\\nWe may also want to develop some early understanding about the domain of our problem. This is described on the [Kaggle competition description page here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). Here are the highlights to note.\\\\n\\\\n- On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. Translated 32% survival rate.\\\\n- One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew.\\\\n- Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.\\\\n\\\\n## Workflow goals\\\\n\\\\nThe data science solutions workflow solves for seven major goals.\\\\n\\\\n**Classifying.** We may want to classify or categorize our samples. We may also want to understand the implications or correlation of different classes with our solution goal.\\\\n\\\\n**Correlating.** One can approach the problem based on available features within the training dataset. Which features within the dataset contribute significantly to our solution goal? Statistically speaking is there a [correlation](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Correlation) among a feature and solution goal? As the feature values change does the solution state change as well, and visa-versa? This can be tested both for numerical and categorical features in the given dataset. We may also want to determine correlation among features other than survival for subsequent goals and workflow stages. Correlating certain features may help in creating, completing, or correcting features.\\\\n\\\\n**Converting.** For modeling stage, one needs to prepare the data. Depending on the choice of model algorithm one may require all features to be converted to numerical equivalent values. So for instance converting text categorical values to numeric values.\\\\n\\\\n**Completing.** Data preparation may also require us to estimate any missing values within a feature. Model algorithms may work best when there are no missing values.\\\\n\\\\n**Correcting.** We may also analyze the given training dataset for errors or possibly innacurate values within features and try to corrent these values or exclude the samples containing the errors. One way to do this is to detect any outliers among our samples or features. We may also completely discard a feature if it is not contribting to the analysis or may significantly skew the results.\\\\n\\\\n**Creating.** Can we create new features based on an existing feature or a set of features, such that the new feature follows the correlation, conversion, completeness goals.\\\\n\\\\n**Charting.** How to select the right visualization plots and charts depending on nature of the data and the solution goals.\\\"},{\\\"metadata\\\":{\\\"_uuid\\\":\\\"960f8b1937dc4915ce1eb0f82614b1985c4321a4\\\",\\\"_cell_guid\\\":\\\"56a3be4e-76ef-20c6-25e8-da16147cf6d7\\\"},\\\"cell_type\\\":\\\"markdown\\\",\\\"source\\\":\\\"## Refactor Release 2017-Jan-29\\\\n\\\\nWe are significantly refactoring the notebook based on (a) comments received by readers, (b) issues in porting notebook from Jupyter kernel (2.7) to Kaggle kernel (3.5), and (c) review of few more best practice kernels.\\\\n\\\\n### User comments\\\\n\\\\n- Combine training and test data for certain operations like converting titles across dataset to numerical values.

Then check out <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/titanic-tutorial\">Alexis Cook’s Titanic Tutorial</a> that walks you through step by step how to make your first submission!\n\n<iframe width=\"699\" height=\"368\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8yZMXCaFshs\" title=\"YouTube video | How to Get Started with Kaggle’s Titanic Competition | Kaggle\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n## The Challenge\nThe sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.\n\nOn April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.\n\nWhile there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.\n\nIn this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).\n\n> #### Recommended Tutorial\n> We highly recommend [Alexis Cook’s Titanic Tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/titanic-tutorial) that walks you through making your very first submission step by step and [this starter notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/gusthema/titanic-competition-w-tensorflow-decision-forests) to get started.\n\n## How Kaggle’s Competitions Work\n1. **Join the Competition**\nRead about the challenge description, accept the Competition Rules and gain access to the competition dataset.\n1.  **Get to Work**\nDownload the data, build models on it locally or on Kaggle Notebooks (our no-setup, customizable Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs) and generate a prediction file.\n1.  **Make a Submission**\nUpload your prediction as a submission on Kaggle and receive an accuracy score.\n1.  **Check the Leaderboard**\nSee how your model ranks against other Kagglers on our leaderboard. \n1.  **Improve Your Score**\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a> to find lots of tutorials and insights from other competitors.\n\n> #### Kaggle Lingo Video\n> You may run into unfamiliar lingo as you dig into the Kaggle discussion forums and public notebooks. Check out  Dr. Rachael Tatman’s [video on Kaggle Lingo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEJHyuWKd-s) to get up to speed!\n\n## What Data Will I Use in This Competition?\nIn this competition, you’ll gain access to two similar datasets that include passenger information like name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc. One dataset is titled `train.csv` and the other is titled `test.csv`.\n\n`Train.csv` will contain the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 to be exact) and importantly, will reveal whether they survived or not, also known as the “ground truth”.\n\nThe `test.csv` dataset contains similar information but does not disclose the “ground truth” for each passenger. It’s your job to predict these outcomes.\n\nUsing the patterns you find in the `train.csv` data, predict whether the other 418 passengers on board (found in `test.csv`) survived.\n\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data\">“Data” tab</a> to explore the datasets even further. Once you feel you’ve created a competitive model, submit it to Kaggle to see where your model stands on our leaderboard against other Kagglers.\n\n## How to Submit your Prediction to Kaggle\nOnce you’re ready to make a submission and get on the leaderboard:\n\n1. Click on the “Submit Predictions” button\n<img width=\"699\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen1.png\">\n1. Upload a CSV file in the submission file format. You’re able to submit 10 submissions a day.\n<img width=\"699\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen2.png\">\n\n## Submission File Format:\nYou should submit a csv file with exactly 418 entries plus a header row. Your submission will show an error if you have extra columns (beyond `PassengerId` and `Survived`) or rows.\n\nThe file should have exactly 2 columns:\n- `PassengerId` (sorted in any order)\n- `Survived` (contains your binary predictions: 1 for survived, 0 for deceased)\n\n## Got it! I’m ready to get started. Where do I get help if I need it?\n- For Competition Help: <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\">Titanic Discussion Forum</a>\n\nKaggle doesn’t have a dedicated team to help troubleshoot your code so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. The forums are full of useful information on the data, metric, and different approaches. We encourage you to use the forums often. If you share your knowledge, you'll find that others will share a lot in turn!\n\n## A Last Word on Kaggle Notebooks\nAs we mentioned before, Kaggle Notebooks is our no-setup, customizable, Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs and a huge repository of community published data &amp; code.\n\nIn every competition, you’ll find many Notebooks shared with incredible insights. It’s an invaluable resource worth becoming familiar with. Check out this competition’s Notebooks <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/notebooks\">here</a>.\n\n## 🏃‍♀Ready to Compete? <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/account/login?returnUrl=%2Fc%2Ftitanic\">Join the Competition Here!</a>\n\n## Evaluation\n\n<h2>Goal</h2>\n<p>It is your job to predict if a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic or not. <br>For each  in the test set, you must predict a 0 or 1 value for the  variable.</p>\n<h2>Metric</h2>\n<p>Your score is the percentage of passengers you correctly predict.

They are a great place to begin if you are new to data science or just finished a MOOC and want to get involved in Kaggle.</p>\n<p>Getting Started competitions are a non-competitive way to get familiar with Kaggle’s platform, learn basic machine learning concepts, and start meeting people in the community. They have no cash prize and are on a rolling timeline.</p>\n<h2>How do I create and manage a team?</h2>\n<p>When you accept the competition rules, a team will be created for you. You can invite others to your team, accept a merger with another team, and update basic information like team name by going to the More &gt; <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/team\" target=\"_blank\">Team</a> page.</p>\n<p>We've heard from many Kagglers that teaming up is the best way to learn new skills AND have fun. If you don't have a teammate already, consider asking if anyone wants to team up in the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a>.</p>\n<h2>What are Notebooks?</h2>\n<p>Kaggle Notebooks is a cloud computational environment that enables reproducible and collaborative analysis. Notebooks support scripts in Python and R, Jupyter Notebooks, and RMarkdown reports. You can visit the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/notebooks\" target=\"_blank\">Notebooks</a> tab to view all of the publicly shared code for the Titanic competition. For more on how to use Notebooks to learn data science, check out our <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview\" target=\"&quot;_blank\">Courses</a>!</p>\n<h2>Why did my team disappear from the leaderboard?</h2>\n<p>To keep with the spirit of getting-started competitions, we have implemented a two month rolling window on submissions. Once a submission is more than two months old, it will be invalidated and no longer count towards the leaderboard.</p>\n<p>If your team has no submissions in the previous two months, the team will also drop from the leaderboard. This will keep the leaderboard at a manageable size, freshen it up, and prevent newcomers from getting lost in a sea of abandoned scores.</p>\n<p><i>\"I worked so hard to get that score! Give it back!\"</i> Read more about our decision to implement a rolling leaderboard <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion/6240\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n<h2>How do I contact Support?</h2>\n<p>Kaggle does not have a dedicated support team so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. (For this competition, you’ll want to use the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">Titanic discussion forum)</a>.</p>\n<p>Support is only able to help with issues that are being experienced by all participants. Before contacting support, please check the discussion forum for information on your problem. If you can’t find it, you can post your problem in the forum so a fellow participant or a Kaggle team member can provide help. The forums are full of useful information on the data, metric, and different approaches. We encourage you to use the forums often. If you share your knowledge, you'll find that others will share a lot in turn!</p>\n<p>If your problem persists or it seems to be effective all participants then please <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/contact\" target=\"_blank\">contact us</a>.</p>\ntool: Not a directory: /home/code/exploration/../research/writeups\ntool: /home/code/exploration/../research/kernels:\n[DIR]  alexisbcook_exercise-arithmetic-and-variables/\n[DIR]  alexisbcook_titanic-tutorial/\n[DIR]  arthurtok_introduction-to-ensembling-stacking-in-python/\n[DIR]  ldfreeman3_a-data-science-framework-to-achieve-99-accuracy/\n[FILE] metadata.json (1.7KB)\n[DIR]  startupsci_titanic-data-science-solutions/\ntool: /home/data:\n[FILE] description.md (13.6KB)\n[FILE] gender_submission.csv (3.2KB)\n[FILE] test.csv (28.0KB)\n[FILE] train.csv (59.8KB)\ntool: Error: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/home/code/exploration/../research/kernels/ldfreeman3_a-data-science-framework-to-achieve-99-accuracy/ldfreeman3_a-data-science-framework-to-achieve-99-accuracy.py'\ntool: Error: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/home/code/exploration/../research/kernels/arthurtok_introduction-to-ensembling-stacking-in-python/arthurtok_introduction-to-ensembling-stacking-in-python.py'\ntool: /home/code/exploration/../research/kernels/ldfreeman3_a-data-science-framework-to-achieve-99-accuracy:\n[FILE] a-data-science-framework-to-achieve-99-accuracy.ipynb (107.1KB)\n[FILE] kernel-metadata.json (732.0B)\ntool: /home/code/exploration/../research/kernels/arthurtok_introduction-to-ensembling-stacking-in-python:\n[FILE] introduction-to-ensembling-stacking-in-python.ipynb (39.3KB)\n[FILE] kernel-metadata.json (687.0B)\ntool: /home/code/exploration/../research/kernels/startupsci_titanic-data-science-solutions:\n[FILE] kernel-metadata.json (661.0B)\n[FILE] titanic-data-science-solutions.ipynb (55.5KB)\ntool: {\"cells\":[{\"source\":\"\\n>Hello and Welcome to Kaggle, the online Data Science Community to learn, share, and compete. Most beginners get lost in the field, because they fall into the black box approach, using libraries and algorithms they don't understand.

If you don't understand something in the code the print() function is your best friend. In coding, it's okay to try, fail, and try again. If you do run into problems, Google is your second best friend, because 99.99% of the time, someone else had the same question/problem and already asked the coding community. If you've exhausted all your resources, the Kaggle Community via forums and comments can help too.\",\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"metadata\":{\"_cell_guid\":\"ea24845a-4a15-4235-9ed2-4823acbf4317\",\"_uuid\":\"89022d89e1603ef3869a96b9da78da38b0b33b14\"}},{\"source\":\"<a id=\\\"ch1\\\"></a>\\n# How a Data Scientist Beat the Odds\\nIt's the classical problem, predict the outcome of a binary event. In laymen terms this means, it either occurred or did not occur. For example, you won or did not win, you passed the test or did not pass the test, you were accepted or not accepted, and you get the point. A common business application is churn or customer retention. Another popular use case is, healthcare's mortality rate or survival analysis. Binary events create an interesting dynamic, because we know statistically, a random guess should achieve a 50% accuracy rate, without creating one single algorithm or writing one single line of code. However, just like autocorrect spellcheck technology, sometimes we humans can be too smart for our own good and actually underperform a coin flip. In this kernel, I use Kaggle's Getting Started Competition, Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster, to walk the reader through, how-to use the data science framework to beat the odds.\\n   \\n*What happens when technology is too smart for its own good?*\\n![Funny Autocorrect](http://15858-presscdn-0-65.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/hilarious-autocorrect-fails-20x.jpg)\",\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"metadata\":{\"_cell_guid\":\"ec31d549-537e-4f35-8594-22ef03079081\",\"_uuid\":\"ff6c70c884a8a5fb3258e7f3fefc9e55261df1df\"}},{\"source\":\"<a id=\\\"ch2\\\"></a>\\n# A Data Science Framework\\n1. **Define the Problem:** If data science, big data, machine learning, predictive analytics, business intelligence, or any other buzzword is the solution, then what is the problem? As the saying goes, don't put the cart before the horse. Problems before requirements, requirements before solutions, solutions before design, and design before technology. Too often we are quick to jump on the new shiny technology, tool, or algorithm before determining the actual problem we are trying to solve.\\n2. **Gather the Data:** John Naisbitt wrote in his 1984 (yes, 1984) book Megatrends, we are “drowning in data, yet staving for knowledge.\\\" So, chances are, the dataset(s) already exist somewhere, in some format. It may be external or internal, structured or unstructured, static or streamed, objective or subjective, etc. As the saying goes, you don't have to reinvent the wheel, you just have to know where to find it. In the next step, we will worry about transforming \\\"dirty data\\\" to \\\"clean data.\\\"\\n3. **Prepare Data for Consumption:** This step is often referred to as data wrangling, a required process to turn “wild” data into “manageable” data. Data wrangling includes implementing data architectures for storage and processing, developing data governance standards for quality and control, data extraction (i.e. ETL and web scraping), and data cleaning to identify aberrant, missing, or outlier data points.\\n4. **Perform Exploratory Analysis:** Anybody who has ever worked with data knows, garbage-in, garbage-out (GIGO). Therefore, it is important to deploy descriptive and graphical statistics to look for potential problems, patterns, classifications, correlations and comparisons in the dataset. In addition, data categorization (i.e. qualitative vs quantitative) is also important to understand and select the correct hypothesis test or data model.\\n5. **Model Data:** Like descriptive and inferential statistics, data modeling can either summarize the data or predict future outcomes. Your dataset and expected results, will determine the algorithms available for use. It's important to remember, algorithms are tools and not magical wands or silver bullets. You must still be the master craft (wo)man that knows how-to select the right tool for the job. An analogy would be asking someone to hand you a Philip screwdriver, and they hand you a flathead screwdriver or worst a hammer. At best, it shows a complete lack of understanding. At worst, it makes completing the project impossible. The same is true in data modelling. The wrong model can lead to poor performance at best and the wrong conclusion (that’s used as actionable intelligence) at worst.\\n6. **Validate and Implement Data Model:** After you've trained your model based on a subset of your data, it's time to test your model. This helps ensure you haven't overfit your model or made it so specific to the selected subset, that it does not accurately fit another subset from the same dataset. In this step we determine if our [model overfit, generalize, or underfit our dataset](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/latest/dg/model-fit-underfitting-vs-overfitting.html).\\n7. **Optimize and Strategize:** This is the \\\"bionic man\\\" step, where you iterate back through the process to make it better...stronger...faster than it was before. As a data scientist, your strategy should be to outsource developer operations and application plumbing, so you have more time to focus on recommendations and design. Once you're able to package your ideas, this becomes your “currency exchange\\\" rate.\",\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"metadata\":{\"_cell_guid\":\"8514a868-6816-494a-9e9c-dba14cb36f42\",\"_uuid\":\"bd2a68dcaace0c1371f2994f0204dce65800cc20\"}},{\"source\":\"<a id=\\\"ch3\\\"></a>\\n# Step 1: Define the Problem\\nFor this project, the problem statement is given to us on a golden plater, develop an algorithm to predict the survival outcome of passengers on the Titanic.\\n\\n......\\n\\n**Project Summary:**\\nThe sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.\\n\\nOne of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.\\n\\nIn this challenge, we ask you to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular, we ask you to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.\\n\\nPractice Skills\\n* Binary classification\\n* Python and R basics\\n\\n# Step 2: Gather the Data\\n\\nThe dataset is also given to us on a golden plater with test and train data at [Kaggle's Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)\\n\",\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"metadata\":{\"_cell_guid\":\"22ba49b5-b3b6-4129-8c57-623e0d863ab3\",\"_uuid\":\"ff014109d795c5d1bfcc66c9761730406124ebe4\"}},{\"source\":\"<a id=\\\"ch4\\\"></a>\\n# Step 3: Prepare Data for Consumption\\nSince step 2 was provided to us on a golden plater, so is step 3.

Using the same dataset and different implementation of a decision tree (adaboost, random forest, gradient boost, xgboost, etc.) with tuning does not exceed the 0.77990 submission accuracy. Interesting for this dataset, the simple decision tree algorithm had the best default submission score and with tuning achieved the same best accuracy score.\\n\\nWhile no general conclusions can be made from testing a handful of algorithms on a single dataset, there are several observations on the mentioned dataset. \\n1. The train dataset has a different distribution than the test/validation dataset and population. This created wide margins between the cross validation (CV) accuracy score and Kaggle submission accuracy score.\\n2. Given the same dataset, decision tree based algorithms, seemed to converge on the same accuracy score after proper tuning.\\n3. Despite tuning, no machine learning algorithm, exceeded the homemade algorithm. The author will theorize, that for small datasets, a manmade algorithm is the bar to beat. \\n\\nWith that in mind, for iteration two, I would spend more time on preprocessing and feature engineering. In order to better align the CV score and Kaggle score and improve the overall accuracy.\\n\\n\",\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"metadata\":{\"_cell_guid\":\"a6d34edc-1265-41e8-b163-0b817cd3b6a5\",\"_uuid\":\"c476df95925d67809975caca4ea4dcb4b2a0b277\"}},{\"source\":\"<a id=\\\"ch90\\\"></a>\\n## Change Log:\\n11/22/17 Please note, this kernel is currently in progress, but open to feedback.

In a nutshell stacking uses as a first-level (base), the predictions of a few basic classifiers and then uses another model at the second-level to predict the output from the earlier first-level predictions.\\n\\nThe Titanic dataset is a prime candidate for introducing this concept as many newcomers to Kaggle start out here. Furthermore even though stacking has been responsible for many a team winning Kaggle competitions there seems to be a dearth of kernels on this topic so I hope this notebook can fill somewhat of that void.\\n\\nI myself am quite a newcomer to the Kaggle scene as well and the first proper ensembling/stacking script that I managed to chance upon and study was one written in the AllState Severity Claims competition by the great Faron. The material in this notebook borrows heavily from Faron's script although ported to factor in ensembles of classifiers whilst his was ensembles of regressors. Anyway please check out his script here:\\n\\n[Stacking Starter][1] : by Faron \\n\\n\\nNow onto the notebook at hand and I hope that it manages to do justice and convey the concept of ensembling in an intuitive and concise manner.  My other standalone Kaggle [script][2] which implements exactly the same ensembling steps (albeit with different parameters) discussed below gives a Public LB score of 0.808 which is good enough to get to the top 9% and runs just under 4 minutes. Therefore I am pretty sure there is a lot of room to improve and add on to that script. Anyways please feel free to leave me any comments with regards to how I can improve\\n\\n\\n  [1]: https://www.kaggle.com/mmueller/allstate-claims-severity/stacking-starter/run/390867\\n  [2]: https://www.kaggle.com/arthurtok/titanic/simple-stacking-with-xgboost-0-808\"},{\"metadata\":{\"_execution_state\":\"idle\",\"_cell_guid\":\"14630296-b1aa-759e-bafa-b6a73f3896ed\",\"_uuid\":\"2e37a274400cfeb472b6405d524325245588dd66\",\"trusted\":true},\"cell_type\":\"code\",\"source\":\"# Load in our libraries\\nimport pandas as pd\\nimport numpy as np\\nimport re\\nimport sklearn\\nimport xgboost as xgb\\nimport seaborn as sns\\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\\n%matplotlib inline\\n\\nimport plotly.offline as py\\npy.init_notebook_mode(connected=True)\\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\\nimport plotly.tools as tls\\n\\nimport warnings\\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\\n\\n# Going to use these 5 base models for the stacking\\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import (RandomForestClassifier, AdaBoostClassifier, \\n                              GradientBoostingClassifier, ExtraTreesClassifier)\\nfrom sklearn.svm import SVC\\nfrom sklearn.cross_validation import KFold\",\"execution_count\":1,\"outputs\":[]},{\"metadata\":{\"_uuid\":\"8b590aafe06a2ac55daae9d2456155e457914f5f\",\"_cell_guid\":\"d647b74c-099b-851a-dcd2-3a58c9e8f10c\"},\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"source\":\"# Feature Exploration, Engineering and Cleaning \\n\\nNow we will proceed much like how most kernels in general are structured, and that is to first explore the data on hand, identify possible feature engineering opportunities as well as numerically encode any categorical features.\"},{\"metadata\":{\"_execution_state\":\"idle\",\"_cell_guid\":\"5937fd72-d1ad-f678-cc82-f08a96e4cad0\",\"_uuid\":\"b2ad78041b69ce13d1f41bd9bc8c93cafaf7b8ac\",\"trusted\":true},\"cell_type\":\"code\",\"source\":\"# Load in the train and test datasets\\ntrain = pd.read_csv('../input/train.csv')\\ntest = pd.read_csv('../input/test.csv')\\n\\n# Store our passenger ID for easy access\\nPassengerId = test['PassengerId']\\n\\ntrain.head(3)\",\"execution_count\":2,\"outputs\":[]},{\"metadata\":{\"_uuid\":\"81378834770e55c76751347588322fe32acf5737\",\"_cell_guid\":\"dff1c1dd-1e59-3907-88fa-1a1d699122be\"},\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"source\":\"Well it is no surprise that our task is to somehow extract the information out of the categorical variables \\n\\n**Feature Engineering**\\n\\nHere, credit must be extended to Sina's very comprehensive and well-thought out notebook for the feature engineering ideas so please check out his work \\n\\n[Titanic Best Working Classfier][1] : by Sina\\n\\n\\n  [1]: https://www.kaggle.com/sinakhorami/titanic/titanic-best-working-classifier\"},{\"metadata\":{\"collapsed\":true,\"_execution_state\":\"idle\",\"_cell_guid\":\"e85b2a80-88a4-928f-f2b2-24895dea38f3\",\"_uuid\":\"b1c67249f91768ce8e5e2751364d32c87446cf55\",\"trusted\":true},\"cell_type\":\"code\",\"source\":\"full_data = [train, test]\\n\\n# Some features of my own that I have added in\\n# Gives the length of the name\\ntrain['Name_length'] = train['Name'].apply(len)\\ntest['Name_length'] = test['Name'].apply(len)\\n# Feature that tells whether a passenger had a cabin on the Titanic\\ntrain['Has_Cabin'] = train[\\\"Cabin\\\"].apply(lambda x: 0 if type(x) == float else 1)\\ntest['Has_Cabin'] = test[\\\"Cabin\\\"].apply(lambda x: 0 if type(x) == float else 1)\\n\\n# Feature engineering steps taken from Sina\\n# Create new feature FamilySize as a combination of SibSp and Parch\\nfor dataset in full_data:\\n    dataset['FamilySize'] = dataset['SibSp'] + dataset['Parch'] + 1\\n# Create new feature IsAlone from FamilySize\\nfor dataset in full_data:\\n    dataset['IsAlone'] = 0\\n    dataset.loc[dataset['FamilySize'] == 1, 'IsAlone'] = 1\\n# Remove all NULLS in the Embarked column\\nfor dataset in full_data:\\n    dataset['Embarked'] = dataset['Embarked'].fillna('S')\\n# Remove all NULLS in the Fare column and create a new feature CategoricalFare\\nfor dataset in full_data:\\n    dataset['Fare'] = dataset['Fare'].fillna(train['Fare'].median())\\ntrain['CategoricalFare'] = pd.qcut(train['Fare'], 4)\\n# Create a New feature CategoricalAge\\nfor dataset in full_data:\\n    age_avg = dataset['Age'].mean()\\n    age_std = dataset['Age'].std()\\n    age_null_count = dataset['Age'].isnull().sum()\\n    age_null_random_list = np.random.randint(age_avg -

However many will skip some of the explanation on how the solution is developed as these notebooks are developed by experts for experts. The objective of this notebook is to follow a step-by-step workflow, explaining each step and rationale for every decision we take during solution development.\\n\\n## Workflow stages\\n\\nThe competition solution workflow goes through seven stages described in the Data Science Solutions book.\\n\\n1. Question or problem definition.\\n2. Acquire training and testing data.\\n3. Wrangle, prepare, cleanse the data.\\n4. Analyze, identify patterns, and explore the data.\\n5. Model, predict and solve the problem.\\n6. Visualize, report, and present the problem solving steps and final solution.\\n7. Supply or submit the results.\\n\\nThe workflow indicates general sequence of how each stage may follow the other. However there are use cases with exceptions.\\n\\n- We may combine mulitple workflow stages. We may analyze by visualizing data.\\n- Perform a stage earlier than indicated. We may analyze data before and after wrangling.\\n- Perform a stage multiple times in our workflow. Visualize stage may be used multiple times.\\n- Drop a stage altogether. We may not need supply stage to productize or service enable our dataset for a competition.\\n\\n\\n## Question and problem definition\\n\\nCompetition sites like Kaggle define the problem to solve or questions to ask while providing the datasets for training your data science model and testing the model results against a test dataset. The question or problem definition for Titanic Survival competition is [described here at Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).\\n\\n> Knowing from a training set of samples listing passengers who survived or did not survive the Titanic disaster, can our model determine based on a given test dataset not containing the survival information, if these passengers in the test dataset survived or not.\\n\\nWe may also want to develop some early understanding about the domain of our problem. This is described on the [Kaggle competition description page here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). Here are the highlights to note.\\n\\n- On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. Translated 32% survival rate.\\n- One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew.\\n- Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.\\n\\n## Workflow goals\\n\\nThe data science solutions workflow solves for seven major goals.\\n\\n**Classifying.** We may want to classify or categorize our samples. We may also want to understand the implications or correlation of different classes with our solution goal.\\n\\n**Correlating.** One can approach the problem based on available features within the training dataset. Which features within the dataset contribute significantly to our solution goal? Statistically speaking is there a [correlation](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Correlation) among a feature and solution goal? As the feature values change does the solution state change as well, and visa-versa? This can be tested both for numerical and categorical features in the given dataset. We may also want to determine correlation among features other than survival for subsequent goals and workflow stages. Correlating certain features may help in creating, completing, or correcting features.\\n\\n**Converting.** For modeling stage, one needs to prepare the data. Depending on the choice of model algorithm one may require all features to be converted to numerical equivalent values. So for instance converting text categorical values to numeric values.\\n\\n**Completing.** Data preparation may also require us to estimate any missing values within a feature. Model algorithms may work best when there are no missing values.\\n\\n**Correcting.** We may also analyze the given training dataset for errors or possibly innacurate values within features and try to corrent these values or exclude the samples containing the errors. One way to do this is to detect any outliers among our samples or features. We may also completely discard a feature if it is not contribting to the analysis or may significantly skew the results.\\n\\n**Creating.** Can we create new features based on an existing feature or a set of features, such that the new feature follows the correlation, conversion, completeness goals.\\n\\n**Charting.** How to select the right visualization plots and charts depending on nature of the data and the solution goals.\"},{\"metadata\":{\"_uuid\":\"960f8b1937dc4915ce1eb0f82614b1985c4321a4\",\"_cell_guid\":\"56a3be4e-76ef-20c6-25e8-da16147cf6d7\"},\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"source\":\"## Refactor Release 2017-Jan-29\\n\\nWe are significantly refactoring the notebook based on (a) comments received by readers, (b) issues in porting notebook from Jupyter kernel (2.7) to Kaggle kernel (3.5), and (c) review of few more best practice kernels.\\n\\n### User comments\\n\\n- Combine training and test data for certain operations like converting titles across dataset to numerical values.

Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.\\n\\nWhile there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.\\n\\nIn this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).\\n\\n> #### Recommended Tutorial\\n> We highly recommend [Alexis Cook’s Titanic Tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/titanic-tutorial) that walks you through making your very first submission step by step and [this starter notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/gusthema/titanic-competition-w-tensorflow-decision-forests) to get started.\\n\\n## How Kaggle’s Competitions Work\\n1. **Join the Competition**\\nRead about the challenge description, accept the Competition Rules and gain access to the competition dataset.\\n1.  **Get to Work**\\nDownload the data, build models on it locally or on Kaggle Notebooks (our no-setup, customizable Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs) and generate a prediction file.\\n1.  **Make a Submission**\\nUpload your prediction as a submission on Kaggle and receive an accuracy score.\\n1.  **Check the Leaderboard**\\nSee how your model ranks against other Kagglers on our leaderboard. \\n1.  **Improve Your Score**\\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a> to find lots of tutorials and insights from other competitors.\\n\\n> #### Kaggle Lingo Video\\n> You may run into unfamiliar lingo as you dig into the Kaggle discussion forums and public notebooks. Check out  Dr. Rachael Tatman’s [video on Kaggle Lingo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEJHyuWKd-s) to get up to speed!\\n\\n## What Data Will I Use in This Competition?\\nIn this competition, you’ll gain access to two similar datasets that include passenger information like name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc. One dataset is titled `train.csv` and the other is titled `test.csv`.\\n\\n`Train.csv` will contain the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 to be exact) and importantly, will reveal whether they survived or not, also known as the “ground truth”.\\n\\nThe `test.csv` dataset contains similar information but does not disclose the “ground truth” for each passenger. It’s your job to predict these outcomes.\\n\\nUsing the patterns you find in the `train.csv` data, predict whether the other 418 passengers on board (found in `test.csv`) survived.\\n\\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data\">“Data” tab</a> to explore the datasets even further. Once you feel you’ve created a competitive model, submit it to Kaggle to see where your model stands on our leaderboard against other Kagglers.\\n\\n## How to Submit your Prediction to Kaggle\\nOnce you’re ready to make a submission and get on the leaderboard:\\n\\n1. Click on the “Submit Predictions” button\\n<img width=\"699\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen1.png\">\\n1. Upload a CSV file in the submission file format. You’re able to submit 10 submissions a day.\\n<img width=\"699\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen2.png\">\\n\\n## Submission File Format:\\nYou should submit a csv file with exactly 418 entries plus a header row. Your submission will show an error if you have extra columns (beyond `PassengerId` and `Survived`) or rows.\\n\\nThe file should have exactly 2 columns:\\n- `PassengerId` (sorted in any order)\\n- `Survived` (contains your binary predictions: 1 for survived, 0 for deceased)\\n\\n## Got it! I’m ready to get started. Where do I get help if I need it?\\n- For Competition Help: <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\">Titanic Discussion Forum</a>\\n\\nKaggle doesn’t have a dedicated team to help troubleshoot your code so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. The forums are full of useful information on the data, metric, and different approaches. We encourage you to use the forums often. If you share your knowledge, you\\'ll find that others will share a lot in turn!\\n\\n## A Last Word on Kaggle Notebooks\\nAs we mentioned before, Kaggle Notebooks is our no-setup, customizable, Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs and a huge repository of community published data &amp; code.\\n\\nIn every competition, you’ll find many Notebooks shared with incredible insights. It’s an invaluable resource worth becoming familiar with. Check out this competition’s Notebooks <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/notebooks\">here</a>.\\n\\n## 🏃\\u200d♀Ready to Compete? <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/account/login?returnUrl=%2Fc%2Ftitanic\">Join the Competition Here!</a>\\n\\n## Evaluation\\n\\n<h2>Goal</h2>\\n<p>It is your job to predict if a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic or not. <br>For each  in the test set, you must predict a 0 or 1 value for the  variable.</p>\\n<h2>Metric</h2>\\n<p>Your score is the percentage of passengers you correctly predict.

They are a great place to begin if you are new to data science or just finished a MOOC and want to get involved in Kaggle.</p>\\n<p>Getting Started competitions are a non-competitive way to get familiar with Kaggle’s platform, learn basic machine learning concepts, and start meeting people in the community. They have no cash prize and are on a rolling timeline.</p>\\n<h2>How do I create and manage a team?</h2>\\n<p>When you accept the competition rules, a team will be created for you. You can invite others to your team, accept a merger with another team, and update basic information like team name by going to the More &gt; <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/team\" target=\"_blank\">Team</a> page.</p>\\n<p>We\\'ve heard from many Kagglers that teaming up is the best way to learn new skills AND have fun. If you don\\'t have a teammate already, consider asking if anyone wants to team up in the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a>.</p>\\n<h2>What are Notebooks?</h2>\\n<p>Kaggle Notebooks is a cloud computational environment that enables reproducible and collaborative analysis. Notebooks support scripts in Python and R, Jupyter Notebooks, and RMarkdown reports. You can visit the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/notebooks\" target=\"_blank\">Notebooks</a> tab to view all of the publicly shared code for the Titanic competition. For more on how to use Notebooks to learn data science, check out our <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview\" target=\"&quot;_blank\">Courses</a>!</p>\\n<h2>Why did my team disappear from the leaderboard?</h2>\\n<p>To keep with the spirit of getting-started competitions, we have implemented a two month rolling window on submissions. Once a submission is more than two months old, it will be invalidated and no longer count towards the leaderboard.</p>\\n<p>If your team has no submissions in the previous two months, the team will also drop from the leaderboard. This will keep the leaderboard at a manageable size, freshen it up, and prevent newcomers from getting lost in a sea of abandoned scores.</p>\\n<p><i>\"I worked so hard to get that score! Give it back!\"</i> Read more about our decision to implement a rolling leaderboard <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion/6240\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\\n<h2>How do I contact Support?</h2>\\n<p>Kaggle does not have a dedicated support team so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. (For this competition, you’ll want to use the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">Titanic discussion forum)</a>.</p>\\n<p>Support is only able to help with issues that are being experienced by all participants. Before contacting support, please check the discussion forum for information on your problem. If you can’t find it, you can post your problem in the forum so a fellow participant or a Kaggle team member can provide help. The forums are full of useful information on the data, metric, and different approaches. We encourage you to use the forums often. If you share your knowledge, you\\'ll find that others will share a lot in turn!</p>\\n<p>If your problem persists or it seems to be effective all participants then please <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/contact\" target=\"_blank\">contact us</a>.</p>'}, {'role': 'tool', 'content': 'Not a directory: /home/code/exploration/../research/writeups'}, {'role': 'tool', 'content': '/home/code/exploration/../research/kernels:\\n[DIR]  alexisbcook_exercise-arithmetic-and-variables/\\n[DIR]  alexisbcook_titanic-tutorial/\\n[DIR]  arthurtok_introduction-to-ensembling-stacking-in-python/\\n[DIR]  ldfreeman3_a-data-science-framework-to-achieve-99-accuracy/\\n[FILE] metadata.json (1.7KB)\\n[DIR]  startupsci_titanic-data-science-solutions/'}, {'role': 'tool', 'content': '/home/data:\\n[FILE] description.md (13.6KB)\\n[FILE] gender_submission.csv (3.2KB)\\n[FILE] test.csv (28.0KB)\\n[FILE] train.csv (59.8KB)'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': \"REASONING: This is the classic Titanic survival prediction problem - binary classification with accuracy as the metric.

In laymen terms this means, it either occurred or did not occur. For example, you won or did not win, you passed the test or did not pass the test, you were accepted or not accepted, and you get the point. A common business application is churn or customer retention. Another popular use case is, healthcare\\'s mortality rate or survival analysis. Binary events create an interesting dynamic, because we know statistically, a random guess should achieve a 50% accuracy rate, without creating one single algorithm or writing one single line of code. However, just like autocorrect spellcheck technology, sometimes we humans can be too smart for our own good and actually underperform a coin flip. In this kernel, I use Kaggle\\'s Getting Started Competition, Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster, to walk the reader through, how-to use the data science framework to beat the odds.\\\\n   \\\\n*What happens when technology is too smart for its own good?*\\\\n![Funny Autocorrect](http://15858-presscdn-0-65.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/hilarious-autocorrect-fails-20x.jpg)\",\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"metadata\":{\"_cell_guid\":\"ec31d549-537e-4f35-8594-22ef03079081\",\"_uuid\":\"ff6c70c884a8a5fb3258e7f3fefc9e55261df1df\"}},{\"source\":\"<a id=\\\\\"ch2\\\\\"></a>\\\\n# A Data Science Framework\\\\n1. **Define the Problem:** If data science, big data, machine learning, predictive analytics, business intelligence, or any other buzzword is the solution, then what is the problem? As the saying goes, don\\'t put the cart before the horse. Problems before requirements, requirements before solutions, solutions before design, and design before technology. Too often we are quick to jump on the new shiny technology, tool, or algorithm before determining the actual problem we are trying to solve.\\\\n2. **Gather the Data:** John Naisbitt wrote in his 1984 (yes, 1984) book Megatrends, we are “drowning in data, yet staving for knowledge.\\\\\" So, chances are, the dataset(s) already exist somewhere, in some format. It may be external or internal, structured or unstructured, static or streamed, objective or subjective, etc. As the saying goes, you don\\'t have to reinvent the wheel, you just have to know where to find it. In the next step, we will worry about transforming \\\\\"dirty data\\\\\" to \\\\\"clean data.\\\\\"\\\\n3. **Prepare Data for Consumption:** This step is often referred to as data wrangling, a required process to turn “wild” data into “manageable” data. Data wrangling includes implementing data architectures for storage and processing, developing data governance standards for quality and control, data extraction (i.e. ETL and web scraping), and data cleaning to identify aberrant, missing, or outlier data points.\\\\n4. **Perform Exploratory Analysis:** Anybody who has ever worked with data knows, garbage-in, garbage-out (GIGO). Therefore, it is important to deploy descriptive and graphical statistics to look for potential problems, patterns, classifications, correlations and comparisons in the dataset. In addition, data categorization (i.e. qualitative vs quantitative) is also important to understand and select the correct hypothesis test or data model.\\\\n5. **Model Data:** Like descriptive and inferential statistics, data modeling can either summarize the data or predict future outcomes. Your dataset and expected results, will determine the algorithms available for use. It\\'s important to remember, algorithms are tools and not magical wands or silver bullets. You must still be the master craft (wo)man that knows how-to select the right tool for the job. An analogy would be asking someone to hand you a Philip screwdriver, and they hand you a flathead screwdriver or worst a hammer. At best, it shows a complete lack of understanding. At worst, it makes completing the project impossible. The same is true in data modelling. The wrong model can lead to poor performance at best and the wrong conclusion (that’s used as actionable intelligence) at worst.\\\\n6. **Validate and Implement Data Model:** After you\\'ve trained your model based on a subset of your data, it\\'s time to test your model. This helps ensure you haven\\'t overfit your model or made it so specific to the selected subset, that it does not accurately fit another subset from the same dataset. In this step we determine if our [model overfit, generalize, or underfit our dataset](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/latest/dg/model-fit-underfitting-vs-overfitting.html).\\\\n7. **Optimize and Strategize:** This is the \\\\\"bionic man\\\\\" step, where you iterate back through the process to make it better...stronger...faster than it was before. As a data scientist, your strategy should be to outsource developer operations and application plumbing, so you have more time to focus on recommendations and design. Once you\\'re able to package your ideas, this becomes your “currency exchange\\\\\" rate.\",\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"metadata\":{\"_cell_guid\":\"8514a868-6816-494a-9e9c-dba14cb36f42\",\"_uuid\":\"bd2a68dcaace0c1371f2994f0204dce65800cc20\"}},{\"source\":\"<a id=\\\\\"ch3\\\\\"></a>\\\\n# Step 1: Define the Problem\\\\nFor this project, the problem statement is given to us on a golden plater, develop an algorithm to predict the survival outcome of passengers on the Titanic.\\\\n\\\\n......\\\\n\\\\n**Project Summary:**\\\\nThe sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.\\\\n\\\\nOne of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.\\\\n\\\\nIn this challenge, we ask you to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular, we ask you to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.\\\\n\\\\nPractice Skills\\\\n* Binary classification\\\\n* Python and R basics\\\\n\\\\n# Step 2: Gather the Data\\\\n\\\\nThe dataset is also given to us on a golden plater with test and train data at [Kaggle\\'s Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)\\\\n\",\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"metadata\":{\"_cell_guid\":\"22ba49b5-b3b6-4129-8c57-623e0d863ab3\",\"_uuid\":\"ff014109d795c5d1bfcc66c9761730406124ebe4\"}},{\"source\":\"<a id=\\\\\"ch4\\\\\"></a>\\\\n# Step 3: Prepare Data for Consumption\\\\nSince step 2 was provided to us on a golden plater, so is step 3.

Using the same dataset and different implementation of a decision tree (adaboost, random forest, gradient boost, xgboost, etc.) with tuning does not exceed the 0.77990 submission accuracy. Interesting for this dataset, the simple decision tree algorithm had the best default submission score and with tuning achieved the same best accuracy score.\\\\n\\\\nWhile no general conclusions can be made from testing a handful of algorithms on a single dataset, there are several observations on the mentioned dataset. \\\\n1. The train dataset has a different distribution than the test/validation dataset and population. This created wide margins between the cross validation (CV) accuracy score and Kaggle submission accuracy score.\\\\n2. Given the same dataset, decision tree based algorithms, seemed to converge on the same accuracy score after proper tuning.\\\\n3. Despite tuning, no machine learning algorithm, exceeded the homemade algorithm. The author will theorize, that for small datasets, a manmade algorithm is the bar to beat. \\\\n\\\\nWith that in mind, for iteration two, I would spend more time on preprocessing and feature engineering. In order to better align the CV score and Kaggle score and improve the overall accuracy.\\\\n\\\\n\",\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"metadata\":{\"_cell_guid\":\"a6d34edc-1265-41e8-b163-0b817cd3b6a5\",\"_uuid\":\"c476df95925d67809975caca4ea4dcb4b2a0b277\"}},{\"source\":\"<a id=\\\\\"ch90\\\\\"></a>\\\\n## Change Log:\\\\n11/22/17 Please note, this kernel is currently in progress, but open to feedback.

In a nutshell stacking uses as a first-level (base), the predictions of a few basic classifiers and then uses another model at the second-level to predict the output from the earlier first-level predictions.\\\\n\\\\nThe Titanic dataset is a prime candidate for introducing this concept as many newcomers to Kaggle start out here. Furthermore even though stacking has been responsible for many a team winning Kaggle competitions there seems to be a dearth of kernels on this topic so I hope this notebook can fill somewhat of that void.\\\\n\\\\nI myself am quite a newcomer to the Kaggle scene as well and the first proper ensembling/stacking script that I managed to chance upon and study was one written in the AllState Severity Claims competition by the great Faron. The material in this notebook borrows heavily from Faron\\'s script although ported to factor in ensembles of classifiers whilst his was ensembles of regressors. Anyway please check out his script here:\\\\n\\\\n[Stacking Starter][1] : by Faron \\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNow onto the notebook at hand and I hope that it manages to do justice and convey the concept of ensembling in an intuitive and concise manner.  My other standalone Kaggle [script][2] which implements exactly the same ensembling steps (albeit with different parameters) discussed below gives a Public LB score of 0.808 which is good enough to get to the top 9% and runs just under 4 minutes.

However many will skip some of the explanation on how the solution is developed as these notebooks are developed by experts for experts. The objective of this notebook is to follow a step-by-step workflow, explaining each step and rationale for every decision we take during solution development.\\\\n\\\\n## Workflow stages\\\\n\\\\nThe competition solution workflow goes through seven stages described in the Data Science Solutions book.\\\\n\\\\n1. Question or problem definition.\\\\n2. Acquire training and testing data.\\\\n3. Wrangle, prepare, cleanse the data.\\\\n4. Analyze, identify patterns, and explore the data.\\\\n5. Model, predict and solve the problem.\\\\n6. Visualize, report, and present the problem solving steps and final solution.\\\\n7. Supply or submit the results.\\\\n\\\\nThe workflow indicates general sequence of how each stage may follow the other. However there are use cases with exceptions.\\\\n\\\\n- We may combine mulitple workflow stages. We may analyze by visualizing data.\\\\n- Perform a stage earlier than indicated. We may analyze data before and after wrangling.\\\\n- Perform a stage multiple times in our workflow. Visualize stage may be used multiple times.\\\\n- Drop a stage altogether. We may not need supply stage to productize or service enable our dataset for a competition.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Question and problem definition\\\\n\\\\nCompetition sites like Kaggle define the problem to solve or questions to ask while providing the datasets for training your data science model and testing the model results against a test dataset. The question or problem definition for Titanic Survival competition is [described here at Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).\\\\n\\\\n> Knowing from a training set of samples listing passengers who survived or did not survive the Titanic disaster, can our model determine based on a given test dataset not containing the survival information, if these passengers in the test dataset survived or not.\\\\n\\\\nWe may also want to develop some early understanding about the domain of our problem. This is described on the [Kaggle competition description page here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). Here are the highlights to note.\\\\n\\\\n- On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. Translated 32% survival rate.\\\\n- One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew.\\\\n- Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.\\\\n\\\\n## Workflow goals\\\\n\\\\nThe data science solutions workflow solves for seven major goals.\\\\n\\\\n**Classifying.** We may want to classify or categorize our samples. We may also want to understand the implications or correlation of different classes with our solution goal.\\\\n\\\\n**Correlating.** One can approach the problem based on available features within the training dataset. Which features within the dataset contribute significantly to our solution goal? Statistically speaking is there a [correlation](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Correlation) among a feature and solution goal? As the feature values change does the solution state change as well, and visa-versa? This can be tested both for numerical and categorical features in the given dataset. We may also want to determine correlation among features other than survival for subsequent goals and workflow stages. Correlating certain features may help in creating, completing, or correcting features.\\\\n\\\\n**Converting.** For modeling stage, one needs to prepare the data. Depending on the choice of model algorithm one may require all features to be converted to numerical equivalent values. So for instance converting text categorical values to numeric values.\\\\n\\\\n**Completing.** Data preparation may also require us to estimate any missing values within a feature. Model algorithms may work best when there are no missing values.\\\\n\\\\n**Correcting.** We may also analyze the given training dataset for errors or possibly innacurate values within features and try to corrent these values or exclude the samples containing the errors. One way to do this is to detect any outliers among our samples or features. We may also completely discard a feature if it is not contribting to the analysis or may significantly skew the results.\\\\n\\\\n**Creating.** Can we create new features based on an existing feature or a set of features, such that the new feature follows the correlation, conversion, completeness goals.\\\\n\\\\n**Charting.** How to select the right visualization plots and charts depending on nature of the data and the solution goals.\"},{\"metadata\":{\"_uuid\":\"960f8b1937dc4915ce1eb0f82614b1985c4321a4\",\"_cell_guid\":\"56a3be4e-76ef-20c6-25e8-da16147cf6d7\"},\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"source\":\"## Refactor Release 2017-Jan-29\\\\n\\\\nWe are significantly refactoring the notebook based on (a) comments received by readers, (b) issues in porting notebook from Jupyter kernel (2.7) to Kaggle kernel (3.5), and (c) review of few more best practice kernels.\\\\n\\\\n### User comments\\\\n\\\\n- Combine training and test data for certain operations like converting titles across dataset to numerical values.

Then check out <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/titanic-tutorial\">Alexis Cook’s Titanic Tutorial</a> that walks you through step by step how to make your first submission!\n\n<iframe width=\"699\" height=\"368\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8yZMXCaFshs\" title=\"YouTube video | How to Get Started with Kaggle’s Titanic Competition | Kaggle\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n## The Challenge\nThe sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.\n\nOn April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.\n\nWhile there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.\n\nIn this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).\n\n> #### Recommended Tutorial\n> We highly recommend [Alexis Cook’s Titanic Tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/titanic-tutorial) that walks you through making your very first submission step by step and [this starter notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/gusthema/titanic-competition-w-tensorflow-decision-forests) to get started.\n\n## How Kaggle’s Competitions Work\n1. **Join the Competition**\nRead about the challenge description, accept the Competition Rules and gain access to the competition dataset.\n1.  **Get to Work**\nDownload the data, build models on it locally or on Kaggle Notebooks (our no-setup, customizable Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs) and generate a prediction file.\n1.  **Make a Submission**\nUpload your prediction as a submission on Kaggle and receive an accuracy score.\n1.  **Check the Leaderboard**\nSee how your model ranks against other Kagglers on our leaderboard. \n1.  **Improve Your Score**\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a> to find lots of tutorials and insights from other competitors.\n\n> #### Kaggle Lingo Video\n> You may run into unfamiliar lingo as you dig into the Kaggle discussion forums and public notebooks. Check out  Dr. Rachael Tatman’s [video on Kaggle Lingo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEJHyuWKd-s) to get up to speed!\n\n## What Data Will I Use in This Competition?\nIn this competition, you’ll gain access to two similar datasets that include passenger information like name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc. One dataset is titled `train.csv` and the other is titled `test.csv`.\n\n`Train.csv` will contain the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 to be exact) and importantly, will reveal whether they survived or not, also known as the “ground truth”.\n\nThe `test.csv` dataset contains similar information but does not disclose the “ground truth” for each passenger. It’s your job to predict these outcomes.\n\nUsing the patterns you find in the `train.csv` data, predict whether the other 418 passengers on board (found in `test.csv`) survived.\n\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data\">“Data” tab</a> to explore the datasets even further. Once you feel you’ve created a competitive model, submit it to Kaggle to see where your model stands on our leaderboard against other Kagglers.\n\n## How to Submit your Prediction to Kaggle\nOnce you’re ready to make a submission and get on the leaderboard:\n\n1. Click on the “Submit Predictions” button\n<img width=\"699\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen1.png\">\n1. Upload a CSV file in the submission file format. You’re able to submit 10 submissions a day.\n<img width=\"699\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen2.png\">\n\n## Submission File Format:\nYou should submit a csv file with exactly 418 entries plus a header row. Your submission will show an error if you have extra columns (beyond `PassengerId` and `Survived`) or rows.\n\nThe file should have exactly 2 columns:\n- `PassengerId` (sorted in any order)\n- `Survived` (contains your binary predictions: 1 for survived, 0 for deceased)\n\n## Got it! I’m ready to get started. Where do I get help if I need it?\n- For Competition Help: <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\">Titanic Discussion Forum</a>\n\nKaggle doesn’t have a dedicated team to help troubleshoot your code so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. The forums are full of useful information on the data, metric, and different approaches. We encourage you to use the forums often. If you share your knowledge, you'll find that others will share a lot in turn!\n\n## A Last Word on Kaggle Notebooks\nAs we mentioned before, Kaggle Notebooks is our no-setup, customizable, Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs and a huge repository of community published data &amp; code.\n\nIn every competition, you’ll find many Notebooks shared with incredible insights. It’s an invaluable resource worth becoming familiar with. Check out this competition’s Notebooks <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/notebooks\">here</a>.\n\n## 🏃‍♀Ready to Compete? <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/account/login?returnUrl=%2Fc%2Ftitanic\">Join the Competition Here!</a>\n\n## Evaluation\n\n<h2>Goal</h2>\n<p>It is your job to predict if a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic or not. <br>For each  in the test set, you must predict a 0 or 1 value for the  variable.</p>\n<h2>Metric</h2>\n<p>Your score is the percentage of passengers you correctly predict.

They are a great place to begin if you are new to data science or just finished a MOOC and want to get involved in Kaggle.</p>\n<p>Getting Started competitions are a non-competitive way to get familiar with Kaggle’s platform, learn basic machine learning concepts, and start meeting people in the community. They have no cash prize and are on a rolling timeline.</p>\n<h2>How do I create and manage a team?</h2>\n<p>When you accept the competition rules, a team will be created for you. You can invite others to your team, accept a merger with another team, and update basic information like team name by going to the More &gt; <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/team\" target=\"_blank\">Team</a> page.</p>\n<p>We've heard from many Kagglers that teaming up is the best way to learn new skills AND have fun. If you don't have a teammate already, consider asking if anyone wants to team up in the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a>.</p>\n<h2>What are Notebooks?</h2>\n<p>Kaggle Notebooks is a cloud computational environment that enables reproducible and collaborative analysis. Notebooks support scripts in Python and R, Jupyter Notebooks, and RMarkdown reports. You can visit the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/notebooks\" target=\"_blank\">Notebooks</a> tab to view all of the publicly shared code for the Titanic competition. For more on how to use Notebooks to learn data science, check out our <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview\" target=\"&quot;_blank\">Courses</a>!</p>\n<h2>Why did my team disappear from the leaderboard?</h2>\n<p>To keep with the spirit of getting-started competitions, we have implemented a two month rolling window on submissions. Once a submission is more than two months old, it will be invalidated and no longer count towards the leaderboard.</p>\n<p>If your team has no submissions in the previous two months, the team will also drop from the leaderboard. This will keep the leaderboard at a manageable size, freshen it up, and prevent newcomers from getting lost in a sea of abandoned scores.</p>\n<p><i>\"I worked so hard to get that score! Give it back!\"</i> Read more about our decision to implement a rolling leaderboard <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion/6240\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n<h2>How do I contact Support?</h2>\n<p>Kaggle does not have a dedicated support team so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. (For this competition, you’ll want to use the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">Titanic discussion forum)</a>.</p>\n<p>Support is only able to help with issues that are being experienced by all participants. Before contacting support, please check the discussion forum for information on your problem. If you can’t find it, you can post your problem in the forum so a fellow participant or a Kaggle team member can provide help. The forums are full of useful information on the data, metric, and different approaches. We encourage you to use the forums often.

In laymen terms this means, it either occurred or did not occur. For example, you won or did not win, you passed the test or did not pass the test, you were accepted or not accepted, and you get the point. A common business application is churn or customer retention. Another popular use case is, healthcare's mortality rate or survival analysis. Binary events create an interesting dynamic, because we know statistically, a random guess should achieve a 50% accuracy rate, without creating one single algorithm or writing one single line of code. However, just like autocorrect spellcheck technology, sometimes we humans can be too smart for our own good and actually underperform a coin flip. In this kernel, I use Kaggle's Getting Started Competition, Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster, to walk the reader through, how-to use the data science framework to beat the odds.\\n   \\n*What happens when technology is too smart for its own good?*\\n![Funny Autocorrect](http://15858-presscdn-0-65.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/hilarious-autocorrect-fails-20x.jpg)\",\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"metadata\":{\"_cell_guid\":\"ec31d549-537e-4f35-8594-22ef03079081\",\"_uuid\":\"ff6c70c884a8a5fb3258e7f3fefc9e55261df1df\"}},{\"source\":\"<a id=\\\"ch2\\\"></a>\\n# A Data Science Framework\\n1. **Define the Problem:** If data science, big data, machine learning, predictive analytics, business intelligence, or any other buzzword is the solution, then what is the problem? As the saying goes, don't put the cart before the horse. Problems before requirements, requirements before solutions, solutions before design, and design before technology. Too often we are quick to jump on the new shiny technology, tool, or algorithm before determining the actual problem we are trying to solve.\\n2. **Gather the Data:** John Naisbitt wrote in his 1984 (yes, 1984) book Megatrends, we are “drowning in data, yet staving for knowledge.\\\" So, chances are, the dataset(s) already exist somewhere, in some format. It may be external or internal, structured or unstructured, static or streamed, objective or subjective, etc. As the saying goes, you don't have to reinvent the wheel, you just have to know where to find it. In the next step, we will worry about transforming \\\"dirty data\\\" to \\\"clean data.\\\"\\n3. **Prepare Data for Consumption:** This step is often referred to as data wrangling, a required process to turn “wild” data into “manageable” data. Data wrangling includes implementing data architectures for storage and processing, developing data governance standards for quality and control, data extraction (i.e. ETL and web scraping), and data cleaning to identify aberrant, missing, or outlier data points.\\n4. **Perform Exploratory Analysis:** Anybody who has ever worked with data knows, garbage-in, garbage-out (GIGO). Therefore, it is important to deploy descriptive and graphical statistics to look for potential problems, patterns, classifications, correlations and comparisons in the dataset. In addition, data categorization (i.e. qualitative vs quantitative) is also important to understand and select the correct hypothesis test or data model.\\n5. **Model Data:** Like descriptive and inferential statistics, data modeling can either summarize the data or predict future outcomes. Your dataset and expected results, will determine the algorithms available for use. It's important to remember, algorithms are tools and not magical wands or silver bullets. You must still be the master craft (wo)man that knows how-to select the right tool for the job. An analogy would be asking someone to hand you a Philip screwdriver, and they hand you a flathead screwdriver or worst a hammer. At best, it shows a complete lack of understanding. At worst, it makes completing the project impossible. The same is true in data modelling. The wrong model can lead to poor performance at best and the wrong conclusion (that’s used as actionable intelligence) at worst.\\n6. **Validate and Implement Data Model:** After you've trained your model based on a subset of your data, it's time to test your model. This helps ensure you haven't overfit your model or made it so specific to the selected subset, that it does not accurately fit another subset from the same dataset. In this step we determine if our [model overfit, generalize, or underfit our dataset](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/latest/dg/model-fit-underfitting-vs-overfitting.html).\\n7. **Optimize and Strategize:** This is the \\\"bionic man\\\" step, where you iterate back through the process to make it better...stronger...faster than it was before. As a data scientist, your strategy should be to outsource developer operations and application plumbing, so you have more time to focus on recommendations and design. Once you're able to package your ideas, this becomes your “currency exchange\\\" rate.\",\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"metadata\":{\"_cell_guid\":\"8514a868-6816-494a-9e9c-dba14cb36f42\",\"_uuid\":\"bd2a68dcaace0c1371f2994f0204dce65800cc20\"}},{\"source\":\"<a id=\\\"ch3\\\"></a>\\n# Step 1: Define the Problem\\nFor this project, the problem statement is given to us on a golden plater, develop an algorithm to predict the survival outcome of passengers on the Titanic.\\n\\n......\\n\\n**Project Summary:**\\nThe sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.\\n\\nOne of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.\\n\\nIn this challenge, we ask you to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular, we ask you to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.\\n\\nPractice Skills\\n* Binary classification\\n* Python and R basics\\n\\n# Step 2: Gather the Data\\n\\nThe dataset is also given to us on a golden plater with test and train data at [Kaggle's Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)\\n\",\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"metadata\":{\"_cell_guid\":\"22ba49b5-b3b6-4129-8c57-623e0d863ab3\",\"_uuid\":\"ff014109d795c5d1bfcc66c9761730406124ebe4\"}},{\"source\":\"<a id=\\\"ch4\\\"></a>\\n# Step 3: Prepare Data for Consumption\\nSince step 2 was provided to us on a golden plater, so is step 3.

Using the same dataset and different implementation of a decision tree (adaboost, random forest, gradient boost, xgboost, etc.) with tuning does not exceed the 0.77990 submission accuracy. Interesting for this dataset, the simple decision tree algorithm had the best default submission score and with tuning achieved the same best accuracy score.\\n\\nWhile no general conclusions can be made from testing a handful of algorithms on a single dataset, there are several observations on the mentioned dataset. \\n1. The train dataset has a different distribution than the test/validation dataset and population. This created wide margins between the cross validation (CV) accuracy score and Kaggle submission accuracy score.\\n2. Given the same dataset, decision tree based algorithms, seemed to converge on the same accuracy score after proper tuning.\\n3. Despite tuning, no machine learning algorithm, exceeded the homemade algorithm. The author will theorize, that for small datasets, a manmade algorithm is the bar to beat. \\n\\nWith that in mind, for iteration two, I would spend more time on preprocessing and feature engineering. In order to better align the CV score and Kaggle score and improve the overall accuracy.\\n\\n\",\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"metadata\":{\"_cell_guid\":\"a6d34edc-1265-41e8-b163-0b817cd3b6a5\",\"_uuid\":\"c476df95925d67809975caca4ea4dcb4b2a0b277\"}},{\"source\":\"<a id=\\\"ch90\\\"></a>\\n## Change Log:\\n11/22/17 Please note, this kernel is currently in progress, but open to feedback.

In a nutshell stacking uses as a first-level (base), the predictions of a few basic classifiers and then uses another model at the second-level to predict the output from the earlier first-level predictions.\\n\\nThe Titanic dataset is a prime candidate for introducing this concept as many newcomers to Kaggle start out here. Furthermore even though stacking has been responsible for many a team winning Kaggle competitions there seems to be a dearth of kernels on this topic so I hope this notebook can fill somewhat of that void.\\n\\nI myself am quite a newcomer to the Kaggle scene as well and the first proper ensembling/stacking script that I managed to chance upon and study was one written in the AllState Severity Claims competition by the great Faron. The material in this notebook borrows heavily from Faron's script although ported to factor in ensembles of classifiers whilst his was ensembles of regressors. Anyway please check out his script here:\\n\\n[Stacking Starter][1] : by Faron \\n\\n\\nNow onto the notebook at hand and I hope that it manages to do justice and convey the concept of ensembling in an intuitive and concise manner.  My other standalone Kaggle [script][2] which implements exactly the same ensembling steps (albeit with different parameters) discussed below gives a Public LB score of 0.808 which is good enough to get to the top 9% and runs just under 4 minutes. Therefore I am pretty sure there is a lot of room to improve and add on to that script. Anyways please feel free to leave me any comments with regards to how I can improve\\n\\n\\n  [1]: https://www.kaggle.com/mmueller/allstate-claims-severity/stacking-starter/run/390867\\n  [2]: https://www.kaggle.com/arthurtok/titanic/simple-stacking-with-xgboost-0-808\"},{\"metadata\":{\"_execution_state\":\"idle\",\"_cell_guid\":\"14630296-b1aa-759e-bafa-b6a73f3896ed\",\"_uuid\":\"2e37a274400cfeb472b6405d524325245588dd66\",\"trusted\":true},\"cell_type\":\"code\",\"source\":\"# Load in our libraries\\nimport pandas as pd\\nimport numpy as np\\nimport re\\nimport sklearn\\nimport xgboost as xgb\\nimport seaborn as sns\\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\\n%matplotlib inline\\n\\nimport plotly.offline as py\\npy.init_notebook_mode(connected=True)\\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\\nimport plotly.tools as tls\\n\\nimport warnings\\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\\n\\n# Going to use these 5 base models for the stacking\\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import (RandomForestClassifier, AdaBoostClassifier, \\n                              GradientBoostingClassifier, ExtraTreesClassifier)\\nfrom sklearn.svm import SVC\\nfrom sklearn.cross_validation import KFold\",\"execution_count\":1,\"outputs\":[]},{\"metadata\":{\"_uuid\":\"8b590aafe06a2ac55daae9d2456155e457914f5f\",\"_cell_guid\":\"d647b74c-099b-851a-dcd2-3a58c9e8f10c\"},\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"source\":\"# Feature Exploration, Engineering and Cleaning \\n\\nNow we will proceed much like how most kernels in general are structured, and that is to first explore the data on hand, identify possible feature engineering opportunities as well as numerically encode any categorical features.\"},{\"metadata\":{\"_execution_state\":\"idle\",\"_cell_guid\":\"5937fd72-d1ad-f678-cc82-f08a96e4cad0\",\"_uuid\":\"b2ad78041b69ce13d1f41bd9bc8c93cafaf7b8ac\",\"trusted\":true},\"cell_type\":\"code\",\"source\":\"# Load in the train and test datasets\\ntrain = pd.read_csv('../input/train.csv')\\ntest = pd.read_csv('../input/test.csv')\\n\\n# Store our passenger ID for easy access\\nPassengerId = test['PassengerId']\\n\\ntrain.head(3)\",\"execution_count\":2,\"outputs\":[]},{\"metadata\":{\"_uuid\":\"81378834770e55c76751347588322fe32acf5737\",\"_cell_guid\":\"dff1c1dd-1e59-3907-88fa-1a1d699122be\"},\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"source\":\"Well it is no surprise that our task is to somehow extract the information out of the categorical variables \\n\\n**Feature Engineering**\\n\\nHere, credit must be extended to Sina's very comprehensive and well-thought out notebook for the feature engineering ideas so please check out his work \\n\\n[Titanic Best Working Classfier][1] : by Sina\\n\\n\\n  [1]: https://www.kaggle.com/sinakhorami/titanic/titanic-best-working-classifier\"},{\"metadata\":{\"collapsed\":true,\"_execution_state\":\"idle\",\"_cell_guid\":\"e85b2a80-88a4-928f-f2b2-24895dea38f3\",\"_uuid\":\"b1c67249f91768ce8e5e2751364d32c87446cf55\",\"trusted\":true},\"cell_type\":\"code\",\"source\":\"full_data = [train, test]\\n\\n# Some features of my own that I have added in\\n# Gives the length of the name\\ntrain['Name_length'] = train['Name'].apply(len)\\ntest['Name_length'] = test['Name'].apply(len)\\n# Feature that tells whether a passenger had a cabin on the Titanic\\ntrain['Has_Cabin'] = train[\\\"Cabin\\\"].apply(lambda x: 0 if type(x) == float else 1)\\ntest['Has_Cabin'] = test[\\\"Cabin\\\"].apply(lambda x: 0 if type(x) == float else 1)\\n\\n# Feature engineering steps taken from Sina\\n# Create new feature FamilySize as a combination of SibSp and Parch\\nfor dataset in full_data:\\n    dataset['FamilySize'] = dataset['SibSp'] + dataset['Parch'] + 1\\n# Create new feature IsAlone from FamilySize\\nfor dataset in full_data:\\n    dataset['IsAlone'] = 0\\n    dataset.loc[dataset['FamilySize'] == 1, 'IsAlone'] = 1\\n# Remove all NULLS in the Embarked column\\nfor dataset in full_data:\\n    dataset['Embarked'] = dataset['Embarked'].fillna('S')\\n# Remove all NULLS in the Fare column and create a new feature CategoricalFare\\nfor dataset in full_data:\\n    dataset['Fare'] = dataset['Fare'].fillna(train['Fare'].median())\\ntrain['CategoricalFare'] = pd.qcut(train['Fare'], 4)\\n# Create a New feature CategoricalAge\\nfor dataset in full_data:\\n    age_avg = dataset['Age'].mean()\\n    age_std = dataset['Age'].std()\\n    age_null_count = dataset['Age'].isnull().sum()\\n    age_null_random_list = np.random.randint(age_avg -

However many will skip some of the explanation on how the solution is developed as these notebooks are developed by experts for experts. The objective of this notebook is to follow a step-by-step workflow, explaining each step and rationale for every decision we take during solution development.\\n\\n## Workflow stages\\n\\nThe competition solution workflow goes through seven stages described in the Data Science Solutions book.\\n\\n1. Question or problem definition.\\n2. Acquire training and testing data.\\n3. Wrangle, prepare, cleanse the data.\\n4. Analyze, identify patterns, and explore the data.\\n5. Model, predict and solve the problem.\\n6. Visualize, report, and present the problem solving steps and final solution.\\n7. Supply or submit the results.\\n\\nThe workflow indicates general sequence of how each stage may follow the other. However there are use cases with exceptions.\\n\\n- We may combine mulitple workflow stages. We may analyze by visualizing data.\\n- Perform a stage earlier than indicated. We may analyze data before and after wrangling.\\n- Perform a stage multiple times in our workflow. Visualize stage may be used multiple times.\\n- Drop a stage altogether. We may not need supply stage to productize or service enable our dataset for a competition.\\n\\n\\n## Question and problem definition\\n\\nCompetition sites like Kaggle define the problem to solve or questions to ask while providing the datasets for training your data science model and testing the model results against a test dataset. The question or problem definition for Titanic Survival competition is [described here at Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).\\n\\n> Knowing from a training set of samples listing passengers who survived or did not survive the Titanic disaster, can our model determine based on a given test dataset not containing the survival information, if these passengers in the test dataset survived or not.\\n\\nWe may also want to develop some early understanding about the domain of our problem. This is described on the [Kaggle competition description page here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). Here are the highlights to note.\\n\\n- On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. Translated 32% survival rate.\\n- One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew.\\n- Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.\\n\\n## Workflow goals\\n\\nThe data science solutions workflow solves for seven major goals.\\n\\n**Classifying.** We may want to classify or categorize our samples. We may also want to understand the implications or correlation of different classes with our solution goal.\\n\\n**Correlating.** One can approach the problem based on available features within the training dataset. Which features within the dataset contribute significantly to our solution goal? Statistically speaking is there a [correlation](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Correlation) among a feature and solution goal? As the feature values change does the solution state change as well, and visa-versa? This can be tested both for numerical and categorical features in the given dataset. We may also want to determine correlation among features other than survival for subsequent goals and workflow stages. Correlating certain features may help in creating, completing, or correcting features.\\n\\n**Converting.** For modeling stage, one needs to prepare the data. Depending on the choice of model algorithm one may require all features to be converted to numerical equivalent values. So for instance converting text categorical values to numeric values.\\n\\n**Completing.** Data preparation may also require us to estimate any missing values within a feature. Model algorithms may work best when there are no missing values.\\n\\n**Correcting.** We may also analyze the given training dataset for errors or possibly innacurate values within features and try to corrent these values or exclude the samples containing the errors. One way to do this is to detect any outliers among our samples or features. We may also completely discard a feature if it is not contribting to the analysis or may significantly skew the results.\\n\\n**Creating.** Can we create new features based on an existing feature or a set of features, such that the new feature follows the correlation, conversion, completeness goals.\\n\\n**Charting.** How to select the right visualization plots and charts depending on nature of the data and the solution goals.\"},{\"metadata\":{\"_uuid\":\"960f8b1937dc4915ce1eb0f82614b1985c4321a4\",\"_cell_guid\":\"56a3be4e-76ef-20c6-25e8-da16147cf6d7\"},\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"source\":\"## Refactor Release 2017-Jan-29\\n\\nWe are significantly refactoring the notebook based on (a) comments received by readers, (b) issues in porting notebook from Jupyter kernel (2.7) to Kaggle kernel (3.5), and (c) review of few more best practice kernels.\\n\\n### User comments\\n\\n- Combine training and test data for certain operations like converting titles across dataset to numerical values.

Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.\\n\\nWhile there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.\\n\\nIn this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).\\n\\n> #### Recommended Tutorial\\n> We highly recommend [Alexis Cook’s Titanic Tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/titanic-tutorial) that walks you through making your very first submission step by step and [this starter notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/gusthema/titanic-competition-w-tensorflow-decision-forests) to get started.\\n\\n## How Kaggle’s Competitions Work\\n1. **Join the Competition**\\nRead about the challenge description, accept the Competition Rules and gain access to the competition dataset.\\n1.  **Get to Work**\\nDownload the data, build models on it locally or on Kaggle Notebooks (our no-setup, customizable Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs) and generate a prediction file.\\n1.  **Make a Submission**\\nUpload your prediction as a submission on Kaggle and receive an accuracy score.\\n1.  **Check the Leaderboard**\\nSee how your model ranks against other Kagglers on our leaderboard. \\n1.  **Improve Your Score**\\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a> to find lots of tutorials and insights from other competitors.\\n\\n> #### Kaggle Lingo Video\\n> You may run into unfamiliar lingo as you dig into the Kaggle discussion forums and public notebooks. Check out  Dr. Rachael Tatman’s [video on Kaggle Lingo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEJHyuWKd-s) to get up to speed!\\n\\n## What Data Will I Use in This Competition?\\nIn this competition, you’ll gain access to two similar datasets that include passenger information like name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc. One dataset is titled `train.csv` and the other is titled `test.csv`.\\n\\n`Train.csv` will contain the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 to be exact) and importantly, will reveal whether they survived or not, also known as the “ground truth”.\\n\\nThe `test.csv` dataset contains similar information but does not disclose the “ground truth” for each passenger. It’s your job to predict these outcomes.\\n\\nUsing the patterns you find in the `train.csv` data, predict whether the other 418 passengers on board (found in `test.csv`) survived.\\n\\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data\">“Data” tab</a> to explore the datasets even further. Once you feel you’ve created a competitive model, submit it to Kaggle to see where your model stands on our leaderboard against other Kagglers.\\n\\n## How to Submit your Prediction to Kaggle\\nOnce you’re ready to make a submission and get on the leaderboard:\\n\\n1. Click on the “Submit Predictions” button\\n<img width=\"699\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen1.png\">\\n1. Upload a CSV file in the submission file format. You’re able to submit 10 submissions a day.\\n<img width=\"699\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen2.png\">\\n\\n## Submission File Format:\\nYou should submit a csv file with exactly 418 entries plus a header row. Your submission will show an error if you have extra columns (beyond `PassengerId` and `Survived`) or rows.\\n\\nThe file should have exactly 2 columns:\\n- `PassengerId` (sorted in any order)\\n- `Survived` (contains your binary predictions: 1 for survived, 0 for deceased)\\n\\n## Got it! I’m ready to get started. Where do I get help if I need it?\\n- For Competition Help: <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\">Titanic Discussion Forum</a>\\n\\nKaggle doesn’t have a dedicated team to help troubleshoot your code so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. The forums are full of useful information on the data, metric, and different approaches. We encourage you to use the forums often. If you share your knowledge, you\\'ll find that others will share a lot in turn!\\n\\n## A Last Word on Kaggle Notebooks\\nAs we mentioned before, Kaggle Notebooks is our no-setup, customizable, Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs and a huge repository of community published data &amp; code.\\n\\nIn every competition, you’ll find many Notebooks shared with incredible insights. It’s an invaluable resource worth becoming familiar with.

They are a great place to begin if you are new to data science or just finished a MOOC and want to get involved in Kaggle.</p>\\n<p>Getting Started competitions are a non-competitive way to get familiar with Kaggle’s platform, learn basic machine learning concepts, and start meeting people in the community. They have no cash prize and are on a rolling timeline.</p>\\n<h2>How do I create and manage a team?</h2>\\n<p>When you accept the competition rules, a team will be created for you. You can invite others to your team, accept a merger with another team, and update basic information like team name by going to the More &gt; <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/team\" target=\"_blank\">Team</a> page.</p>\\n<p>We\\'ve heard from many Kagglers that teaming up is the best way to learn new skills AND have fun. If you don\\'t have a teammate already, consider asking if anyone wants to team up in the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a>.</p>\\n<h2>What are Notebooks?</h2>\\n<p>Kaggle Notebooks is a cloud computational environment that enables reproducible and collaborative analysis. Notebooks support scripts in Python and R, Jupyter Notebooks, and RMarkdown reports. You can visit the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/notebooks\" target=\"_blank\">Notebooks</a> tab to view all of the publicly shared code for the Titanic competition. For more on how to use Notebooks to learn data science, check out our <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview\" target=\"&quot;_blank\">Courses</a>!</p>\\n<h2>Why did my team disappear from the leaderboard?</h2>\\n<p>To keep with the spirit of getting-started competitions, we have implemented a two month rolling window on submissions. Once a submission is more than two months old, it will be invalidated and no longer count towards the leaderboard.</p>\\n<p>If your team has no submissions in the previous two months, the team will also drop from the leaderboard. This will keep the leaderboard at a manageable size, freshen it up, and prevent newcomers from getting lost in a sea of abandoned scores.</p>\\n<p><i>\"I worked so hard to get that score! Give it back!\"</i> Read more about our decision to implement a rolling leaderboard <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion/6240\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\\n<h2>How do I contact Support?</h2>\\n<p>Kaggle does not have a dedicated support team so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. (For this competition, you’ll want to use the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">Titanic discussion forum)</a>.</p>\\n<p>Support is only able to help with issues that are being experienced by all participants. Before contacting support, please check the discussion forum for information on your problem. If you can’t find it, you can post your problem in the forum so a fellow participant or a Kaggle team member can provide help. The forums are full of useful information on the data, metric, and different approaches. We encourage you to use the forums often. If you share your knowledge, you\\'ll find that others will share a lot in turn!</p>\\n<p>If your problem persists or it seems to be effective all participants then please <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/contact\" target=\"_blank\">contact us</a>.</p>'}, {'role': 'tool', 'content': 'Not a directory: /home/code/exploration/../research/writeups'}, {'role': 'tool', 'content': '/home/code/exploration/../research/kernels:\\n[DIR]  alexisbcook_exercise-arithmetic-and-variables/\\n[DIR]  alexisbcook_titanic-tutorial/\\n[DIR]  arthurtok_introduction-to-ensembling-stacking-in-python/\\n[DIR]  ldfreeman3_a-data-science-framework-to-achieve-99-accuracy/\\n[FILE] metadata.json (1.7KB)\\n[DIR]  startupsci_titanic-data-science-solutions/'}, {'role': 'tool', 'content': '/home/data:\\n[FILE] description.md (13.6KB)\\n[FILE] gender_submission.csv (3.2KB)\\n[FILE] test.csv (28.0KB)\\n[FILE] train.csv (59.8KB)'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': \"REASONING: This is the classic Titanic survival prediction problem - binary classification with accuracy as the metric.

In laymen terms this means, it either occurred or did not occur. For example, you won or did not win, you passed the test or did not pass the test, you were accepted or not accepted, and you get the point. A common business application is churn or customer retention. Another popular use case is, healthcare\\'s mortality rate or survival analysis. Binary events create an interesting dynamic, because we know statistically, a random guess should achieve a 50% accuracy rate, without creating one single algorithm or writing one single line of code. However, just like autocorrect spellcheck technology, sometimes we humans can be too smart for our own good and actually underperform a coin flip. In this kernel, I use Kaggle\\'s Getting Started Competition, Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster, to walk the reader through, how-to use the data science framework to beat the odds.\\\\n   \\\\n*What happens when technology is too smart for its own good?*\\\\n![Funny Autocorrect](http://15858-presscdn-0-65.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/hilarious-autocorrect-fails-20x.jpg)\",\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"metadata\":{\"_cell_guid\":\"ec31d549-537e-4f35-8594-22ef03079081\",\"_uuid\":\"ff6c70c884a8a5fb3258e7f3fefc9e55261df1df\"}},{\"source\":\"<a id=\\\\\"ch2\\\\\"></a>\\\\n# A Data Science Framework\\\\n1. **Define the Problem:** If data science, big data, machine learning, predictive analytics, business intelligence, or any other buzzword is the solution, then what is the problem? As the saying goes, don\\'t put the cart before the horse. Problems before requirements, requirements before solutions, solutions before design, and design before technology. Too often we are quick to jump on the new shiny technology, tool, or algorithm before determining the actual problem we are trying to solve.\\\\n2. **Gather the Data:** John Naisbitt wrote in his 1984 (yes, 1984) book Megatrends, we are “drowning in data, yet staving for knowledge.\\\\\" So, chances are, the dataset(s) already exist somewhere, in some format. It may be external or internal, structured or unstructured, static or streamed, objective or subjective, etc. As the saying goes, you don\\'t have to reinvent the wheel, you just have to know where to find it. In the next step, we will worry about transforming \\\\\"dirty data\\\\\" to \\\\\"clean data.\\\\\"\\\\n3. **Prepare Data for Consumption:** This step is often referred to as data wrangling, a required process to turn “wild” data into “manageable” data. Data wrangling includes implementing data architectures for storage and processing, developing data governance standards for quality and control, data extraction (i.e. ETL and web scraping), and data cleaning to identify aberrant, missing, or outlier data points.\\\\n4. **Perform Exploratory Analysis:** Anybody who has ever worked with data knows, garbage-in, garbage-out (GIGO). Therefore, it is important to deploy descriptive and graphical statistics to look for potential problems, patterns, classifications, correlations and comparisons in the dataset. In addition, data categorization (i.e. qualitative vs quantitative) is also important to understand and select the correct hypothesis test or data model.\\\\n5. **Model Data:** Like descriptive and inferential statistics, data modeling can either summarize the data or predict future outcomes. Your dataset and expected results, will determine the algorithms available for use. It\\'s important to remember, algorithms are tools and not magical wands or silver bullets. You must still be the master craft (wo)man that knows how-to select the right tool for the job. An analogy would be asking someone to hand you a Philip screwdriver, and they hand you a flathead screwdriver or worst a hammer. At best, it shows a complete lack of understanding. At worst, it makes completing the project impossible. The same is true in data modelling. The wrong model can lead to poor performance at best and the wrong conclusion (that’s used as actionable intelligence) at worst.\\\\n6. **Validate and Implement Data Model:** After you\\'ve trained your model based on a subset of your data, it\\'s time to test your model. This helps ensure you haven\\'t overfit your model or made it so specific to the selected subset, that it does not accurately fit another subset from the same dataset. In this step we determine if our [model overfit, generalize, or underfit our dataset](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/latest/dg/model-fit-underfitting-vs-overfitting.html).\\\\n7. **Optimize and Strategize:** This is the \\\\\"bionic man\\\\\" step, where you iterate back through the process to make it better...stronger...faster than it was before. As a data scientist, your strategy should be to outsource developer operations and application plumbing, so you have more time to focus on recommendations and design. Once you\\'re able to package your ideas, this becomes your “currency exchange\\\\\" rate.\",\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"metadata\":{\"_cell_guid\":\"8514a868-6816-494a-9e9c-dba14cb36f42\",\"_uuid\":\"bd2a68dcaace0c1371f2994f0204dce65800cc20\"}},{\"source\":\"<a id=\\\\\"ch3\\\\\"></a>\\\\n# Step 1: Define the Problem\\\\nFor this project, the problem statement is given to us on a golden plater, develop an algorithm to predict the survival outcome of passengers on the Titanic.\\\\n\\\\n......\\\\n\\\\n**Project Summary:**\\\\nThe sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.\\\\n\\\\nOne of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.\\\\n\\\\nIn this challenge, we ask you to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular, we ask you to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.\\\\n\\\\nPractice Skills\\\\n* Binary classification\\\\n* Python and R basics\\\\n\\\\n# Step 2: Gather the Data\\\\n\\\\nThe dataset is also given to us on a golden plater with test and train data at [Kaggle\\'s Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)\\\\n\",\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"metadata\":{\"_cell_guid\":\"22ba49b5-b3b6-4129-8c57-623e0d863ab3\",\"_uuid\":\"ff014109d795c5d1bfcc66c9761730406124ebe4\"}},{\"source\":\"<a id=\\\\\"ch4\\\\\"></a>\\\\n# Step 3: Prepare Data for Consumption\\\\nSince step 2 was provided to us on a golden plater, so is step 3.

Using the same dataset and different implementation of a decision tree (adaboost, random forest, gradient boost, xgboost, etc.) with tuning does not exceed the 0.77990 submission accuracy. Interesting for this dataset, the simple decision tree algorithm had the best default submission score and with tuning achieved the same best accuracy score.\\\\n\\\\nWhile no general conclusions can be made from testing a handful of algorithms on a single dataset, there are several observations on the mentioned dataset. \\\\n1. The train dataset has a different distribution than the test/validation dataset and population. This created wide margins between the cross validation (CV) accuracy score and Kaggle submission accuracy score.\\\\n2. Given the same dataset, decision tree based algorithms, seemed to converge on the same accuracy score after proper tuning.\\\\n3. Despite tuning, no machine learning algorithm, exceeded the homemade algorithm. The author will theorize, that for small datasets, a manmade algorithm is the bar to beat. \\\\n\\\\nWith that in mind, for iteration two, I would spend more time on preprocessing and feature engineering.

In a nutshell stacking uses as a first-level (base), the predictions of a few basic classifiers and then uses another model at the second-level to predict the output from the earlier first-level predictions.\\\\n\\\\nThe Titanic dataset is a prime candidate for introducing this concept as many newcomers to Kaggle start out here. Furthermore even though stacking has been responsible for many a team winning Kaggle competitions there seems to be a dearth of kernels on this topic so I hope this notebook can fill somewhat of that void.\\\\n\\\\nI myself am quite a newcomer to the Kaggle scene as well and the first proper ensembling/stacking script that I managed to chance upon and study was one written in the AllState Severity Claims competition by the great Faron. The material in this notebook borrows heavily from Faron\\'s script although ported to factor in ensembles of classifiers whilst his was ensembles of regressors. Anyway please check out his script here:\\\\n\\\\n[Stacking Starter][1] : by Faron \\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNow onto the notebook at hand and I hope that it manages to do justice and convey the concept of ensembling in an intuitive and concise manner.  My other standalone Kaggle [script][2] which implements exactly the same ensembling steps (albeit with different parameters) discussed below gives a Public LB score of 0.808 which is good enough to get to the top 9% and runs just under 4 minutes. Therefore I am pretty sure there is a lot of room to improve and add on to that script. Anyways please feel free to leave me any comments with regards to how I can improve\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n  [1]: https://www.kaggle.com/mmueller/allstate-claims-severity/stacking-starter/run/390867\\\\n  [2]: https://www.kaggle.com/arthurtok/titanic/simple-stacking-with-xgboost-0-808\"},{\"metadata\":{\"_execution_state\":\"idle\",\"_cell_guid\":\"14630296-b1aa-759e-bafa-b6a73f3896ed\",\"_uuid\":\"2e37a274400cfeb472b6405d524325245588dd66\",\"trusted\":true},\"cell_type\":\"code\",\"source\":\"# Load in our libraries\\\\nimport pandas as pd\\\\nimport numpy as np\\\\nimport re\\\\nimport sklearn\\\\nimport xgboost as xgb\\\\nimport seaborn as sns\\\\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\\\\n%matplotlib inline\\\\n\\\\nimport plotly.offline as py\\\\npy.init_notebook_mode(connected=True)\\\\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\\\\nimport plotly.tools as tls\\\\n\\\\nimport warnings\\\\nwarnings.filterwarnings(\\'ignore\\')\\\\n\\\\n# Going to use these 5 base models for the stacking\\\\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import (RandomForestClassifier, AdaBoostClassifier, \\\\n                              GradientBoostingClassifier, ExtraTreesClassifier)\\\\nfrom sklearn.svm import SVC\\\\nfrom sklearn.cross_validation import KFold\",\"execution_count\":1,\"outputs\":[]},{\"metadata\":{\"_uuid\":\"8b590aafe06a2ac55daae9d2456155e457914f5f\",\"_cell_guid\":\"d647b74c-099b-851a-dcd2-3a58c9e8f10c\"},\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"source\":\"# Feature Exploration, Engineering and Cleaning \\\\n\\\\nNow we will proceed much like how most kernels in general are structured, and that is to first explore the data on hand, identify possible feature engineering opportunities as well as numerically encode any categorical features.\"},{\"metadata\":{\"_execution_state\":\"idle\",\"_cell_guid\":\"5937fd72-d1ad-f678-cc82-f08a96e4cad0\",\"_uuid\":\"b2ad78041b69ce13d1f41bd9bc8c93cafaf7b8ac\",\"trusted\":true},\"cell_type\":\"code\",\"source\":\"# Load in the train and test datasets\\\\ntrain = pd.read_csv(\\'../input/train.csv\\')\\\\ntest = pd.read_csv(\\'../input/test.csv\\')\\\\n\\\\n# Store our passenger ID for easy access\\\\nPassengerId = test[\\'PassengerId\\']\\\\n\\\\ntrain.head(3)\",\"execution_count\":2,\"outputs\":[]},{\"metadata\":{\"_uuid\":\"81378834770e55c76751347588322fe32acf5737\",\"_cell_guid\":\"dff1c1dd-1e59-3907-88fa-1a1d699122be\"},\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"source\":\"Well it is no surprise that our task is to somehow extract the information out of the categorical variables \\\\n\\\\n**Feature Engineering**\\\\n\\\\nHere, credit must be extended to Sina\\'s very comprehensive and well-thought out notebook for the feature engineering ideas so please check out his work \\\\n\\\\n[Titanic Best Working Classfier][1] : by Sina\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n  [1]: https://www.kaggle.com/sinakhorami/titanic/titanic-best-working-classifier\"},{\"metadata\":{\"collapsed\":true,\"_execution_state\":\"idle\",\"_cell_guid\":\"e85b2a80-88a4-928f-f2b2-24895dea38f3\",\"_uuid\":\"b1c67249f91768ce8e5e2751364d32c87446cf55\",\"trusted\":true},\"cell_type\":\"code\",\"source\":\"full_data = [train, test]\\\\n\\\\n# Some features of my own that I have added in\\\\n# Gives the length of the name\\\\ntrain[\\'Name_length\\'] = train[\\'Name\\'].apply(len)\\\\ntest[\\'Name_length\\'] = test[\\'Name\\'].apply(len)\\\\n# Feature that tells whether a passenger had a cabin on the Titanic\\\\ntrain[\\'Has_Cabin\\'] = train[\\\\\"Cabin\\\\\"].apply(lambda x: 0 if type(x) == float else 1)\\\\ntest[\\'Has_Cabin\\'] = test[\\\\\"Cabin\\\\\"].apply(lambda x: 0 if type(x) == float else 1)\\\\n\\\\n# Feature engineering steps taken from Sina\\\\n# Create new feature FamilySize as a combination of SibSp and Parch\\\\nfor dataset in full_data:\\\\n    dataset[\\'FamilySize\\'] = dataset[\\'SibSp\\'] + dataset[\\'Parch\\'] + 1\\\\n# Create new feature IsAlone from FamilySize\\\\nfor dataset in full_data:\\\\n    dataset[\\'IsAlone\\'] = 0\\\\n    dataset.loc[dataset[\\'FamilySize\\'] == 1, \\'IsAlone\\'] = 1\\\\n# Remove all NULLS in the Embarked column\\\\nfor dataset in full_data:\\\\n    dataset[\\'Embarked\\'] = dataset[\\'Embarked\\'].fillna(\\'S\\')\\\\n# Remove all NULLS in the Fare column and create a new feature CategoricalFare\\\\nfor dataset in full_data:\\\\n    dataset[\\'Fare\\'] = dataset[\\'Fare\\'].fillna(train[\\'Fare\\'].median())\\\\ntrain[\\'CategoricalFare\\'] = pd.qcut(train[\\'Fare\\'], 4)\\\\n# Create a New feature CategoricalAge\\\\nfor dataset in full_data:\\\\n    age_avg = dataset[\\'Age\\'].mean()\\\\n    age_std = dataset[\\'Age\\'].std()\\\\n    age_null_count = dataset[\\'Age\\'].isnull().sum()\\\\n    age_null_random_list = np.random.randint(age_avg -

However many will skip some of the explanation on how the solution is developed as these notebooks are developed by experts for experts. The objective of this notebook is to follow a step-by-step workflow, explaining each step and rationale for every decision we take during solution development.\\\\n\\\\n## Workflow stages\\\\n\\\\nThe competition solution workflow goes through seven stages described in the Data Science Solutions book.\\\\n\\\\n1. Question or problem definition.\\\\n2. Acquire training and testing data.\\\\n3. Wrangle, prepare, cleanse the data.\\\\n4. Analyze, identify patterns, and explore the data.\\\\n5. Model, predict and solve the problem.\\\\n6. Visualize, report, and present the problem solving steps and final solution.\\\\n7. Supply or submit the results.\\\\n\\\\nThe workflow indicates general sequence of how each stage may follow the other. However there are use cases with exceptions.\\\\n\\\\n- We may combine mulitple workflow stages. We may analyze by visualizing data.\\\\n- Perform a stage earlier than indicated. We may analyze data before and after wrangling.\\\\n- Perform a stage multiple times in our workflow. Visualize stage may be used multiple times.\\\\n- Drop a stage altogether. We may not need supply stage to productize or service enable our dataset for a competition.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Question and problem definition\\\\n\\\\nCompetition sites like Kaggle define the problem to solve or questions to ask while providing the datasets for training your data science model and testing the model results against a test dataset. The question or problem definition for Titanic Survival competition is [described here at Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).\\\\n\\\\n> Knowing from a training set of samples listing passengers who survived or did not survive the Titanic disaster, can our model determine based on a given test dataset not containing the survival information, if these passengers in the test dataset survived or not.\\\\n\\\\nWe may also want to develop some early understanding about the domain of our problem. This is described on the [Kaggle competition description page here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). Here are the highlights to note.\\\\n\\\\n- On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. Translated 32% survival rate.\\\\n- One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew.\\\\n- Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.\\\\n\\\\n## Workflow goals\\\\n\\\\nThe data science solutions workflow solves for seven major goals.\\\\n\\\\n**Classifying.** We may want to classify or categorize our samples. We may also want to understand the implications or correlation of different classes with our solution goal.\\\\n\\\\n**Correlating.** One can approach the problem based on available features within the training dataset. Which features within the dataset contribute significantly to our solution goal? Statistically speaking is there a [correlation](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Correlation) among a feature and solution goal? As the feature values change does the solution state change as well, and visa-versa? This can be tested both for numerical and categorical features in the given dataset. We may also want to determine correlation among features other than survival for subsequent goals and workflow stages. Correlating certain features may help in creating, completing, or correcting features.\\\\n\\\\n**Converting.** For modeling stage, one needs to prepare the data. Depending on the choice of model algorithm one may require all features to be converted to numerical equivalent values. So for instance converting text categorical values to numeric values.\\\\n\\\\n**Completing.** Data preparation may also require us to estimate any missing values within a feature. Model algorithms may work best when there are no missing values.\\\\n\\\\n**Correcting.** We may also analyze the given training dataset for errors or possibly innacurate values within features and try to corrent these values or exclude the samples containing the errors. One way to do this is to detect any outliers among our samples or features. We may also completely discard a feature if it is not contribting to the analysis or may significantly skew the results.\\\\n\\\\n**Creating.** Can we create new features based on an existing feature or a set of features, such that the new feature follows the correlation, conversion, completeness goals.\\\\n\\\\n**Charting.** How to select the right visualization plots and charts depending on nature of the data and the solution goals.\"},{\"metadata\":{\"_uuid\":\"960f8b1937dc4915ce1eb0f82614b1985c4321a4\",\"_cell_guid\":\"56a3be4e-76ef-20c6-25e8-da16147cf6d7\"},\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"source\":\"## Refactor Release 2017-Jan-29\\\\n\\\\nWe are significantly refactoring the notebook based on (a) comments received by readers, (b) issues in porting notebook from Jupyter kernel (2.7) to Kaggle kernel (3.5), and (c) review of few more best practice kernels.\\\\n\\\\n### User comments\\\\n\\\\n- Combine training and test data for certain operations like converting titles across dataset to numerical values.

Once you’re ready to start competing, click on the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/account/login?returnUrl=%2Fc%2Ftitanic\" target=\"_blank\">\"Join Competition button</a> to create an account and gain access to the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data\" target=\"_blank\">competition data</a>. Then check out <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/titanic-tutorial\">Alexis Cook’s Titanic Tutorial</a> that walks you through step by step how to make your first submission!\n\n<iframe width=\"699\" height=\"368\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8yZMXCaFshs\" title=\"YouTube video | How to Get Started with Kaggle’s Titanic Competition | Kaggle\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n## The Challenge\nThe sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.\n\nOn April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.\n\nWhile there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.\n\nIn this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).\n\n> #### Recommended Tutorial\n> We highly recommend [Alexis Cook’s Titanic Tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/titanic-tutorial) that walks you through making your very first submission step by step and [this starter notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/gusthema/titanic-competition-w-tensorflow-decision-forests) to get started.\n\n## How Kaggle’s Competitions Work\n1. **Join the Competition**\nRead about the challenge description, accept the Competition Rules and gain access to the competition dataset.\n1.  **Get to Work**\nDownload the data, build models on it locally or on Kaggle Notebooks (our no-setup, customizable Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs) and generate a prediction file.\n1.  **Make a Submission**\nUpload your prediction as a submission on Kaggle and receive an accuracy score.\n1.  **Check the Leaderboard**\nSee how your model ranks against other Kagglers on our leaderboard. \n1.  **Improve Your Score**\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a> to find lots of tutorials and insights from other competitors.\n\n> #### Kaggle Lingo Video\n> You may run into unfamiliar lingo as you dig into the Kaggle discussion forums and public notebooks. Check out  Dr. Rachael Tatman’s [video on Kaggle Lingo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEJHyuWKd-s) to get up to speed!\n\n## What Data Will I Use in This Competition?\nIn this competition, you’ll gain access to two similar datasets that include passenger information like name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc. One dataset is titled `train.csv` and the other is titled `test.csv`.\n\n`Train.csv` will contain the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 to be exact) and importantly, will reveal whether they survived or not, also known as the “ground truth”.\n\nThe `test.csv` dataset contains similar information but does not disclose the “ground truth” for each passenger. It’s your job to predict these outcomes.\n\nUsing the patterns you find in the `train.csv` data, predict whether the other 418 passengers on board (found in `test.csv`) survived.\n\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data\">“Data” tab</a> to explore the datasets even further. Once you feel you’ve created a competitive model, submit it to Kaggle to see where your model stands on our leaderboard against other Kagglers.\n\n## How to Submit your Prediction to Kaggle\nOnce you’re ready to make a submission and get on the leaderboard:\n\n1. Click on the “Submit Predictions” button\n<img width=\"699\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen1.png\">\n1. Upload a CSV file in the submission file format. You’re able to submit 10 submissions a day.\n<img width=\"699\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen2.png\">\n\n## Submission File Format:\nYou should submit a csv file with exactly 418 entries plus a header row. Your submission will show an error if you have extra columns (beyond `PassengerId` and `Survived`) or rows.\n\nThe file should have exactly 2 columns:\n- `PassengerId` (sorted in any order)\n- `Survived` (contains your binary predictions: 1 for survived, 0 for deceased)\n\n## Got it! I’m ready to get started. Where do I get help if I need it?\n- For Competition Help: <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\">Titanic Discussion Forum</a>\n\nKaggle doesn’t have a dedicated team to help troubleshoot your code so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. The forums are full of useful information on the data, metric, and different approaches. We encourage you to use the forums often. If you share your knowledge, you'll find that others will share a lot in turn!\n\n## A Last Word on Kaggle Notebooks\nAs we mentioned before, Kaggle Notebooks is our no-setup, customizable, Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs and a huge repository of community published data &amp; code.\n\nIn every competition, you’ll find many Notebooks shared with incredible insights. It’s an invaluable resource worth becoming familiar with. Check out this competition’s Notebooks <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/notebooks\">here</a>.\n\n## 🏃‍♀Ready to Compete? <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/account/login?returnUrl=%2Fc%2Ftitanic\">Join the Competition Here!</a>\n\n## Evaluation\n\n<h2>Goal</h2>\n<p>It is your job to predict if a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic or not. <br>For each  in the test set, you must predict a 0 or 1 value for the  variable.</p>\n<h2>Metric</h2>\n<p>Your score is the percentage of passengers you correctly predict.

They are a great place to begin if you are new to data science or just finished a MOOC and want to get involved in Kaggle.</p>\n<p>Getting Started competitions are a non-competitive way to get familiar with Kaggle’s platform, learn basic machine learning concepts, and start meeting people in the community. They have no cash prize and are on a rolling timeline.</p>\n<h2>How do I create and manage a team?</h2>\n<p>When you accept the competition rules, a team will be created for you. You can invite others to your team, accept a merger with another team, and update basic information like team name by going to the More &gt; <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/team\" target=\"_blank\">Team</a> page.</p>\n<p>We've heard from many Kagglers that teaming up is the best way to learn new skills AND have fun. If you don't have a teammate already, consider asking if anyone wants to team up in the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a>.</p>\n<h2>What are Notebooks?</h2>\n<p>Kaggle Notebooks is a cloud computational environment that enables reproducible and collaborative analysis. Notebooks support scripts in Python and R, Jupyter Notebooks, and RMarkdown reports. You can visit the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/notebooks\" target=\"_blank\">Notebooks</a> tab to view all of the publicly shared code for the Titanic competition. For more on how to use Notebooks to learn data science, check out our <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview\" target=\"&quot;_blank\">Courses</a>!</p>\n<h2>Why did my team disappear from the leaderboard?</h2>\n<p>To keep with the spirit of getting-started competitions, we have implemented a two month rolling window on submissions. Once a submission is more than two months old, it will be invalidated and no longer count towards the leaderboard.</p>\n<p>If your team has no submissions in the previous two months, the team will also drop from the leaderboard. This will keep the leaderboard at a manageable size, freshen it up, and prevent newcomers from getting lost in a sea of abandoned scores.</p>\n<p><i>\"I worked so hard to get that score! Give it back!\"</i> Read more about our decision to implement a rolling leaderboard <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion/6240\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n<h2>How do I contact Support?</h2>\n<p>Kaggle does not have a dedicated support team so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. (For this competition, you’ll want to use the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">Titanic discussion forum)</a>.</p>\n<p>Support is only able to help with issues that are being experienced by all participants. Before contacting support, please check the discussion forum for information on your problem.

Not only will you be able to submit your first competition, but you’ll be able to solve any problem thrown your way. I provide clear explanations, clean code, and plenty of links to resources. *Please Note: This Kernel is still being improved. So check the Change Logs below for updates.

If you don't understand something in the code the print() function is your best friend. In coding, it's okay to try, fail, and try again. If you do run into problems, Google is your second best friend, because 99.99% of the time, someone else had the same question/problem and already asked the coding community. If you've exhausted all your resources, the Kaggle Community via forums and comments can help too.\",\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"metadata\":{\"_cell_guid\":\"ea24845a-4a15-4235-9ed2-4823acbf4317\",\"_uuid\":\"89022d89e1603ef3869a96b9da78da38b0b33b14\"}},{\"source\":\"<a id=\\\"ch1\\\"></a>\\n# How a Data Scientist Beat the Odds\\nIt's the classical problem, predict the outcome of a binary event. In laymen terms this means, it either occurred or did not occur. For example, you won or did not win, you passed the test or did not pass the test, you were accepted or not accepted, and you get the point. A common business application is churn or customer retention. Another popular use case is, healthcare's mortality rate or survival analysis. Binary events create an interesting dynamic, because we know statistically, a random guess should achieve a 50% accuracy rate, without creating one single algorithm or writing one single line of code. However, just like autocorrect spellcheck technology, sometimes we humans can be too smart for our own good and actually underperform a coin flip. In this kernel, I use Kaggle's Getting Started Competition, Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster, to walk the reader through, how-to use the data science framework to beat the odds.\\n   \\n*What happens when technology is too smart for its own good?*\\n![Funny Autocorrect](http://15858-presscdn-0-65.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/hilarious-autocorrect-fails-20x.jpg)\",\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"metadata\":{\"_cell_guid\":\"ec31d549-537e-4f35-8594-22ef03079081\",\"_uuid\":\"ff6c70c884a8a5fb3258e7f3fefc9e55261df1df\"}},{\"source\":\"<a id=\\\"ch2\\\"></a>\\n# A Data Science Framework\\n1. **Define the Problem:** If data science, big data, machine learning, predictive analytics, business intelligence, or any other buzzword is the solution, then what is the problem? As the saying goes, don't put the cart before the horse. Problems before requirements, requirements before solutions, solutions before design, and design before technology. Too often we are quick to jump on the new shiny technology, tool, or algorithm before determining the actual problem we are trying to solve.\\n2. **Gather the Data:** John Naisbitt wrote in his 1984 (yes, 1984) book Megatrends, we are “drowning in data, yet staving for knowledge.\\\" So, chances are, the dataset(s) already exist somewhere, in some format. It may be external or internal, structured or unstructured, static or streamed, objective or subjective, etc. As the saying goes, you don't have to reinvent the wheel, you just have to know where to find it. In the next step, we will worry about transforming \\\"dirty data\\\" to \\\"clean data.\\\"\\n3. **Prepare Data for Consumption:** This step is often referred to as data wrangling, a required process to turn “wild” data into “manageable” data. Data wrangling includes implementing data architectures for storage and processing, developing data governance standards for quality and control, data extraction (i.e. ETL and web scraping), and data cleaning to identify aberrant, missing, or outlier data points.\\n4. **Perform Exploratory Analysis:** Anybody who has ever worked with data knows, garbage-in, garbage-out (GIGO). Therefore, it is important to deploy descriptive and graphical statistics to look for potential problems, patterns, classifications, correlations and comparisons in the dataset. In addition, data categorization (i.e. qualitative vs quantitative) is also important to understand and select the correct hypothesis test or data model.\\n5. **Model Data:** Like descriptive and inferential statistics, data modeling can either summarize the data or predict future outcomes. Your dataset and expected results, will determine the algorithms available for use. It's important to remember, algorithms are tools and not magical wands or silver bullets. You must still be the master craft (wo)man that knows how-to select the right tool for the job. An analogy would be asking someone to hand you a Philip screwdriver, and they hand you a flathead screwdriver or worst a hammer. At best, it shows a complete lack of understanding. At worst, it makes completing the project impossible. The same is true in data modelling. The wrong model can lead to poor performance at best and the wrong conclusion (that’s used as actionable intelligence) at worst.\\n6. **Validate and Implement Data Model:** After you've trained your model based on a subset of your data, it's time to test your model. This helps ensure you haven't overfit your model or made it so specific to the selected subset, that it does not accurately fit another subset from the same dataset. In this step we determine if our [model overfit, generalize, or underfit our dataset](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/latest/dg/model-fit-underfitting-vs-overfitting.html).\\n7. **Optimize and Strategize:** This is the \\\"bionic man\\\" step, where you iterate back through the process to make it better...stronger...faster than it was before. As a data scientist, your strategy should be to outsource developer operations and application plumbing, so you have more time to focus on recommendations and design. Once you're able to package your ideas, this becomes your “currency exchange\\\" rate.\",\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"metadata\":{\"_cell_guid\":\"8514a868-6816-494a-9e9c-dba14cb36f42\",\"_uuid\":\"bd2a68dcaace0c1371f2994f0204dce65800cc20\"}},{\"source\":\"<a id=\\\"ch3\\\"></a>\\n# Step 1: Define the Problem\\nFor this project, the problem statement is given to us on a golden plater, develop an algorithm to predict the survival outcome of passengers on the Titanic.\\n\\n......\\n\\n**Project Summary:**\\nThe sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.\\n\\nOne of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.\\n\\nIn this challenge, we ask you to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular, we ask you to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.\\n\\nPractice Skills\\n* Binary classification\\n* Python and R basics\\n\\n# Step 2: Gather the Data\\n\\nThe dataset is also given to us on a golden plater with test and train data at [Kaggle's Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)\\n\",\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"metadata\":{\"_cell_guid\":\"22ba49b5-b3b6-4129-8c57-623e0d863ab3\",\"_uuid\":\"ff014109d795c5d1bfcc66c9761730406124ebe4\"}},{\"source\":\"<a id=\\\"ch4\\\"></a>\\n# Step 3: Prepare Data for Consumption\\nSince step 2 was provided to us on a golden plater, so is step 3.

Using the same dataset and different implementation of a decision tree (adaboost, random forest, gradient boost, xgboost, etc.) with tuning does not exceed the 0.77990 submission accuracy. Interesting for this dataset, the simple decision tree algorithm had the best default submission score and with tuning achieved the same best accuracy score.\\n\\nWhile no general conclusions can be made from testing a handful of algorithms on a single dataset, there are several observations on the mentioned dataset. \\n1. The train dataset has a different distribution than the test/validation dataset and population. This created wide margins between the cross validation (CV) accuracy score and Kaggle submission accuracy score.\\n2. Given the same dataset, decision tree based algorithms, seemed to converge on the same accuracy score after proper tuning.\\n3. Despite tuning, no machine learning algorithm, exceeded the homemade algorithm. The author will theorize, that for small datasets, a manmade algorithm is the bar to beat. \\n\\nWith that in mind, for iteration two, I would spend more time on preprocessing and feature engineering. In order to better align the CV score and Kaggle score and improve the overall accuracy.\\n\\n\",\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"metadata\":{\"_cell_guid\":\"a6d34edc-1265-41e8-b163-0b817cd3b6a5\",\"_uuid\":\"c476df95925d67809975caca4ea4dcb4b2a0b277\"}},{\"source\":\"<a id=\\\"ch90\\\"></a>\\n## Change Log:\\n11/22/17 Please note, this kernel is currently in progress, but open to feedback.

In a nutshell stacking uses as a first-level (base), the predictions of a few basic classifiers and then uses another model at the second-level to predict the output from the earlier first-level predictions.\\n\\nThe Titanic dataset is a prime candidate for introducing this concept as many newcomers to Kaggle start out here. Furthermore even though stacking has been responsible for many a team winning Kaggle competitions there seems to be a dearth of kernels on this topic so I hope this notebook can fill somewhat of that void.\\n\\nI myself am quite a newcomer to the Kaggle scene as well and the first proper ensembling/stacking script that I managed to chance upon and study was one written in the AllState Severity Claims competition by the great Faron. The material in this notebook borrows heavily from Faron's script although ported to factor in ensembles of classifiers whilst his was ensembles of regressors. Anyway please check out his script here:\\n\\n[Stacking Starter][1] : by Faron \\n\\n\\nNow onto the notebook at hand and I hope that it manages to do justice and convey the concept of ensembling in an intuitive and concise manner.  My other standalone Kaggle [script][2] which implements exactly the same ensembling steps (albeit with different parameters) discussed below gives a Public LB score of 0.808 which is good enough to get to the top 9% and runs just under 4 minutes. Therefore I am pretty sure there is a lot of room to improve and add on to that script.

However many will skip some of the explanation on how the solution is developed as these notebooks are developed by experts for experts. The objective of this notebook is to follow a step-by-step workflow, explaining each step and rationale for every decision we take during solution development.\\n\\n## Workflow stages\\n\\nThe competition solution workflow goes through seven stages described in the Data Science Solutions book.\\n\\n1. Question or problem definition.\\n2. Acquire training and testing data.\\n3. Wrangle, prepare, cleanse the data.\\n4. Analyze, identify patterns, and explore the data.\\n5. Model, predict and solve the problem.\\n6. Visualize, report, and present the problem solving steps and final solution.\\n7. Supply or submit the results.\\n\\nThe workflow indicates general sequence of how each stage may follow the other. However there are use cases with exceptions.\\n\\n- We may combine mulitple workflow stages. We may analyze by visualizing data.\\n- Perform a stage earlier than indicated. We may analyze data before and after wrangling.\\n- Perform a stage multiple times in our workflow. Visualize stage may be used multiple times.\\n- Drop a stage altogether. We may not need supply stage to productize or service enable our dataset for a competition.\\n\\n\\n## Question and problem definition\\n\\nCompetition sites like Kaggle define the problem to solve or questions to ask while providing the datasets for training your data science model and testing the model results against a test dataset. The question or problem definition for Titanic Survival competition is [described here at Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).\\n\\n> Knowing from a training set of samples listing passengers who survived or did not survive the Titanic disaster, can our model determine based on a given test dataset not containing the survival information, if these passengers in the test dataset survived or not.\\n\\nWe may also want to develop some early understanding about the domain of our problem. This is described on the [Kaggle competition description page here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). Here are the highlights to note.\\n\\n- On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. Translated 32% survival rate.\\n- One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew.\\n- Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.\\n\\n## Workflow goals\\n\\nThe data science solutions workflow solves for seven major goals.\\n\\n**Classifying.** We may want to classify or categorize our samples. We may also want to understand the implications or correlation of different classes with our solution goal.\\n\\n**Correlating.** One can approach the problem based on available features within the training dataset. Which features within the dataset contribute significantly to our solution goal? Statistically speaking is there a [correlation](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Correlation) among a feature and solution goal? As the feature values change does the solution state change as well, and visa-versa? This can be tested both for numerical and categorical features in the given dataset. We may also want to determine correlation among features other than survival for subsequent goals and workflow stages. Correlating certain features may help in creating, completing, or correcting features.\\n\\n**Converting.** For modeling stage, one needs to prepare the data. Depending on the choice of model algorithm one may require all features to be converted to numerical equivalent values. So for instance converting text categorical values to numeric values.\\n\\n**Completing.** Data preparation may also require us to estimate any missing values within a feature. Model algorithms may work best when there are no missing values.\\n\\n**Correcting.** We may also analyze the given training dataset for errors or possibly innacurate values within features and try to corrent these values or exclude the samples containing the errors. One way to do this is to detect any outliers among our samples or features. We may also completely discard a feature if it is not contribting to the analysis or may significantly skew the results.\\n\\n**Creating.** Can we create new features based on an existing feature or a set of features, such that the new feature follows the correlation, conversion, completeness goals.\\n\\n**Charting.** How to select the right visualization plots and charts depending on nature of the data and the solution goals.\"},{\"metadata\":{\"_uuid\":\"960f8b1937dc4915ce1eb0f82614b1985c4321a4\",\"_cell_guid\":\"56a3be4e-76ef-20c6-25e8-da16147cf6d7\"},\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"source\":\"## Refactor Release 2017-Jan-29\\n\\nWe are significantly refactoring the notebook based on (a) comments received by readers, (b) issues in porting notebook from Jupyter kernel (2.7) to Kaggle kernel (3.5), and (c) review of few more best practice kernels.\\n\\n### User comments\\n\\n- Combine training and test data for certain operations like converting titles across dataset to numerical values.

Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.\\n\\nWhile there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.\\n\\nIn this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).\\n\\n> #### Recommended Tutorial\\n> We highly recommend [Alexis Cook’s Titanic Tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/titanic-tutorial) that walks you through making your very first submission step by step and [this starter notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/gusthema/titanic-competition-w-tensorflow-decision-forests) to get started.\\n\\n## How Kaggle’s Competitions Work\\n1. **Join the Competition**\\nRead about the challenge description, accept the Competition Rules and gain access to the competition dataset.\\n1.  **Get to Work**\\nDownload the data, build models on it locally or on Kaggle Notebooks (our no-setup, customizable Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs) and generate a prediction file.\\n1.  **Make a Submission**\\nUpload your prediction as a submission on Kaggle and receive an accuracy score.\\n1.  **Check the Leaderboard**\\nSee how your model ranks against other Kagglers on our leaderboard. \\n1.  **Improve Your Score**\\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a> to find lots of tutorials and insights from other competitors.\\n\\n> #### Kaggle Lingo Video\\n> You may run into unfamiliar lingo as you dig into the Kaggle discussion forums and public notebooks. Check out  Dr. Rachael Tatman’s [video on Kaggle Lingo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEJHyuWKd-s) to get up to speed!\\n\\n## What Data Will I Use in This Competition?\\nIn this competition, you’ll gain access to two similar datasets that include passenger information like name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc. One dataset is titled `train.csv` and the other is titled `test.csv`.\\n\\n`Train.csv` will contain the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 to be exact) and importantly, will reveal whether they survived or not, also known as the “ground truth”.\\n\\nThe `test.csv` dataset contains similar information but does not disclose the “ground truth” for each passenger. It’s your job to predict these outcomes.\\n\\nUsing the patterns you find in the `train.csv` data, predict whether the other 418 passengers on board (found in `test.csv`) survived.\\n\\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data\">“Data” tab</a> to explore the datasets even further. Once you feel you’ve created a competitive model, submit it to Kaggle to see where your model stands on our leaderboard against other Kagglers.\\n\\n## How to Submit your Prediction to Kaggle\\nOnce you’re ready to make a submission and get on the leaderboard:\\n\\n1.

They are a great place to begin if you are new to data science or just finished a MOOC and want to get involved in Kaggle.</p>\\n<p>Getting Started competitions are a non-competitive way to get familiar with Kaggle’s platform, learn basic machine learning concepts, and start meeting people in the community. They have no cash prize and are on a rolling timeline.</p>\\n<h2>How do I create and manage a team?</h2>\\n<p>When you accept the competition rules, a team will be created for you. You can invite others to your team, accept a merger with another team, and update basic information like team name by going to the More &gt; <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/team\" target=\"_blank\">Team</a> page.</p>\\n<p>We\\'ve heard from many Kagglers that teaming up is the best way to learn new skills AND have fun. If you don\\'t have a teammate already, consider asking if anyone wants to team up in the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a>.</p>\\n<h2>What are Notebooks?</h2>\\n<p>Kaggle Notebooks is a cloud computational environment that enables reproducible and collaborative analysis. Notebooks support scripts in Python and R, Jupyter Notebooks, and RMarkdown reports. You can visit the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/notebooks\" target=\"_blank\">Notebooks</a> tab to view all of the publicly shared code for the Titanic competition. For more on how to use Notebooks to learn data science, check out our <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview\" target=\"&quot;_blank\">Courses</a>!</p>\\n<h2>Why did my team disappear from the leaderboard?</h2>\\n<p>To keep with the spirit of getting-started competitions, we have implemented a two month rolling window on submissions. Once a submission is more than two months old, it will be invalidated and no longer count towards the leaderboard.</p>\\n<p>If your team has no submissions in the previous two months, the team will also drop from the leaderboard. This will keep the leaderboard at a manageable size, freshen it up, and prevent newcomers from getting lost in a sea of abandoned scores.</p>\\n<p><i>\"I worked so hard to get that score! Give it back!\"</i> Read more about our decision to implement a rolling leaderboard <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion/6240\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\\n<h2>How do I contact Support?</h2>\\n<p>Kaggle does not have a dedicated support team so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. (For this competition, you’ll want to use the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">Titanic discussion forum)</a>.</p>\\n<p>Support is only able to help with issues that are being experienced by all participants. Before contacting support, please check the discussion forum for information on your problem. If you can’t find it, you can post your problem in the forum so a fellow participant or a Kaggle team member can provide help. The forums are full of useful information on the data, metric, and different approaches. We encourage you to use the forums often. If you share your knowledge, you\\'ll find that others will share a lot in turn!</p>\\n<p>If your problem persists or it seems to be effective all participants then please <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/contact\" target=\"_blank\">contact us</a>.</p>'}, {'role': 'tool', 'content': 'Not a directory: /home/code/exploration/../research/writeups'}, {'role': 'tool', 'content': '/home/code/exploration/../research/kernels:\\n[DIR]  alexisbcook_exercise-arithmetic-and-variables/\\n[DIR]  alexisbcook_titanic-tutorial/\\n[DIR]  arthurtok_introduction-to-ensembling-stacking-in-python/\\n[DIR]  ldfreeman3_a-data-science-framework-to-achieve-99-accuracy/\\n[FILE] metadata.json (1.7KB)\\n[DIR]  startupsci_titanic-data-science-solutions/'}, {'role': 'tool', 'content': '/home/data:\\n[FILE] description.md (13.6KB)\\n[FILE] gender_submission.csv (3.2KB)\\n[FILE] test.csv (28.0KB)\\n[FILE] train.csv (59.8KB)'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': \"REASONING: This is the classic Titanic survival prediction problem - binary classification with accuracy as the metric.

In laymen terms this means, it either occurred or did not occur. For example, you won or did not win, you passed the test or did not pass the test, you were accepted or not accepted, and you get the point. A common business application is churn or customer retention. Another popular use case is, healthcare\\'s mortality rate or survival analysis. Binary events create an interesting dynamic, because we know statistically, a random guess should achieve a 50% accuracy rate, without creating one single algorithm or writing one single line of code. However, just like autocorrect spellcheck technology, sometimes we humans can be too smart for our own good and actually underperform a coin flip. In this kernel, I use Kaggle\\'s Getting Started Competition, Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster, to walk the reader through, how-to use the data science framework to beat the odds.\\\\n   \\\\n*What happens when technology is too smart for its own good?*\\\\n![Funny Autocorrect](http://15858-presscdn-0-65.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/hilarious-autocorrect-fails-20x.jpg)\",\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"metadata\":{\"_cell_guid\":\"ec31d549-537e-4f35-8594-22ef03079081\",\"_uuid\":\"ff6c70c884a8a5fb3258e7f3fefc9e55261df1df\"}},{\"source\":\"<a id=\\\\\"ch2\\\\\"></a>\\\\n# A Data Science Framework\\\\n1. **Define the Problem:** If data science, big data, machine learning, predictive analytics, business intelligence, or any other buzzword is the solution, then what is the problem? As the saying goes, don\\'t put the cart before the horse. Problems before requirements, requirements before solutions, solutions before design, and design before technology. Too often we are quick to jump on the new shiny technology, tool, or algorithm before determining the actual problem we are trying to solve.\\\\n2. **Gather the Data:** John Naisbitt wrote in his 1984 (yes, 1984) book Megatrends, we are “drowning in data, yet staving for knowledge.\\\\\" So, chances are, the dataset(s) already exist somewhere, in some format. It may be external or internal, structured or unstructured, static or streamed, objective or subjective, etc. As the saying goes, you don\\'t have to reinvent the wheel, you just have to know where to find it. In the next step, we will worry about transforming \\\\\"dirty data\\\\\" to \\\\\"clean data.\\\\\"\\\\n3. **Prepare Data for Consumption:** This step is often referred to as data wrangling, a required process to turn “wild” data into “manageable” data. Data wrangling includes implementing data architectures for storage and processing, developing data governance standards for quality and control, data extraction (i.e. ETL and web scraping), and data cleaning to identify aberrant, missing, or outlier data points.\\\\n4. **Perform Exploratory Analysis:** Anybody who has ever worked with data knows, garbage-in, garbage-out (GIGO). Therefore, it is important to deploy descriptive and graphical statistics to look for potential problems, patterns, classifications, correlations and comparisons in the dataset. In addition, data categorization (i.e. qualitative vs quantitative) is also important to understand and select the correct hypothesis test or data model.\\\\n5. **Model Data:** Like descriptive and inferential statistics, data modeling can either summarize the data or predict future outcomes. Your dataset and expected results, will determine the algorithms available for use. It\\'s important to remember, algorithms are tools and not magical wands or silver bullets. You must still be the master craft (wo)man that knows how-to select the right tool for the job. An analogy would be asking someone to hand you a Philip screwdriver, and they hand you a flathead screwdriver or worst a hammer. At best, it shows a complete lack of understanding. At worst, it makes completing the project impossible. The same is true in data modelling. The wrong model can lead to poor performance at best and the wrong conclusion (that’s used as actionable intelligence) at worst.\\\\n6. **Validate and Implement Data Model:** After you\\'ve trained your model based on a subset of your data, it\\'s time to test your model. This helps ensure you haven\\'t overfit your model or made it so specific to the selected subset, that it does not accurately fit another subset from the same dataset. In this step we determine if our [model overfit, generalize, or underfit our dataset](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/latest/dg/model-fit-underfitting-vs-overfitting.html).\\\\n7. **Optimize and Strategize:** This is the \\\\\"bionic man\\\\\" step, where you iterate back through the process to make it better...stronger...faster than it was before. As a data scientist, your strategy should be to outsource developer operations and application plumbing, so you have more time to focus on recommendations and design. Once you\\'re able to package your ideas, this becomes your “currency exchange\\\\\" rate.\",\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"metadata\":{\"_cell_guid\":\"8514a868-6816-494a-9e9c-dba14cb36f42\",\"_uuid\":\"bd2a68dcaace0c1371f2994f0204dce65800cc20\"}},{\"source\":\"<a id=\\\\\"ch3\\\\\"></a>\\\\n# Step 1: Define the Problem\\\\nFor this project, the problem statement is given to us on a golden plater, develop an algorithm to predict the survival outcome of passengers on the Titanic.\\\\n\\\\n......\\\\n\\\\n**Project Summary:**\\\\nThe sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.\\\\n\\\\nOne of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.\\\\n\\\\nIn this challenge, we ask you to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular, we ask you to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.\\\\n\\\\nPractice Skills\\\\n* Binary classification\\\\n* Python and R basics\\\\n\\\\n# Step 2: Gather the Data\\\\n\\\\nThe dataset is also given to us on a golden plater with test and train data at [Kaggle\\'s Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)\\\\n\",\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"metadata\":{\"_cell_guid\":\"22ba49b5-b3b6-4129-8c57-623e0d863ab3\",\"_uuid\":\"ff014109d795c5d1bfcc66c9761730406124ebe4\"}},{\"source\":\"<a id=\\\\\"ch4\\\\\"></a>\\\\n# Step 3: Prepare Data for Consumption\\\\nSince step 2 was provided to us on a golden plater, so is step 3.

Using the same dataset and different implementation of a decision tree (adaboost, random forest, gradient boost, xgboost, etc.) with tuning does not exceed the 0.77990 submission accuracy. Interesting for this dataset, the simple decision tree algorithm had the best default submission score and with tuning achieved the same best accuracy score.\\\\n\\\\nWhile no general conclusions can be made from testing a handful of algorithms on a single dataset, there are several observations on the mentioned dataset. \\\\n1. The train dataset has a different distribution than the test/validation dataset and population. This created wide margins between the cross validation (CV) accuracy score and Kaggle submission accuracy score.\\\\n2. Given the same dataset, decision tree based algorithms, seemed to converge on the same accuracy score after proper tuning.\\\\n3. Despite tuning, no machine learning algorithm, exceeded the homemade algorithm. The author will theorize, that for small datasets, a manmade algorithm is the bar to beat. \\\\n\\\\nWith that in mind, for iteration two, I would spend more time on preprocessing and feature engineering. In order to better align the CV score and Kaggle score and improve the overall accuracy.\\\\n\\\\n\",\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"metadata\":{\"_cell_guid\":\"a6d34edc-1265-41e8-b163-0b817cd3b6a5\",\"_uuid\":\"c476df95925d67809975caca4ea4dcb4b2a0b277\"}},{\"source\":\"<a id=\\\\\"ch90\\\\\"></a>\\\\n## Change Log:\\\\n11/22/17 Please note, this kernel is currently in progress, but open to feedback.

In a nutshell stacking uses as a first-level (base), the predictions of a few basic classifiers and then uses another model at the second-level to predict the output from the earlier first-level predictions.\\\\n\\\\nThe Titanic dataset is a prime candidate for introducing this concept as many newcomers to Kaggle start out here. Furthermore even though stacking has been responsible for many a team winning Kaggle competitions there seems to be a dearth of kernels on this topic so I hope this notebook can fill somewhat of that void.\\\\n\\\\nI myself am quite a newcomer to the Kaggle scene as well and the first proper ensembling/stacking script that I managed to chance upon and study was one written in the AllState Severity Claims competition by the great Faron. The material in this notebook borrows heavily from Faron\\'s script although ported to factor in ensembles of classifiers whilst his was ensembles of regressors. Anyway please check out his script here:\\\\n\\\\n[Stacking Starter][1] : by Faron \\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNow onto the notebook at hand and I hope that it manages to do justice and convey the concept of ensembling in an intuitive and concise manner.  My other standalone Kaggle [script][2] which implements exactly the same ensembling steps (albeit with different parameters) discussed below gives a Public LB score of 0.808 which is good enough to get to the top 9% and runs just under 4 minutes. Therefore I am pretty sure there is a lot of room to improve and add on to that script. Anyways please feel free to leave me any comments with regards to how I can improve\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n  [1]: https://www.kaggle.com/mmueller/allstate-claims-severity/stacking-starter/run/390867\\\\n  [2]: https://www.kaggle.com/arthurtok/titanic/simple-stacking-with-xgboost-0-808\"},{\"metadata\":{\"_execution_state\":\"idle\",\"_cell_guid\":\"14630296-b1aa-759e-bafa-b6a73f3896ed\",\"_uuid\":\"2e37a274400cfeb472b6405d524325245588dd66\",\"trusted\":true},\"cell_type\":\"code\",\"source\":\"# Load in our libraries\\\\nimport pandas as pd\\\\nimport numpy as np\\\\nimport re\\\\nimport sklearn\\\\nimport xgboost as xgb\\\\nimport seaborn as sns\\\\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\\\\n%matplotlib inline\\\\n\\\\nimport plotly.offline as py\\\\npy.init_notebook_mode(connected=True)\\\\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\\\\nimport plotly.tools as tls\\\\n\\\\nimport warnings\\\\nwarnings.filterwarnings(\\'ignore\\')\\\\n\\\\n# Going to use these 5 base models for the stacking\\\\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import (RandomForestClassifier, AdaBoostClassifier, \\\\n                              GradientBoostingClassifier, ExtraTreesClassifier)\\\\nfrom sklearn.svm import SVC\\\\nfrom sklearn.cross_validation import KFold\",\"execution_count\":1,\"outputs\":[]},{\"metadata\":{\"_uuid\":\"8b590aafe06a2ac55daae9d2456155e457914f5f\",\"_cell_guid\":\"d647b74c-099b-851a-dcd2-3a58c9e8f10c\"},\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"source\":\"# Feature Exploration, Engineering and Cleaning \\\\n\\\\nNow we will proceed much like how most kernels in general are structured, and that is to first explore the data on hand, identify possible feature engineering opportunities as well as numerically encode any categorical features.\"},{\"metadata\":{\"_execution_state\":\"idle\",\"_cell_guid\":\"5937fd72-d1ad-f678-cc82-f08a96e4cad0\",\"_uuid\":\"b2ad78041b69ce13d1f41bd9bc8c93cafaf7b8ac\",\"trusted\":true},\"cell_type\":\"code\",\"source\":\"# Load in the train and test datasets\\\\ntrain = pd.read_csv(\\'../input/train.csv\\')\\\\ntest = pd.read_csv(\\'../input/test.csv\\')\\\\n\\\\n# Store our passenger ID for easy access\\\\nPassengerId = test[\\'PassengerId\\']\\\\n\\\\ntrain.head(3)\",\"execution_count\":2,\"outputs\":[]},{\"metadata\":{\"_uuid\":\"81378834770e55c76751347588322fe32acf5737\",\"_cell_guid\":\"dff1c1dd-1e59-3907-88fa-1a1d699122be\"},\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"source\":\"Well it is no surprise that our task is to somehow extract the information out of the categorical variables \\\\n\\\\n**Feature Engineering**\\\\n\\\\nHere, credit must be extended to Sina\\'s very comprehensive and well-thought out notebook for the feature engineering ideas so please check out his work \\\\n\\\\n[Titanic Best Working Classfier][1] : by Sina\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n  [1]: https://www.kaggle.com/sinakhorami/titanic/titanic-best-working-classifier\"},{\"metadata\":{\"collapsed\":true,\"_execution_state\":\"idle\",\"_cell_guid\":\"e85b2a80-88a4-928f-f2b2-24895dea38f3\",\"_uuid\":\"b1c67249f91768ce8e5e2751364d32c87446cf55\",\"trusted\":true},\"cell_type\":\"code\",\"source\":\"full_data = [train, test]\\\\n\\\\n# Some features of my own that I have added in\\\\n# Gives the length of the name\\\\ntrain[\\'Name_length\\'] = train[\\'Name\\'].apply(len)\\\\ntest[\\'Name_length\\'] = test[\\'Name\\'].apply(len)\\\\n# Feature that tells whether a passenger had a cabin on the Titanic\\\\ntrain[\\'Has_Cabin\\'] = train[\\\\\"Cabin\\\\\"].apply(lambda x: 0 if type(x) == float else 1)\\\\ntest[\\'Has_Cabin\\'] = test[\\\\\"Cabin\\\\\"].apply(lambda x: 0 if type(x) == float else 1)\\\\n\\\\n# Feature engineering steps taken from Sina\\\\n# Create new feature FamilySize as a combination of SibSp and Parch\\\\nfor dataset in full_data:\\\\n    dataset[\\'FamilySize\\'] = dataset[\\'SibSp\\'] + dataset[\\'Parch\\'] + 1\\\\n# Create new feature IsAlone from FamilySize\\\\nfor dataset in full_data:\\\\n    dataset[\\'IsAlone\\'] = 0\\\\n    dataset.loc[dataset[\\'FamilySize\\'] == 1, \\'IsAlone\\'] = 1\\\\n# Remove all NULLS in the Embarked column\\\\nfor dataset in full_data:\\\\n    dataset[\\'Embarked\\'] = dataset[\\'Embarked\\'].fillna(\\'S\\')\\\\n# Remove all NULLS in the Fare column and create a new feature CategoricalFare\\\\nfor dataset in full_data:\\\\n    dataset[\\'Fare\\'] = dataset[\\'Fare\\'].fillna(train[\\'Fare\\'].median())\\\\ntrain[\\'CategoricalFare\\'] = pd.qcut(train[\\'Fare\\'], 4)\\\\n# Create a New feature CategoricalAge\\\\nfor dataset in full_data:\\\\n    age_avg = dataset[\\'Age\\'].mean()\\\\n    age_std = dataset[\\'Age\\'].std()\\\\n    age_null_count = dataset[\\'Age\\'].isnull().sum()\\\\n    age_null_random_list = np.random.randint(age_avg -

However many will skip some of the explanation on how the solution is developed as these notebooks are developed by experts for experts. The objective of this notebook is to follow a step-by-step workflow, explaining each step and rationale for every decision we take during solution development.\\\\n\\\\n## Workflow stages\\\\n\\\\nThe competition solution workflow goes through seven stages described in the Data Science Solutions book.\\\\n\\\\n1. Question or problem definition.\\\\n2. Acquire training and testing data.\\\\n3. Wrangle, prepare, cleanse the data.\\\\n4. Analyze, identify patterns, and explore the data.\\\\n5. Model, predict and solve the problem.\\\\n6. Visualize, report, and present the problem solving steps and final solution.\\\\n7. Supply or submit the results.\\\\n\\\\nThe workflow indicates general sequence of how each stage may follow the other. However there are use cases with exceptions.\\\\n\\\\n- We may combine mulitple workflow stages. We may analyze by visualizing data.\\\\n- Perform a stage earlier than indicated. We may analyze data before and after wrangling.\\\\n- Perform a stage multiple times in our workflow. Visualize stage may be used multiple times.\\\\n- Drop a stage altogether. We may not need supply stage to productize or service enable our dataset for a competition.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Question and problem definition\\\\n\\\\nCompetition sites like Kaggle define the problem to solve or questions to ask while providing the datasets for training your data science model and testing the model results against a test dataset. The question or problem definition for Titanic Survival competition is [described here at Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).\\\\n\\\\n> Knowing from a training set of samples listing passengers who survived or did not survive the Titanic disaster, can our model determine based on a given test dataset not containing the survival information, if these passengers in the test dataset survived or not.\\\\n\\\\nWe may also want to develop some early understanding about the domain of our problem. This is described on the [Kaggle competition description page here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). Here are the highlights to note.\\\\n\\\\n- On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. Translated 32% survival rate.\\\\n- One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew.\\\\n- Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.\\\\n\\\\n## Workflow goals\\\\n\\\\nThe data science solutions workflow solves for seven major goals.\\\\n\\\\n**Classifying.** We may want to classify or categorize our samples. We may also want to understand the implications or correlation of different classes with our solution goal.\\\\n\\\\n**Correlating.** One can approach the problem based on available features within the training dataset. Which features within the dataset contribute significantly to our solution goal? Statistically speaking is there a [correlation](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Correlation) among a feature and solution goal? As the feature values change does the solution state change as well, and visa-versa? This can be tested both for numerical and categorical features in the given dataset. We may also want to determine correlation among features other than survival for subsequent goals and workflow stages. Correlating certain features may help in creating, completing, or correcting features.\\\\n\\\\n**Converting.** For modeling stage, one needs to prepare the data. Depending on the choice of model algorithm one may require all features to be converted to numerical equivalent values. So for instance converting text categorical values to numeric values.\\\\n\\\\n**Completing.** Data preparation may also require us to estimate any missing values within a feature. Model algorithms may work best when there are no missing values.\\\\n\\\\n**Correcting.** We may also analyze the given training dataset for errors or possibly innacurate values within features and try to corrent these values or exclude the samples containing the errors. One way to do this is to detect any outliers among our samples or features. We may also completely discard a feature if it is not contribting to the analysis or may significantly skew the results.\\\\n\\\\n**Creating.** Can we create new features based on an existing feature or a set of features, such that the new feature follows the correlation, conversion, completeness goals.\\\\n\\\\n**Charting.** How to select the right visualization plots and charts depending on nature of the data and the solution goals.\"},{\"metadata\":{\"_uuid\":\"960f8b1937dc4915ce1eb0f82614b1985c4321a4\",\"_cell_guid\":\"56a3be4e-76ef-20c6-25e8-da16147cf6d7\"},\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"source\":\"## Refactor Release 2017-Jan-29\\\\n\\\\nWe are significantly refactoring the notebook based on (a) comments received by readers, (b) issues in porting notebook from Jupyter kernel (2.7) to Kaggle kernel (3.5), and (c) review of few more best practice kernels.\\\\n\\\\n### User comments\\\\n\\\\n- Combine training and test data for certain operations like converting titles across dataset to numerical values.

We've got channels for competitions, job postings and career discussions, resources, and socializing with your fellow data scientists. Follow the link here:** https://discord.gg/kaggle\n\nThe competition is simple: use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.\n\nRead on or watch the video below to explore more details. Once you’re ready to start competing, click on the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/account/login?returnUrl=%2Fc%2Ftitanic\" target=\"_blank\">\"Join Competition button</a> to create an account and gain access to the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data\" target=\"_blank\">competition data</a>. Then check out <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/titanic-tutorial\">Alexis Cook’s Titanic Tutorial</a> that walks you through step by step how to make your first submission!\n\n<iframe width=\"699\" height=\"368\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8yZMXCaFshs\" title=\"YouTube video | How to Get Started with Kaggle’s Titanic Competition | Kaggle\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n## The Challenge\nThe sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.\n\nOn April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.\n\nWhile there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.\n\nIn this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).\n\n> #### Recommended Tutorial\n> We highly recommend [Alexis Cook’s Titanic Tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/titanic-tutorial) that walks you through making your very first submission step by step and [this starter notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/gusthema/titanic-competition-w-tensorflow-decision-forests) to get started.\n\n## How Kaggle’s Competitions Work\n1. **Join the Competition**\nRead about the challenge description, accept the Competition Rules and gain access to the competition dataset.\n1.  **Get to Work**\nDownload the data, build models on it locally or on Kaggle Notebooks (our no-setup, customizable Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs) and generate a prediction file.\n1.  **Make a Submission**\nUpload your prediction as a submission on Kaggle and receive an accuracy score.\n1.  **Check the Leaderboard**\nSee how your model ranks against other Kagglers on our leaderboard. \n1.  **Improve Your Score**\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a> to find lots of tutorials and insights from other competitors.\n\n> #### Kaggle Lingo Video\n> You may run into unfamiliar lingo as you dig into the Kaggle discussion forums and public notebooks. Check out  Dr. Rachael Tatman’s [video on Kaggle Lingo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEJHyuWKd-s) to get up to speed!\n\n## What Data Will I Use in This Competition?\nIn this competition, you’ll gain access to two similar datasets that include passenger information like name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc. One dataset is titled `train.csv` and the other is titled `test.csv`.\n\n`Train.csv` will contain the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 to be exact) and importantly, will reveal whether they survived or not, also known as the “ground truth”.\n\nThe `test.csv` dataset contains similar information but does not disclose the “ground truth” for each passenger. It’s your job to predict these outcomes.\n\nUsing the patterns you find in the `train.csv` data, predict whether the other 418 passengers on board (found in `test.csv`) survived.\n\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data\">“Data” tab</a> to explore the datasets even further. Once you feel you’ve created a competitive model, submit it to Kaggle to see where your model stands on our leaderboard against other Kagglers.\n\n## How to Submit your Prediction to Kaggle\nOnce you’re ready to make a submission and get on the leaderboard:\n\n1. Click on the “Submit Predictions” button\n<img width=\"699\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen1.png\">\n1. Upload a CSV file in the submission file format. You’re able to submit 10 submissions a day.\n<img width=\"699\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen2.png\">\n\n## Submission File Format:\nYou should submit a csv file with exactly 418 entries plus a header row. Your submission will show an error if you have extra columns (beyond `PassengerId` and `Survived`) or rows.\n\nThe file should have exactly 2 columns:\n- `PassengerId` (sorted in any order)\n- `Survived` (contains your binary predictions: 1 for survived, 0 for deceased)\n\n## Got it! I’m ready to get started. Where do I get help if I need it?\n- For Competition Help: <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\">Titanic Discussion Forum</a>\n\nKaggle doesn’t have a dedicated team to help troubleshoot your code so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. The forums are full of useful information on the data, metric, and different approaches. We encourage you to use the forums often. If you share your knowledge, you'll find that others will share a lot in turn!\n\n## A Last Word on Kaggle Notebooks\nAs we mentioned before, Kaggle Notebooks is our no-setup, customizable, Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs and a huge repository of community published data &amp; code.\n\nIn every competition, you’ll find many Notebooks shared with incredible insights. It’s an invaluable resource worth becoming familiar with. Check out this competition’s Notebooks <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/notebooks\">here</a>.\n\n## 🏃‍♀Ready to Compete? <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/account/login?returnUrl=%2Fc%2Ftitanic\">Join the Competition Here!</a>\n\n## Evaluation\n\n<h2>Goal</h2>\n<p>It is your job to predict if a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic or not. <br>For each  in the test set, you must predict a 0 or 1 value for the  variable.</p>\n<h2>Metric</h2>\n<p>Your score is the percentage of passengers you correctly predict. This is known as <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision#In_binary_classification\">accuracy</a>.</p>\n<h2>Submission File Format</h2>\n<p>You should submit a csv file with exactly 418 entries <b>plus</b> a header row. Your submission will show an error if you have extra columns (beyond PassengerId and Survived) or rows.<br><br>The file should have exactly 2 columns:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>PassengerId (sorted in any order)</li>\n<li>Survived (contains your binary predictions: 1 for survived, 0 for deceased)</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><b>PassengerId,Survived</b><br>892,0<br>893,1<br>894,0<br>Etc.</pre>\n<p>You can download an example submission file (gender_submission.csv) on the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data\">Data page</a>.</p>\n\n## data-description\n\n<h3>Overview</h3>\n<p>The data has been split into two groups:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>training set (train.csv)</li>\n<li>test set (test.csv)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b> The training set </b>should be used to build your machine learning models. For the training set, we provide the outcome (also known as the “ground truth”) for each passenger. Your model will be based on “features” like passengers’ gender and class.

They are a great place to begin if you are new to data science or just finished a MOOC and want to get involved in Kaggle.</p>\n<p>Getting Started competitions are a non-competitive way to get familiar with Kaggle’s platform, learn basic machine learning concepts, and start meeting people in the community. They have no cash prize and are on a rolling timeline.</p>\n<h2>How do I create and manage a team?</h2>\n<p>When you accept the competition rules, a team will be created for you. You can invite others to your team, accept a merger with another team, and update basic information like team name by going to the More &gt; <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/team\" target=\"_blank\">Team</a> page.</p>\n<p>We've heard from many Kagglers that teaming up is the best way to learn new skills AND have fun. If you don't have a teammate already, consider asking if anyone wants to team up in the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a>.</p>\n<h2>What are Notebooks?</h2>\n<p>Kaggle Notebooks is a cloud computational environment that enables reproducible and collaborative analysis. Notebooks support scripts in Python and R, Jupyter Notebooks, and RMarkdown reports. You can visit the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/notebooks\" target=\"_blank\">Notebooks</a> tab to view all of the publicly shared code for the Titanic competition. For more on how to use Notebooks to learn data science, check out our <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview\" target=\"&quot;_blank\">Courses</a>!</p>\n<h2>Why did my team disappear from the leaderboard?</h2>\n<p>To keep with the spirit of getting-started competitions, we have implemented a two month rolling window on submissions. Once a submission is more than two months old, it will be invalidated and no longer count towards the leaderboard.</p>\n<p>If your team has no submissions in the previous two months, the team will also drop from the leaderboard. This will keep the leaderboard at a manageable size, freshen it up, and prevent newcomers from getting lost in a sea of abandoned scores.</p>\n<p><i>\"I worked so hard to get that score! Give it back!\"</i> Read more about our decision to implement a rolling leaderboard <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion/6240\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n<h2>How do I contact Support?</h2>\n<p>Kaggle does not have a dedicated support team so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. (For this competition, you’ll want to use the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">Titanic discussion forum)</a>.</p>\n<p>Support is only able to help with issues that are being experienced by all participants. Before contacting support, please check the discussion forum for information on your problem. If you can’t find it, you can post your problem in the forum so a fellow participant or a Kaggle team member can provide help.

In laymen terms this means, it either occurred or did not occur. For example, you won or did not win, you passed the test or did not pass the test, you were accepted or not accepted, and you get the point. A common business application is churn or customer retention. Another popular use case is, healthcare's mortality rate or survival analysis. Binary events create an interesting dynamic, because we know statistically, a random guess should achieve a 50% accuracy rate, without creating one single algorithm or writing one single line of code. However, just like autocorrect spellcheck technology, sometimes we humans can be too smart for our own good and actually underperform a coin flip. In this kernel, I use Kaggle's Getting Started Competition, Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster, to walk the reader through, how-to use the data science framework to beat the odds.\\n   \\n*What happens when technology is too smart for its own good?*\\n![Funny Autocorrect](http://15858-presscdn-0-65.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/hilarious-autocorrect-fails-20x.jpg)\",\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"metadata\":{\"_cell_guid\":\"ec31d549-537e-4f35-8594-22ef03079081\",\"_uuid\":\"ff6c70c884a8a5fb3258e7f3fefc9e55261df1df\"}},{\"source\":\"<a id=\\\"ch2\\\"></a>\\n# A Data Science Framework\\n1. **Define the Problem:** If data science, big data, machine learning, predictive analytics, business intelligence, or any other buzzword is the solution, then what is the problem? As the saying goes, don't put the cart before the horse. Problems before requirements, requirements before solutions, solutions before design, and design before technology. Too often we are quick to jump on the new shiny technology, tool, or algorithm before determining the actual problem we are trying to solve.\\n2. **Gather the Data:** John Naisbitt wrote in his 1984 (yes, 1984) book Megatrends, we are “drowning in data, yet staving for knowledge.\\\" So, chances are, the dataset(s) already exist somewhere, in some format. It may be external or internal, structured or unstructured, static or streamed, objective or subjective, etc. As the saying goes, you don't have to reinvent the wheel, you just have to know where to find it. In the next step, we will worry about transforming \\\"dirty data\\\" to \\\"clean data.\\\"\\n3. **Prepare Data for Consumption:** This step is often referred to as data wrangling, a required process to turn “wild” data into “manageable” data. Data wrangling includes implementing data architectures for storage and processing, developing data governance standards for quality and control, data extraction (i.e. ETL and web scraping), and data cleaning to identify aberrant, missing, or outlier data points.\\n4. **Perform Exploratory Analysis:** Anybody who has ever worked with data knows, garbage-in, garbage-out (GIGO). Therefore, it is important to deploy descriptive and graphical statistics to look for potential problems, patterns, classifications, correlations and comparisons in the dataset. In addition, data categorization (i.e. qualitative vs quantitative) is also important to understand and select the correct hypothesis test or data model.\\n5. **Model Data:** Like descriptive and inferential statistics, data modeling can either summarize the data or predict future outcomes. Your dataset and expected results, will determine the algorithms available for use. It's important to remember, algorithms are tools and not magical wands or silver bullets. You must still be the master craft (wo)man that knows how-to select the right tool for the job. An analogy would be asking someone to hand you a Philip screwdriver, and they hand you a flathead screwdriver or worst a hammer. At best, it shows a complete lack of understanding. At worst, it makes completing the project impossible. The same is true in data modelling. The wrong model can lead to poor performance at best and the wrong conclusion (that’s used as actionable intelligence) at worst.\\n6. **Validate and Implement Data Model:** After you've trained your model based on a subset of your data, it's time to test your model. This helps ensure you haven't overfit your model or made it so specific to the selected subset, that it does not accurately fit another subset from the same dataset. In this step we determine if our [model overfit, generalize, or underfit our dataset](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/latest/dg/model-fit-underfitting-vs-overfitting.html).\\n7. **Optimize and Strategize:** This is the \\\"bionic man\\\" step, where you iterate back through the process to make it better...stronger...faster than it was before. As a data scientist, your strategy should be to outsource developer operations and application plumbing, so you have more time to focus on recommendations and design. Once you're able to package your ideas, this becomes your “currency exchange\\\" rate.\",\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"metadata\":{\"_cell_guid\":\"8514a868-6816-494a-9e9c-dba14cb36f42\",\"_uuid\":\"bd2a68dcaace0c1371f2994f0204dce65800cc20\"}},{\"source\":\"<a id=\\\"ch3\\\"></a>\\n# Step 1: Define the Problem\\nFor this project, the problem statement is given to us on a golden plater, develop an algorithm to predict the survival outcome of passengers on the Titanic.\\n\\n......\\n\\n**Project Summary:**\\nThe sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.\\n\\nOne of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.\\n\\nIn this challenge, we ask you to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular, we ask you to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.\\n\\nPractice Skills\\n* Binary classification\\n* Python and R basics\\n\\n# Step 2: Gather the Data\\n\\nThe dataset is also given to us on a golden plater with test and train data at [Kaggle's Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)\\n\",\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"metadata\":{\"_cell_guid\":\"22ba49b5-b3b6-4129-8c57-623e0d863ab3\",\"_uuid\":\"ff014109d795c5d1bfcc66c9761730406124ebe4\"}},{\"source\":\"<a id=\\\"ch4\\\"></a>\\n# Step 3: Prepare Data for Consumption\\nSince step 2 was provided to us on a golden plater, so is step 3.

Using the same dataset and different implementation of a decision tree (adaboost, random forest, gradient boost, xgboost, etc.) with tuning does not exceed the 0.77990 submission accuracy. Interesting for this dataset, the simple decision tree algorithm had the best default submission score and with tuning achieved the same best accuracy score.\\n\\nWhile no general conclusions can be made from testing a handful of algorithms on a single dataset, there are several observations on the mentioned dataset. \\n1. The train dataset has a different distribution than the test/validation dataset and population. This created wide margins between the cross validation (CV) accuracy score and Kaggle submission accuracy score.\\n2. Given the same dataset, decision tree based algorithms, seemed to converge on the same accuracy score after proper tuning.\\n3. Despite tuning, no machine learning algorithm, exceeded the homemade algorithm. The author will theorize, that for small datasets, a manmade algorithm is the bar to beat. \\n\\nWith that in mind, for iteration two, I would spend more time on preprocessing and feature engineering. In order to better align the CV score and Kaggle score and improve the overall accuracy.\\n\\n\",\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"metadata\":{\"_cell_guid\":\"a6d34edc-1265-41e8-b163-0b817cd3b6a5\",\"_uuid\":\"c476df95925d67809975caca4ea4dcb4b2a0b277\"}},{\"source\":\"<a id=\\\"ch90\\\"></a>\\n## Change Log:\\n11/22/17 Please note, this kernel is currently in progress, but open to feedback.

In a nutshell stacking uses as a first-level (base), the predictions of a few basic classifiers and then uses another model at the second-level to predict the output from the earlier first-level predictions.\\n\\nThe Titanic dataset is a prime candidate for introducing this concept as many newcomers to Kaggle start out here. Furthermore even though stacking has been responsible for many a team winning Kaggle competitions there seems to be a dearth of kernels on this topic so I hope this notebook can fill somewhat of that void.\\n\\nI myself am quite a newcomer to the Kaggle scene as well and the first proper ensembling/stacking script that I managed to chance upon and study was one written in the AllState Severity Claims competition by the great Faron. The material in this notebook borrows heavily from Faron's script although ported to factor in ensembles of classifiers whilst his was ensembles of regressors. Anyway please check out his script here:\\n\\n[Stacking Starter][1] : by Faron \\n\\n\\nNow onto the notebook at hand and I hope that it manages to do justice and convey the concept of ensembling in an intuitive and concise manner.  My other standalone Kaggle [script][2] which implements exactly the same ensembling steps (albeit with different parameters) discussed below gives a Public LB score of 0.808 which is good enough to get to the top 9% and runs just under 4 minutes. Therefore I am pretty sure there is a lot of room to improve and add on to that script. Anyways please feel free to leave me any comments with regards to how I can improve\\n\\n\\n  [1]: https://www.kaggle.com/mmueller/allstate-claims-severity/stacking-starter/run/390867\\n  [2]: https://www.kaggle.com/arthurtok/titanic/simple-stacking-with-xgboost-0-808\"},{\"metadata\":{\"_execution_state\":\"idle\",\"_cell_guid\":\"14630296-b1aa-759e-bafa-b6a73f3896ed\",\"_uuid\":\"2e37a274400cfeb472b6405d524325245588dd66\",\"trusted\":true},\"cell_type\":\"code\",\"source\":\"# Load in our libraries\\nimport pandas as pd\\nimport numpy as np\\nimport re\\nimport sklearn\\nimport xgboost as xgb\\nimport seaborn as sns\\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\\n%matplotlib inline\\n\\nimport plotly.offline as py\\npy.init_notebook_mode(connected=True)\\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\\nimport plotly.tools as tls\\n\\nimport warnings\\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\\n\\n# Going to use these 5 base models for the stacking\\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import (RandomForestClassifier, AdaBoostClassifier, \\n                              GradientBoostingClassifier, ExtraTreesClassifier)\\nfrom sklearn.svm import SVC\\nfrom sklearn.cross_validation import KFold\",\"execution_count\":1,\"outputs\":[]},{\"metadata\":{\"_uuid\":\"8b590aafe06a2ac55daae9d2456155e457914f5f\",\"_cell_guid\":\"d647b74c-099b-851a-dcd2-3a58c9e8f10c\"},\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"source\":\"# Feature Exploration, Engineering and Cleaning \\n\\nNow we will proceed much like how most kernels in general are structured, and that is to first explore the data on hand, identify possible feature engineering opportunities as well as numerically encode any categorical features.\"},{\"metadata\":{\"_execution_state\":\"idle\",\"_cell_guid\":\"5937fd72-d1ad-f678-cc82-f08a96e4cad0\",\"_uuid\":\"b2ad78041b69ce13d1f41bd9bc8c93cafaf7b8ac\",\"trusted\":true},\"cell_type\":\"code\",\"source\":\"# Load in the train and test datasets\\ntrain = pd.read_csv('../input/train.csv')\\ntest = pd.read_csv('../input/test.csv')\\n\\n# Store our passenger ID for easy access\\nPassengerId = test['PassengerId']\\n\\ntrain.head(3)\",\"execution_count\":2,\"outputs\":[]},{\"metadata\":{\"_uuid\":\"81378834770e55c76751347588322fe32acf5737\",\"_cell_guid\":\"dff1c1dd-1e59-3907-88fa-1a1d699122be\"},\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"source\":\"Well it is no surprise that our task is to somehow extract the information out of the categorical variables \\n\\n**Feature Engineering**\\n\\nHere, credit must be extended to Sina's very comprehensive and well-thought out notebook for the feature engineering ideas so please check out his work \\n\\n[Titanic Best Working Classfier][1] : by Sina\\n\\n\\n  [1]: https://www.kaggle.com/sinakhorami/titanic/titanic-best-working-classifier\"},{\"metadata\":{\"collapsed\":true,\"_execution_state\":\"idle\",\"_cell_guid\":\"e85b2a80-88a4-928f-f2b2-24895dea38f3\",\"_uuid\":\"b1c67249f91768ce8e5e2751364d32c87446cf55\",\"trusted\":true},\"cell_type\":\"code\",\"source\":\"full_data = [train, test]\\n\\n# Some features of my own that I have added in\\n# Gives the length of the name\\ntrain['Name_length'] = train['Name'].apply(len)\\ntest['Name_length'] = test['Name'].apply(len)\\n# Feature that tells whether a passenger had a cabin on the Titanic\\ntrain['Has_Cabin'] = train[\\\"Cabin\\\"].apply(lambda x: 0 if type(x) == float else 1)\\ntest['Has_Cabin'] = test[\\\"Cabin\\\"].apply(lambda x: 0 if type(x) == float else 1)\\n\\n# Feature engineering steps taken from Sina\\n# Create new feature FamilySize as a combination of SibSp and Parch\\nfor dataset in full_data:\\n    dataset['FamilySize'] = dataset['SibSp'] + dataset['Parch'] + 1\\n# Create new feature IsAlone from FamilySize\\nfor dataset in full_data:\\n    dataset['IsAlone'] = 0\\n    dataset.loc[dataset['FamilySize'] == 1, 'IsAlone'] = 1\\n# Remove all NULLS in the Embarked column\\nfor dataset in full_data:\\n    dataset['Embarked'] = dataset['Embarked'].fillna('S')\\n# Remove all NULLS in the Fare column and create a new feature CategoricalFare\\nfor dataset in full_data:\\n    dataset['Fare'] = dataset['Fare'].fillna(train['Fare'].median())\\ntrain['CategoricalFare'] = pd.qcut(train['Fare'], 4)\\n# Create a New feature CategoricalAge\\nfor dataset in full_data:\\n    age_avg = dataset['Age'].mean()\\n    age_std = dataset['Age'].std()\\n    age_null_count = dataset['Age'].isnull().sum()\\n    age_null_random_list = np.random.randint(age_avg -

However many will skip some of the explanation on how the solution is developed as these notebooks are developed by experts for experts. The objective of this notebook is to follow a step-by-step workflow, explaining each step and rationale for every decision we take during solution development.\\n\\n## Workflow stages\\n\\nThe competition solution workflow goes through seven stages described in the Data Science Solutions book.\\n\\n1. Question or problem definition.\\n2. Acquire training and testing data.\\n3. Wrangle, prepare, cleanse the data.\\n4. Analyze, identify patterns, and explore the data.\\n5. Model, predict and solve the problem.\\n6. Visualize, report, and present the problem solving steps and final solution.\\n7. Supply or submit the results.\\n\\nThe workflow indicates general sequence of how each stage may follow the other. However there are use cases with exceptions.\\n\\n- We may combine mulitple workflow stages. We may analyze by visualizing data.\\n- Perform a stage earlier than indicated. We may analyze data before and after wrangling.\\n- Perform a stage multiple times in our workflow. Visualize stage may be used multiple times.\\n- Drop a stage altogether. We may not need supply stage to productize or service enable our dataset for a competition.\\n\\n\\n## Question and problem definition\\n\\nCompetition sites like Kaggle define the problem to solve or questions to ask while providing the datasets for training your data science model and testing the model results against a test dataset. The question or problem definition for Titanic Survival competition is [described here at Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).\\n\\n> Knowing from a training set of samples listing passengers who survived or did not survive the Titanic disaster, can our model determine based on a given test dataset not containing the survival information, if these passengers in the test dataset survived or not.\\n\\nWe may also want to develop some early understanding about the domain of our problem. This is described on the [Kaggle competition description page here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). Here are the highlights to note.\\n\\n- On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. Translated 32% survival rate.\\n- One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew.\\n- Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.\\n\\n## Workflow goals\\n\\nThe data science solutions workflow solves for seven major goals.\\n\\n**Classifying.** We may want to classify or categorize our samples. We may also want to understand the implications or correlation of different classes with our solution goal.\\n\\n**Correlating.** One can approach the problem based on available features within the training dataset. Which features within the dataset contribute significantly to our solution goal? Statistically speaking is there a [correlation](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Correlation) among a feature and solution goal? As the feature values change does the solution state change as well, and visa-versa? This can be tested both for numerical and categorical features in the given dataset. We may also want to determine correlation among features other than survival for subsequent goals and workflow stages. Correlating certain features may help in creating, completing, or correcting features.\\n\\n**Converting.** For modeling stage, one needs to prepare the data. Depending on the choice of model algorithm one may require all features to be converted to numerical equivalent values. So for instance converting text categorical values to numeric values.\\n\\n**Completing.** Data preparation may also require us to estimate any missing values within a feature. Model algorithms may work best when there are no missing values.\\n\\n**Correcting.** We may also analyze the given training dataset for errors or possibly innacurate values within features and try to corrent these values or exclude the samples containing the errors. One way to do this is to detect any outliers among our samples or features. We may also completely discard a feature if it is not contribting to the analysis or may significantly skew the results.\\n\\n**Creating.** Can we create new features based on an existing feature or a set of features, such that the new feature follows the correlation, conversion, completeness goals.\\n\\n**Charting.** How to select the right visualization plots and charts depending on nature of the data and the solution goals.\"},{\"metadata\":{\"_uuid\":\"960f8b1937dc4915ce1eb0f82614b1985c4321a4\",\"_cell_guid\":\"56a3be4e-76ef-20c6-25e8-da16147cf6d7\"},\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"source\":\"## Refactor Release 2017-Jan-29\\n\\nWe are significantly refactoring the notebook based on (a) comments received by readers, (b) issues in porting notebook from Jupyter kernel (2.7) to Kaggle kernel (3.5), and (c) review of few more best practice kernels.\\n\\n### User comments\\n\\n- Combine training and test data for certain operations like converting titles across dataset to numerical values.

Then check out <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/titanic-tutorial\">Alexis Cook’s Titanic Tutorial</a> that walks you through step by step how to make your first submission!\\n\\n<iframe width=\"699\" height=\"368\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8yZMXCaFshs\" title=\"YouTube video | How to Get Started with Kaggle’s Titanic Competition | Kaggle\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n\\n## The Challenge\\nThe sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.\\n\\nOn April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.\\n\\nWhile there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.\\n\\nIn this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).\\n\\n> #### Recommended Tutorial\\n> We highly recommend [Alexis Cook’s Titanic Tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/titanic-tutorial) that walks you through making your very first submission step by step and [this starter notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/gusthema/titanic-competition-w-tensorflow-decision-forests) to get started.\\n\\n## How Kaggle’s Competitions Work\\n1. **Join the Competition**\\nRead about the challenge description, accept the Competition Rules and gain access to the competition dataset.\\n1.  **Get to Work**\\nDownload the data, build models on it locally or on Kaggle Notebooks (our no-setup, customizable Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs) and generate a prediction file.\\n1.  **Make a Submission**\\nUpload your prediction as a submission on Kaggle and receive an accuracy score.\\n1.  **Check the Leaderboard**\\nSee how your model ranks against other Kagglers on our leaderboard. \\n1.  **Improve Your Score**\\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a> to find lots of tutorials and insights from other competitors.\\n\\n> #### Kaggle Lingo Video\\n> You may run into unfamiliar lingo as you dig into the Kaggle discussion forums and public notebooks. Check out  Dr. Rachael Tatman’s [video on Kaggle Lingo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEJHyuWKd-s) to get up to speed!\\n\\n## What Data Will I Use in This Competition?\\nIn this competition, you’ll gain access to two similar datasets that include passenger information like name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc. One dataset is titled `train.csv` and the other is titled `test.csv`.\\n\\n`Train.csv` will contain the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 to be exact) and importantly, will reveal whether they survived or not, also known as the “ground truth”.\\n\\nThe `test.csv` dataset contains similar information but does not disclose the “ground truth” for each passenger. It’s your job to predict these outcomes.\\n\\nUsing the patterns you find in the `train.csv` data, predict whether the other 418 passengers on board (found in `test.csv`) survived.\\n\\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data\">“Data” tab</a> to explore the datasets even further. Once you feel you’ve created a competitive model, submit it to Kaggle to see where your model stands on our leaderboard against other Kagglers.\\n\\n## How to Submit your Prediction to Kaggle\\nOnce you’re ready to make a submission and get on the leaderboard:\\n\\n1. Click on the “Submit Predictions” button\\n<img width=\"699\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen1.png\">\\n1. Upload a CSV file in the submission file format. You’re able to submit 10 submissions a day.\\n<img width=\"699\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen2.png\">\\n\\n## Submission File Format:\\nYou should submit a csv file with exactly 418 entries plus a header row. Your submission will show an error if you have extra columns (beyond `PassengerId` and `Survived`) or rows.\\n\\nThe file should have exactly 2 columns:\\n- `PassengerId` (sorted in any order)\\n- `Survived` (contains your binary predictions: 1 for survived, 0 for deceased)\\n\\n## Got it! I’m ready to get started. Where do I get help if I need it?\\n- For Competition Help: <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\">Titanic Discussion Forum</a>\\n\\nKaggle doesn’t have a dedicated team to help troubleshoot your code so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. The forums are full of useful information on the data, metric, and different approaches. We encourage you to use the forums often. If you share your knowledge, you\\'ll find that others will share a lot in turn!\\n\\n## A Last Word on Kaggle Notebooks\\nAs we mentioned before, Kaggle Notebooks is our no-setup, customizable, Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs and a huge repository of community published data &amp; code.\\n\\nIn every competition, you’ll find many Notebooks shared with incredible insights. It’s an invaluable resource worth becoming familiar with. Check out this competition’s Notebooks <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/notebooks\">here</a>.\\n\\n## 🏃\\u200d♀Ready to Compete? <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/account/login?returnUrl=%2Fc%2Ftitanic\">Join the Competition Here!</a>\\n\\n## Evaluation\\n\\n<h2>Goal</h2>\\n<p>It is your job to predict if a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic or not. <br>For each  in the test set, you must predict a 0 or 1 value for the  variable.</p>\\n<h2>Metric</h2>\\n<p>Your score is the percentage of passengers you correctly predict. This is known as <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision#In_binary_classification\">accuracy</a>.</p>\\n<h2>Submission File Format</h2>\\n<p>You should submit a csv file with exactly 418 entries <b>plus</b> a header row. Your submission will show an error if you have extra columns (beyond PassengerId and Survived) or rows.<br><br>The file should have exactly 2 columns:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>PassengerId (sorted in any order)</li>\\n<li>Survived (contains your binary predictions: 1 for survived, 0 for deceased)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<pre><b>PassengerId,Survived</b><br>892,0<br>893,1<br>894,0<br>Etc.</pre>\\n<p>You can download an example submission file (gender_submission.csv) on the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data\">Data page</a>.</p>\\n\\n## data-description\\n\\n<h3>Overview</h3>\\n<p>The data has been split into two groups:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>training set (train.csv)</li>\\n<li>test set (test.csv)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><b> The training set </b>should be used to build your machine learning models. For the training set, we provide the outcome (also known as the “ground truth”) for each passenger. Your model will be based on “features” like passengers’ gender and class. You can also use <a href=\"https://triangleinequality.wordpress.com/2013/09/08/basic-feature-engineering-with-the-titanic-data/\" target=\"_blank\"> feature engineering </a>to create new features.</p>\\n<p><b>The test set </b>should be used to see how well your model performs on unseen data. For the test set, we do not provide the ground truth for each passenger. It is your job to predict these outcomes. For each passenger in the test set, use the model you trained to predict whether or not they survived the sinking of the Titanic.</p>\\n<p>We also include <b>gender_submission.csv</b>, a set of predictions that assume all and only female passengers survive, as an example of what a submission file should look like.</p>\\n<h3>Data Dictionary</h3>\\n<table style=\"width: 100%;\">\\n<tbody>\\n<tr><th><b>Variable</b></th><th><b>Definition</b></th><th><b>Key</b></th></tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>survival</td>\\n<td>Survival</td>\\n<td>0 = No, 1 = Yes</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>pclass</td>\\n<td>Ticket class</td>\\n<td>1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>sex</td>\\n<td>Sex</td>\\n<td></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Age</td>\\n<td>Age in years</td>\\n<td></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>sibsp</td>\\n<td># of siblings / spouses aboard the Titanic</td>\\n<td></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>parch</td>\\n<td># of parents / children aboard the Titanic</td>\\n<td></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>ticket</td>\\n<td>Ticket number</td>\\n<td></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>fare</td>\\n<td>Passenger fare</td>\\n<td></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>cabin</td>\\n<td>Cabin number</td>\\n<td></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>embarked</td>\\n<td>Port of Embarkation</td>\\n<td>C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton</td>\\n</tr>\\n</tbody>\\n</table>\\n<h3>Variable Notes</h3>\\n<p><b>pclass</b>: A proxy for socio-economic status (SES)<br /> 1st = Upper<br /> 2nd = Middle<br /> 3rd = Lower<br /><br /> <b>age</b>: Age is fractional if less than 1.

They are a great place to begin if you are new to data science or just finished a MOOC and want to get involved in Kaggle.</p>\\n<p>Getting Started competitions are a non-competitive way to get familiar with Kaggle’s platform, learn basic machine learning concepts, and start meeting people in the community. They have no cash prize and are on a rolling timeline.</p>\\n<h2>How do I create and manage a team?</h2>\\n<p>When you accept the competition rules, a team will be created for you. You can invite others to your team, accept a merger with another team, and update basic information like team name by going to the More &gt; <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/team\" target=\"_blank\">Team</a> page.</p>\\n<p>We\\'ve heard from many Kagglers that teaming up is the best way to learn new skills AND have fun. If you don\\'t have a teammate already, consider asking if anyone wants to team up in the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a>.</p>\\n<h2>What are Notebooks?</h2>\\n<p>Kaggle Notebooks is a cloud computational environment that enables reproducible and collaborative analysis. Notebooks support scripts in Python and R, Jupyter Notebooks, and RMarkdown reports. You can visit the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/notebooks\" target=\"_blank\">Notebooks</a> tab to view all of the publicly shared code for the Titanic competition. For more on how to use Notebooks to learn data science, check out our <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview\" target=\"&quot;_blank\">Courses</a>!</p>\\n<h2>Why did my team disappear from the leaderboard?</h2>\\n<p>To keep with the spirit of getting-started competitions, we have implemented a two month rolling window on submissions. Once a submission is more than two months old, it will be invalidated and no longer count towards the leaderboard.</p>\\n<p>If your team has no submissions in the previous two months, the team will also drop from the leaderboard. This will keep the leaderboard at a manageable size, freshen it up, and prevent newcomers from getting lost in a sea of abandoned scores.</p>\\n<p><i>\"I worked so hard to get that score! Give it back!\"</i> Read more about our decision to implement a rolling leaderboard <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion/6240\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\\n<h2>How do I contact Support?</h2>\\n<p>Kaggle does not have a dedicated support team so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. (For this competition, you’ll want to use the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">Titanic discussion forum)</a>.</p>\\n<p>Support is only able to help with issues that are being experienced by all participants. Before contacting support, please check the discussion forum for information on your problem. If you can’t find it, you can post your problem in the forum so a fellow participant or a Kaggle team member can provide help. The forums are full of useful information on the data, metric, and different approaches. We encourage you to use the forums often. If you share your knowledge, you\\'ll find that others will share a lot in turn!</p>\\n<p>If your problem persists or it seems to be effective all participants then please <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/contact\" target=\"_blank\">contact us</a>.</p>'}, {'role': 'tool', 'content': 'Not a directory: /home/code/exploration/../research/writeups'}, {'role': 'tool', 'content': '/home/code/exploration/../research/kernels:\\n[DIR]  alexisbcook_exercise-arithmetic-and-variables/\\n[DIR]  alexisbcook_titanic-tutorial/\\n[DIR]  arthurtok_introduction-to-ensembling-stacking-in-python/\\n[DIR]  ldfreeman3_a-data-science-framework-to-achieve-99-accuracy/\\n[FILE] metadata.json (1.7KB)\\n[DIR]  startupsci_titanic-data-science-solutions/'}, {'role': 'tool', 'content': '/home/data:\\n[FILE] description.md (13.6KB)\\n[FILE] gender_submission.csv (3.2KB)\\n[FILE] test.csv (28.0KB)\\n[FILE] train.csv (59.8KB)'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': \"REASONING: This is the classic Titanic survival prediction problem - binary classification with accuracy as the metric.

In laymen terms this means, it either occurred or did not occur. For example, you won or did not win, you passed the test or did not pass the test, you were accepted or not accepted, and you get the point. A common business application is churn or customer retention. Another popular use case is, healthcare\\'s mortality rate or survival analysis. Binary events create an interesting dynamic, because we know statistically, a random guess should achieve a 50% accuracy rate, without creating one single algorithm or writing one single line of code. However, just like autocorrect spellcheck technology, sometimes we humans can be too smart for our own good and actually underperform a coin flip. In this kernel, I use Kaggle\\'s Getting Started Competition, Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster, to walk the reader through, how-to use the data science framework to beat the odds.\\\\n   \\\\n*What happens when technology is too smart for its own good?*\\\\n![Funny Autocorrect](http://15858-presscdn-0-65.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/hilarious-autocorrect-fails-20x.jpg)\",\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"metadata\":{\"_cell_guid\":\"ec31d549-537e-4f35-8594-22ef03079081\",\"_uuid\":\"ff6c70c884a8a5fb3258e7f3fefc9e55261df1df\"}},{\"source\":\"<a id=\\\\\"ch2\\\\\"></a>\\\\n# A Data Science Framework\\\\n1. **Define the Problem:** If data science, big data, machine learning, predictive analytics, business intelligence, or any other buzzword is the solution, then what is the problem? As the saying goes, don\\'t put the cart before the horse. Problems before requirements, requirements before solutions, solutions before design, and design before technology. Too often we are quick to jump on the new shiny technology, tool, or algorithm before determining the actual problem we are trying to solve.\\\\n2. **Gather the Data:** John Naisbitt wrote in his 1984 (yes, 1984) book Megatrends, we are “drowning in data, yet staving for knowledge.\\\\\" So, chances are, the dataset(s) already exist somewhere, in some format. It may be external or internal, structured or unstructured, static or streamed, objective or subjective, etc. As the saying goes, you don\\'t have to reinvent the wheel, you just have to know where to find it. In the next step, we will worry about transforming \\\\\"dirty data\\\\\" to \\\\\"clean data.\\\\\"\\\\n3. **Prepare Data for Consumption:** This step is often referred to as data wrangling, a required process to turn “wild” data into “manageable” data. Data wrangling includes implementing data architectures for storage and processing, developing data governance standards for quality and control, data extraction (i.e. ETL and web scraping), and data cleaning to identify aberrant, missing, or outlier data points.\\\\n4. **Perform Exploratory Analysis:** Anybody who has ever worked with data knows, garbage-in, garbage-out (GIGO). Therefore, it is important to deploy descriptive and graphical statistics to look for potential problems, patterns, classifications, correlations and comparisons in the dataset. In addition, data categorization (i.e. qualitative vs quantitative) is also important to understand and select the correct hypothesis test or data model.\\\\n5. **Model Data:** Like descriptive and inferential statistics, data modeling can either summarize the data or predict future outcomes. Your dataset and expected results, will determine the algorithms available for use. It\\'s important to remember, algorithms are tools and not magical wands or silver bullets. You must still be the master craft (wo)man that knows how-to select the right tool for the job. An analogy would be asking someone to hand you a Philip screwdriver, and they hand you a flathead screwdriver or worst a hammer. At best, it shows a complete lack of understanding. At worst, it makes completing the project impossible. The same is true in data modelling. The wrong model can lead to poor performance at best and the wrong conclusion (that’s used as actionable intelligence) at worst.\\\\n6. **Validate and Implement Data Model:** After you\\'ve trained your model based on a subset of your data, it\\'s time to test your model. This helps ensure you haven\\'t overfit your model or made it so specific to the selected subset, that it does not accurately fit another subset from the same dataset. In this step we determine if our [model overfit, generalize, or underfit our dataset](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/latest/dg/model-fit-underfitting-vs-overfitting.html).\\\\n7. **Optimize and Strategize:** This is the \\\\\"bionic man\\\\\" step, where you iterate back through the process to make it better...stronger...faster than it was before. As a data scientist, your strategy should be to outsource developer operations and application plumbing, so you have more time to focus on recommendations and design. Once you\\'re able to package your ideas, this becomes your “currency exchange\\\\\" rate.\",\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"metadata\":{\"_cell_guid\":\"8514a868-6816-494a-9e9c-dba14cb36f42\",\"_uuid\":\"bd2a68dcaace0c1371f2994f0204dce65800cc20\"}},{\"source\":\"<a id=\\\\\"ch3\\\\\"></a>\\\\n# Step 1: Define the Problem\\\\nFor this project, the problem statement is given to us on a golden plater, develop an algorithm to predict the survival outcome of passengers on the Titanic.\\\\n\\\\n......\\\\n\\\\n**Project Summary:**\\\\nThe sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.\\\\n\\\\nOne of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.\\\\n\\\\nIn this challenge, we ask you to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular, we ask you to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.\\\\n\\\\nPractice Skills\\\\n* Binary classification\\\\n* Python and R basics\\\\n\\\\n# Step 2: Gather the Data\\\\n\\\\nThe dataset is also given to us on a golden plater with test and train data at [Kaggle\\'s Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)\\\\n\",\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"metadata\":{\"_cell_guid\":\"22ba49b5-b3b6-4129-8c57-623e0d863ab3\",\"_uuid\":\"ff014109d795c5d1bfcc66c9761730406124ebe4\"}},{\"source\":\"<a id=\\\\\"ch4\\\\\"></a>\\\\n# Step 3: Prepare Data for Consumption\\\\nSince step 2 was provided to us on a golden plater, so is step 3.

Using the same dataset and different implementation of a decision tree (adaboost, random forest, gradient boost, xgboost, etc.) with tuning does not exceed the 0.77990 submission accuracy. Interesting for this dataset, the simple decision tree algorithm had the best default submission score and with tuning achieved the same best accuracy score.\\\\n\\\\nWhile no general conclusions can be made from testing a handful of algorithms on a single dataset, there are several observations on the mentioned dataset. \\\\n1. The train dataset has a different distribution than the test/validation dataset and population. This created wide margins between the cross validation (CV) accuracy score and Kaggle submission accuracy score.\\\\n2. Given the same dataset, decision tree based algorithms, seemed to converge on the same accuracy score after proper tuning.\\\\n3. Despite tuning, no machine learning algorithm, exceeded the homemade algorithm. The author will theorize, that for small datasets, a manmade algorithm is the bar to beat. \\\\n\\\\nWith that in mind, for iteration two, I would spend more time on preprocessing and feature engineering. In order to better align the CV score and Kaggle score and improve the overall accuracy.\\\\n\\\\n\",\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"metadata\":{\"_cell_guid\":\"a6d34edc-1265-41e8-b163-0b817cd3b6a5\",\"_uuid\":\"c476df95925d67809975caca4ea4dcb4b2a0b277\"}},{\"source\":\"<a id=\\\\\"ch90\\\\\"></a>\\\\n## Change Log:\\\\n11/22/17 Please note, this kernel is currently in progress, but open to feedback.

In a nutshell stacking uses as a first-level (base), the predictions of a few basic classifiers and then uses another model at the second-level to predict the output from the earlier first-level predictions.\\\\n\\\\nThe Titanic dataset is a prime candidate for introducing this concept as many newcomers to Kaggle start out here. Furthermore even though stacking has been responsible for many a team winning Kaggle competitions there seems to be a dearth of kernels on this topic so I hope this notebook can fill somewhat of that void.\\\\n\\\\nI myself am quite a newcomer to the Kaggle scene as well and the first proper ensembling/stacking script that I managed to chance upon and study was one written in the AllState Severity Claims competition by the great Faron. The material in this notebook borrows heavily from Faron\\'s script although ported to factor in ensembles of classifiers whilst his was ensembles of regressors. Anyway please check out his script here:\\\\n\\\\n[Stacking Starter][1] : by Faron \\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNow onto the notebook at hand and I hope that it manages to do justice and convey the concept of ensembling in an intuitive and concise manner.  My other standalone Kaggle [script][2] which implements exactly the same ensembling steps (albeit with different parameters) discussed below gives a Public LB score of 0.808 which is good enough to get to the top 9% and runs just under 4 minutes. Therefore I am pretty sure there is a lot of room to improve and add on to that script.

However many will skip some of the explanation on how the solution is developed as these notebooks are developed by experts for experts. The objective of this notebook is to follow a step-by-step workflow, explaining each step and rationale for every decision we take during solution development.\\\\n\\\\n## Workflow stages\\\\n\\\\nThe competition solution workflow goes through seven stages described in the Data Science Solutions book.\\\\n\\\\n1. Question or problem definition.\\\\n2. Acquire training and testing data.\\\\n3. Wrangle, prepare, cleanse the data.\\\\n4. Analyze, identify patterns, and explore the data.\\\\n5. Model, predict and solve the problem.\\\\n6. Visualize, report, and present the problem solving steps and final solution.\\\\n7. Supply or submit the results.\\\\n\\\\nThe workflow indicates general sequence of how each stage may follow the other. However there are use cases with exceptions.\\\\n\\\\n- We may combine mulitple workflow stages. We may analyze by visualizing data.\\\\n- Perform a stage earlier than indicated. We may analyze data before and after wrangling.\\\\n- Perform a stage multiple times in our workflow. Visualize stage may be used multiple times.\\\\n- Drop a stage altogether. We may not need supply stage to productize or service enable our dataset for a competition.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Question and problem definition\\\\n\\\\nCompetition sites like Kaggle define the problem to solve or questions to ask while providing the datasets for training your data science model and testing the model results against a test dataset. The question or problem definition for Titanic Survival competition is [described here at Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).\\\\n\\\\n> Knowing from a training set of samples listing passengers who survived or did not survive the Titanic disaster, can our model determine based on a given test dataset not containing the survival information, if these passengers in the test dataset survived or not.\\\\n\\\\nWe may also want to develop some early understanding about the domain of our problem. This is described on the [Kaggle competition description page here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). Here are the highlights to note.\\\\n\\\\n- On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. Translated 32% survival rate.\\\\n- One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew.\\\\n- Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.\\\\n\\\\n## Workflow goals\\\\n\\\\nThe data science solutions workflow solves for seven major goals.\\\\n\\\\n**Classifying.** We may want to classify or categorize our samples. We may also want to understand the implications or correlation of different classes with our solution goal.\\\\n\\\\n**Correlating.** One can approach the problem based on available features within the training dataset. Which features within the dataset contribute significantly to our solution goal? Statistically speaking is there a [correlation](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Correlation) among a feature and solution goal? As the feature values change does the solution state change as well, and visa-versa? This can be tested both for numerical and categorical features in the given dataset. We may also want to determine correlation among features other than survival for subsequent goals and workflow stages. Correlating certain features may help in creating, completing, or correcting features.\\\\n\\\\n**Converting.** For modeling stage, one needs to prepare the data. Depending on the choice of model algorithm one may require all features to be converted to numerical equivalent values. So for instance converting text categorical values to numeric values.\\\\n\\\\n**Completing.** Data preparation may also require us to estimate any missing values within a feature. Model algorithms may work best when there are no missing values.\\\\n\\\\n**Correcting.** We may also analyze the given training dataset for errors or possibly innacurate values within features and try to corrent these values or exclude the samples containing the errors. One way to do this is to detect any outliers among our samples or features. We may also completely discard a feature if it is not contribting to the analysis or may significantly skew the results.\\\\n\\\\n**Creating.** Can we create new features based on an existing feature or a set of features, such that the new feature follows the correlation, conversion, completeness goals.\\\\n\\\\n**Charting.** How to select the right visualization plots and charts depending on nature of the data and the solution goals.\"},{\"metadata\":{\"_uuid\":\"960f8b1937dc4915ce1eb0f82614b1985c4321a4\",\"_cell_guid\":\"56a3be4e-76ef-20c6-25e8-da16147cf6d7\"},\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"source\":\"## Refactor Release 2017-Jan-29\\\\n\\\\nWe are significantly refactoring the notebook based on (a) comments received by readers, (b) issues in porting notebook from Jupyter kernel (2.7) to Kaggle kernel (3.5), and (c) review of few more best practice kernels.\\\\n\\\\n### User comments\\\\n\\\\n- Combine training and test data for certain operations like converting titles across dataset to numerical values.

We've got channels for competitions, job postings and career discussions, resources, and socializing with your fellow data scientists. Follow the link here:** https://discord.gg/kaggle\n\nThe competition is simple: use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.\n\nRead on or watch the video below to explore more details. Once you’re ready to start competing, click on the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/account/login?returnUrl=%2Fc%2Ftitanic\" target=\"_blank\">\"Join Competition button</a> to create an account and gain access to the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data\" target=\"_blank\">competition data</a>. Then check out <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/titanic-tutorial\">Alexis Cook’s Titanic Tutorial</a> that walks you through step by step how to make your first submission!\n\n<iframe width=\"699\" height=\"368\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8yZMXCaFshs\" title=\"YouTube video | How to Get Started with Kaggle’s Titanic Competition | Kaggle\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n## The Challenge\nThe sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.\n\nOn April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.\n\nWhile there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.\n\nIn this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).\n\n> #### Recommended Tutorial\n> We highly recommend [Alexis Cook’s Titanic Tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/titanic-tutorial) that walks you through making your very first submission step by step and [this starter notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/gusthema/titanic-competition-w-tensorflow-decision-forests) to get started.\n\n## How Kaggle’s Competitions Work\n1. **Join the Competition**\nRead about the challenge description, accept the Competition Rules and gain access to the competition dataset.\n1.  **Get to Work**\nDownload the data, build models on it locally or on Kaggle Notebooks (our no-setup, customizable Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs) and generate a prediction file.\n1.  **Make a Submission**\nUpload your prediction as a submission on Kaggle and receive an accuracy score.\n1.  **Check the Leaderboard**\nSee how your model ranks against other Kagglers on our leaderboard. \n1.  **Improve Your Score**\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a> to find lots of tutorials and insights from other competitors.\n\n> #### Kaggle Lingo Video\n> You may run into unfamiliar lingo as you dig into the Kaggle discussion forums and public notebooks. Check out  Dr. Rachael Tatman’s [video on Kaggle Lingo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEJHyuWKd-s) to get up to speed!\n\n## What Data Will I Use in This Competition?\nIn this competition, you’ll gain access to two similar datasets that include passenger information like name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc. One dataset is titled `train.csv` and the other is titled `test.csv`.\n\n`Train.csv` will contain the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 to be exact) and importantly, will reveal whether they survived or not, also known as the “ground truth”.\n\nThe `test.csv` dataset contains similar information but does not disclose the “ground truth” for each passenger. It’s your job to predict these outcomes.\n\nUsing the patterns you find in the `train.csv` data, predict whether the other 418 passengers on board (found in `test.csv`) survived.\n\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data\">“Data” tab</a> to explore the datasets even further. Once you feel you’ve created a competitive model, submit it to Kaggle to see where your model stands on our leaderboard against other Kagglers.\n\n## How to Submit your Prediction to Kaggle\nOnce you’re ready to make a submission and get on the leaderboard:\n\n1. Click on the “Submit Predictions” button\n<img width=\"699\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen1.png\">\n1. Upload a CSV file in the submission file format. You’re able to submit 10 submissions a day.\n<img width=\"699\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen2.png\">\n\n## Submission File Format:\nYou should submit a csv file with exactly 418 entries plus a header row. Your submission will show an error if you have extra columns (beyond `PassengerId` and `Survived`) or rows.\n\nThe file should have exactly 2 columns:\n- `PassengerId` (sorted in any order)\n- `Survived` (contains your binary predictions: 1 for survived, 0 for deceased)\n\n## Got it! I’m ready to get started. Where do I get help if I need it?\n- For Competition Help: <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\">Titanic Discussion Forum</a>\n\nKaggle doesn’t have a dedicated team to help troubleshoot your code so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. The forums are full of useful information on the data, metric, and different approaches. We encourage you to use the forums often. If you share your knowledge, you'll find that others will share a lot in turn!\n\n## A Last Word on Kaggle Notebooks\nAs we mentioned before, Kaggle Notebooks is our no-setup, customizable, Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs and a huge repository of community published data &amp; code.\n\nIn every competition, you’ll find many Notebooks shared with incredible insights. It’s an invaluable resource worth becoming familiar with. Check out this competition’s Notebooks <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/notebooks\">here</a>.\n\n## 🏃‍♀Ready to Compete? <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/account/login?returnUrl=%2Fc%2Ftitanic\">Join the Competition Here!</a>\n\n## Evaluation\n\n<h2>Goal</h2>\n<p>It is your job to predict if a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic or not. <br>For each  in the test set, you must predict a 0 or 1 value for the  variable.</p>\n<h2>Metric</h2>\n<p>Your score is the percentage of passengers you correctly predict. This is known as <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision#In_binary_classification\">accuracy</a>.</p>\n<h2>Submission File Format</h2>\n<p>You should submit a csv file with exactly 418 entries <b>plus</b> a header row. Your submission will show an error if you have extra columns (beyond PassengerId and Survived) or rows.<br><br>The file should have exactly 2 columns:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>PassengerId (sorted in any order)</li>\n<li>Survived (contains your binary predictions: 1 for survived, 0 for deceased)</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><b>PassengerId,Survived</b><br>892,0<br>893,1<br>894,0<br>Etc.</pre>\n<p>You can download an example submission file (gender_submission.csv) on the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data\">Data page</a>.</p>\n\n## data-description\n\n<h3>Overview</h3>\n<p>The data has been split into two groups:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>training set (train.csv)</li>\n<li>test set (test.csv)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b> The training set </b>should be used to build your machine learning models. For the training set, we provide the outcome (also known as the “ground truth”) for each passenger. Your model will be based on “features” like passengers’ gender and class. You can also use <a href=\"https://triangleinequality.wordpress.com/2013/09/08/basic-feature-engineering-with-the-titanic-data/\" target=\"_blank\"> feature engineering </a>to create new features.</p>\n<p><b>The test set </b>should be used to see how well your model performs on unseen data. For the test set, we do not provide the ground truth for each passenger. It is your job to predict these outcomes. For each passenger in the test set, use the model you trained to predict whether or not they survived the sinking of the Titanic.</p>\n<p>We also include <b>gender_submission.csv</b>, a set of predictions that assume all and only female passengers survive, as an example of what a submission file should look like.</p>\n<h3>Data Dictionary</h3>\n<table style=\"width: 100%;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr><th><b>Variable</b></th><th><b>Definition</b></th><th><b>Key</b></th></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>survival</td>\n<td>Survival</td>\n<td>0 = No, 1 = Yes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>pclass</td>\n<td>Ticket class</td>\n<td>1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>sex</td>\n<td>Sex</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Age</td>\n<td>Age in years</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>sibsp</td>\n<td># of siblings / spouses aboard the Titanic</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>parch</td>\n<td># of parents / children aboard the Titanic</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>ticket</td>\n<td>Ticket number</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>fare</td>\n<td>Passenger fare</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>cabin</td>\n<td>Cabin number</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>embarked</td>\n<td>Port of Embarkation</td>\n<td>C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>Variable Notes</h3>\n<p><b>pclass</b>: A proxy for socio-economic status (SES)<br /> 1st = Upper<br /> 2nd = Middle<br /> 3rd = Lower<br /><br /> <b>age</b>: Age is fractional if less than 1.

They are a great place to begin if you are new to data science or just finished a MOOC and want to get involved in Kaggle.</p>\n<p>Getting Started competitions are a non-competitive way to get familiar with Kaggle’s platform, learn basic machine learning concepts, and start meeting people in the community. They have no cash prize and are on a rolling timeline.</p>\n<h2>How do I create and manage a team?</h2>\n<p>When you accept the competition rules, a team will be created for you. You can invite others to your team, accept a merger with another team, and update basic information like team name by going to the More &gt; <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/team\" target=\"_blank\">Team</a> page.</p>\n<p>We've heard from many Kagglers that teaming up is the best way to learn new skills AND have fun. If you don't have a teammate already, consider asking if anyone wants to team up in the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a>.</p>\n<h2>What are Notebooks?</h2>\n<p>Kaggle Notebooks is a cloud computational environment that enables reproducible and collaborative analysis. Notebooks support scripts in Python and R, Jupyter Notebooks, and RMarkdown reports. You can visit the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/notebooks\" target=\"_blank\">Notebooks</a> tab to view all of the publicly shared code for the Titanic competition. For more on how to use Notebooks to learn data science, check out our <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview\" target=\"&quot;_blank\">Courses</a>!</p>\n<h2>Why did my team disappear from the leaderboard?</h2>\n<p>To keep with the spirit of getting-started competitions, we have implemented a two month rolling window on submissions. Once a submission is more than two months old, it will be invalidated and no longer count towards the leaderboard.</p>\n<p>If your team has no submissions in the previous two months, the team will also drop from the leaderboard. This will keep the leaderboard at a manageable size, freshen it up, and prevent newcomers from getting lost in a sea of abandoned scores.</p>\n<p><i>\"I worked so hard to get that score! Give it back!\"</i> Read more about our decision to implement a rolling leaderboard <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion/6240\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n<h2>How do I contact Support?</h2>\n<p>Kaggle does not have a dedicated support team so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. (For this competition, you’ll want to use the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">Titanic discussion forum)</a>.</p>\n<p>Support is only able to help with issues that are being experienced by all participants. Before contacting support, please check the discussion forum for information on your problem. If you can’t find it, you can post your problem in the forum so a fellow participant or a Kaggle team member can provide help. The forums are full of useful information on the data, metric, and different approaches. We encourage you to use the forums often. If you share your knowledge, you'll find that others will share a lot in turn!</p>\n<p>If your problem persists or it seems to be effective all participants then please <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/contact\" target=\"_blank\">contact us</a>.</p>\ntool: Not a directory: /home/code/exploration/../research/writeups\ntool: /home/code/exploration/../research/kernels:\n[DIR]  alexisbcook_exercise-arithmetic-and-variables/\n[DIR]  alexisbcook_titanic-tutorial/\n[DIR]  arthurtok_introduction-to-ensembling-stacking-in-python/\n[DIR]  ldfreeman3_a-data-science-framework-to-achieve-99-accuracy/\n[FILE] metadata.json (1.7KB)\n[DIR]  startupsci_titanic-data-science-solutions/\ntool: /home/data:\n[FILE] description.md (13.6KB)\n[FILE] gender_submission.csv (3.2KB)\n[FILE] test.csv (28.0KB)\n[FILE] train.csv (59.8KB)\ntool: Error: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/home/code/exploration/../research/kernels/ldfreeman3_a-data-science-framework-to-achieve-99-accuracy/ldfreeman3_a-data-science-framework-to-achieve-99-accuracy.py'\ntool: Error: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/home/code/exploration/../research/kernels/arthurtok_introduction-to-ensembling-stacking-in-python/arthurtok_introduction-to-ensembling-stacking-in-python.py'\ntool: /home/code/exploration/../research/kernels/ldfreeman3_a-data-science-framework-to-achieve-99-accuracy:\n[FILE] a-data-science-framework-to-achieve-99-accuracy.ipynb (107.1KB)\n[FILE] kernel-metadata.json (732.0B)\ntool: /home/code/exploration/../research/kernels/arthurtok_introduction-to-ensembling-stacking-in-python:\n[FILE] introduction-to-ensembling-stacking-in-python.ipynb (39.3KB)\n[FILE] kernel-metadata.json (687.0B)\ntool: /home/code/exploration/../research/kernels/startupsci_titanic-data-science-solutions:\n[FILE] kernel-metadata.json (661.0B)\n[FILE] titanic-data-science-solutions.ipynb (55.5KB)\ntool: {\"cells\":[{\"source\":\"\\n>Hello and Welcome to Kaggle, the online Data Science Community to learn, share, and compete.

For example, you won or did not win, you passed the test or did not pass the test, you were accepted or not accepted, and you get the point. A common business application is churn or customer retention. Another popular use case is, healthcare's mortality rate or survival analysis. Binary events create an interesting dynamic, because we know statistically, a random guess should achieve a 50% accuracy rate, without creating one single algorithm or writing one single line of code. However, just like autocorrect spellcheck technology, sometimes we humans can be too smart for our own good and actually underperform a coin flip. In this kernel, I use Kaggle's Getting Started Competition, Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster, to walk the reader through, how-to use the data science framework to beat the odds.\\n   \\n*What happens when technology is too smart for its own good?*\\n![Funny Autocorrect](http://15858-presscdn-0-65.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/hilarious-autocorrect-fails-20x.jpg)\",\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"metadata\":{\"_cell_guid\":\"ec31d549-537e-4f35-8594-22ef03079081\",\"_uuid\":\"ff6c70c884a8a5fb3258e7f3fefc9e55261df1df\"}},{\"source\":\"<a id=\\\"ch2\\\"></a>\\n# A Data Science Framework\\n1. **Define the Problem:** If data science, big data, machine learning, predictive analytics, business intelligence, or any other buzzword is the solution, then what is the problem? As the saying goes, don't put the cart before the horse. Problems before requirements, requirements before solutions, solutions before design, and design before technology. Too often we are quick to jump on the new shiny technology, tool, or algorithm before determining the actual problem we are trying to solve.\\n2. **Gather the Data:** John Naisbitt wrote in his 1984 (yes, 1984) book Megatrends, we are “drowning in data, yet staving for knowledge.\\\" So, chances are, the dataset(s) already exist somewhere, in some format. It may be external or internal, structured or unstructured, static or streamed, objective or subjective, etc. As the saying goes, you don't have to reinvent the wheel, you just have to know where to find it. In the next step, we will worry about transforming \\\"dirty data\\\" to \\\"clean data.\\\"\\n3. **Prepare Data for Consumption:** This step is often referred to as data wrangling, a required process to turn “wild” data into “manageable” data. Data wrangling includes implementing data architectures for storage and processing, developing data governance standards for quality and control, data extraction (i.e. ETL and web scraping), and data cleaning to identify aberrant, missing, or outlier data points.\\n4. **Perform Exploratory Analysis:** Anybody who has ever worked with data knows, garbage-in, garbage-out (GIGO). Therefore, it is important to deploy descriptive and graphical statistics to look for potential problems, patterns, classifications, correlations and comparisons in the dataset. In addition, data categorization (i.e. qualitative vs quantitative) is also important to understand and select the correct hypothesis test or data model.\\n5. **Model Data:** Like descriptive and inferential statistics, data modeling can either summarize the data or predict future outcomes. Your dataset and expected results, will determine the algorithms available for use. It's important to remember, algorithms are tools and not magical wands or silver bullets. You must still be the master craft (wo)man that knows how-to select the right tool for the job. An analogy would be asking someone to hand you a Philip screwdriver, and they hand you a flathead screwdriver or worst a hammer. At best, it shows a complete lack of understanding. At worst, it makes completing the project impossible. The same is true in data modelling. The wrong model can lead to poor performance at best and the wrong conclusion (that’s used as actionable intelligence) at worst.\\n6. **Validate and Implement Data Model:** After you've trained your model based on a subset of your data, it's time to test your model. This helps ensure you haven't overfit your model or made it so specific to the selected subset, that it does not accurately fit another subset from the same dataset. In this step we determine if our [model overfit, generalize, or underfit our dataset](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/latest/dg/model-fit-underfitting-vs-overfitting.html).\\n7. **Optimize and Strategize:** This is the \\\"bionic man\\\" step, where you iterate back through the process to make it better...stronger...faster than it was before. As a data scientist, your strategy should be to outsource developer operations and application plumbing, so you have more time to focus on recommendations and design. Once you're able to package your ideas, this becomes your “currency exchange\\\" rate.\",\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"metadata\":{\"_cell_guid\":\"8514a868-6816-494a-9e9c-dba14cb36f42\",\"_uuid\":\"bd2a68dcaace0c1371f2994f0204dce65800cc20\"}},{\"source\":\"<a id=\\\"ch3\\\"></a>\\n# Step 1: Define the Problem\\nFor this project, the problem statement is given to us on a golden plater, develop an algorithm to predict the survival outcome of passengers on the Titanic.\\n\\n......\\n\\n**Project Summary:**\\nThe sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.\\n\\nOne of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.\\n\\nIn this challenge, we ask you to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular, we ask you to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.\\n\\nPractice Skills\\n* Binary classification\\n* Python and R basics\\n\\n# Step 2: Gather the Data\\n\\nThe dataset is also given to us on a golden plater with test and train data at [Kaggle's Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)\\n\",\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"metadata\":{\"_cell_guid\":\"22ba49b5-b3b6-4129-8c57-623e0d863ab3\",\"_uuid\":\"ff014109d795c5d1bfcc66c9761730406124ebe4\"}},{\"source\":\"<a id=\\\"ch4\\\"></a>\\n# Step 3: Prepare Data for Consumption\\nSince step 2 was provided to us on a golden plater, so is step 3.

Using the same dataset and different implementation of a decision tree (adaboost, random forest, gradient boost, xgboost, etc.) with tuning does not exceed the 0.77990 submission accuracy. Interesting for this dataset, the simple decision tree algorithm had the best default submission score and with tuning achieved the same best accuracy score.\\n\\nWhile no general conclusions can be made from testing a handful of algorithms on a single dataset, there are several observations on the mentioned dataset. \\n1. The train dataset has a different distribution than the test/validation dataset and population. This created wide margins between the cross validation (CV) accuracy score and Kaggle submission accuracy score.\\n2. Given the same dataset, decision tree based algorithms, seemed to converge on the same accuracy score after proper tuning.\\n3. Despite tuning, no machine learning algorithm, exceeded the homemade algorithm. The author will theorize, that for small datasets, a manmade algorithm is the bar to beat. \\n\\nWith that in mind, for iteration two, I would spend more time on preprocessing and feature engineering. In order to better align the CV score and Kaggle score and improve the overall accuracy.\\n\\n\",\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"metadata\":{\"_cell_guid\":\"a6d34edc-1265-41e8-b163-0b817cd3b6a5\",\"_uuid\":\"c476df95925d67809975caca4ea4dcb4b2a0b277\"}},{\"source\":\"<a id=\\\"ch90\\\"></a>\\n## Change Log:\\n11/22/17 Please note, this kernel is currently in progress, but open to feedback.

In a nutshell stacking uses as a first-level (base), the predictions of a few basic classifiers and then uses another model at the second-level to predict the output from the earlier first-level predictions.\\n\\nThe Titanic dataset is a prime candidate for introducing this concept as many newcomers to Kaggle start out here. Furthermore even though stacking has been responsible for many a team winning Kaggle competitions there seems to be a dearth of kernels on this topic so I hope this notebook can fill somewhat of that void.\\n\\nI myself am quite a newcomer to the Kaggle scene as well and the first proper ensembling/stacking script that I managed to chance upon and study was one written in the AllState Severity Claims competition by the great Faron. The material in this notebook borrows heavily from Faron's script although ported to factor in ensembles of classifiers whilst his was ensembles of regressors. Anyway please check out his script here:\\n\\n[Stacking Starter][1] : by Faron \\n\\n\\nNow onto the notebook at hand and I hope that it manages to do justice and convey the concept of ensembling in an intuitive and concise manner.  My other standalone Kaggle [script][2] which implements exactly the same ensembling steps (albeit with different parameters) discussed below gives a Public LB score of 0.808 which is good enough to get to the top 9% and runs just under 4 minutes.

However many will skip some of the explanation on how the solution is developed as these notebooks are developed by experts for experts. The objective of this notebook is to follow a step-by-step workflow, explaining each step and rationale for every decision we take during solution development.\\n\\n## Workflow stages\\n\\nThe competition solution workflow goes through seven stages described in the Data Science Solutions book.\\n\\n1. Question or problem definition.\\n2. Acquire training and testing data.\\n3. Wrangle, prepare, cleanse the data.\\n4. Analyze, identify patterns, and explore the data.\\n5. Model, predict and solve the problem.\\n6. Visualize, report, and present the problem solving steps and final solution.\\n7. Supply or submit the results.\\n\\nThe workflow indicates general sequence of how each stage may follow the other. However there are use cases with exceptions.\\n\\n- We may combine mulitple workflow stages. We may analyze by visualizing data.\\n- Perform a stage earlier than indicated. We may analyze data before and after wrangling.\\n- Perform a stage multiple times in our workflow. Visualize stage may be used multiple times.\\n- Drop a stage altogether. We may not need supply stage to productize or service enable our dataset for a competition.\\n\\n\\n## Question and problem definition\\n\\nCompetition sites like Kaggle define the problem to solve or questions to ask while providing the datasets for training your data science model and testing the model results against a test dataset. The question or problem definition for Titanic Survival competition is [described here at Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).\\n\\n> Knowing from a training set of samples listing passengers who survived or did not survive the Titanic disaster, can our model determine based on a given test dataset not containing the survival information, if these passengers in the test dataset survived or not.\\n\\nWe may also want to develop some early understanding about the domain of our problem. This is described on the [Kaggle competition description page here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). Here are the highlights to note.\\n\\n- On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. Translated 32% survival rate.\\n- One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew.\\n- Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.\\n\\n## Workflow goals\\n\\nThe data science solutions workflow solves for seven major goals.\\n\\n**Classifying.** We may want to classify or categorize our samples. We may also want to understand the implications or correlation of different classes with our solution goal.\\n\\n**Correlating.** One can approach the problem based on available features within the training dataset. Which features within the dataset contribute significantly to our solution goal? Statistically speaking is there a [correlation](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Correlation) among a feature and solution goal? As the feature values change does the solution state change as well, and visa-versa? This can be tested both for numerical and categorical features in the given dataset. We may also want to determine correlation among features other than survival for subsequent goals and workflow stages. Correlating certain features may help in creating, completing, or correcting features.\\n\\n**Converting.** For modeling stage, one needs to prepare the data. Depending on the choice of model algorithm one may require all features to be converted to numerical equivalent values. So for instance converting text categorical values to numeric values.\\n\\n**Completing.** Data preparation may also require us to estimate any missing values within a feature. Model algorithms may work best when there are no missing values.\\n\\n**Correcting.** We may also analyze the given training dataset for errors or possibly innacurate values within features and try to corrent these values or exclude the samples containing the errors. One way to do this is to detect any outliers among our samples or features. We may also completely discard a feature if it is not contribting to the analysis or may significantly skew the results.\\n\\n**Creating.** Can we create new features based on an existing feature or a set of features, such that the new feature follows the correlation, conversion, completeness goals.\\n\\n**Charting.** How to select the right visualization plots and charts depending on nature of the data and the solution goals.\"},{\"metadata\":{\"_uuid\":\"960f8b1937dc4915ce1eb0f82614b1985c4321a4\",\"_cell_guid\":\"56a3be4e-76ef-20c6-25e8-da16147cf6d7\"},\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"source\":\"## Refactor Release 2017-Jan-29\\n\\nWe are significantly refactoring the notebook based on (a) comments received by readers, (b) issues in porting notebook from Jupyter kernel (2.7) to Kaggle kernel (3.5), and (c) review of few more best practice kernels.\\n\\n### User comments\\n\\n- Combine training and test data for certain operations like converting titles across dataset to numerical values.

Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.\\n\\nWhile there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.\\n\\nIn this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).\\n\\n> #### Recommended Tutorial\\n> We highly recommend [Alexis Cook’s Titanic Tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/titanic-tutorial) that walks you through making your very first submission step by step and [this starter notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/gusthema/titanic-competition-w-tensorflow-decision-forests) to get started.\\n\\n## How Kaggle’s Competitions Work\\n1. **Join the Competition**\\nRead about the challenge description, accept the Competition Rules and gain access to the competition dataset.\\n1.  **Get to Work**\\nDownload the data, build models on it locally or on Kaggle Notebooks (our no-setup, customizable Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs) and generate a prediction file.\\n1.  **Make a Submission**\\nUpload your prediction as a submission on Kaggle and receive an accuracy score.\\n1.  **Check the Leaderboard**\\nSee how your model ranks against other Kagglers on our leaderboard. \\n1.  **Improve Your Score**\\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a> to find lots of tutorials and insights from other competitors.\\n\\n> #### Kaggle Lingo Video\\n> You may run into unfamiliar lingo as you dig into the Kaggle discussion forums and public notebooks. Check out  Dr. Rachael Tatman’s [video on Kaggle Lingo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEJHyuWKd-s) to get up to speed!\\n\\n## What Data Will I Use in This Competition?\\nIn this competition, you’ll gain access to two similar datasets that include passenger information like name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc. One dataset is titled `train.csv` and the other is titled `test.csv`.\\n\\n`Train.csv` will contain the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 to be exact) and importantly, will reveal whether they survived or not, also known as the “ground truth”.\\n\\nThe `test.csv` dataset contains similar information but does not disclose the “ground truth” for each passenger. It’s your job to predict these outcomes.\\n\\nUsing the patterns you find in the `train.csv` data, predict whether the other 418 passengers on board (found in `test.csv`) survived.\\n\\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data\">“Data” tab</a> to explore the datasets even further. Once you feel you’ve created a competitive model, submit it to Kaggle to see where your model stands on our leaderboard against other Kagglers.\\n\\n## How to Submit your Prediction to Kaggle\\nOnce you’re ready to make a submission and get on the leaderboard:\\n\\n1. Click on the “Submit Predictions” button\\n<img width=\"699\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen1.png\">\\n1. Upload a CSV file in the submission file format. You’re able to submit 10 submissions a day.\\n<img width=\"699\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen2.png\">\\n\\n## Submission File Format:\\nYou should submit a csv file with exactly 418 entries plus a header row. Your submission will show an error if you have extra columns (beyond `PassengerId` and `Survived`) or rows.\\n\\nThe file should have exactly 2 columns:\\n- `PassengerId` (sorted in any order)\\n- `Survived` (contains your binary predictions: 1 for survived, 0 for deceased)\\n\\n## Got it! I’m ready to get started. Where do I get help if I need it?\\n- For Competition Help: <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\">Titanic Discussion Forum</a>\\n\\nKaggle doesn’t have a dedicated team to help troubleshoot your code so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. The forums are full of useful information on the data, metric, and different approaches. We encourage you to use the forums often. If you share your knowledge, you\\'ll find that others will share a lot in turn!\\n\\n## A Last Word on Kaggle Notebooks\\nAs we mentioned before, Kaggle Notebooks is our no-setup, customizable, Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs and a huge repository of community published data &amp; code.\\n\\nIn every competition, you’ll find many Notebooks shared with incredible insights. It’s an invaluable resource worth becoming familiar with.

They are a great place to begin if you are new to data science or just finished a MOOC and want to get involved in Kaggle.</p>\\n<p>Getting Started competitions are a non-competitive way to get familiar with Kaggle’s platform, learn basic machine learning concepts, and start meeting people in the community. They have no cash prize and are on a rolling timeline.</p>\\n<h2>How do I create and manage a team?</h2>\\n<p>When you accept the competition rules, a team will be created for you. You can invite others to your team, accept a merger with another team, and update basic information like team name by going to the More &gt; <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/team\" target=\"_blank\">Team</a> page.</p>\\n<p>We\\'ve heard from many Kagglers that teaming up is the best way to learn new skills AND have fun. If you don\\'t have a teammate already, consider asking if anyone wants to team up in the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a>.</p>\\n<h2>What are Notebooks?</h2>\\n<p>Kaggle Notebooks is a cloud computational environment that enables reproducible and collaborative analysis. Notebooks support scripts in Python and R, Jupyter Notebooks, and RMarkdown reports. You can visit the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/notebooks\" target=\"_blank\">Notebooks</a> tab to view all of the publicly shared code for the Titanic competition. For more on how to use Notebooks to learn data science, check out our <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview\" target=\"&quot;_blank\">Courses</a>!</p>\\n<h2>Why did my team disappear from the leaderboard?</h2>\\n<p>To keep with the spirit of getting-started competitions, we have implemented a two month rolling window on submissions. Once a submission is more than two months old, it will be invalidated and no longer count towards the leaderboard.</p>\\n<p>If your team has no submissions in the previous two months, the team will also drop from the leaderboard. This will keep the leaderboard at a manageable size, freshen it up, and prevent newcomers from getting lost in a sea of abandoned scores.</p>\\n<p><i>\"I worked so hard to get that score! Give it back!\"</i> Read more about our decision to implement a rolling leaderboard <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion/6240\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\\n<h2>How do I contact Support?</h2>\\n<p>Kaggle does not have a dedicated support team so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. (For this competition, you’ll want to use the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">Titanic discussion forum)</a>.</p>\\n<p>Support is only able to help with issues that are being experienced by all participants. Before contacting support, please check the discussion forum for information on your problem. If you can’t find it, you can post your problem in the forum so a fellow participant or a Kaggle team member can provide help. The forums are full of useful information on the data, metric, and different approaches. We encourage you to use the forums often.

In laymen terms this means, it either occurred or did not occur. For example, you won or did not win, you passed the test or did not pass the test, you were accepted or not accepted, and you get the point. A common business application is churn or customer retention. Another popular use case is, healthcare\\'s mortality rate or survival analysis. Binary events create an interesting dynamic, because we know statistically, a random guess should achieve a 50% accuracy rate, without creating one single algorithm or writing one single line of code. However, just like autocorrect spellcheck technology, sometimes we humans can be too smart for our own good and actually underperform a coin flip. In this kernel, I use Kaggle\\'s Getting Started Competition, Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster, to walk the reader through, how-to use the data science framework to beat the odds.\\\\n   \\\\n*What happens when technology is too smart for its own good?*\\\\n![Funny Autocorrect](http://15858-presscdn-0-65.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/hilarious-autocorrect-fails-20x.jpg)\",\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"metadata\":{\"_cell_guid\":\"ec31d549-537e-4f35-8594-22ef03079081\",\"_uuid\":\"ff6c70c884a8a5fb3258e7f3fefc9e55261df1df\"}},{\"source\":\"<a id=\\\\\"ch2\\\\\"></a>\\\\n# A Data Science Framework\\\\n1. **Define the Problem:** If data science, big data, machine learning, predictive analytics, business intelligence, or any other buzzword is the solution, then what is the problem? As the saying goes, don\\'t put the cart before the horse. Problems before requirements, requirements before solutions, solutions before design, and design before technology. Too often we are quick to jump on the new shiny technology, tool, or algorithm before determining the actual problem we are trying to solve.\\\\n2. **Gather the Data:** John Naisbitt wrote in his 1984 (yes, 1984) book Megatrends, we are “drowning in data, yet staving for knowledge.\\\\\" So, chances are, the dataset(s) already exist somewhere, in some format. It may be external or internal, structured or unstructured, static or streamed, objective or subjective, etc. As the saying goes, you don\\'t have to reinvent the wheel, you just have to know where to find it. In the next step, we will worry about transforming \\\\\"dirty data\\\\\" to \\\\\"clean data.\\\\\"\\\\n3. **Prepare Data for Consumption:** This step is often referred to as data wrangling, a required process to turn “wild” data into “manageable” data. Data wrangling includes implementing data architectures for storage and processing, developing data governance standards for quality and control, data extraction (i.e. ETL and web scraping), and data cleaning to identify aberrant, missing, or outlier data points.\\\\n4. **Perform Exploratory Analysis:** Anybody who has ever worked with data knows, garbage-in, garbage-out (GIGO). Therefore, it is important to deploy descriptive and graphical statistics to look for potential problems, patterns, classifications, correlations and comparisons in the dataset. In addition, data categorization (i.e. qualitative vs quantitative) is also important to understand and select the correct hypothesis test or data model.\\\\n5. **Model Data:** Like descriptive and inferential statistics, data modeling can either summarize the data or predict future outcomes. Your dataset and expected results, will determine the algorithms available for use. It\\'s important to remember, algorithms are tools and not magical wands or silver bullets. You must still be the master craft (wo)man that knows how-to select the right tool for the job. An analogy would be asking someone to hand you a Philip screwdriver, and they hand you a flathead screwdriver or worst a hammer. At best, it shows a complete lack of understanding. At worst, it makes completing the project impossible. The same is true in data modelling. The wrong model can lead to poor performance at best and the wrong conclusion (that’s used as actionable intelligence) at worst.\\\\n6. **Validate and Implement Data Model:** After you\\'ve trained your model based on a subset of your data, it\\'s time to test your model. This helps ensure you haven\\'t overfit your model or made it so specific to the selected subset, that it does not accurately fit another subset from the same dataset. In this step we determine if our [model overfit, generalize, or underfit our dataset](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/latest/dg/model-fit-underfitting-vs-overfitting.html).\\\\n7. **Optimize and Strategize:** This is the \\\\\"bionic man\\\\\" step, where you iterate back through the process to make it better...stronger...faster than it was before. As a data scientist, your strategy should be to outsource developer operations and application plumbing, so you have more time to focus on recommendations and design. Once you\\'re able to package your ideas, this becomes your “currency exchange\\\\\" rate.\",\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"metadata\":{\"_cell_guid\":\"8514a868-6816-494a-9e9c-dba14cb36f42\",\"_uuid\":\"bd2a68dcaace0c1371f2994f0204dce65800cc20\"}},{\"source\":\"<a id=\\\\\"ch3\\\\\"></a>\\\\n# Step 1: Define the Problem\\\\nFor this project, the problem statement is given to us on a golden plater, develop an algorithm to predict the survival outcome of passengers on the Titanic.\\\\n\\\\n......\\\\n\\\\n**Project Summary:**\\\\nThe sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.

Using the same dataset and different implementation of a decision tree (adaboost, random forest, gradient boost, xgboost, etc.) with tuning does not exceed the 0.77990 submission accuracy. Interesting for this dataset, the simple decision tree algorithm had the best default submission score and with tuning achieved the same best accuracy score.\\\\n\\\\nWhile no general conclusions can be made from testing a handful of algorithms on a single dataset, there are several observations on the mentioned dataset. \\\\n1. The train dataset has a different distribution than the test/validation dataset and population. This created wide margins between the cross validation (CV) accuracy score and Kaggle submission accuracy score.\\\\n2. Given the same dataset, decision tree based algorithms, seemed to converge on the same accuracy score after proper tuning.\\\\n3. Despite tuning, no machine learning algorithm, exceeded the homemade algorithm. The author will theorize, that for small datasets, a manmade algorithm is the bar to beat. \\\\n\\\\nWith that in mind, for iteration two, I would spend more time on preprocessing and feature engineering. In order to better align the CV score and Kaggle score and improve the overall accuracy.\\\\n\\\\n\",\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"metadata\":{\"_cell_guid\":\"a6d34edc-1265-41e8-b163-0b817cd3b6a5\",\"_uuid\":\"c476df95925d67809975caca4ea4dcb4b2a0b277\"}},{\"source\":\"<a id=\\\\\"ch90\\\\\"></a>\\\\n## Change Log:\\\\n11/22/17 Please note, this kernel is currently in progress, but open to feedback.

In a nutshell stacking uses as a first-level (base), the predictions of a few basic classifiers and then uses another model at the second-level to predict the output from the earlier first-level predictions.\\\\n\\\\nThe Titanic dataset is a prime candidate for introducing this concept as many newcomers to Kaggle start out here. Furthermore even though stacking has been responsible for many a team winning Kaggle competitions there seems to be a dearth of kernels on this topic so I hope this notebook can fill somewhat of that void.\\\\n\\\\nI myself am quite a newcomer to the Kaggle scene as well and the first proper ensembling/stacking script that I managed to chance upon and study was one written in the AllState Severity Claims competition by the great Faron. The material in this notebook borrows heavily from Faron\\'s script although ported to factor in ensembles of classifiers whilst his was ensembles of regressors. Anyway please check out his script here:\\\\n\\\\n[Stacking Starter][1] : by Faron \\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNow onto the notebook at hand and I hope that it manages to do justice and convey the concept of ensembling in an intuitive and concise manner.  My other standalone Kaggle [script][2] which implements exactly the same ensembling steps (albeit with different parameters) discussed below gives a Public LB score of 0.808 which is good enough to get to the top 9% and runs just under 4 minutes. Therefore I am pretty sure there is a lot of room to improve and add on to that script. Anyways please feel free to leave me any comments with regards to how I can improve\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n  [1]: https://www.kaggle.com/mmueller/allstate-claims-severity/stacking-starter/run/390867\\\\n  [2]: https://www.kaggle.com/arthurtok/titanic/simple-stacking-with-xgboost-0-808\"},{\"metadata\":{\"_execution_state\":\"idle\",\"_cell_guid\":\"14630296-b1aa-759e-bafa-b6a73f3896ed\",\"_uuid\":\"2e37a274400cfeb472b6405d524325245588dd66\",\"trusted\":true},\"cell_type\":\"code\",\"source\":\"# Load in our libraries\\\\nimport pandas as pd\\\\nimport numpy as np\\\\nimport re\\\\nimport sklearn\\\\nimport xgboost as xgb\\\\nimport seaborn as sns\\\\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\\\\n%matplotlib inline\\\\n\\\\nimport plotly.offline as py\\\\npy.init_notebook_mode(connected=True)\\\\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\\\\nimport plotly.tools as tls\\\\n\\\\nimport warnings\\\\nwarnings.filterwarnings(\\'ignore\\')\\\\n\\\\n# Going to use these 5 base models for the stacking\\\\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import (RandomForestClassifier, AdaBoostClassifier, \\\\n                              GradientBoostingClassifier, ExtraTreesClassifier)\\\\nfrom sklearn.svm import SVC\\\\nfrom sklearn.cross_validation import KFold\",\"execution_count\":1,\"outputs\":[]},{\"metadata\":{\"_uuid\":\"8b590aafe06a2ac55daae9d2456155e457914f5f\",\"_cell_guid\":\"d647b74c-099b-851a-dcd2-3a58c9e8f10c\"},\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"source\":\"# Feature Exploration, Engineering and Cleaning \\\\n\\\\nNow we will proceed much like how most kernels in general are structured, and that is to first explore the data on hand, identify possible feature engineering opportunities as well as numerically encode any categorical features.\"},{\"metadata\":{\"_execution_state\":\"idle\",\"_cell_guid\":\"5937fd72-d1ad-f678-cc82-f08a96e4cad0\",\"_uuid\":\"b2ad78041b69ce13d1f41bd9bc8c93cafaf7b8ac\",\"trusted\":true},\"cell_type\":\"code\",\"source\":\"# Load in the train and test datasets\\\\ntrain = pd.read_csv(\\'../input/train.csv\\')\\\\ntest = pd.read_csv(\\'../input/test.csv\\')\\\\n\\\\n# Store our passenger ID for easy access\\\\nPassengerId = test[\\'PassengerId\\']\\\\n\\\\ntrain.head(3)\",\"execution_count\":2,\"outputs\":[]},{\"metadata\":{\"_uuid\":\"81378834770e55c76751347588322fe32acf5737\",\"_cell_guid\":\"dff1c1dd-1e59-3907-88fa-1a1d699122be\"},\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"source\":\"Well it is no surprise that our task is to somehow extract the information out of the categorical variables \\\\n\\\\n**Feature Engineering**\\\\n\\\\nHere, credit must be extended to Sina\\'s very comprehensive and well-thought out notebook for the feature engineering ideas so please check out his work \\\\n\\\\n[Titanic Best Working Classfier][1] : by Sina\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n  [1]: https://www.kaggle.com/sinakhorami/titanic/titanic-best-working-classifier\"},{\"metadata\":{\"collapsed\":true,\"_execution_state\":\"idle\",\"_cell_guid\":\"e85b2a80-88a4-928f-f2b2-24895dea38f3\",\"_uuid\":\"b1c67249f91768ce8e5e2751364d32c87446cf55\",\"trusted\":true},\"cell_type\":\"code\",\"source\":\"full_data = [train, test]\\\\n\\\\n# Some features of my own that I have added in\\\\n# Gives the length of the name\\\\ntrain[\\'Name_length\\'] = train[\\'Name\\'].apply(len)\\\\ntest[\\'Name_length\\'] = test[\\'Name\\'].apply(len)\\\\n# Feature that tells whether a passenger had a cabin on the Titanic\\\\ntrain[\\'Has_Cabin\\'] = train[\\\\\"Cabin\\\\\"].apply(lambda x: 0 if type(x) == float else 1)\\\\ntest[\\'Has_Cabin\\'] = test[\\\\\"Cabin\\\\\"].apply(lambda x: 0 if type(x) == float else 1)\\\\n\\\\n# Feature engineering steps taken from Sina\\\\n# Create new feature FamilySize as a combination of SibSp and Parch\\\\nfor dataset in full_data:\\\\n    dataset[\\'FamilySize\\'] = dataset[\\'SibSp\\'] + dataset[\\'Parch\\'] + 1\\\\n# Create new feature IsAlone from FamilySize\\\\nfor dataset in full_data:\\\\n    dataset[\\'IsAlone\\'] = 0\\\\n    dataset.loc[dataset[\\'FamilySize\\'] == 1, \\'IsAlone\\'] = 1\\\\n# Remove all NULLS in the Embarked column\\\\nfor dataset in full_data:\\\\n    dataset[\\'Embarked\\'] = dataset[\\'Embarked\\'].fillna(\\'S\\')\\\\n# Remove all NULLS in the Fare column and create a new feature CategoricalFare\\\\nfor dataset in full_data:\\\\n    dataset[\\'Fare\\'] = dataset[\\'Fare\\'].fillna(train[\\'Fare\\'].median())\\\\ntrain[\\'CategoricalFare\\'] = pd.qcut(train[\\'Fare\\'], 4)\\\\n# Create a New feature CategoricalAge\\\\nfor dataset in full_data:\\\\n    age_avg = dataset[\\'Age\\'].mean()\\\\n    age_std = dataset[\\'Age\\'].std()\\\\n    age_null_count = dataset[\\'Age\\'].isnull().sum()\\\\n    age_null_random_list = np.random.randint(age_avg -

However many will skip some of the explanation on how the solution is developed as these notebooks are developed by experts for experts. The objective of this notebook is to follow a step-by-step workflow, explaining each step and rationale for every decision we take during solution development.\\\\n\\\\n## Workflow stages\\\\n\\\\nThe competition solution workflow goes through seven stages described in the Data Science Solutions book.\\\\n\\\\n1. Question or problem definition.\\\\n2. Acquire training and testing data.\\\\n3. Wrangle, prepare, cleanse the data.\\\\n4. Analyze, identify patterns, and explore the data.\\\\n5. Model, predict and solve the problem.\\\\n6. Visualize, report, and present the problem solving steps and final solution.\\\\n7. Supply or submit the results.\\\\n\\\\nThe workflow indicates general sequence of how each stage may follow the other. However there are use cases with exceptions.\\\\n\\\\n- We may combine mulitple workflow stages. We may analyze by visualizing data.\\\\n- Perform a stage earlier than indicated. We may analyze data before and after wrangling.\\\\n- Perform a stage multiple times in our workflow. Visualize stage may be used multiple times.\\\\n- Drop a stage altogether. We may not need supply stage to productize or service enable our dataset for a competition.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Question and problem definition\\\\n\\\\nCompetition sites like Kaggle define the problem to solve or questions to ask while providing the datasets for training your data science model and testing the model results against a test dataset. The question or problem definition for Titanic Survival competition is [described here at Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).\\\\n\\\\n> Knowing from a training set of samples listing passengers who survived or did not survive the Titanic disaster, can our model determine based on a given test dataset not containing the survival information, if these passengers in the test dataset survived or not.\\\\n\\\\nWe may also want to develop some early understanding about the domain of our problem. This is described on the [Kaggle competition description page here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). Here are the highlights to note.\\\\n\\\\n- On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. Translated 32% survival rate.\\\\n- One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew.\\\\n- Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.\\\\n\\\\n## Workflow goals\\\\n\\\\nThe data science solutions workflow solves for seven major goals.\\\\n\\\\n**Classifying.** We may want to classify or categorize our samples. We may also want to understand the implications or correlation of different classes with our solution goal.\\\\n\\\\n**Correlating.** One can approach the problem based on available features within the training dataset. Which features within the dataset contribute significantly to our solution goal? Statistically speaking is there a [correlation](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Correlation) among a feature and solution goal? As the feature values change does the solution state change as well, and visa-versa? This can be tested both for numerical and categorical features in the given dataset. We may also want to determine correlation among features other than survival for subsequent goals and workflow stages. Correlating certain features may help in creating, completing, or correcting features.\\\\n\\\\n**Converting.** For modeling stage, one needs to prepare the data. Depending on the choice of model algorithm one may require all features to be converted to numerical equivalent values. So for instance converting text categorical values to numeric values.\\\\n\\\\n**Completing.** Data preparation may also require us to estimate any missing values within a feature. Model algorithms may work best when there are no missing values.\\\\n\\\\n**Correcting.** We may also analyze the given training dataset for errors or possibly innacurate values within features and try to corrent these values or exclude the samples containing the errors. One way to do this is to detect any outliers among our samples or features. We may also completely discard a feature if it is not contribting to the analysis or may significantly skew the results.\\\\n\\\\n**Creating.** Can we create new features based on an existing feature or a set of features, such that the new feature follows the correlation, conversion, completeness goals.\\\\n\\\\n**Charting.** How to select the right visualization plots and charts depending on nature of the data and the solution goals.\"},{\"metadata\":{\"_uuid\":\"960f8b1937dc4915ce1eb0f82614b1985c4321a4\",\"_cell_guid\":\"56a3be4e-76ef-20c6-25e8-da16147cf6d7\"},\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"source\":\"## Refactor Release 2017-Jan-29\\\\n\\\\nWe are significantly refactoring the notebook based on (a) comments received by readers, (b) issues in porting notebook from Jupyter kernel (2.7) to Kaggle kernel (3.5), and (c) review of few more best practice kernels.\\\\n\\\\n### User comments\\\\n\\\\n- Combine training and test data for certain operations like converting titles across dataset to numerical values.

Then check out <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/titanic-tutorial\">Alexis Cook’s Titanic Tutorial</a> that walks you through step by step how to make your first submission!\n\n<iframe width=\"699\" height=\"368\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8yZMXCaFshs\" title=\"YouTube video | How to Get Started with Kaggle’s Titanic Competition | Kaggle\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n## The Challenge\nThe sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.\n\nOn April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.\n\nWhile there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.\n\nIn this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).\n\n> #### Recommended Tutorial\n> We highly recommend [Alexis Cook’s Titanic Tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/titanic-tutorial) that walks you through making your very first submission step by step and [this starter notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/gusthema/titanic-competition-w-tensorflow-decision-forests) to get started.\n\n## How Kaggle’s Competitions Work\n1. **Join the Competition**\nRead about the challenge description, accept the Competition Rules and gain access to the competition dataset.\n1.  **Get to Work**\nDownload the data, build models on it locally or on Kaggle Notebooks (our no-setup, customizable Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs) and generate a prediction file.\n1.  **Make a Submission**\nUpload your prediction as a submission on Kaggle and receive an accuracy score.\n1.  **Check the Leaderboard**\nSee how your model ranks against other Kagglers on our leaderboard. \n1.  **Improve Your Score**\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a> to find lots of tutorials and insights from other competitors.\n\n> #### Kaggle Lingo Video\n> You may run into unfamiliar lingo as you dig into the Kaggle discussion forums and public notebooks. Check out  Dr. Rachael Tatman’s [video on Kaggle Lingo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEJHyuWKd-s) to get up to speed!\n\n## What Data Will I Use in This Competition?\nIn this competition, you’ll gain access to two similar datasets that include passenger information like name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc. One dataset is titled `train.csv` and the other is titled `test.csv`.\n\n`Train.csv` will contain the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 to be exact) and importantly, will reveal whether they survived or not, also known as the “ground truth”.\n\nThe `test.csv` dataset contains similar information but does not disclose the “ground truth” for each passenger. It’s your job to predict these outcomes.\n\nUsing the patterns you find in the `train.csv` data, predict whether the other 418 passengers on board (found in `test.csv`) survived.\n\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data\">“Data” tab</a> to explore the datasets even further. Once you feel you’ve created a competitive model, submit it to Kaggle to see where your model stands on our leaderboard against other Kagglers.\n\n## How to Submit your Prediction to Kaggle\nOnce you’re ready to make a submission and get on the leaderboard:\n\n1. Click on the “Submit Predictions” button\n<img width=\"699\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen1.png\">\n1. Upload a CSV file in the submission file format. You’re able to submit 10 submissions a day.\n<img width=\"699\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen2.png\">\n\n## Submission File Format:\nYou should submit a csv file with exactly 418 entries plus a header row. Your submission will show an error if you have extra columns (beyond `PassengerId` and `Survived`) or rows.\n\nThe file should have exactly 2 columns:\n- `PassengerId` (sorted in any order)\n- `Survived` (contains your binary predictions: 1 for survived, 0 for deceased)\n\n## Got it! I’m ready to get started. Where do I get help if I need it?\n- For Competition Help: <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\">Titanic Discussion Forum</a>\n\nKaggle doesn’t have a dedicated team to help troubleshoot your code so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. The forums are full of useful information on the data, metric, and different approaches. We encourage you to use the forums often. If you share your knowledge, you'll find that others will share a lot in turn!\n\n## A Last Word on Kaggle Notebooks\nAs we mentioned before, Kaggle Notebooks is our no-setup, customizable, Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs and a huge repository of community published data &amp; code.\n\nIn every competition, you’ll find many Notebooks shared with incredible insights. It’s an invaluable resource worth becoming familiar with. Check out this competition’s Notebooks <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/notebooks\">here</a>.\n\n## 🏃‍♀Ready to Compete? <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/account/login?returnUrl=%2Fc%2Ftitanic\">Join the Competition Here!</a>\n\n## Evaluation\n\n<h2>Goal</h2>\n<p>It is your job to predict if a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic or not. <br>For each  in the test set, you must predict a 0 or 1 value for the  variable.</p>\n<h2>Metric</h2>\n<p>Your score is the percentage of passengers you correctly predict.

They are a great place to begin if you are new to data science or just finished a MOOC and want to get involved in Kaggle.</p>\n<p>Getting Started competitions are a non-competitive way to get familiar with Kaggle’s platform, learn basic machine learning concepts, and start meeting people in the community. They have no cash prize and are on a rolling timeline.</p>\n<h2>How do I create and manage a team?</h2>\n<p>When you accept the competition rules, a team will be created for you. You can invite others to your team, accept a merger with another team, and update basic information like team name by going to the More &gt; <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/team\" target=\"_blank\">Team</a> page.</p>\n<p>We've heard from many Kagglers that teaming up is the best way to learn new skills AND have fun. If you don't have a teammate already, consider asking if anyone wants to team up in the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a>.</p>\n<h2>What are Notebooks?</h2>\n<p>Kaggle Notebooks is a cloud computational environment that enables reproducible and collaborative analysis. Notebooks support scripts in Python and R, Jupyter Notebooks, and RMarkdown reports. You can visit the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/notebooks\" target=\"_blank\">Notebooks</a> tab to view all of the publicly shared code for the Titanic competition. For more on how to use Notebooks to learn data science, check out our <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview\" target=\"&quot;_blank\">Courses</a>!</p>\n<h2>Why did my team disappear from the leaderboard?</h2>\n<p>To keep with the spirit of getting-started competitions, we have implemented a two month rolling window on submissions. Once a submission is more than two months old, it will be invalidated and no longer count towards the leaderboard.</p>\n<p>If your team has no submissions in the previous two months, the team will also drop from the leaderboard. This will keep the leaderboard at a manageable size, freshen it up, and prevent newcomers from getting lost in a sea of abandoned scores.</p>\n<p><i>\"I worked so hard to get that score! Give it back!\"</i> Read more about our decision to implement a rolling leaderboard <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion/6240\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n<h2>How do I contact Support?</h2>\n<p>Kaggle does not have a dedicated support team so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. (For this competition, you’ll want to use the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">Titanic discussion forum)</a>.</p>\n<p>Support is only able to help with issues that are being experienced by all participants. Before contacting support, please check the discussion forum for information on your problem. If you can’t find it, you can post your problem in the forum so a fellow participant or a Kaggle team member can provide help. The forums are full of useful information on the data, metric, and different approaches. We encourage you to use the forums often.

In laymen terms this means, it either occurred or did not occur. For example, you won or did not win, you passed the test or did not pass the test, you were accepted or not accepted, and you get the point. A common business application is churn or customer retention. Another popular use case is, healthcare's mortality rate or survival analysis. Binary events create an interesting dynamic, because we know statistically, a random guess should achieve a 50% accuracy rate, without creating one single algorithm or writing one single line of code. However, just like autocorrect spellcheck technology, sometimes we humans can be too smart for our own good and actually underperform a coin flip. In this kernel, I use Kaggle's Getting Started Competition, Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster, to walk the reader through, how-to use the data science framework to beat the odds.\\n   \\n*What happens when technology is too smart for its own good?*\\n![Funny Autocorrect](http://15858-presscdn-0-65.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/hilarious-autocorrect-fails-20x.jpg)\",\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"metadata\":{\"_cell_guid\":\"ec31d549-537e-4f35-8594-22ef03079081\",\"_uuid\":\"ff6c70c884a8a5fb3258e7f3fefc9e55261df1df\"}},{\"source\":\"<a id=\\\"ch2\\\"></a>\\n# A Data Science Framework\\n1. **Define the Problem:** If data science, big data, machine learning, predictive analytics, business intelligence, or any other buzzword is the solution, then what is the problem? As the saying goes, don't put the cart before the horse. Problems before requirements, requirements before solutions, solutions before design, and design before technology. Too often we are quick to jump on the new shiny technology, tool, or algorithm before determining the actual problem we are trying to solve.\\n2. **Gather the Data:** John Naisbitt wrote in his 1984 (yes, 1984) book Megatrends, we are “drowning in data, yet staving for knowledge.\\\" So, chances are, the dataset(s) already exist somewhere, in some format. It may be external or internal, structured or unstructured, static or streamed, objective or subjective, etc. As the saying goes, you don't have to reinvent the wheel, you just have to know where to find it. In the next step, we will worry about transforming \\\"dirty data\\\" to \\\"clean data.\\\"\\n3. **Prepare Data for Consumption:** This step is often referred to as data wrangling, a required process to turn “wild” data into “manageable” data. Data wrangling includes implementing data architectures for storage and processing, developing data governance standards for quality and control, data extraction (i.e. ETL and web scraping), and data cleaning to identify aberrant, missing, or outlier data points.\\n4. **Perform Exploratory Analysis:** Anybody who has ever worked with data knows, garbage-in, garbage-out (GIGO). Therefore, it is important to deploy descriptive and graphical statistics to look for potential problems, patterns, classifications, correlations and comparisons in the dataset. In addition, data categorization (i.e. qualitative vs quantitative) is also important to understand and select the correct hypothesis test or data model.\\n5. **Model Data:** Like descriptive and inferential statistics, data modeling can either summarize the data or predict future outcomes. Your dataset and expected results, will determine the algorithms available for use. It's important to remember, algorithms are tools and not magical wands or silver bullets. You must still be the master craft (wo)man that knows how-to select the right tool for the job. An analogy would be asking someone to hand you a Philip screwdriver, and they hand you a flathead screwdriver or worst a hammer. At best, it shows a complete lack of understanding. At worst, it makes completing the project impossible. The same is true in data modelling. The wrong model can lead to poor performance at best and the wrong conclusion (that’s used as actionable intelligence) at worst.\\n6. **Validate and Implement Data Model:** After you've trained your model based on a subset of your data, it's time to test your model. This helps ensure you haven't overfit your model or made it so specific to the selected subset, that it does not accurately fit another subset from the same dataset. In this step we determine if our [model overfit, generalize, or underfit our dataset](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/latest/dg/model-fit-underfitting-vs-overfitting.html).\\n7. **Optimize and Strategize:** This is the \\\"bionic man\\\" step, where you iterate back through the process to make it better...stronger...faster than it was before. As a data scientist, your strategy should be to outsource developer operations and application plumbing, so you have more time to focus on recommendations and design. Once you're able to package your ideas, this becomes your “currency exchange\\\" rate.\",\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"metadata\":{\"_cell_guid\":\"8514a868-6816-494a-9e9c-dba14cb36f42\",\"_uuid\":\"bd2a68dcaace0c1371f2994f0204dce65800cc20\"}},{\"source\":\"<a id=\\\"ch3\\\"></a>\\n# Step 1: Define the Problem\\nFor this project, the problem statement is given to us on a golden plater, develop an algorithm to predict the survival outcome of passengers on the Titanic.\\n\\n......\\n\\n**Project Summary:**\\nThe sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.\\n\\nOne of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.\\n\\nIn this challenge, we ask you to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular, we ask you to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.\\n\\nPractice Skills\\n* Binary classification\\n* Python and R basics\\n\\n# Step 2: Gather the Data\\n\\nThe dataset is also given to us on a golden plater with test and train data at [Kaggle's Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)\\n\",\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"metadata\":{\"_cell_guid\":\"22ba49b5-b3b6-4129-8c57-623e0d863ab3\",\"_uuid\":\"ff014109d795c5d1bfcc66c9761730406124ebe4\"}},{\"source\":\"<a id=\\\"ch4\\\"></a>\\n# Step 3: Prepare Data for Consumption\\nSince step 2 was provided to us on a golden plater, so is step 3.

Using the same dataset and different implementation of a decision tree (adaboost, random forest, gradient boost, xgboost, etc.) with tuning does not exceed the 0.77990 submission accuracy. Interesting for this dataset, the simple decision tree algorithm had the best default submission score and with tuning achieved the same best accuracy score.\\n\\nWhile no general conclusions can be made from testing a handful of algorithms on a single dataset, there are several observations on the mentioned dataset. \\n1. The train dataset has a different distribution than the test/validation dataset and population. This created wide margins between the cross validation (CV) accuracy score and Kaggle submission accuracy score.\\n2. Given the same dataset, decision tree based algorithms, seemed to converge on the same accuracy score after proper tuning.\\n3. Despite tuning, no machine learning algorithm, exceeded the homemade algorithm. The author will theorize, that for small datasets, a manmade algorithm is the bar to beat. \\n\\nWith that in mind, for iteration two, I would spend more time on preprocessing and feature engineering. In order to better align the CV score and Kaggle score and improve the overall accuracy.\\n\\n\",\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"metadata\":{\"_cell_guid\":\"a6d34edc-1265-41e8-b163-0b817cd3b6a5\",\"_uuid\":\"c476df95925d67809975caca4ea4dcb4b2a0b277\"}},{\"source\":\"<a id=\\\"ch90\\\"></a>\\n## Change Log:\\n11/22/17 Please note, this kernel is currently in progress, but open to feedback.

In a nutshell stacking uses as a first-level (base), the predictions of a few basic classifiers and then uses another model at the second-level to predict the output from the earlier first-level predictions.\\n\\nThe Titanic dataset is a prime candidate for introducing this concept as many newcomers to Kaggle start out here. Furthermore even though stacking has been responsible for many a team winning Kaggle competitions there seems to be a dearth of kernels on this topic so I hope this notebook can fill somewhat of that void.\\n\\nI myself am quite a newcomer to the Kaggle scene as well and the first proper ensembling/stacking script that I managed to chance upon and study was one written in the AllState Severity Claims competition by the great Faron. The material in this notebook borrows heavily from Faron's script although ported to factor in ensembles of classifiers whilst his was ensembles of regressors. Anyway please check out his script here:\\n\\n[Stacking Starter][1] : by Faron \\n\\n\\nNow onto the notebook at hand and I hope that it manages to do justice and convey the concept of ensembling in an intuitive and concise manner.  My other standalone Kaggle [script][2] which implements exactly the same ensembling steps (albeit with different parameters) discussed below gives a Public LB score of 0.808 which is good enough to get to the top 9% and runs just under 4 minutes. Therefore I am pretty sure there is a lot of room to improve and add on to that script. Anyways please feel free to leave me any comments with regards to how I can improve\\n\\n\\n  [1]: https://www.kaggle.com/mmueller/allstate-claims-severity/stacking-starter/run/390867\\n  [2]: https://www.kaggle.com/arthurtok/titanic/simple-stacking-with-xgboost-0-808\"},{\"metadata\":{\"_execution_state\":\"idle\",\"_cell_guid\":\"14630296-b1aa-759e-bafa-b6a73f3896ed\",\"_uuid\":\"2e37a274400cfeb472b6405d524325245588dd66\",\"trusted\":true},\"cell_type\":\"code\",\"source\":\"# Load in our libraries\\nimport pandas as pd\\nimport numpy as np\\nimport re\\nimport sklearn\\nimport xgboost as xgb\\nimport seaborn as sns\\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\\n%matplotlib inline\\n\\nimport plotly.offline as py\\npy.init_notebook_mode(connected=True)\\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\\nimport plotly.tools as tls\\n\\nimport warnings\\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\\n\\n# Going to use these 5 base models for the stacking\\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import (RandomForestClassifier, AdaBoostClassifier, \\n                              GradientBoostingClassifier, ExtraTreesClassifier)\\nfrom sklearn.svm import SVC\\nfrom sklearn.cross_validation import KFold\",\"execution_count\":1,\"outputs\":[]},{\"metadata\":{\"_uuid\":\"8b590aafe06a2ac55daae9d2456155e457914f5f\",\"_cell_guid\":\"d647b74c-099b-851a-dcd2-3a58c9e8f10c\"},\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"source\":\"# Feature Exploration, Engineering and Cleaning \\n\\nNow we will proceed much like how most kernels in general are structured, and that is to first explore the data on hand, identify possible feature engineering opportunities as well as numerically encode any categorical features.\"},{\"metadata\":{\"_execution_state\":\"idle\",\"_cell_guid\":\"5937fd72-d1ad-f678-cc82-f08a96e4cad0\",\"_uuid\":\"b2ad78041b69ce13d1f41bd9bc8c93cafaf7b8ac\",\"trusted\":true},\"cell_type\":\"code\",\"source\":\"# Load in the train and test datasets\\ntrain = pd.read_csv('../input/train.csv')\\ntest = pd.read_csv('../input/test.csv')\\n\\n# Store our passenger ID for easy access\\nPassengerId = test['PassengerId']\\n\\ntrain.head(3)\",\"execution_count\":2,\"outputs\":[]},{\"metadata\":{\"_uuid\":\"81378834770e55c76751347588322fe32acf5737\",\"_cell_guid\":\"dff1c1dd-1e59-3907-88fa-1a1d699122be\"},\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"source\":\"Well it is no surprise that our task is to somehow extract the information out of the categorical variables \\n\\n**Feature Engineering**\\n\\nHere, credit must be extended to Sina's very comprehensive and well-thought out notebook for the feature engineering ideas so please check out his work \\n\\n[Titanic Best Working Classfier][1] : by Sina\\n\\n\\n  [1]: https://www.kaggle.com/sinakhorami/titanic/titanic-best-working-classifier\"},{\"metadata\":{\"collapsed\":true,\"_execution_state\":\"idle\",\"_cell_guid\":\"e85b2a80-88a4-928f-f2b2-24895dea38f3\",\"_uuid\":\"b1c67249f91768ce8e5e2751364d32c87446cf55\",\"trusted\":true},\"cell_type\":\"code\",\"source\":\"full_data = [train, test]\\n\\n# Some features of my own that I have added in\\n# Gives the length of the name\\ntrain['Name_length'] = train['Name'].apply(len)\\ntest['Name_length'] = test['Name'].apply(len)\\n# Feature that tells whether a passenger had a cabin on the Titanic\\ntrain['Has_Cabin'] = train[\\\"Cabin\\\"].apply(lambda x: 0 if type(x) == float else 1)\\ntest['Has_Cabin'] = test[\\\"Cabin\\\"].apply(lambda x: 0 if type(x) == float else 1)\\n\\n# Feature engineering steps taken from Sina\\n# Create new feature FamilySize as a combination of SibSp and Parch\\nfor dataset in full_data:\\n    dataset['FamilySize'] = dataset['SibSp'] + dataset['Parch'] + 1\\n# Create new feature IsAlone from FamilySize\\nfor dataset in full_data:\\n    dataset['IsAlone'] = 0\\n    dataset.loc[dataset['FamilySize'] == 1, 'IsAlone'] = 1\\n# Remove all NULLS in the Embarked column\\nfor dataset in full_data:\\n    dataset['Embarked'] = dataset['Embarked'].fillna('S')\\n# Remove all NULLS in the Fare column and create a new feature CategoricalFare\\nfor dataset in full_data:\\n    dataset['Fare'] = dataset['Fare'].fillna(train['Fare'].median())\\ntrain['CategoricalFare'] = pd.qcut(train['Fare'], 4)\\n# Create a New feature CategoricalAge\\nfor dataset in full_data:\\n    age_avg = dataset['Age'].mean()\\n    age_std = dataset['Age'].std()\\n    age_null_count = dataset['Age'].isnull().sum()\\n    age_null_random_list = np.random.randint(age_avg -

However many will skip some of the explanation on how the solution is developed as these notebooks are developed by experts for experts. The objective of this notebook is to follow a step-by-step workflow, explaining each step and rationale for every decision we take during solution development.\\n\\n## Workflow stages\\n\\nThe competition solution workflow goes through seven stages described in the Data Science Solutions book.\\n\\n1. Question or problem definition.\\n2. Acquire training and testing data.\\n3. Wrangle, prepare, cleanse the data.\\n4. Analyze, identify patterns, and explore the data.\\n5. Model, predict and solve the problem.\\n6. Visualize, report, and present the problem solving steps and final solution.\\n7. Supply or submit the results.\\n\\nThe workflow indicates general sequence of how each stage may follow the other. However there are use cases with exceptions.\\n\\n- We may combine mulitple workflow stages. We may analyze by visualizing data.\\n- Perform a stage earlier than indicated. We may analyze data before and after wrangling.\\n- Perform a stage multiple times in our workflow. Visualize stage may be used multiple times.\\n- Drop a stage altogether. We may not need supply stage to productize or service enable our dataset for a competition.\\n\\n\\n## Question and problem definition\\n\\nCompetition sites like Kaggle define the problem to solve or questions to ask while providing the datasets for training your data science model and testing the model results against a test dataset. The question or problem definition for Titanic Survival competition is [described here at Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).\\n\\n> Knowing from a training set of samples listing passengers who survived or did not survive the Titanic disaster, can our model determine based on a given test dataset not containing the survival information, if these passengers in the test dataset survived or not.\\n\\nWe may also want to develop some early understanding about the domain of our problem. This is described on the [Kaggle competition description page here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). Here are the highlights to note.\\n\\n- On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. Translated 32% survival rate.\\n- One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew.\\n- Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.\\n\\n## Workflow goals\\n\\nThe data science solutions workflow solves for seven major goals.\\n\\n**Classifying.** We may want to classify or categorize our samples. We may also want to understand the implications or correlation of different classes with our solution goal.\\n\\n**Correlating.** One can approach the problem based on available features within the training dataset. Which features within the dataset contribute significantly to our solution goal? Statistically speaking is there a [correlation](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Correlation) among a feature and solution goal? As the feature values change does the solution state change as well, and visa-versa? This can be tested both for numerical and categorical features in the given dataset. We may also want to determine correlation among features other than survival for subsequent goals and workflow stages. Correlating certain features may help in creating, completing, or correcting features.\\n\\n**Converting.** For modeling stage, one needs to prepare the data. Depending on the choice of model algorithm one may require all features to be converted to numerical equivalent values. So for instance converting text categorical values to numeric values.\\n\\n**Completing.** Data preparation may also require us to estimate any missing values within a feature. Model algorithms may work best when there are no missing values.\\n\\n**Correcting.** We may also analyze the given training dataset for errors or possibly innacurate values within features and try to corrent these values or exclude the samples containing the errors. One way to do this is to detect any outliers among our samples or features. We may also completely discard a feature if it is not contribting to the analysis or may significantly skew the results.\\n\\n**Creating.** Can we create new features based on an existing feature or a set of features, such that the new feature follows the correlation, conversion, completeness goals.\\n\\n**Charting.** How to select the right visualization plots and charts depending on nature of the data and the solution goals.\"},{\"metadata\":{\"_uuid\":\"960f8b1937dc4915ce1eb0f82614b1985c4321a4\",\"_cell_guid\":\"56a3be4e-76ef-20c6-25e8-da16147cf6d7\"},\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"source\":\"## Refactor Release 2017-Jan-29\\n\\nWe are significantly refactoring the notebook based on (a) comments received by readers, (b) issues in porting notebook from Jupyter kernel (2.7) to Kaggle kernel (3.5), and (c) review of few more best practice kernels.\\n\\n### User comments\\n\\n- Combine training and test data for certain operations like converting titles across dataset to numerical values.

Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.\\n\\nWhile there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.\\n\\nIn this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).\\n\\n> #### Recommended Tutorial\\n> We highly recommend [Alexis Cook’s Titanic Tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/titanic-tutorial) that walks you through making your very first submission step by step and [this starter notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/gusthema/titanic-competition-w-tensorflow-decision-forests) to get started.\\n\\n## How Kaggle’s Competitions Work\\n1. **Join the Competition**\\nRead about the challenge description, accept the Competition Rules and gain access to the competition dataset.\\n1.  **Get to Work**\\nDownload the data, build models on it locally or on Kaggle Notebooks (our no-setup, customizable Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs) and generate a prediction file.\\n1.  **Make a Submission**\\nUpload your prediction as a submission on Kaggle and receive an accuracy score.\\n1.  **Check the Leaderboard**\\nSee how your model ranks against other Kagglers on our leaderboard. \\n1.  **Improve Your Score**\\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a> to find lots of tutorials and insights from other competitors.\\n\\n> #### Kaggle Lingo Video\\n> You may run into unfamiliar lingo as you dig into the Kaggle discussion forums and public notebooks. Check out  Dr. Rachael Tatman’s [video on Kaggle Lingo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEJHyuWKd-s) to get up to speed!\\n\\n## What Data Will I Use in This Competition?\\nIn this competition, you’ll gain access to two similar datasets that include passenger information like name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc. One dataset is titled `train.csv` and the other is titled `test.csv`.\\n\\n`Train.csv` will contain the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 to be exact) and importantly, will reveal whether they survived or not, also known as the “ground truth”.\\n\\nThe `test.csv` dataset contains similar information but does not disclose the “ground truth” for each passenger. It’s your job to predict these outcomes.\\n\\nUsing the patterns you find in the `train.csv` data, predict whether the other 418 passengers on board (found in `test.csv`) survived.\\n\\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data\">“Data” tab</a> to explore the datasets even further. Once you feel you’ve created a competitive model, submit it to Kaggle to see where your model stands on our leaderboard against other Kagglers.\\n\\n## How to Submit your Prediction to Kaggle\\nOnce you’re ready to make a submission and get on the leaderboard:\\n\\n1. Click on the “Submit Predictions” button\\n<img width=\"699\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen1.png\">\\n1. Upload a CSV file in the submission file format. You’re able to submit 10 submissions a day.\\n<img width=\"699\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen2.png\">\\n\\n## Submission File Format:\\nYou should submit a csv file with exactly 418 entries plus a header row. Your submission will show an error if you have extra columns (beyond `PassengerId` and `Survived`) or rows.\\n\\nThe file should have exactly 2 columns:\\n- `PassengerId` (sorted in any order)\\n- `Survived` (contains your binary predictions: 1 for survived, 0 for deceased)\\n\\n## Got it! I’m ready to get started. Where do I get help if I need it?\\n- For Competition Help: <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\">Titanic Discussion Forum</a>\\n\\nKaggle doesn’t have a dedicated team to help troubleshoot your code so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. The forums are full of useful information on the data, metric, and different approaches. We encourage you to use the forums often. If you share your knowledge, you\\'ll find that others will share a lot in turn!\\n\\n## A Last Word on Kaggle Notebooks\\nAs we mentioned before, Kaggle Notebooks is our no-setup, customizable, Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs and a huge repository of community published data &amp; code.\\n\\nIn every competition, you’ll find many Notebooks shared with incredible insights. It’s an invaluable resource worth becoming familiar with. Check out this competition’s Notebooks <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/notebooks\">here</a>.\\n\\n## 🏃\\u200d♀Ready to Compete? <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/account/login?returnUrl=%2Fc%2Ftitanic\">Join the Competition Here!</a>\\n\\n## Evaluation\\n\\n<h2>Goal</h2>\\n<p>It is your job to predict if a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic or not. <br>For each  in the test set, you must predict a 0 or 1 value for the  variable.</p>\\n<h2>Metric</h2>\\n<p>Your score is the percentage of passengers you correctly predict.

They are a great place to begin if you are new to data science or just finished a MOOC and want to get involved in Kaggle.</p>\\n<p>Getting Started competitions are a non-competitive way to get familiar with Kaggle’s platform, learn basic machine learning concepts, and start meeting people in the community. They have no cash prize and are on a rolling timeline.</p>\\n<h2>How do I create and manage a team?</h2>\\n<p>When you accept the competition rules, a team will be created for you. You can invite others to your team, accept a merger with another team, and update basic information like team name by going to the More &gt; <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/team\" target=\"_blank\">Team</a> page.</p>\\n<p>We\\'ve heard from many Kagglers that teaming up is the best way to learn new skills AND have fun. If you don\\'t have a teammate already, consider asking if anyone wants to team up in the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a>.</p>\\n<h2>What are Notebooks?</h2>\\n<p>Kaggle Notebooks is a cloud computational environment that enables reproducible and collaborative analysis. Notebooks support scripts in Python and R, Jupyter Notebooks, and RMarkdown reports. You can visit the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/notebooks\" target=\"_blank\">Notebooks</a> tab to view all of the publicly shared code for the Titanic competition. For more on how to use Notebooks to learn data science, check out our <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview\" target=\"&quot;_blank\">Courses</a>!</p>\\n<h2>Why did my team disappear from the leaderboard?</h2>\\n<p>To keep with the spirit of getting-started competitions, we have implemented a two month rolling window on submissions. Once a submission is more than two months old, it will be invalidated and no longer count towards the leaderboard.</p>\\n<p>If your team has no submissions in the previous two months, the team will also drop from the leaderboard. This will keep the leaderboard at a manageable size, freshen it up, and prevent newcomers from getting lost in a sea of abandoned scores.</p>\\n<p><i>\"I worked so hard to get that score! Give it back!\"</i> Read more about our decision to implement a rolling leaderboard <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion/6240\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\\n<h2>How do I contact Support?</h2>\\n<p>Kaggle does not have a dedicated support team so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. (For this competition, you’ll want to use the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">Titanic discussion forum)</a>.</p>\\n<p>Support is only able to help with issues that are being experienced by all participants. Before contacting support, please check the discussion forum for information on your problem. If you can’t find it, you can post your problem in the forum so a fellow participant or a Kaggle team member can provide help. The forums are full of useful information on the data, metric, and different approaches. We encourage you to use the forums often. If you share your knowledge, you\\'ll find that others will share a lot in turn!</p>\\n<p>If your problem persists or it seems to be effective all participants then please <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/contact\" target=\"_blank\">contact us</a>.</p>'}, {'role': 'tool', 'content': 'Not a directory: /home/code/exploration/../research/writeups'}, {'role': 'tool', 'content': '/home/code/exploration/../research/kernels:\\n[DIR]  alexisbcook_exercise-arithmetic-and-variables/\\n[DIR]  alexisbcook_titanic-tutorial/\\n[DIR]  arthurtok_introduction-to-ensembling-stacking-in-python/\\n[DIR]  ldfreeman3_a-data-science-framework-to-achieve-99-accuracy/\\n[FILE] metadata.json (1.7KB)\\n[DIR]  startupsci_titanic-data-science-solutions/'}, {'role': 'tool', 'content': '/home/data:\\n[FILE] description.md (13.6KB)\\n[FILE] gender_submission.csv (3.2KB)\\n[FILE] test.csv (28.0KB)\\n[FILE] train.csv (59.8KB)'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': \"REASONING: This is the classic Titanic survival prediction problem - binary classification with accuracy as the metric.

In laymen terms this means, it either occurred or did not occur. For example, you won or did not win, you passed the test or did not pass the test, you were accepted or not accepted, and you get the point. A common business application is churn or customer retention. Another popular use case is, healthcare\\'s mortality rate or survival analysis. Binary events create an interesting dynamic, because we know statistically, a random guess should achieve a 50% accuracy rate, without creating one single algorithm or writing one single line of code. However, just like autocorrect spellcheck technology, sometimes we humans can be too smart for our own good and actually underperform a coin flip. In this kernel, I use Kaggle\\'s Getting Started Competition, Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster, to walk the reader through, how-to use the data science framework to beat the odds.\\\\n   \\\\n*What happens when technology is too smart for its own good?*\\\\n![Funny Autocorrect](http://15858-presscdn-0-65.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/hilarious-autocorrect-fails-20x.jpg)\",\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"metadata\":{\"_cell_guid\":\"ec31d549-537e-4f35-8594-22ef03079081\",\"_uuid\":\"ff6c70c884a8a5fb3258e7f3fefc9e55261df1df\"}},{\"source\":\"<a id=\\\\\"ch2\\\\\"></a>\\\\n# A Data Science Framework\\\\n1. **Define the Problem:** If data science, big data, machine learning, predictive analytics, business intelligence, or any other buzzword is the solution, then what is the problem? As the saying goes, don\\'t put the cart before the horse. Problems before requirements, requirements before solutions, solutions before design, and design before technology. Too often we are quick to jump on the new shiny technology, tool, or algorithm before determining the actual problem we are trying to solve.\\\\n2. **Gather the Data:** John Naisbitt wrote in his 1984 (yes, 1984) book Megatrends, we are “drowning in data, yet staving for knowledge.\\\\\" So, chances are, the dataset(s) already exist somewhere, in some format. It may be external or internal, structured or unstructured, static or streamed, objective or subjective, etc. As the saying goes, you don\\'t have to reinvent the wheel, you just have to know where to find it. In the next step, we will worry about transforming \\\\\"dirty data\\\\\" to \\\\\"clean data.\\\\\"\\\\n3. **Prepare Data for Consumption:** This step is often referred to as data wrangling, a required process to turn “wild” data into “manageable” data. Data wrangling includes implementing data architectures for storage and processing, developing data governance standards for quality and control, data extraction (i.e. ETL and web scraping), and data cleaning to identify aberrant, missing, or outlier data points.\\\\n4. **Perform Exploratory Analysis:** Anybody who has ever worked with data knows, garbage-in, garbage-out (GIGO). Therefore, it is important to deploy descriptive and graphical statistics to look for potential problems, patterns, classifications, correlations and comparisons in the dataset. In addition, data categorization (i.e. qualitative vs quantitative) is also important to understand and select the correct hypothesis test or data model.\\\\n5. **Model Data:** Like descriptive and inferential statistics, data modeling can either summarize the data or predict future outcomes. Your dataset and expected results, will determine the algorithms available for use. It\\'s important to remember, algorithms are tools and not magical wands or silver bullets. You must still be the master craft (wo)man that knows how-to select the right tool for the job. An analogy would be asking someone to hand you a Philip screwdriver, and they hand you a flathead screwdriver or worst a hammer. At best, it shows a complete lack of understanding. At worst, it makes completing the project impossible. The same is true in data modelling. The wrong model can lead to poor performance at best and the wrong conclusion (that’s used as actionable intelligence) at worst.\\\\n6. **Validate and Implement Data Model:** After you\\'ve trained your model based on a subset of your data, it\\'s time to test your model. This helps ensure you haven\\'t overfit your model or made it so specific to the selected subset, that it does not accurately fit another subset from the same dataset. In this step we determine if our [model overfit, generalize, or underfit our dataset](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/latest/dg/model-fit-underfitting-vs-overfitting.html).\\\\n7. **Optimize and Strategize:** This is the \\\\\"bionic man\\\\\" step, where you iterate back through the process to make it better...stronger...faster than it was before. As a data scientist, your strategy should be to outsource developer operations and application plumbing, so you have more time to focus on recommendations and design. Once you\\'re able to package your ideas, this becomes your “currency exchange\\\\\" rate.\",\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"metadata\":{\"_cell_guid\":\"8514a868-6816-494a-9e9c-dba14cb36f42\",\"_uuid\":\"bd2a68dcaace0c1371f2994f0204dce65800cc20\"}},{\"source\":\"<a id=\\\\\"ch3\\\\\"></a>\\\\n# Step 1: Define the Problem\\\\nFor this project, the problem statement is given to us on a golden plater, develop an algorithm to predict the survival outcome of passengers on the Titanic.\\\\n\\\\n......\\\\n\\\\n**Project Summary:**\\\\nThe sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.

Using the same dataset and different implementation of a decision tree (adaboost, random forest, gradient boost, xgboost, etc.) with tuning does not exceed the 0.77990 submission accuracy. Interesting for this dataset, the simple decision tree algorithm had the best default submission score and with tuning achieved the same best accuracy score.\\\\n\\\\nWhile no general conclusions can be made from testing a handful of algorithms on a single dataset, there are several observations on the mentioned dataset. \\\\n1. The train dataset has a different distribution than the test/validation dataset and population. This created wide margins between the cross validation (CV) accuracy score and Kaggle submission accuracy score.\\\\n2. Given the same dataset, decision tree based algorithms, seemed to converge on the same accuracy score after proper tuning.\\\\n3. Despite tuning, no machine learning algorithm, exceeded the homemade algorithm. The author will theorize, that for small datasets, a manmade algorithm is the bar to beat. \\\\n\\\\nWith that in mind, for iteration two, I would spend more time on preprocessing and feature engineering. In order to better align the CV score and Kaggle score and improve the overall accuracy.\\\\n\\\\n\",\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"metadata\":{\"_cell_guid\":\"a6d34edc-1265-41e8-b163-0b817cd3b6a5\",\"_uuid\":\"c476df95925d67809975caca4ea4dcb4b2a0b277\"}},{\"source\":\"<a id=\\\\\"ch90\\\\\"></a>\\\\n## Change Log:\\\\n11/22/17 Please note, this kernel is currently in progress, but open to feedback.

In a nutshell stacking uses as a first-level (base), the predictions of a few basic classifiers and then uses another model at the second-level to predict the output from the earlier first-level predictions.\\\\n\\\\nThe Titanic dataset is a prime candidate for introducing this concept as many newcomers to Kaggle start out here. Furthermore even though stacking has been responsible for many a team winning Kaggle competitions there seems to be a dearth of kernels on this topic so I hope this notebook can fill somewhat of that void.\\\\n\\\\nI myself am quite a newcomer to the Kaggle scene as well and the first proper ensembling/stacking script that I managed to chance upon and study was one written in the AllState Severity Claims competition by the great Faron. The material in this notebook borrows heavily from Faron\\'s script although ported to factor in ensembles of classifiers whilst his was ensembles of regressors. Anyway please check out his script here:\\\\n\\\\n[Stacking Starter][1] : by Faron \\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNow onto the notebook at hand and I hope that it manages to do justice and convey the concept of ensembling in an intuitive and concise manner.  My other standalone Kaggle [script][2] which implements exactly the same ensembling steps (albeit with different parameters) discussed below gives a Public LB score of 0.808 which is good enough to get to the top 9% and runs just under 4 minutes. Therefore I am pretty sure there is a lot of room to improve and add on to that script. Anyways please feel free to leave me any comments with regards to how I can improve\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n  [1]: https://www.kaggle.com/mmueller/allstate-claims-severity/stacking-starter/run/390867\\\\n  [2]: https://www.kaggle.com/arthurtok/titanic/simple-stacking-with-xgboost-0-808\"},{\"metadata\":{\"_execution_state\":\"idle\",\"_cell_guid\":\"14630296-b1aa-759e-bafa-b6a73f3896ed\",\"_uuid\":\"2e37a274400cfeb472b6405d524325245588dd66\",\"trusted\":true},\"cell_type\":\"code\",\"source\":\"# Load in our libraries\\\\nimport pandas as pd\\\\nimport numpy as np\\\\nimport re\\\\nimport sklearn\\\\nimport xgboost as xgb\\\\nimport seaborn as sns\\\\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\\\\n%matplotlib inline\\\\n\\\\nimport plotly.offline as py\\\\npy.init_notebook_mode(connected=True)\\\\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\\\\nimport plotly.tools as tls\\\\n\\\\nimport warnings\\\\nwarnings.filterwarnings(\\'ignore\\')\\\\n\\\\n# Going to use these 5 base models for the stacking\\\\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import (RandomForestClassifier, AdaBoostClassifier, \\\\n                              GradientBoostingClassifier, ExtraTreesClassifier)\\\\nfrom sklearn.svm import SVC\\\\nfrom sklearn.cross_validation import KFold\",\"execution_count\":1,\"outputs\":[]},{\"metadata\":{\"_uuid\":\"8b590aafe06a2ac55daae9d2456155e457914f5f\",\"_cell_guid\":\"d647b74c-099b-851a-dcd2-3a58c9e8f10c\"},\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"source\":\"# Feature Exploration, Engineering and Cleaning \\\\n\\\\nNow we will proceed much like how most kernels in general are structured, and that is to first explore the data on hand, identify possible feature engineering opportunities as well as numerically encode any categorical features.\"},{\"metadata\":{\"_execution_state\":\"idle\",\"_cell_guid\":\"5937fd72-d1ad-f678-cc82-f08a96e4cad0\",\"_uuid\":\"b2ad78041b69ce13d1f41bd9bc8c93cafaf7b8ac\",\"trusted\":true},\"cell_type\":\"code\",\"source\":\"# Load in the train and test datasets\\\\ntrain = pd.read_csv(\\'../input/train.csv\\')\\\\ntest = pd.read_csv(\\'../input/test.csv\\')\\\\n\\\\n# Store our passenger ID for easy access\\\\nPassengerId = test[\\'PassengerId\\']\\\\n\\\\ntrain.head(3)\",\"execution_count\":2,\"outputs\":[]},{\"metadata\":{\"_uuid\":\"81378834770e55c76751347588322fe32acf5737\",\"_cell_guid\":\"dff1c1dd-1e59-3907-88fa-1a1d699122be\"},\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"source\":\"Well it is no surprise that our task is to somehow extract the information out of the categorical variables \\\\n\\\\n**Feature Engineering**\\\\n\\\\nHere, credit must be extended to Sina\\'s very comprehensive and well-thought out notebook for the feature engineering ideas so please check out his work \\\\n\\\\n[Titanic Best Working Classfier][1] : by Sina\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n  [1]: https://www.kaggle.com/sinakhorami/titanic/titanic-best-working-classifier\"},{\"metadata\":{\"collapsed\":true,\"_execution_state\":\"idle\",\"_cell_guid\":\"e85b2a80-88a4-928f-f2b2-24895dea38f3\",\"_uuid\":\"b1c67249f91768ce8e5e2751364d32c87446cf55\",\"trusted\":true},\"cell_type\":\"code\",\"source\":\"full_data = [train, test]\\\\n\\\\n# Some features of my own that I have added in\\\\n# Gives the length of the name\\\\ntrain[\\'Name_length\\'] = train[\\'Name\\'].apply(len)\\\\ntest[\\'Name_length\\'] = test[\\'Name\\'].apply(len)\\\\n# Feature that tells whether a passenger had a cabin on the Titanic\\\\ntrain[\\'Has_Cabin\\'] = train[\\\\\"Cabin\\\\\"].apply(lambda x: 0 if type(x) == float else 1)\\\\ntest[\\'Has_Cabin\\'] = test[\\\\\"Cabin\\\\\"].apply(lambda x: 0 if type(x) == float else 1)\\\\n\\\\n# Feature engineering steps taken from Sina\\\\n# Create new feature FamilySize as a combination of SibSp and Parch\\\\nfor dataset in full_data:\\\\n    dataset[\\'FamilySize\\'] = dataset[\\'SibSp\\'] + dataset[\\'Parch\\'] + 1\\\\n# Create new feature IsAlone from FamilySize\\\\nfor dataset in full_data:\\\\n    dataset[\\'IsAlone\\'] = 0\\\\n    dataset.loc[dataset[\\'FamilySize\\'] == 1, \\'IsAlone\\'] = 1\\\\n# Remove all NULLS in the Embarked column\\\\nfor dataset in full_data:\\\\n    dataset[\\'Embarked\\'] = dataset[\\'Embarked\\'].fillna(\\'S\\')\\\\n# Remove all NULLS in the Fare column and create a new feature CategoricalFare\\\\nfor dataset in full_data:\\\\n    dataset[\\'Fare\\'] = dataset[\\'Fare\\'].fillna(train[\\'Fare\\'].median())\\\\ntrain[\\'CategoricalFare\\'] = pd.qcut(train[\\'Fare\\'], 4)\\\\n# Create a New feature CategoricalAge\\\\nfor dataset in full_data:\\\\n    age_avg = dataset[\\'Age\\'].mean()\\\\n    age_std = dataset[\\'Age\\'].std()\\\\n    age_null_count = dataset[\\'Age\\'].isnull().sum()\\\\n    age_null_random_list = np.random.randint(age_avg -

However many will skip some of the explanation on how the solution is developed as these notebooks are developed by experts for experts. The objective of this notebook is to follow a step-by-step workflow, explaining each step and rationale for every decision we take during solution development.\\\\n\\\\n## Workflow stages\\\\n\\\\nThe competition solution workflow goes through seven stages described in the Data Science Solutions book.\\\\n\\\\n1. Question or problem definition.\\\\n2. Acquire training and testing data.\\\\n3. Wrangle, prepare, cleanse the data.\\\\n4. Analyze, identify patterns, and explore the data.\\\\n5. Model, predict and solve the problem.\\\\n6. Visualize, report, and present the problem solving steps and final solution.\\\\n7. Supply or submit the results.\\\\n\\\\nThe workflow indicates general sequence of how each stage may follow the other. However there are use cases with exceptions.\\\\n\\\\n- We may combine mulitple workflow stages. We may analyze by visualizing data.\\\\n- Perform a stage earlier than indicated. We may analyze data before and after wrangling.\\\\n- Perform a stage multiple times in our workflow. Visualize stage may be used multiple times.\\\\n- Drop a stage altogether. We may not need supply stage to productize or service enable our dataset for a competition.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Question and problem definition\\\\n\\\\nCompetition sites like Kaggle define the problem to solve or questions to ask while providing the datasets for training your data science model and testing the model results against a test dataset. The question or problem definition for Titanic Survival competition is [described here at Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).\\\\n\\\\n> Knowing from a training set of samples listing passengers who survived or did not survive the Titanic disaster, can our model determine based on a given test dataset not containing the survival information, if these passengers in the test dataset survived or not.\\\\n\\\\nWe may also want to develop some early understanding about the domain of our problem. This is described on the [Kaggle competition description page here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). Here are the highlights to note.\\\\n\\\\n- On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. Translated 32% survival rate.\\\\n- One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew.\\\\n- Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.\\\\n\\\\n## Workflow goals\\\\n\\\\nThe data science solutions workflow solves for seven major goals.\\\\n\\\\n**Classifying.** We may want to classify or categorize our samples. We may also want to understand the implications or correlation of different classes with our solution goal.\\\\n\\\\n**Correlating.** One can approach the problem based on available features within the training dataset. Which features within the dataset contribute significantly to our solution goal? Statistically speaking is there a [correlation](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Correlation) among a feature and solution goal? As the feature values change does the solution state change as well, and visa-versa? This can be tested both for numerical and categorical features in the given dataset. We may also want to determine correlation among features other than survival for subsequent goals and workflow stages. Correlating certain features may help in creating, completing, or correcting features.\\\\n\\\\n**Converting.** For modeling stage, one needs to prepare the data. Depending on the choice of model algorithm one may require all features to be converted to numerical equivalent values. So for instance converting text categorical values to numeric values.\\\\n\\\\n**Completing.** Data preparation may also require us to estimate any missing values within a feature. Model algorithms may work best when there are no missing values.\\\\n\\\\n**Correcting.** We may also analyze the given training dataset for errors or possibly innacurate values within features and try to corrent these values or exclude the samples containing the errors. One way to do this is to detect any outliers among our samples or features. We may also completely discard a feature if it is not contribting to the analysis or may significantly skew the results.\\\\n\\\\n**Creating.** Can we create new features based on an existing feature or a set of features, such that the new feature follows the correlation, conversion, completeness goals.\\\\n\\\\n**Charting.** How to select the right visualization plots and charts depending on nature of the data and the solution goals.\"},{\"metadata\":{\"_uuid\":\"960f8b1937dc4915ce1eb0f82614b1985c4321a4\",\"_cell_guid\":\"56a3be4e-76ef-20c6-25e8-da16147cf6d7\"},\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"source\":\"## Refactor Release 2017-Jan-29\\\\n\\\\nWe are significantly refactoring the notebook based on (a) comments received by readers, (b) issues in porting notebook from Jupyter kernel (2.7) to Kaggle kernel (3.5), and (c) review of few more best practice kernels.\\\\n\\\\n### User comments\\\\n\\\\n- Combine training and test data for certain operations like converting titles across dataset to numerical values.

Then check out <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/titanic-tutorial\">Alexis Cook’s Titanic Tutorial</a> that walks you through step by step how to make your first submission!\n\n<iframe width=\"699\" height=\"368\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8yZMXCaFshs\" title=\"YouTube video | How to Get Started with Kaggle’s Titanic Competition | Kaggle\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n## The Challenge\nThe sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.\n\nOn April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.\n\nWhile there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.\n\nIn this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).\n\n> #### Recommended Tutorial\n> We highly recommend [Alexis Cook’s Titanic Tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/titanic-tutorial) that walks you through making your very first submission step by step and [this starter notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/gusthema/titanic-competition-w-tensorflow-decision-forests) to get started.\n\n## How Kaggle’s Competitions Work\n1. **Join the Competition**\nRead about the challenge description, accept the Competition Rules and gain access to the competition dataset.\n1.  **Get to Work**\nDownload the data, build models on it locally or on Kaggle Notebooks (our no-setup, customizable Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs) and generate a prediction file.\n1.  **Make a Submission**\nUpload your prediction as a submission on Kaggle and receive an accuracy score.\n1.  **Check the Leaderboard**\nSee how your model ranks against other Kagglers on our leaderboard. \n1.  **Improve Your Score**\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a> to find lots of tutorials and insights from other competitors.\n\n> #### Kaggle Lingo Video\n> You may run into unfamiliar lingo as you dig into the Kaggle discussion forums and public notebooks. Check out  Dr. Rachael Tatman’s [video on Kaggle Lingo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEJHyuWKd-s) to get up to speed!\n\n## What Data Will I Use in This Competition?\nIn this competition, you’ll gain access to two similar datasets that include passenger information like name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc. One dataset is titled `train.csv` and the other is titled `test.csv`.\n\n`Train.csv` will contain the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 to be exact) and importantly, will reveal whether they survived or not, also known as the “ground truth”.\n\nThe `test.csv` dataset contains similar information but does not disclose the “ground truth” for each passenger. It’s your job to predict these outcomes.\n\nUsing the patterns you find in the `train.csv` data, predict whether the other 418 passengers on board (found in `test.csv`) survived.\n\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data\">“Data” tab</a> to explore the datasets even further. Once you feel you’ve created a competitive model, submit it to Kaggle to see where your model stands on our leaderboard against other Kagglers.\n\n## How to Submit your Prediction to Kaggle\nOnce you’re ready to make a submission and get on the leaderboard:\n\n1. Click on the “Submit Predictions” button\n<img width=\"699\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen1.png\">\n1. Upload a CSV file in the submission file format. You’re able to submit 10 submissions a day.\n<img width=\"699\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen2.png\">\n\n## Submission File Format:\nYou should submit a csv file with exactly 418 entries plus a header row. Your submission will show an error if you have extra columns (beyond `PassengerId` and `Survived`) or rows.\n\nThe file should have exactly 2 columns:\n- `PassengerId` (sorted in any order)\n- `Survived` (contains your binary predictions: 1 for survived, 0 for deceased)\n\n## Got it! I’m ready to get started. Where do I get help if I need it?\n- For Competition Help: <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\">Titanic Discussion Forum</a>\n\nKaggle doesn’t have a dedicated team to help troubleshoot your code so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. The forums are full of useful information on the data, metric, and different approaches. We encourage you to use the forums often. If you share your knowledge, you'll find that others will share a lot in turn!\n\n## A Last Word on Kaggle Notebooks\nAs we mentioned before, Kaggle Notebooks is our no-setup, customizable, Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs and a huge repository of community published data &amp; code.\n\nIn every competition, you’ll find many Notebooks shared with incredible insights. It’s an invaluable resource worth becoming familiar with. Check out this competition’s Notebooks <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/notebooks\">here</a>.\n\n## 🏃‍♀Ready to Compete? <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/account/login?returnUrl=%2Fc%2Ftitanic\">Join the Competition Here!</a>\n\n## Evaluation\n\n<h2>Goal</h2>\n<p>It is your job to predict if a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic or not. <br>For each  in the test set, you must predict a 0 or 1 value for the  variable.</p>\n<h2>Metric</h2>\n<p>Your score is the percentage of passengers you correctly predict.

They are a great place to begin if you are new to data science or just finished a MOOC and want to get involved in Kaggle.</p>\n<p>Getting Started competitions are a non-competitive way to get familiar with Kaggle’s platform, learn basic machine learning concepts, and start meeting people in the community. They have no cash prize and are on a rolling timeline.</p>\n<h2>How do I create and manage a team?</h2>\n<p>When you accept the competition rules, a team will be created for you. You can invite others to your team, accept a merger with another team, and update basic information like team name by going to the More &gt; <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/team\" target=\"_blank\">Team</a> page.</p>\n<p>We've heard from many Kagglers that teaming up is the best way to learn new skills AND have fun. If you don't have a teammate already, consider asking if anyone wants to team up in the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a>.</p>\n<h2>What are Notebooks?</h2>\n<p>Kaggle Notebooks is a cloud computational environment that enables reproducible and collaborative analysis. Notebooks support scripts in Python and R, Jupyter Notebooks, and RMarkdown reports. You can visit the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/notebooks\" target=\"_blank\">Notebooks</a> tab to view all of the publicly shared code for the Titanic competition. For more on how to use Notebooks to learn data science, check out our <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview\" target=\"&quot;_blank\">Courses</a>!</p>\n<h2>Why did my team disappear from the leaderboard?</h2>\n<p>To keep with the spirit of getting-started competitions, we have implemented a two month rolling window on submissions. Once a submission is more than two months old, it will be invalidated and no longer count towards the leaderboard.</p>\n<p>If your team has no submissions in the previous two months, the team will also drop from the leaderboard. This will keep the leaderboard at a manageable size, freshen it up, and prevent newcomers from getting lost in a sea of abandoned scores.</p>\n<p><i>\"I worked so hard to get that score! Give it back!\"</i> Read more about our decision to implement a rolling leaderboard <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion/6240\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n<h2>How do I contact Support?</h2>\n<p>Kaggle does not have a dedicated support team so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. (For this competition, you’ll want to use the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">Titanic discussion forum)</a>.</p>\n<p>Support is only able to help with issues that are being experienced by all participants. Before contacting support, please check the discussion forum for information on your problem. If you can’t find it, you can post your problem in the forum so a fellow participant or a Kaggle team member can provide help. The forums are full of useful information on the data, metric, and different approaches. We encourage you to use the forums often. If you share your knowledge, you'll find that others will share a lot in turn!</p>\n<p>If your problem persists or it seems to be effective all participants then please <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/contact\" target=\"_blank\">contact us</a>.</p>\ntool: Not a directory: /home/code/exploration/../research/writeups\ntool: /home/code/exploration/../research/kernels:\n[DIR]  alexisbcook_exercise-arithmetic-and-variables/\n[DIR]  alexisbcook_titanic-tutorial/\n[DIR]  arthurtok_introduction-to-ensembling-stacking-in-python/\n[DIR]  ldfreeman3_a-data-science-framework-to-achieve-99-accuracy/\n[FILE] metadata.json (1.7KB)\n[DIR]  startupsci_titanic-data-science-solutions/\ntool: /home/data:\n[FILE] description.md (13.6KB)\n[FILE] gender_submission.csv (3.2KB)\n[FILE] test.csv (28.0KB)\n[FILE] train.csv (59.8KB)\ntool: Error: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/home/code/exploration/../research/kernels/ldfreeman3_a-data-science-framework-to-achieve-99-accuracy/ldfreeman3_a-data-science-framework-to-achieve-99-accuracy.py'\ntool: Error: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/home/code/exploration/../research/kernels/arthurtok_introduction-to-ensembling-stacking-in-python/arthurtok_introduction-to-ensembling-stacking-in-python.py'\ntool: /home/code/exploration/../research/kernels/ldfreeman3_a-data-science-framework-to-achieve-99-accuracy:\n[FILE] a-data-science-framework-to-achieve-99-accuracy.ipynb (107.1KB)\n[FILE] kernel-metadata.json (732.0B)\ntool: /home/code/exploration/../research/kernels/arthurtok_introduction-to-ensembling-stacking-in-python:\n[FILE] introduction-to-ensembling-stacking-in-python.ipynb (39.3KB)\n[FILE] kernel-metadata.json (687.0B)\ntool: /home/code/exploration/../research/kernels/startupsci_titanic-data-science-solutions:\n[FILE] kernel-metadata.json (661.0B)\n[FILE] titanic-data-science-solutions.ipynb (55.5KB)\ntool: {\"cells\":[{\"source\":\"\\n>Hello and Welcome to Kaggle, the online Data Science Community to learn, share, and compete.

In laymen terms this means, it either occurred or did not occur. For example, you won or did not win, you passed the test or did not pass the test, you were accepted or not accepted, and you get the point. A common business application is churn or customer retention. Another popular use case is, healthcare's mortality rate or survival analysis. Binary events create an interesting dynamic, because we know statistically, a random guess should achieve a 50% accuracy rate, without creating one single algorithm or writing one single line of code. However, just like autocorrect spellcheck technology, sometimes we humans can be too smart for our own good and actually underperform a coin flip. In this kernel, I use Kaggle's Getting Started Competition, Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster, to walk the reader through, how-to use the data science framework to beat the odds.\\n   \\n*What happens when technology is too smart for its own good?*\\n![Funny Autocorrect](http://15858-presscdn-0-65.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/hilarious-autocorrect-fails-20x.jpg)\",\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"metadata\":{\"_cell_guid\":\"ec31d549-537e-4f35-8594-22ef03079081\",\"_uuid\":\"ff6c70c884a8a5fb3258e7f3fefc9e55261df1df\"}},{\"source\":\"<a id=\\\"ch2\\\"></a>\\n# A Data Science Framework\\n1. **Define the Problem:** If data science, big data, machine learning, predictive analytics, business intelligence, or any other buzzword is the solution, then what is the problem? As the saying goes, don't put the cart before the horse. Problems before requirements, requirements before solutions, solutions before design, and design before technology. Too often we are quick to jump on the new shiny technology, tool, or algorithm before determining the actual problem we are trying to solve.\\n2. **Gather the Data:** John Naisbitt wrote in his 1984 (yes, 1984) book Megatrends, we are “drowning in data, yet staving for knowledge.\\\" So, chances are, the dataset(s) already exist somewhere, in some format. It may be external or internal, structured or unstructured, static or streamed, objective or subjective, etc. As the saying goes, you don't have to reinvent the wheel, you just have to know where to find it. In the next step, we will worry about transforming \\\"dirty data\\\" to \\\"clean data.\\\"\\n3. **Prepare Data for Consumption:** This step is often referred to as data wrangling, a required process to turn “wild” data into “manageable” data. Data wrangling includes implementing data architectures for storage and processing, developing data governance standards for quality and control, data extraction (i.e. ETL and web scraping), and data cleaning to identify aberrant, missing, or outlier data points.\\n4. **Perform Exploratory Analysis:** Anybody who has ever worked with data knows, garbage-in, garbage-out (GIGO). Therefore, it is important to deploy descriptive and graphical statistics to look for potential problems, patterns, classifications, correlations and comparisons in the dataset. In addition, data categorization (i.e. qualitative vs quantitative) is also important to understand and select the correct hypothesis test or data model.\\n5. **Model Data:** Like descriptive and inferential statistics, data modeling can either summarize the data or predict future outcomes. Your dataset and expected results, will determine the algorithms available for use. It's important to remember, algorithms are tools and not magical wands or silver bullets. You must still be the master craft (wo)man that knows how-to select the right tool for the job. An analogy would be asking someone to hand you a Philip screwdriver, and they hand you a flathead screwdriver or worst a hammer. At best, it shows a complete lack of understanding. At worst, it makes completing the project impossible. The same is true in data modelling. The wrong model can lead to poor performance at best and the wrong conclusion (that’s used as actionable intelligence) at worst.\\n6. **Validate and Implement Data Model:** After you've trained your model based on a subset of your data, it's time to test your model. This helps ensure you haven't overfit your model or made it so specific to the selected subset, that it does not accurately fit another subset from the same dataset. In this step we determine if our [model overfit, generalize, or underfit our dataset](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/latest/dg/model-fit-underfitting-vs-overfitting.html).\\n7. **Optimize and Strategize:** This is the \\\"bionic man\\\" step, where you iterate back through the process to make it better...stronger...faster than it was before. As a data scientist, your strategy should be to outsource developer operations and application plumbing, so you have more time to focus on recommendations and design. Once you're able to package your ideas, this becomes your “currency exchange\\\" rate.\",\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"metadata\":{\"_cell_guid\":\"8514a868-6816-494a-9e9c-dba14cb36f42\",\"_uuid\":\"bd2a68dcaace0c1371f2994f0204dce65800cc20\"}},{\"source\":\"<a id=\\\"ch3\\\"></a>\\n# Step 1: Define the Problem\\nFor this project, the problem statement is given to us on a golden plater, develop an algorithm to predict the survival outcome of passengers on the Titanic.\\n\\n......\\n\\n**Project Summary:**\\nThe sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.\\n\\nOne of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.\\n\\nIn this challenge, we ask you to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular, we ask you to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.\\n\\nPractice Skills\\n* Binary classification\\n* Python and R basics\\n\\n# Step 2: Gather the Data\\n\\nThe dataset is also given to us on a golden plater with test and train data at [Kaggle's Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)\\n\",\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"metadata\":{\"_cell_guid\":\"22ba49b5-b3b6-4129-8c57-623e0d863ab3\",\"_uuid\":\"ff014109d795c5d1bfcc66c9761730406124ebe4\"}},{\"source\":\"<a id=\\\"ch4\\\"></a>\\n# Step 3: Prepare Data for Consumption\\nSince step 2 was provided to us on a golden plater, so is step 3.

Using the same dataset and different implementation of a decision tree (adaboost, random forest, gradient boost, xgboost, etc.) with tuning does not exceed the 0.77990 submission accuracy. Interesting for this dataset, the simple decision tree algorithm had the best default submission score and with tuning achieved the same best accuracy score.\\n\\nWhile no general conclusions can be made from testing a handful of algorithms on a single dataset, there are several observations on the mentioned dataset. \\n1. The train dataset has a different distribution than the test/validation dataset and population. This created wide margins between the cross validation (CV) accuracy score and Kaggle submission accuracy score.\\n2. Given the same dataset, decision tree based algorithms, seemed to converge on the same accuracy score after proper tuning.\\n3. Despite tuning, no machine learning algorithm, exceeded the homemade algorithm. The author will theorize, that for small datasets, a manmade algorithm is the bar to beat. \\n\\nWith that in mind, for iteration two, I would spend more time on preprocessing and feature engineering. In order to better align the CV score and Kaggle score and improve the overall accuracy.\\n\\n\",\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"metadata\":{\"_cell_guid\":\"a6d34edc-1265-41e8-b163-0b817cd3b6a5\",\"_uuid\":\"c476df95925d67809975caca4ea4dcb4b2a0b277\"}},{\"source\":\"<a id=\\\"ch90\\\"></a>\\n## Change Log:\\n11/22/17 Please note, this kernel is currently in progress, but open to feedback.

In a nutshell stacking uses as a first-level (base), the predictions of a few basic classifiers and then uses another model at the second-level to predict the output from the earlier first-level predictions.\\n\\nThe Titanic dataset is a prime candidate for introducing this concept as many newcomers to Kaggle start out here. Furthermore even though stacking has been responsible for many a team winning Kaggle competitions there seems to be a dearth of kernels on this topic so I hope this notebook can fill somewhat of that void.\\n\\nI myself am quite a newcomer to the Kaggle scene as well and the first proper ensembling/stacking script that I managed to chance upon and study was one written in the AllState Severity Claims competition by the great Faron. The material in this notebook borrows heavily from Faron's script although ported to factor in ensembles of classifiers whilst his was ensembles of regressors. Anyway please check out his script here:\\n\\n[Stacking Starter][1] : by Faron \\n\\n\\nNow onto the notebook at hand and I hope that it manages to do justice and convey the concept of ensembling in an intuitive and concise manner.  My other standalone Kaggle [script][2] which implements exactly the same ensembling steps (albeit with different parameters) discussed below gives a Public LB score of 0.808 which is good enough to get to the top 9% and runs just under 4 minutes. Therefore I am pretty sure there is a lot of room to improve and add on to that script. Anyways please feel free to leave me any comments with regards to how I can improve\\n\\n\\n  [1]: https://www.kaggle.com/mmueller/allstate-claims-severity/stacking-starter/run/390867\\n  [2]: https://www.kaggle.com/arthurtok/titanic/simple-stacking-with-xgboost-0-808\"},{\"metadata\":{\"_execution_state\":\"idle\",\"_cell_guid\":\"14630296-b1aa-759e-bafa-b6a73f3896ed\",\"_uuid\":\"2e37a274400cfeb472b6405d524325245588dd66\",\"trusted\":true},\"cell_type\":\"code\",\"source\":\"# Load in our libraries\\nimport pandas as pd\\nimport numpy as np\\nimport re\\nimport sklearn\\nimport xgboost as xgb\\nimport seaborn as sns\\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\\n%matplotlib inline\\n\\nimport plotly.offline as py\\npy.init_notebook_mode(connected=True)\\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\\nimport plotly.tools as tls\\n\\nimport warnings\\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\\n\\n# Going to use these 5 base models for the stacking\\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import (RandomForestClassifier, AdaBoostClassifier, \\n                              GradientBoostingClassifier, ExtraTreesClassifier)\\nfrom sklearn.svm import SVC\\nfrom sklearn.cross_validation import KFold\",\"execution_count\":1,\"outputs\":[]},{\"metadata\":{\"_uuid\":\"8b590aafe06a2ac55daae9d2456155e457914f5f\",\"_cell_guid\":\"d647b74c-099b-851a-dcd2-3a58c9e8f10c\"},\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"source\":\"# Feature Exploration, Engineering and Cleaning \\n\\nNow we will proceed much like how most kernels in general are structured, and that is to first explore the data on hand, identify possible feature engineering opportunities as well as numerically encode any categorical features.\"},{\"metadata\":{\"_execution_state\":\"idle\",\"_cell_guid\":\"5937fd72-d1ad-f678-cc82-f08a96e4cad0\",\"_uuid\":\"b2ad78041b69ce13d1f41bd9bc8c93cafaf7b8ac\",\"trusted\":true},\"cell_type\":\"code\",\"source\":\"# Load in the train and test datasets\\ntrain = pd.read_csv('../input/train.csv')\\ntest = pd.read_csv('../input/test.csv')\\n\\n# Store our passenger ID for easy access\\nPassengerId = test['PassengerId']\\n\\ntrain.head(3)\",\"execution_count\":2,\"outputs\":[]},{\"metadata\":{\"_uuid\":\"81378834770e55c76751347588322fe32acf5737\",\"_cell_guid\":\"dff1c1dd-1e59-3907-88fa-1a1d699122be\"},\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"source\":\"Well it is no surprise that our task is to somehow extract the information out of the categorical variables \\n\\n**Feature Engineering**\\n\\nHere, credit must be extended to Sina's very comprehensive and well-thought out notebook for the feature engineering ideas so please check out his work \\n\\n[Titanic Best Working Classfier][1] : by Sina\\n\\n\\n  [1]: https://www.kaggle.com/sinakhorami/titanic/titanic-best-working-classifier\"},{\"metadata\":{\"collapsed\":true,\"_execution_state\":\"idle\",\"_cell_guid\":\"e85b2a80-88a4-928f-f2b2-24895dea38f3\",\"_uuid\":\"b1c67249f91768ce8e5e2751364d32c87446cf55\",\"trusted\":true},\"cell_type\":\"code\",\"source\":\"full_data = [train, test]\\n\\n# Some features of my own that I have added in\\n# Gives the length of the name\\ntrain['Name_length'] = train['Name'].apply(len)\\ntest['Name_length'] = test['Name'].apply(len)\\n# Feature that tells whether a passenger had a cabin on the Titanic\\ntrain['Has_Cabin'] = train[\\\"Cabin\\\"].apply(lambda x: 0 if type(x) == float else 1)\\ntest['Has_Cabin'] = test[\\\"Cabin\\\"].apply(lambda x: 0 if type(x) == float else 1)\\n\\n# Feature engineering steps taken from Sina\\n# Create new feature FamilySize as a combination of SibSp and Parch\\nfor dataset in full_data:\\n    dataset['FamilySize'] = dataset['SibSp'] + dataset['Parch'] + 1\\n# Create new feature IsAlone from FamilySize\\nfor dataset in full_data:\\n    dataset['IsAlone'] = 0\\n    dataset.loc[dataset['FamilySize'] == 1, 'IsAlone'] = 1\\n# Remove all NULLS in the Embarked column\\nfor dataset in full_data:\\n    dataset['Embarked'] = dataset['Embarked'].fillna('S')\\n# Remove all NULLS in the Fare column and create a new feature CategoricalFare\\nfor dataset in full_data:\\n    dataset['Fare'] = dataset['Fare'].fillna(train['Fare'].median())\\ntrain['CategoricalFare'] = pd.qcut(train['Fare'], 4)\\n# Create a New feature CategoricalAge\\nfor dataset in full_data:\\n    age_avg = dataset['Age'].mean()\\n    age_std = dataset['Age'].std()\\n    age_null_count = dataset['Age'].isnull().sum()\\n    age_null_random_list = np.random.randint(age_avg -

However many will skip some of the explanation on how the solution is developed as these notebooks are developed by experts for experts. The objective of this notebook is to follow a step-by-step workflow, explaining each step and rationale for every decision we take during solution development.\\n\\n## Workflow stages\\n\\nThe competition solution workflow goes through seven stages described in the Data Science Solutions book.\\n\\n1. Question or problem definition.\\n2. Acquire training and testing data.\\n3. Wrangle, prepare, cleanse the data.\\n4. Analyze, identify patterns, and explore the data.\\n5. Model, predict and solve the problem.\\n6. Visualize, report, and present the problem solving steps and final solution.\\n7. Supply or submit the results.\\n\\nThe workflow indicates general sequence of how each stage may follow the other. However there are use cases with exceptions.\\n\\n- We may combine mulitple workflow stages. We may analyze by visualizing data.\\n- Perform a stage earlier than indicated. We may analyze data before and after wrangling.\\n- Perform a stage multiple times in our workflow. Visualize stage may be used multiple times.\\n- Drop a stage altogether. We may not need supply stage to productize or service enable our dataset for a competition.\\n\\n\\n## Question and problem definition\\n\\nCompetition sites like Kaggle define the problem to solve or questions to ask while providing the datasets for training your data science model and testing the model results against a test dataset. The question or problem definition for Titanic Survival competition is [described here at Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).\\n\\n> Knowing from a training set of samples listing passengers who survived or did not survive the Titanic disaster, can our model determine based on a given test dataset not containing the survival information, if these passengers in the test dataset survived or not.\\n\\nWe may also want to develop some early understanding about the domain of our problem. This is described on the [Kaggle competition description page here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). Here are the highlights to note.\\n\\n- On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. Translated 32% survival rate.\\n- One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew.\\n- Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.\\n\\n## Workflow goals\\n\\nThe data science solutions workflow solves for seven major goals.\\n\\n**Classifying.** We may want to classify or categorize our samples. We may also want to understand the implications or correlation of different classes with our solution goal.\\n\\n**Correlating.** One can approach the problem based on available features within the training dataset. Which features within the dataset contribute significantly to our solution goal? Statistically speaking is there a [correlation](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Correlation) among a feature and solution goal? As the feature values change does the solution state change as well, and visa-versa? This can be tested both for numerical and categorical features in the given dataset. We may also want to determine correlation among features other than survival for subsequent goals and workflow stages. Correlating certain features may help in creating, completing, or correcting features.\\n\\n**Converting.** For modeling stage, one needs to prepare the data. Depending on the choice of model algorithm one may require all features to be converted to numerical equivalent values. So for instance converting text categorical values to numeric values.\\n\\n**Completing.** Data preparation may also require us to estimate any missing values within a feature. Model algorithms may work best when there are no missing values.\\n\\n**Correcting.** We may also analyze the given training dataset for errors or possibly innacurate values within features and try to corrent these values or exclude the samples containing the errors. One way to do this is to detect any outliers among our samples or features. We may also completely discard a feature if it is not contribting to the analysis or may significantly skew the results.\\n\\n**Creating.** Can we create new features based on an existing feature or a set of features, such that the new feature follows the correlation, conversion, completeness goals.\\n\\n**Charting.** How to select the right visualization plots and charts depending on nature of the data and the solution goals.\"},{\"metadata\":{\"_uuid\":\"960f8b1937dc4915ce1eb0f82614b1985c4321a4\",\"_cell_guid\":\"56a3be4e-76ef-20c6-25e8-da16147cf6d7\"},\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"source\":\"## Refactor Release 2017-Jan-29\\n\\nWe are significantly refactoring the notebook based on (a) comments received by readers, (b) issues in porting notebook from Jupyter kernel (2.7) to Kaggle kernel (3.5), and (c) review of few more best practice kernels.\\n\\n### User comments\\n\\n- Combine training and test data for certain operations like converting titles across dataset to numerical values.

Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.\\n\\nWhile there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.\\n\\nIn this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).\\n\\n> #### Recommended Tutorial\\n> We highly recommend [Alexis Cook’s Titanic Tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/titanic-tutorial) that walks you through making your very first submission step by step and [this starter notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/gusthema/titanic-competition-w-tensorflow-decision-forests) to get started.\\n\\n## How Kaggle’s Competitions Work\\n1. **Join the Competition**\\nRead about the challenge description, accept the Competition Rules and gain access to the competition dataset.\\n1.  **Get to Work**\\nDownload the data, build models on it locally or on Kaggle Notebooks (our no-setup, customizable Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs) and generate a prediction file.\\n1.  **Make a Submission**\\nUpload your prediction as a submission on Kaggle and receive an accuracy score.\\n1.  **Check the Leaderboard**\\nSee how your model ranks against other Kagglers on our leaderboard. \\n1.  **Improve Your Score**\\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a> to find lots of tutorials and insights from other competitors.\\n\\n> #### Kaggle Lingo Video\\n> You may run into unfamiliar lingo as you dig into the Kaggle discussion forums and public notebooks. Check out  Dr. Rachael Tatman’s [video on Kaggle Lingo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEJHyuWKd-s) to get up to speed!\\n\\n## What Data Will I Use in This Competition?\\nIn this competition, you’ll gain access to two similar datasets that include passenger information like name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc. One dataset is titled `train.csv` and the other is titled `test.csv`.\\n\\n`Train.csv` will contain the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 to be exact) and importantly, will reveal whether they survived or not, also known as the “ground truth”.\\n\\nThe `test.csv` dataset contains similar information but does not disclose the “ground truth” for each passenger. It’s your job to predict these outcomes.\\n\\nUsing the patterns you find in the `train.csv` data, predict whether the other 418 passengers on board (found in `test.csv`) survived.\\n\\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data\">“Data” tab</a> to explore the datasets even further. Once you feel you’ve created a competitive model, submit it to Kaggle to see where your model stands on our leaderboard against other Kagglers.\\n\\n## How to Submit your Prediction to Kaggle\\nOnce you’re ready to make a submission and get on the leaderboard:\\n\\n1. Click on the “Submit Predictions” button\\n<img width=\"699\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen1.png\">\\n1. Upload a CSV file in the submission file format. You’re able to submit 10 submissions a day.\\n<img width=\"699\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen2.png\">\\n\\n## Submission File Format:\\nYou should submit a csv file with exactly 418 entries plus a header row. Your submission will show an error if you have extra columns (beyond `PassengerId` and `Survived`) or rows.\\n\\nThe file should have exactly 2 columns:\\n- `PassengerId` (sorted in any order)\\n- `Survived` (contains your binary predictions: 1 for survived, 0 for deceased)\\n\\n## Got it! I’m ready to get started. Where do I get help if I need it?\\n- For Competition Help: <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\">Titanic Discussion Forum</a>\\n\\nKaggle doesn’t have a dedicated team to help troubleshoot your code so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. The forums are full of useful information on the data, metric, and different approaches. We encourage you to use the forums often. If you share your knowledge, you\\'ll find that others will share a lot in turn!\\n\\n## A Last Word on Kaggle Notebooks\\nAs we mentioned before, Kaggle Notebooks is our no-setup, customizable, Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs and a huge repository of community published data &amp; code.\\n\\nIn every competition, you’ll find many Notebooks shared with incredible insights. It’s an invaluable resource worth becoming familiar with. Check out this competition’s Notebooks <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/notebooks\">here</a>.\\n\\n## 🏃\\u200d♀Ready to Compete? <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/account/login?returnUrl=%2Fc%2Ftitanic\">Join the Competition Here!</a>\\n\\n## Evaluation\\n\\n<h2>Goal</h2>\\n<p>It is your job to predict if a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic or not. <br>For each  in the test set, you must predict a 0 or 1 value for the  variable.</p>\\n<h2>Metric</h2>\\n<p>Your score is the percentage of passengers you correctly predict.

They are a great place to begin if you are new to data science or just finished a MOOC and want to get involved in Kaggle.</p>\\n<p>Getting Started competitions are a non-competitive way to get familiar with Kaggle’s platform, learn basic machine learning concepts, and start meeting people in the community. They have no cash prize and are on a rolling timeline.</p>\\n<h2>How do I create and manage a team?</h2>\\n<p>When you accept the competition rules, a team will be created for you. You can invite others to your team, accept a merger with another team, and update basic information like team name by going to the More &gt; <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/team\" target=\"_blank\">Team</a> page.</p>\\n<p>We\\'ve heard from many Kagglers that teaming up is the best way to learn new skills AND have fun. If you don\\'t have a teammate already, consider asking if anyone wants to team up in the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a>.</p>\\n<h2>What are Notebooks?</h2>\\n<p>Kaggle Notebooks is a cloud computational environment that enables reproducible and collaborative analysis. Notebooks support scripts in Python and R, Jupyter Notebooks, and RMarkdown reports. You can visit the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/notebooks\" target=\"_blank\">Notebooks</a> tab to view all of the publicly shared code for the Titanic competition. For more on how to use Notebooks to learn data science, check out our <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview\" target=\"&quot;_blank\">Courses</a>!</p>\\n<h2>Why did my team disappear from the leaderboard?</h2>\\n<p>To keep with the spirit of getting-started competitions, we have implemented a two month rolling window on submissions. Once a submission is more than two months old, it will be invalidated and no longer count towards the leaderboard.</p>\\n<p>If your team has no submissions in the previous two months, the team will also drop from the leaderboard. This will keep the leaderboard at a manageable size, freshen it up, and prevent newcomers from getting lost in a sea of abandoned scores.</p>\\n<p><i>\"I worked so hard to get that score! Give it back!\"</i> Read more about our decision to implement a rolling leaderboard <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion/6240\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\\n<h2>How do I contact Support?</h2>\\n<p>Kaggle does not have a dedicated support team so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. (For this competition, you’ll want to use the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">Titanic discussion forum)</a>.</p>\\n<p>Support is only able to help with issues that are being experienced by all participants. Before contacting support, please check the discussion forum for information on your problem. If you can’t find it, you can post your problem in the forum so a fellow participant or a Kaggle team member can provide help. The forums are full of useful information on the data, metric, and different approaches. We encourage you to use the forums often. If you share your knowledge, you\\'ll find that others will share a lot in turn!</p>\\n<p>If your problem persists or it seems to be effective all participants then please <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/contact\" target=\"_blank\">contact us</a>.</p>'}, {'role': 'tool', 'content': 'Not a directory: /home/code/exploration/../research/writeups'}, {'role': 'tool', 'content': '/home/code/exploration/../research/kernels:\\n[DIR]  alexisbcook_exercise-arithmetic-and-variables/\\n[DIR]  alexisbcook_titanic-tutorial/\\n[DIR]  arthurtok_introduction-to-ensembling-stacking-in-python/\\n[DIR]  ldfreeman3_a-data-science-framework-to-achieve-99-accuracy/\\n[FILE] metadata.json (1.7KB)\\n[DIR]  startupsci_titanic-data-science-solutions/'}, {'role': 'tool', 'content': '/home/data:\\n[FILE] description.md (13.6KB)\\n[FILE] gender_submission.csv (3.2KB)\\n[FILE] test.csv (28.0KB)\\n[FILE] train.csv (59.8KB)'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': \"REASONING: This is the classic Titanic survival prediction problem - binary classification with accuracy as the metric.

In laymen terms this means, it either occurred or did not occur. For example, you won or did not win, you passed the test or did not pass the test, you were accepted or not accepted, and you get the point. A common business application is churn or customer retention. Another popular use case is, healthcare\\'s mortality rate or survival analysis. Binary events create an interesting dynamic, because we know statistically, a random guess should achieve a 50% accuracy rate, without creating one single algorithm or writing one single line of code. However, just like autocorrect spellcheck technology, sometimes we humans can be too smart for our own good and actually underperform a coin flip. In this kernel, I use Kaggle\\'s Getting Started Competition, Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster, to walk the reader through, how-to use the data science framework to beat the odds.\\\\n   \\\\n*What happens when technology is too smart for its own good?*\\\\n![Funny Autocorrect](http://15858-presscdn-0-65.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/hilarious-autocorrect-fails-20x.jpg)\",\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"metadata\":{\"_cell_guid\":\"ec31d549-537e-4f35-8594-22ef03079081\",\"_uuid\":\"ff6c70c884a8a5fb3258e7f3fefc9e55261df1df\"}},{\"source\":\"<a id=\\\\\"ch2\\\\\"></a>\\\\n# A Data Science Framework\\\\n1. **Define the Problem:** If data science, big data, machine learning, predictive analytics, business intelligence, or any other buzzword is the solution, then what is the problem? As the saying goes, don\\'t put the cart before the horse. Problems before requirements, requirements before solutions, solutions before design, and design before technology. Too often we are quick to jump on the new shiny technology, tool, or algorithm before determining the actual problem we are trying to solve.\\\\n2. **Gather the Data:** John Naisbitt wrote in his 1984 (yes, 1984) book Megatrends, we are “drowning in data, yet staving for knowledge.\\\\\" So, chances are, the dataset(s) already exist somewhere, in some format. It may be external or internal, structured or unstructured, static or streamed, objective or subjective, etc. As the saying goes, you don\\'t have to reinvent the wheel, you just have to know where to find it. In the next step, we will worry about transforming \\\\\"dirty data\\\\\" to \\\\\"clean data.\\\\\"\\\\n3. **Prepare Data for Consumption:** This step is often referred to as data wrangling, a required process to turn “wild” data into “manageable” data. Data wrangling includes implementing data architectures for storage and processing, developing data governance standards for quality and control, data extraction (i.e. ETL and web scraping), and data cleaning to identify aberrant, missing, or outlier data points.\\\\n4. **Perform Exploratory Analysis:** Anybody who has ever worked with data knows, garbage-in, garbage-out (GIGO). Therefore, it is important to deploy descriptive and graphical statistics to look for potential problems, patterns, classifications, correlations and comparisons in the dataset. In addition, data categorization (i.e. qualitative vs quantitative) is also important to understand and select the correct hypothesis test or data model.\\\\n5. **Model Data:** Like descriptive and inferential statistics, data modeling can either summarize the data or predict future outcomes. Your dataset and expected results, will determine the algorithms available for use. It\\'s important to remember, algorithms are tools and not magical wands or silver bullets. You must still be the master craft (wo)man that knows how-to select the right tool for the job. An analogy would be asking someone to hand you a Philip screwdriver, and they hand you a flathead screwdriver or worst a hammer. At best, it shows a complete lack of understanding. At worst, it makes completing the project impossible. The same is true in data modelling. The wrong model can lead to poor performance at best and the wrong conclusion (that’s used as actionable intelligence) at worst.\\\\n6. **Validate and Implement Data Model:** After you\\'ve trained your model based on a subset of your data, it\\'s time to test your model. This helps ensure you haven\\'t overfit your model or made it so specific to the selected subset, that it does not accurately fit another subset from the same dataset. In this step we determine if our [model overfit, generalize, or underfit our dataset](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/latest/dg/model-fit-underfitting-vs-overfitting.html).\\\\n7. **Optimize and Strategize:** This is the \\\\\"bionic man\\\\\" step, where you iterate back through the process to make it better...stronger...faster than it was before. As a data scientist, your strategy should be to outsource developer operations and application plumbing, so you have more time to focus on recommendations and design. Once you\\'re able to package your ideas, this becomes your “currency exchange\\\\\" rate.\",\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"metadata\":{\"_cell_guid\":\"8514a868-6816-494a-9e9c-dba14cb36f42\",\"_uuid\":\"bd2a68dcaace0c1371f2994f0204dce65800cc20\"}},{\"source\":\"<a id=\\\\\"ch3\\\\\"></a>\\\\n# Step 1: Define the Problem\\\\nFor this project, the problem statement is given to us on a golden plater, develop an algorithm to predict the survival outcome of passengers on the Titanic.\\\\n\\\\n......\\\\n\\\\n**Project Summary:**\\\\nThe sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.

Using the same dataset and different implementation of a decision tree (adaboost, random forest, gradient boost, xgboost, etc.) with tuning does not exceed the 0.77990 submission accuracy. Interesting for this dataset, the simple decision tree algorithm had the best default submission score and with tuning achieved the same best accuracy score.\\\\n\\\\nWhile no general conclusions can be made from testing a handful of algorithms on a single dataset, there are several observations on the mentioned dataset. \\\\n1. The train dataset has a different distribution than the test/validation dataset and population. This created wide margins between the cross validation (CV) accuracy score and Kaggle submission accuracy score.\\\\n2. Given the same dataset, decision tree based algorithms, seemed to converge on the same accuracy score after proper tuning.\\\\n3. Despite tuning, no machine learning algorithm, exceeded the homemade algorithm. The author will theorize, that for small datasets, a manmade algorithm is the bar to beat. \\\\n\\\\nWith that in mind, for iteration two, I would spend more time on preprocessing and feature engineering. In order to better align the CV score and Kaggle score and improve the overall accuracy.\\\\n\\\\n\",\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"metadata\":{\"_cell_guid\":\"a6d34edc-1265-41e8-b163-0b817cd3b6a5\",\"_uuid\":\"c476df95925d67809975caca4ea4dcb4b2a0b277\"}},{\"source\":\"<a id=\\\\\"ch90\\\\\"></a>\\\\n## Change Log:\\\\n11/22/17 Please note, this kernel is currently in progress, but open to feedback.

In a nutshell stacking uses as a first-level (base), the predictions of a few basic classifiers and then uses another model at the second-level to predict the output from the earlier first-level predictions.\\\\n\\\\nThe Titanic dataset is a prime candidate for introducing this concept as many newcomers to Kaggle start out here. Furthermore even though stacking has been responsible for many a team winning Kaggle competitions there seems to be a dearth of kernels on this topic so I hope this notebook can fill somewhat of that void.\\\\n\\\\nI myself am quite a newcomer to the Kaggle scene as well and the first proper ensembling/stacking script that I managed to chance upon and study was one written in the AllState Severity Claims competition by the great Faron. The material in this notebook borrows heavily from Faron\\'s script although ported to factor in ensembles of classifiers whilst his was ensembles of regressors. Anyway please check out his script here:\\\\n\\\\n[Stacking Starter][1] : by Faron \\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNow onto the notebook at hand and I hope that it manages to do justice and convey the concept of ensembling in an intuitive and concise manner.  My other standalone Kaggle [script][2] which implements exactly the same ensembling steps (albeit with different parameters) discussed below gives a Public LB score of 0.808 which is good enough to get to the top 9% and runs just under 4 minutes. Therefore I am pretty sure there is a lot of room to improve and add on to that script. Anyways please feel free to leave me any comments with regards to how I can improve\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n  [1]: https://www.kaggle.com/mmueller/allstate-claims-severity/stacking-starter/run/390867\\\\n  [2]: https://www.kaggle.com/arthurtok/titanic/simple-stacking-with-xgboost-0-808\"},{\"metadata\":{\"_execution_state\":\"idle\",\"_cell_guid\":\"14630296-b1aa-759e-bafa-b6a73f3896ed\",\"_uuid\":\"2e37a274400cfeb472b6405d524325245588dd66\",\"trusted\":true},\"cell_type\":\"code\",\"source\":\"# Load in our libraries\\\\nimport pandas as pd\\\\nimport numpy as np\\\\nimport re\\\\nimport sklearn\\\\nimport xgboost as xgb\\\\nimport seaborn as sns\\\\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\\\\n%matplotlib inline\\\\n\\\\nimport plotly.offline as py\\\\npy.init_notebook_mode(connected=True)\\\\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\\\\nimport plotly.tools as tls\\\\n\\\\nimport warnings\\\\nwarnings.filterwarnings(\\'ignore\\')\\\\n\\\\n# Going to use these 5 base models for the stacking\\\\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import (RandomForestClassifier, AdaBoostClassifier, \\\\n                              GradientBoostingClassifier, ExtraTreesClassifier)\\\\nfrom sklearn.svm import SVC\\\\nfrom sklearn.cross_validation import KFold\",\"execution_count\":1,\"outputs\":[]},{\"metadata\":{\"_uuid\":\"8b590aafe06a2ac55daae9d2456155e457914f5f\",\"_cell_guid\":\"d647b74c-099b-851a-dcd2-3a58c9e8f10c\"},\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"source\":\"# Feature Exploration, Engineering and Cleaning \\\\n\\\\nNow we will proceed much like how most kernels in general are structured, and that is to first explore the data on hand, identify possible feature engineering opportunities as well as numerically encode any categorical features.\"},{\"metadata\":{\"_execution_state\":\"idle\",\"_cell_guid\":\"5937fd72-d1ad-f678-cc82-f08a96e4cad0\",\"_uuid\":\"b2ad78041b69ce13d1f41bd9bc8c93cafaf7b8ac\",\"trusted\":true},\"cell_type\":\"code\",\"source\":\"# Load in the train and test datasets\\\\ntrain = pd.read_csv(\\'../input/train.csv\\')\\\\ntest = pd.read_csv(\\'../input/test.csv\\')\\\\n\\\\n# Store our passenger ID for easy access\\\\nPassengerId = test[\\'PassengerId\\']\\\\n\\\\ntrain.head(3)\",\"execution_count\":2,\"outputs\":[]},{\"metadata\":{\"_uuid\":\"81378834770e55c76751347588322fe32acf5737\",\"_cell_guid\":\"dff1c1dd-1e59-3907-88fa-1a1d699122be\"},\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"source\":\"Well it is no surprise that our task is to somehow extract the information out of the categorical variables \\\\n\\\\n**Feature Engineering**\\\\n\\\\nHere, credit must be extended to Sina\\'s very comprehensive and well-thought out notebook for the feature engineering ideas so please check out his work \\\\n\\\\n[Titanic Best Working Classfier][1] : by Sina\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n  [1]: https://www.kaggle.com/sinakhorami/titanic/titanic-best-working-classifier\"},{\"metadata\":{\"collapsed\":true,\"_execution_state\":\"idle\",\"_cell_guid\":\"e85b2a80-88a4-928f-f2b2-24895dea38f3\",\"_uuid\":\"b1c67249f91768ce8e5e2751364d32c87446cf55\",\"trusted\":true},\"cell_type\":\"code\",\"source\":\"full_data = [train, test]\\\\n\\\\n# Some features of my own that I have added in\\\\n# Gives the length of the name\\\\ntrain[\\'Name_length\\'] = train[\\'Name\\'].apply(len)\\\\ntest[\\'Name_length\\'] = test[\\'Name\\'].apply(len)\\\\n# Feature that tells whether a passenger had a cabin on the Titanic\\\\ntrain[\\'Has_Cabin\\'] = train[\\\\\"Cabin\\\\\"].apply(lambda x: 0 if type(x) == float else 1)\\\\ntest[\\'Has_Cabin\\'] = test[\\\\\"Cabin\\\\\"].apply(lambda x: 0 if type(x) == float else 1)\\\\n\\\\n# Feature engineering steps taken from Sina\\\\n# Create new feature FamilySize as a combination of SibSp and Parch\\\\nfor dataset in full_data:\\\\n    dataset[\\'FamilySize\\'] = dataset[\\'SibSp\\'] + dataset[\\'Parch\\'] + 1\\\\n# Create new feature IsAlone from FamilySize\\\\nfor dataset in full_data:\\\\n    dataset[\\'IsAlone\\'] = 0\\\\n    dataset.loc[dataset[\\'FamilySize\\'] == 1, \\'IsAlone\\'] = 1\\\\n# Remove all NULLS in the Embarked column\\\\nfor dataset in full_data:\\\\n    dataset[\\'Embarked\\'] = dataset[\\'Embarked\\'].fillna(\\'S\\')\\\\n# Remove all NULLS in the Fare column and create a new feature CategoricalFare\\\\nfor dataset in full_data:\\\\n    dataset[\\'Fare\\'] = dataset[\\'Fare\\'].fillna(train[\\'Fare\\'].median())\\\\ntrain[\\'CategoricalFare\\'] = pd.qcut(train[\\'Fare\\'], 4)\\\\n# Create a New feature CategoricalAge\\\\nfor dataset in full_data:\\\\n    age_avg = dataset[\\'Age\\'].mean()\\\\n    age_std = dataset[\\'Age\\'].std()\\\\n    age_null_count = dataset[\\'Age\\'].isnull().sum()\\\\n    age_null_random_list = np.random.randint(age_avg -

However many will skip some of the explanation on how the solution is developed as these notebooks are developed by experts for experts. The objective of this notebook is to follow a step-by-step workflow, explaining each step and rationale for every decision we take during solution development.\\\\n\\\\n## Workflow stages\\\\n\\\\nThe competition solution workflow goes through seven stages described in the Data Science Solutions book.\\\\n\\\\n1. Question or problem definition.\\\\n2. Acquire training and testing data.\\\\n3. Wrangle, prepare, cleanse the data.\\\\n4. Analyze, identify patterns, and explore the data.\\\\n5. Model, predict and solve the problem.\\\\n6. Visualize, report, and present the problem solving steps and final solution.\\\\n7. Supply or submit the results.\\\\n\\\\nThe workflow indicates general sequence of how each stage may follow the other. However there are use cases with exceptions.\\\\n\\\\n- We may combine mulitple workflow stages. We may analyze by visualizing data.\\\\n- Perform a stage earlier than indicated. We may analyze data before and after wrangling.\\\\n- Perform a stage multiple times in our workflow. Visualize stage may be used multiple times.\\\\n- Drop a stage altogether. We may not need supply stage to productize or service enable our dataset for a competition.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Question and problem definition\\\\n\\\\nCompetition sites like Kaggle define the problem to solve or questions to ask while providing the datasets for training your data science model and testing the model results against a test dataset. The question or problem definition for Titanic Survival competition is [described here at Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).\\\\n\\\\n> Knowing from a training set of samples listing passengers who survived or did not survive the Titanic disaster, can our model determine based on a given test dataset not containing the survival information, if these passengers in the test dataset survived or not.\\\\n\\\\nWe may also want to develop some early understanding about the domain of our problem. This is described on the [Kaggle competition description page here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). Here are the highlights to note.\\\\n\\\\n- On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. Translated 32% survival rate.\\\\n- One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew.\\\\n- Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.\\\\n\\\\n## Workflow goals\\\\n\\\\nThe data science solutions workflow solves for seven major goals.\\\\n\\\\n**Classifying.** We may want to classify or categorize our samples. We may also want to understand the implications or correlation of different classes with our solution goal.\\\\n\\\\n**Correlating.** One can approach the problem based on available features within the training dataset. Which features within the dataset contribute significantly to our solution goal? Statistically speaking is there a [correlation](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Correlation) among a feature and solution goal? As the feature values change does the solution state change as well, and visa-versa? This can be tested both for numerical and categorical features in the given dataset. We may also want to determine correlation among features other than survival for subsequent goals and workflow stages. Correlating certain features may help in creating, completing, or correcting features.\\\\n\\\\n**Converting.** For modeling stage, one needs to prepare the data. Depending on the choice of model algorithm one may require all features to be converted to numerical equivalent values. So for instance converting text categorical values to numeric values.\\\\n\\\\n**Completing.** Data preparation may also require us to estimate any missing values within a feature. Model algorithms may work best when there are no missing values.\\\\n\\\\n**Correcting.** We may also analyze the given training dataset for errors or possibly innacurate values within features and try to corrent these values or exclude the samples containing the errors. One way to do this is to detect any outliers among our samples or features. We may also completely discard a feature if it is not contribting to the analysis or may significantly skew the results.\\\\n\\\\n**Creating.** Can we create new features based on an existing feature or a set of features, such that the new feature follows the correlation, conversion, completeness goals.\\\\n\\\\n**Charting.** How to select the right visualization plots and charts depending on nature of the data and the solution goals.\"},{\"metadata\":{\"_uuid\":\"960f8b1937dc4915ce1eb0f82614b1985c4321a4\",\"_cell_guid\":\"56a3be4e-76ef-20c6-25e8-da16147cf6d7\"},\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"source\":\"## Refactor Release 2017-Jan-29\\\\n\\\\nWe are significantly refactoring the notebook based on (a) comments received by readers, (b) issues in porting notebook from Jupyter kernel (2.7) to Kaggle kernel (3.5), and (c) review of few more best practice kernels.\\\\n\\\\n### User comments\\\\n\\\\n- Combine training and test data for certain operations like converting titles across dataset to numerical values.

We've got channels for competitions, job postings and career discussions, resources, and socializing with your fellow data scientists. Follow the link here:** https://discord.gg/kaggle\n\nThe competition is simple: use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.\n\nRead on or watch the video below to explore more details. Once you’re ready to start competing, click on the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/account/login?returnUrl=%2Fc%2Ftitanic\" target=\"_blank\">\"Join Competition button</a> to create an account and gain access to the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data\" target=\"_blank\">competition data</a>. Then check out <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/titanic-tutorial\">Alexis Cook’s Titanic Tutorial</a> that walks you through step by step how to make your first submission!\n\n<iframe width=\"699\" height=\"368\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8yZMXCaFshs\" title=\"YouTube video | How to Get Started with Kaggle’s Titanic Competition | Kaggle\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n## The Challenge\nThe sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.\n\nOn April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.\n\nWhile there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.\n\nIn this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).\n\n> #### Recommended Tutorial\n> We highly recommend [Alexis Cook’s Titanic Tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/titanic-tutorial) that walks you through making your very first submission step by step and [this starter notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/gusthema/titanic-competition-w-tensorflow-decision-forests) to get started.\n\n## How Kaggle’s Competitions Work\n1. **Join the Competition**\nRead about the challenge description, accept the Competition Rules and gain access to the competition dataset.\n1.  **Get to Work**\nDownload the data, build models on it locally or on Kaggle Notebooks (our no-setup, customizable Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs) and generate a prediction file.\n1.  **Make a Submission**\nUpload your prediction as a submission on Kaggle and receive an accuracy score.\n1.  **Check the Leaderboard**\nSee how your model ranks against other Kagglers on our leaderboard. \n1.  **Improve Your Score**\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a> to find lots of tutorials and insights from other competitors.\n\n> #### Kaggle Lingo Video\n> You may run into unfamiliar lingo as you dig into the Kaggle discussion forums and public notebooks. Check out  Dr. Rachael Tatman’s [video on Kaggle Lingo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEJHyuWKd-s) to get up to speed!\n\n## What Data Will I Use in This Competition?\nIn this competition, you’ll gain access to two similar datasets that include passenger information like name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc. One dataset is titled `train.csv` and the other is titled `test.csv`.\n\n`Train.csv` will contain the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 to be exact) and importantly, will reveal whether they survived or not, also known as the “ground truth”.\n\nThe `test.csv` dataset contains similar information but does not disclose the “ground truth” for each passenger. It’s your job to predict these outcomes.\n\nUsing the patterns you find in the `train.csv` data, predict whether the other 418 passengers on board (found in `test.csv`) survived.\n\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data\">“Data” tab</a> to explore the datasets even further. Once you feel you’ve created a competitive model, submit it to Kaggle to see where your model stands on our leaderboard against other Kagglers.\n\n## How to Submit your Prediction to Kaggle\nOnce you’re ready to make a submission and get on the leaderboard:\n\n1. Click on the “Submit Predictions” button\n<img width=\"699\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen1.png\">\n1. Upload a CSV file in the submission file format. You’re able to submit 10 submissions a day.\n<img width=\"699\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen2.png\">\n\n## Submission File Format:\nYou should submit a csv file with exactly 418 entries plus a header row. Your submission will show an error if you have extra columns (beyond `PassengerId` and `Survived`) or rows.\n\nThe file should have exactly 2 columns:\n- `PassengerId` (sorted in any order)\n- `Survived` (contains your binary predictions: 1 for survived, 0 for deceased)\n\n## Got it! I’m ready to get started. Where do I get help if I need it?\n- For Competition Help: <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\">Titanic Discussion Forum</a>\n\nKaggle doesn’t have a dedicated team to help troubleshoot your code so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. The forums are full of useful information on the data, metric, and different approaches. We encourage you to use the forums often. If you share your knowledge, you'll find that others will share a lot in turn!\n\n## A Last Word on Kaggle Notebooks\nAs we mentioned before, Kaggle Notebooks is our no-setup, customizable, Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs and a huge repository of community published data &amp; code.\n\nIn every competition, you’ll find many Notebooks shared with incredible insights. It’s an invaluable resource worth becoming familiar with. Check out this competition’s Notebooks <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/notebooks\">here</a>.\n\n## 🏃‍♀Ready to Compete? <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/account/login?returnUrl=%2Fc%2Ftitanic\">Join the Competition Here!</a>\n\n## Evaluation\n\n<h2>Goal</h2>\n<p>It is your job to predict if a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic or not. <br>For each  in the test set, you must predict a 0 or 1 value for the  variable.</p>\n<h2>Metric</h2>\n<p>Your score is the percentage of passengers you correctly predict.

They are a great place to begin if you are new to data science or just finished a MOOC and want to get involved in Kaggle.</p>\n<p>Getting Started competitions are a non-competitive way to get familiar with Kaggle’s platform, learn basic machine learning concepts, and start meeting people in the community. They have no cash prize and are on a rolling timeline.</p>\n<h2>How do I create and manage a team?</h2>\n<p>When you accept the competition rules, a team will be created for you. You can invite others to your team, accept a merger with another team, and update basic information like team name by going to the More &gt; <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/team\" target=\"_blank\">Team</a> page.</p>\n<p>We've heard from many Kagglers that teaming up is the best way to learn new skills AND have fun. If you don't have a teammate already, consider asking if anyone wants to team up in the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a>.</p>\n<h2>What are Notebooks?</h2>\n<p>Kaggle Notebooks is a cloud computational environment that enables reproducible and collaborative analysis. Notebooks support scripts in Python and R, Jupyter Notebooks, and RMarkdown reports. You can visit the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/notebooks\" target=\"_blank\">Notebooks</a> tab to view all of the publicly shared code for the Titanic competition. For more on how to use Notebooks to learn data science, check out our <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview\" target=\"&quot;_blank\">Courses</a>!</p>\n<h2>Why did my team disappear from the leaderboard?</h2>\n<p>To keep with the spirit of getting-started competitions, we have implemented a two month rolling window on submissions. Once a submission is more than two months old, it will be invalidated and no longer count towards the leaderboard.</p>\n<p>If your team has no submissions in the previous two months, the team will also drop from the leaderboard. This will keep the leaderboard at a manageable size, freshen it up, and prevent newcomers from getting lost in a sea of abandoned scores.</p>\n<p><i>\"I worked so hard to get that score! Give it back!\"</i> Read more about our decision to implement a rolling leaderboard <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion/6240\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n<h2>How do I contact Support?</h2>\n<p>Kaggle does not have a dedicated support team so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. (For this competition, you’ll want to use the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">Titanic discussion forum)</a>.</p>\n<p>Support is only able to help with issues that are being experienced by all participants. Before contacting support, please check the discussion forum for information on your problem. If you can’t find it, you can post your problem in the forum so a fellow participant or a Kaggle team member can provide help. The forums are full of useful information on the data, metric, and different approaches. We encourage you to use the forums often. If you share your knowledge, you'll find that others will share a lot in turn!</p>\n<p>If your problem persists or it seems to be effective all participants then please <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/contact\" target=\"_blank\">contact us</a>.</p>\ntool: Not a directory: /home/code/exploration/../research/writeups\ntool: /home/code/exploration/../research/kernels:\n[DIR]  alexisbcook_exercise-arithmetic-and-variables/\n[DIR]  alexisbcook_titanic-tutorial/\n[DIR]  arthurtok_introduction-to-ensembling-stacking-in-python/\n[DIR]  ldfreeman3_a-data-science-framework-to-achieve-99-accuracy/\n[FILE] metadata.json (1.7KB)\n[DIR]  startupsci_titanic-data-science-solutions/\ntool: /home/data:\n[FILE] description.md (13.6KB)\n[FILE] gender_submission.csv (3.2KB)\n[FILE] test.csv (28.0KB)\n[FILE] train.csv (59.8KB)\ntool: Error: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/home/code/exploration/../research/kernels/ldfreeman3_a-data-science-framework-to-achieve-99-accuracy/ldfreeman3_a-data-science-framework-to-achieve-99-accuracy.py'\ntool: Error: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/home/code/exploration/../research/kernels/arthurtok_introduction-to-ensembling-stacking-in-python/arthurtok_introduction-to-ensembling-stacking-in-python.py'\ntool: /home/code/exploration/../research/kernels/ldfreeman3_a-data-science-framework-to-achieve-99-accuracy:\n[FILE] a-data-science-framework-to-achieve-99-accuracy.ipynb (107.1KB)\n[FILE] kernel-metadata.json (732.0B)\ntool: /home/code/exploration/../research/kernels/arthurtok_introduction-to-ensembling-stacking-in-python:\n[FILE] introduction-to-ensembling-stacking-in-python.ipynb (39.3KB)\n[FILE] kernel-metadata.json (687.0B)\ntool: /home/code/exploration/../research/kernels/startupsci_titanic-data-science-solutions:\n[FILE] kernel-metadata.json (661.0B)\n[FILE] titanic-data-science-solutions.ipynb (55.5KB)\ntool: {\"cells\":[{\"source\":\"\\n>Hello and Welcome to Kaggle, the online Data Science Community to learn, share, and compete.

In laymen terms this means, it either occurred or did not occur. For example, you won or did not win, you passed the test or did not pass the test, you were accepted or not accepted, and you get the point. A common business application is churn or customer retention. Another popular use case is, healthcare's mortality rate or survival analysis. Binary events create an interesting dynamic, because we know statistically, a random guess should achieve a 50% accuracy rate, without creating one single algorithm or writing one single line of code. However, just like autocorrect spellcheck technology, sometimes we humans can be too smart for our own good and actually underperform a coin flip. In this kernel, I use Kaggle's Getting Started Competition, Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster, to walk the reader through, how-to use the data science framework to beat the odds.\\n   \\n*What happens when technology is too smart for its own good?*\\n![Funny Autocorrect](http://15858-presscdn-0-65.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/hilarious-autocorrect-fails-20x.jpg)\",\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"metadata\":{\"_cell_guid\":\"ec31d549-537e-4f35-8594-22ef03079081\",\"_uuid\":\"ff6c70c884a8a5fb3258e7f3fefc9e55261df1df\"}},{\"source\":\"<a id=\\\"ch2\\\"></a>\\n# A Data Science Framework\\n1. **Define the Problem:** If data science, big data, machine learning, predictive analytics, business intelligence, or any other buzzword is the solution, then what is the problem? As the saying goes, don't put the cart before the horse. Problems before requirements, requirements before solutions, solutions before design, and design before technology. Too often we are quick to jump on the new shiny technology, tool, or algorithm before determining the actual problem we are trying to solve.\\n2. **Gather the Data:** John Naisbitt wrote in his 1984 (yes, 1984) book Megatrends, we are “drowning in data, yet staving for knowledge.\\\" So, chances are, the dataset(s) already exist somewhere, in some format. It may be external or internal, structured or unstructured, static or streamed, objective or subjective, etc. As the saying goes, you don't have to reinvent the wheel, you just have to know where to find it. In the next step, we will worry about transforming \\\"dirty data\\\" to \\\"clean data.\\\"\\n3. **Prepare Data for Consumption:** This step is often referred to as data wrangling, a required process to turn “wild” data into “manageable” data. Data wrangling includes implementing data architectures for storage and processing, developing data governance standards for quality and control, data extraction (i.e. ETL and web scraping), and data cleaning to identify aberrant, missing, or outlier data points.\\n4. **Perform Exploratory Analysis:** Anybody who has ever worked with data knows, garbage-in, garbage-out (GIGO). Therefore, it is important to deploy descriptive and graphical statistics to look for potential problems, patterns, classifications, correlations and comparisons in the dataset. In addition, data categorization (i.e. qualitative vs quantitative) is also important to understand and select the correct hypothesis test or data model.\\n5. **Model Data:** Like descriptive and inferential statistics, data modeling can either summarize the data or predict future outcomes. Your dataset and expected results, will determine the algorithms available for use. It's important to remember, algorithms are tools and not magical wands or silver bullets. You must still be the master craft (wo)man that knows how-to select the right tool for the job. An analogy would be asking someone to hand you a Philip screwdriver, and they hand you a flathead screwdriver or worst a hammer. At best, it shows a complete lack of understanding. At worst, it makes completing the project impossible. The same is true in data modelling. The wrong model can lead to poor performance at best and the wrong conclusion (that’s used as actionable intelligence) at worst.\\n6. **Validate and Implement Data Model:** After you've trained your model based on a subset of your data, it's time to test your model. This helps ensure you haven't overfit your model or made it so specific to the selected subset, that it does not accurately fit another subset from the same dataset. In this step we determine if our [model overfit, generalize, or underfit our dataset](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/latest/dg/model-fit-underfitting-vs-overfitting.html).\\n7. **Optimize and Strategize:** This is the \\\"bionic man\\\" step, where you iterate back through the process to make it better...stronger...faster than it was before. As a data scientist, your strategy should be to outsource developer operations and application plumbing, so you have more time to focus on recommendations and design. Once you're able to package your ideas, this becomes your “currency exchange\\\" rate.\",\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"metadata\":{\"_cell_guid\":\"8514a868-6816-494a-9e9c-dba14cb36f42\",\"_uuid\":\"bd2a68dcaace0c1371f2994f0204dce65800cc20\"}},{\"source\":\"<a id=\\\"ch3\\\"></a>\\n# Step 1: Define the Problem\\nFor this project, the problem statement is given to us on a golden plater, develop an algorithm to predict the survival outcome of passengers on the Titanic.\\n\\n......\\n\\n**Project Summary:**\\nThe sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.\\n\\nOne of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.\\n\\nIn this challenge, we ask you to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular, we ask you to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.\\n\\nPractice Skills\\n* Binary classification\\n* Python and R basics\\n\\n# Step 2: Gather the Data\\n\\nThe dataset is also given to us on a golden plater with test and train data at [Kaggle's Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)\\n\",\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"metadata\":{\"_cell_guid\":\"22ba49b5-b3b6-4129-8c57-623e0d863ab3\",\"_uuid\":\"ff014109d795c5d1bfcc66c9761730406124ebe4\"}},{\"source\":\"<a id=\\\"ch4\\\"></a>\\n# Step 3: Prepare Data for Consumption\\nSince step 2 was provided to us on a golden plater, so is step 3.

Using the same dataset and different implementation of a decision tree (adaboost, random forest, gradient boost, xgboost, etc.) with tuning does not exceed the 0.77990 submission accuracy. Interesting for this dataset, the simple decision tree algorithm had the best default submission score and with tuning achieved the same best accuracy score.\\n\\nWhile no general conclusions can be made from testing a handful of algorithms on a single dataset, there are several observations on the mentioned dataset. \\n1. The train dataset has a different distribution than the test/validation dataset and population. This created wide margins between the cross validation (CV) accuracy score and Kaggle submission accuracy score.\\n2. Given the same dataset, decision tree based algorithms, seemed to converge on the same accuracy score after proper tuning.\\n3. Despite tuning, no machine learning algorithm, exceeded the homemade algorithm. The author will theorize, that for small datasets, a manmade algorithm is the bar to beat. \\n\\nWith that in mind, for iteration two, I would spend more time on preprocessing and feature engineering. In order to better align the CV score and Kaggle score and improve the overall accuracy.\\n\\n\",\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"metadata\":{\"_cell_guid\":\"a6d34edc-1265-41e8-b163-0b817cd3b6a5\",\"_uuid\":\"c476df95925d67809975caca4ea4dcb4b2a0b277\"}},{\"source\":\"<a id=\\\"ch90\\\"></a>\\n## Change Log:\\n11/22/17 Please note, this kernel is currently in progress, but open to feedback.

In a nutshell stacking uses as a first-level (base), the predictions of a few basic classifiers and then uses another model at the second-level to predict the output from the earlier first-level predictions.\\n\\nThe Titanic dataset is a prime candidate for introducing this concept as many newcomers to Kaggle start out here. Furthermore even though stacking has been responsible for many a team winning Kaggle competitions there seems to be a dearth of kernels on this topic so I hope this notebook can fill somewhat of that void.\\n\\nI myself am quite a newcomer to the Kaggle scene as well and the first proper ensembling/stacking script that I managed to chance upon and study was one written in the AllState Severity Claims competition by the great Faron. The material in this notebook borrows heavily from Faron's script although ported to factor in ensembles of classifiers whilst his was ensembles of regressors. Anyway please check out his script here:\\n\\n[Stacking Starter][1] : by Faron \\n\\n\\nNow onto the notebook at hand and I hope that it manages to do justice and convey the concept of ensembling in an intuitive and concise manner.  My other standalone Kaggle [script][2] which implements exactly the same ensembling steps (albeit with different parameters) discussed below gives a Public LB score of 0.808 which is good enough to get to the top 9% and runs just under 4 minutes.

However many will skip some of the explanation on how the solution is developed as these notebooks are developed by experts for experts. The objective of this notebook is to follow a step-by-step workflow, explaining each step and rationale for every decision we take during solution development.\\n\\n## Workflow stages\\n\\nThe competition solution workflow goes through seven stages described in the Data Science Solutions book.\\n\\n1. Question or problem definition.\\n2. Acquire training and testing data.\\n3. Wrangle, prepare, cleanse the data.\\n4. Analyze, identify patterns, and explore the data.\\n5. Model, predict and solve the problem.\\n6. Visualize, report, and present the problem solving steps and final solution.\\n7. Supply or submit the results.\\n\\nThe workflow indicates general sequence of how each stage may follow the other. However there are use cases with exceptions.\\n\\n- We may combine mulitple workflow stages. We may analyze by visualizing data.\\n- Perform a stage earlier than indicated. We may analyze data before and after wrangling.\\n- Perform a stage multiple times in our workflow. Visualize stage may be used multiple times.\\n- Drop a stage altogether. We may not need supply stage to productize or service enable our dataset for a competition.\\n\\n\\n## Question and problem definition\\n\\nCompetition sites like Kaggle define the problem to solve or questions to ask while providing the datasets for training your data science model and testing the model results against a test dataset. The question or problem definition for Titanic Survival competition is [described here at Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).\\n\\n> Knowing from a training set of samples listing passengers who survived or did not survive the Titanic disaster, can our model determine based on a given test dataset not containing the survival information, if these passengers in the test dataset survived or not.\\n\\nWe may also want to develop some early understanding about the domain of our problem. This is described on the [Kaggle competition description page here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). Here are the highlights to note.\\n\\n- On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. Translated 32% survival rate.\\n- One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew.\\n- Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.\\n\\n## Workflow goals\\n\\nThe data science solutions workflow solves for seven major goals.\\n\\n**Classifying.** We may want to classify or categorize our samples. We may also want to understand the implications or correlation of different classes with our solution goal.\\n\\n**Correlating.** One can approach the problem based on available features within the training dataset. Which features within the dataset contribute significantly to our solution goal? Statistically speaking is there a [correlation](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Correlation) among a feature and solution goal? As the feature values change does the solution state change as well, and visa-versa? This can be tested both for numerical and categorical features in the given dataset. We may also want to determine correlation among features other than survival for subsequent goals and workflow stages. Correlating certain features may help in creating, completing, or correcting features.\\n\\n**Converting.** For modeling stage, one needs to prepare the data. Depending on the choice of model algorithm one may require all features to be converted to numerical equivalent values. So for instance converting text categorical values to numeric values.\\n\\n**Completing.** Data preparation may also require us to estimate any missing values within a feature. Model algorithms may work best when there are no missing values.\\n\\n**Correcting.** We may also analyze the given training dataset for errors or possibly innacurate values within features and try to corrent these values or exclude the samples containing the errors. One way to do this is to detect any outliers among our samples or features. We may also completely discard a feature if it is not contribting to the analysis or may significantly skew the results.\\n\\n**Creating.** Can we create new features based on an existing feature or a set of features, such that the new feature follows the correlation, conversion, completeness goals.\\n\\n**Charting.** How to select the right visualization plots and charts depending on nature of the data and the solution goals.\"},{\"metadata\":{\"_uuid\":\"960f8b1937dc4915ce1eb0f82614b1985c4321a4\",\"_cell_guid\":\"56a3be4e-76ef-20c6-25e8-da16147cf6d7\"},\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"source\":\"## Refactor Release 2017-Jan-29\\n\\nWe are significantly refactoring the notebook based on (a) comments received by readers, (b) issues in porting notebook from Jupyter kernel (2.7) to Kaggle kernel (3.5), and (c) review of few more best practice kernels.\\n\\n### User comments\\n\\n- Combine training and test data for certain operations like converting titles across dataset to numerical values.

Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.\\n\\nWhile there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.\\n\\nIn this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).\\n\\n> #### Recommended Tutorial\\n> We highly recommend [Alexis Cook’s Titanic Tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/titanic-tutorial) that walks you through making your very first submission step by step and [this starter notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/gusthema/titanic-competition-w-tensorflow-decision-forests) to get started.\\n\\n## How Kaggle’s Competitions Work\\n1. **Join the Competition**\\nRead about the challenge description, accept the Competition Rules and gain access to the competition dataset.\\n1.  **Get to Work**\\nDownload the data, build models on it locally or on Kaggle Notebooks (our no-setup, customizable Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs) and generate a prediction file.\\n1.  **Make a Submission**\\nUpload your prediction as a submission on Kaggle and receive an accuracy score.\\n1.  **Check the Leaderboard**\\nSee how your model ranks against other Kagglers on our leaderboard. \\n1.  **Improve Your Score**\\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a> to find lots of tutorials and insights from other competitors.\\n\\n> #### Kaggle Lingo Video\\n> You may run into unfamiliar lingo as you dig into the Kaggle discussion forums and public notebooks. Check out  Dr. Rachael Tatman’s [video on Kaggle Lingo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEJHyuWKd-s) to get up to speed!\\n\\n## What Data Will I Use in This Competition?\\nIn this competition, you’ll gain access to two similar datasets that include passenger information like name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc. One dataset is titled `train.csv` and the other is titled `test.csv`.\\n\\n`Train.csv` will contain the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 to be exact) and importantly, will reveal whether they survived or not, also known as the “ground truth”.\\n\\nThe `test.csv` dataset contains similar information but does not disclose the “ground truth” for each passenger. It’s your job to predict these outcomes.\\n\\nUsing the patterns you find in the `train.csv` data, predict whether the other 418 passengers on board (found in `test.csv`) survived.\\n\\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data\">“Data” tab</a> to explore the datasets even further. Once you feel you’ve created a competitive model, submit it to Kaggle to see where your model stands on our leaderboard against other Kagglers.\\n\\n## How to Submit your Prediction to Kaggle\\nOnce you’re ready to make a submission and get on the leaderboard:\\n\\n1. Click on the “Submit Predictions” button\\n<img width=\"699\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen1.png\">\\n1. Upload a CSV file in the submission file format. You’re able to submit 10 submissions a day.\\n<img width=\"699\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen2.png\">\\n\\n## Submission File Format:\\nYou should submit a csv file with exactly 418 entries plus a header row. Your submission will show an error if you have extra columns (beyond `PassengerId` and `Survived`) or rows.\\n\\nThe file should have exactly 2 columns:\\n- `PassengerId` (sorted in any order)\\n- `Survived` (contains your binary predictions: 1 for survived, 0 for deceased)\\n\\n## Got it! I’m ready to get started. Where do I get help if I need it?\\n- For Competition Help: <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\">Titanic Discussion Forum</a>\\n\\nKaggle doesn’t have a dedicated team to help troubleshoot your code so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. The forums are full of useful information on the data, metric, and different approaches. We encourage you to use the forums often. If you share your knowledge, you\\'ll find that others will share a lot in turn!\\n\\n## A Last Word on Kaggle Notebooks\\nAs we mentioned before, Kaggle Notebooks is our no-setup, customizable, Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs and a huge repository of community published data &amp; code.\\n\\nIn every competition, you’ll find many Notebooks shared with incredible insights. It’s an invaluable resource worth becoming familiar with. Check out this competition’s Notebooks <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/notebooks\">here</a>.\\n\\n## 🏃\\u200d♀Ready to Compete? <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/account/login?returnUrl=%2Fc%2Ftitanic\">Join the Competition Here!</a>\\n\\n## Evaluation\\n\\n<h2>Goal</h2>\\n<p>It is your job to predict if a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic or not. <br>For each  in the test set, you must predict a 0 or 1 value for the  variable.</p>\\n<h2>Metric</h2>\\n<p>Your score is the percentage of passengers you correctly predict.

They are a great place to begin if you are new to data science or just finished a MOOC and want to get involved in Kaggle.</p>\\n<p>Getting Started competitions are a non-competitive way to get familiar with Kaggle’s platform, learn basic machine learning concepts, and start meeting people in the community. They have no cash prize and are on a rolling timeline.</p>\\n<h2>How do I create and manage a team?</h2>\\n<p>When you accept the competition rules, a team will be created for you. You can invite others to your team, accept a merger with another team, and update basic information like team name by going to the More &gt; <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/team\" target=\"_blank\">Team</a> page.</p>\\n<p>We\\'ve heard from many Kagglers that teaming up is the best way to learn new skills AND have fun. If you don\\'t have a teammate already, consider asking if anyone wants to team up in the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a>.</p>\\n<h2>What are Notebooks?</h2>\\n<p>Kaggle Notebooks is a cloud computational environment that enables reproducible and collaborative analysis. Notebooks support scripts in Python and R, Jupyter Notebooks, and RMarkdown reports. You can visit the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/notebooks\" target=\"_blank\">Notebooks</a> tab to view all of the publicly shared code for the Titanic competition. For more on how to use Notebooks to learn data science, check out our <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview\" target=\"&quot;_blank\">Courses</a>!</p>\\n<h2>Why did my team disappear from the leaderboard?</h2>\\n<p>To keep with the spirit of getting-started competitions, we have implemented a two month rolling window on submissions. Once a submission is more than two months old, it will be invalidated and no longer count towards the leaderboard.</p>\\n<p>If your team has no submissions in the previous two months, the team will also drop from the leaderboard. This will keep the leaderboard at a manageable size, freshen it up, and prevent newcomers from getting lost in a sea of abandoned scores.</p>\\n<p><i>\"I worked so hard to get that score! Give it back!\"</i> Read more about our decision to implement a rolling leaderboard <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion/6240\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\\n<h2>How do I contact Support?</h2>\\n<p>Kaggle does not have a dedicated support team so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. (For this competition, you’ll want to use the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">Titanic discussion forum)</a>.</p>\\n<p>Support is only able to help with issues that are being experienced by all participants. Before contacting support, please check the discussion forum for information on your problem. If you can’t find it, you can post your problem in the forum so a fellow participant or a Kaggle team member can provide help. The forums are full of useful information on the data, metric, and different approaches. We encourage you to use the forums often. If you share your knowledge, you\\'ll find that others will share a lot in turn!</p>\\n<p>If your problem persists or it seems to be effective all participants then please <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/contact\" target=\"_blank\">contact us</a>.</p>'}, {'role': 'tool', 'content': 'Not a directory: /home/code/exploration/../research/writeups'}, {'role': 'tool', 'content': '/home/code/exploration/../research/kernels:\\n[DIR]  alexisbcook_exercise-arithmetic-and-variables/\\n[DIR]  alexisbcook_titanic-tutorial/\\n[DIR]  arthurtok_introduction-to-ensembling-stacking-in-python/\\n[DIR]  ldfreeman3_a-data-science-framework-to-achieve-99-accuracy/\\n[FILE] metadata.json (1.7KB)\\n[DIR]  startupsci_titanic-data-science-solutions/'}, {'role': 'tool', 'content': '/home/data:\\n[FILE] description.md (13.6KB)\\n[FILE] gender_submission.csv (3.2KB)\\n[FILE] test.csv (28.0KB)\\n[FILE] train.csv (59.8KB)'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': \"REASONING: This is the classic Titanic survival prediction problem - binary classification with accuracy as the metric.

In laymen terms this means, it either occurred or did not occur. For example, you won or did not win, you passed the test or did not pass the test, you were accepted or not accepted, and you get the point. A common business application is churn or customer retention. Another popular use case is, healthcare\\'s mortality rate or survival analysis. Binary events create an interesting dynamic, because we know statistically, a random guess should achieve a 50% accuracy rate, without creating one single algorithm or writing one single line of code. However, just like autocorrect spellcheck technology, sometimes we humans can be too smart for our own good and actually underperform a coin flip. In this kernel, I use Kaggle\\'s Getting Started Competition, Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster, to walk the reader through, how-to use the data science framework to beat the odds.\\\\n   \\\\n*What happens when technology is too smart for its own good?*\\\\n![Funny Autocorrect](http://15858-presscdn-0-65.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/hilarious-autocorrect-fails-20x.jpg)\",\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"metadata\":{\"_cell_guid\":\"ec31d549-537e-4f35-8594-22ef03079081\",\"_uuid\":\"ff6c70c884a8a5fb3258e7f3fefc9e55261df1df\"}},{\"source\":\"<a id=\\\\\"ch2\\\\\"></a>\\\\n# A Data Science Framework\\\\n1. **Define the Problem:** If data science, big data, machine learning, predictive analytics, business intelligence, or any other buzzword is the solution, then what is the problem? As the saying goes, don\\'t put the cart before the horse. Problems before requirements, requirements before solutions, solutions before design, and design before technology. Too often we are quick to jump on the new shiny technology, tool, or algorithm before determining the actual problem we are trying to solve.\\\\n2. **Gather the Data:** John Naisbitt wrote in his 1984 (yes, 1984) book Megatrends, we are “drowning in data, yet staving for knowledge.\\\\\" So, chances are, the dataset(s) already exist somewhere, in some format. It may be external or internal, structured or unstructured, static or streamed, objective or subjective, etc. As the saying goes, you don\\'t have to reinvent the wheel, you just have to know where to find it. In the next step, we will worry about transforming \\\\\"dirty data\\\\\" to \\\\\"clean data.\\\\\"\\\\n3. **Prepare Data for Consumption:** This step is often referred to as data wrangling, a required process to turn “wild” data into “manageable” data. Data wrangling includes implementing data architectures for storage and processing, developing data governance standards for quality and control, data extraction (i.e. ETL and web scraping), and data cleaning to identify aberrant, missing, or outlier data points.\\\\n4. **Perform Exploratory Analysis:** Anybody who has ever worked with data knows, garbage-in, garbage-out (GIGO). Therefore, it is important to deploy descriptive and graphical statistics to look for potential problems, patterns, classifications, correlations and comparisons in the dataset. In addition, data categorization (i.e. qualitative vs quantitative) is also important to understand and select the correct hypothesis test or data model.\\\\n5. **Model Data:** Like descriptive and inferential statistics, data modeling can either summarize the data or predict future outcomes. Your dataset and expected results, will determine the algorithms available for use. It\\'s important to remember, algorithms are tools and not magical wands or silver bullets. You must still be the master craft (wo)man that knows how-to select the right tool for the job. An analogy would be asking someone to hand you a Philip screwdriver, and they hand you a flathead screwdriver or worst a hammer. At best, it shows a complete lack of understanding. At worst, it makes completing the project impossible. The same is true in data modelling. The wrong model can lead to poor performance at best and the wrong conclusion (that’s used as actionable intelligence) at worst.\\\\n6. **Validate and Implement Data Model:** After you\\'ve trained your model based on a subset of your data, it\\'s time to test your model. This helps ensure you haven\\'t overfit your model or made it so specific to the selected subset, that it does not accurately fit another subset from the same dataset. In this step we determine if our [model overfit, generalize, or underfit our dataset](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/latest/dg/model-fit-underfitting-vs-overfitting.html).\\\\n7. **Optimize and Strategize:** This is the \\\\\"bionic man\\\\\" step, where you iterate back through the process to make it better...stronger...faster than it was before. As a data scientist, your strategy should be to outsource developer operations and application plumbing, so you have more time to focus on recommendations and design. Once you\\'re able to package your ideas, this becomes your “currency exchange\\\\\" rate.\",\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"metadata\":{\"_cell_guid\":\"8514a868-6816-494a-9e9c-dba14cb36f42\",\"_uuid\":\"bd2a68dcaace0c1371f2994f0204dce65800cc20\"}},{\"source\":\"<a id=\\\\\"ch3\\\\\"></a>\\\\n# Step 1: Define the Problem\\\\nFor this project, the problem statement is given to us on a golden plater, develop an algorithm to predict the survival outcome of passengers on the Titanic.\\\\n\\\\n......\\\\n\\\\n**Project Summary:**\\\\nThe sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.

Using the same dataset and different implementation of a decision tree (adaboost, random forest, gradient boost, xgboost, etc.) with tuning does not exceed the 0.77990 submission accuracy. Interesting for this dataset, the simple decision tree algorithm had the best default submission score and with tuning achieved the same best accuracy score.\\\\n\\\\nWhile no general conclusions can be made from testing a handful of algorithms on a single dataset, there are several observations on the mentioned dataset. \\\\n1. The train dataset has a different distribution than the test/validation dataset and population. This created wide margins between the cross validation (CV) accuracy score and Kaggle submission accuracy score.\\\\n2. Given the same dataset, decision tree based algorithms, seemed to converge on the same accuracy score after proper tuning.\\\\n3. Despite tuning, no machine learning algorithm, exceeded the homemade algorithm. The author will theorize, that for small datasets, a manmade algorithm is the bar to beat. \\\\n\\\\nWith that in mind, for iteration two, I would spend more time on preprocessing and feature engineering. In order to better align the CV score and Kaggle score and improve the overall accuracy.\\\\n\\\\n\",\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"metadata\":{\"_cell_guid\":\"a6d34edc-1265-41e8-b163-0b817cd3b6a5\",\"_uuid\":\"c476df95925d67809975caca4ea4dcb4b2a0b277\"}},{\"source\":\"<a id=\\\\\"ch90\\\\\"></a>\\\\n## Change Log:\\\\n11/22/17 Please note, this kernel is currently in progress, but open to feedback.

In a nutshell stacking uses as a first-level (base), the predictions of a few basic classifiers and then uses another model at the second-level to predict the output from the earlier first-level predictions.\\\\n\\\\nThe Titanic dataset is a prime candidate for introducing this concept as many newcomers to Kaggle start out here. Furthermore even though stacking has been responsible for many a team winning Kaggle competitions there seems to be a dearth of kernels on this topic so I hope this notebook can fill somewhat of that void.\\\\n\\\\nI myself am quite a newcomer to the Kaggle scene as well and the first proper ensembling/stacking script that I managed to chance upon and study was one written in the AllState Severity Claims competition by the great Faron. The material in this notebook borrows heavily from Faron\\'s script although ported to factor in ensembles of classifiers whilst his was ensembles of regressors. Anyway please check out his script here:\\\\n\\\\n[Stacking Starter][1] : by Faron \\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNow onto the notebook at hand and I hope that it manages to do justice and convey the concept of ensembling in an intuitive and concise manner.  My other standalone Kaggle [script][2] which implements exactly the same ensembling steps (albeit with different parameters) discussed below gives a Public LB score of 0.808 which is good enough to get to the top 9% and runs just under 4 minutes. Therefore I am pretty sure there is a lot of room to improve and add on to that script.

The objective of this notebook is to follow a step-by-step workflow, explaining each step and rationale for every decision we take during solution development.\\\\n\\\\n## Workflow stages\\\\n\\\\nThe competition solution workflow goes through seven stages described in the Data Science Solutions book.\\\\n\\\\n1. Question or problem definition.\\\\n2. Acquire training and testing data.\\\\n3. Wrangle, prepare, cleanse the data.\\\\n4. Analyze, identify patterns, and explore the data.\\\\n5. Model, predict and solve the problem.\\\\n6. Visualize, report, and present the problem solving steps and final solution.\\\\n7. Supply or submit the results.\\\\n\\\\nThe workflow indicates general sequence of how each stage may follow the other. However there are use cases with exceptions.\\\\n\\\\n- We may combine mulitple workflow stages. We may analyze by visualizing data.\\\\n- Perform a stage earlier than indicated. We may analyze data before and after wrangling.\\\\n- Perform a stage multiple times in our workflow. Visualize stage may be used multiple times.\\\\n- Drop a stage altogether. We may not need supply stage to productize or service enable our dataset for a competition.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Question and problem definition\\\\n\\\\nCompetition sites like Kaggle define the problem to solve or questions to ask while providing the datasets for training your data science model and testing the model results against a test dataset. The question or problem definition for Titanic Survival competition is [described here at Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).\\\\n\\\\n> Knowing from a training set of samples listing passengers who survived or did not survive the Titanic disaster, can our model determine based on a given test dataset not containing the survival information, if these passengers in the test dataset survived or not.\\\\n\\\\nWe may also want to develop some early understanding about the domain of our problem. This is described on the [Kaggle competition description page here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). Here are the highlights to note.\\\\n\\\\n- On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. Translated 32% survival rate.\\\\n- One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew.\\\\n- Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.\\\\n\\\\n## Workflow goals\\\\n\\\\nThe data science solutions workflow solves for seven major goals.\\\\n\\\\n**Classifying.** We may want to classify or categorize our samples. We may also want to understand the implications or correlation of different classes with our solution goal.\\\\n\\\\n**Correlating.** One can approach the problem based on available features within the training dataset. Which features within the dataset contribute significantly to our solution goal? Statistically speaking is there a [correlation](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Correlation) among a feature and solution goal? As the feature values change does the solution state change as well, and visa-versa? This can be tested both for numerical and categorical features in the given dataset. We may also want to determine correlation among features other than survival for subsequent goals and workflow stages. Correlating certain features may help in creating, completing, or correcting features.\\\\n\\\\n**Converting.** For modeling stage, one needs to prepare the data. Depending on the choice of model algorithm one may require all features to be converted to numerical equivalent values. So for instance converting text categorical values to numeric values.\\\\n\\\\n**Completing.** Data preparation may also require us to estimate any missing values within a feature. Model algorithms may work best when there are no missing values.\\\\n\\\\n**Correcting.** We may also analyze the given training dataset for errors or possibly innacurate values within features and try to corrent these values or exclude the samples containing the errors. One way to do this is to detect any outliers among our samples or features. We may also completely discard a feature if it is not contribting to the analysis or may significantly skew the results.\\\\n\\\\n**Creating.** Can we create new features based on an existing feature or a set of features, such that the new feature follows the correlation, conversion, completeness goals.\\\\n\\\\n**Charting.** How to select the right visualization plots and charts depending on nature of the data and the solution goals.\"},{\"metadata\":{\"_uuid\":\"960f8b1937dc4915ce1eb0f82614b1985c4321a4\",\"_cell_guid\":\"56a3be4e-76ef-20c6-25e8-da16147cf6d7\"},\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"source\":\"## Refactor Release 2017-Jan-29\\\\n\\\\nWe are significantly refactoring the notebook based on (a) comments received by readers, (b) issues in porting notebook from Jupyter kernel (2.7) to Kaggle kernel (3.5), and (c) review of few more best practice kernels.\\\\n\\\\n### User comments\\\\n\\\\n- Combine training and test data for certain operations like converting titles across dataset to numerical values.

On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships\\n\\nOne of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.\\n\\n## Cross validation results\\n\\nAfter applying the appropriate preprocessing, each model was evaluated using 10-fold cross validation.

This study enhances Titanic survival prediction through advanced \\nfeature engineering and ensemble model optimization. The Titanic dataset \\npresents a classic binary classification problem requiring the prediction of \\npassenger survival based on demographic and ticket information. Our \\nmethodology employs systematic preprocessing where missing values are \\nintelligently imputed, including eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) \\npredictions for age values. Novel features were extracted from passenger \\nnames, cabin information, and family relationships to improve predictive \\npower. Feature importance was evaluated using Random Forest and XGBoost \\nalgorithms, with SelectFromModel and Recursive Feature Elimination applied \\nfor effective feature selection. Three classification algorithms—logistic \\nregression, random forest, and XGBoost—were systematically optimized using \\ngrid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization techniques. Based on \\nthese optimized models, soft voting and stacking ensemble approaches were \\nimplemented. Cross-validation results demonstrate that ensemble methods \\nachieved superior accuracy (0.8361) compared to individual models: logistic \\nregression (0.8339), random forest (0.8350), and XGBoost (0.8204). This \\nresearch provides valuable optimization strategies for similar classification \\ntasks, particularly highlighting how feature engineering combined with \\nensemble methods can substantially enhance predictive performance while \\nmaintaining computational efficiency. \\nKeywords: Titanic Survival Prediction, Feature Engineering, Ensemble \\nLearning, Hyperparameter Tuning. \\n1 Introduction \\nThe collision of the Titanic with an iceberg in 1912 was the cause of this catastrophe \\nthat left 1,517 lives lost and is one of the most dangerous maritime accidents of the \\ntwentieth century. Its historical significance and the multidimensional nature of \\npassenger data (including social class, gender, age, family relationships, etc.) have \\nestablished it as a classic binary classification benchmark dataset in machine learning. \\n© The Author(s) 2025\\nY. Sun (ed.), Proceedings of the 2025 3rd International Conference on Image, Algorithms, and Artificial\\nIntelligence (ICIAAI 2025), Advances in Computer Science Research 122,\\nhttps://doi.org/10.2991/978-94-6463-823-3_19\\n208 H. Li\\nDespite extensive research on this problem, traditional methods exhibit \\nsignificant limitations. Early studies predominantly focused on the direct application \\nof basic features, achieving prediction accuracy generally below 80% [1]. For \\ninstance, simple rules based on gender and passenger class could rapidly distinguish \\nsurvival groups. However, these methods failed to fully explore nonlinear interactions \\nbetween features and higher-order features. Moreover, approximately 20% of the age \\nfield and 68% of the cabin number field (Cabin) are missing in the dataset. Traditional \\napproaches often rely on mean imputation or directly delete missing values, leading to \\ninformation loss and model bias [2]. \\nAccording to previous research, traditional classification methods applied to the \\nTitanic dataset achieved limited accuracy. These methods were constrained by their \\ninability to capture complex feature interactions and their sensitivity to missing values \\n[2]. Simultaneously, traditional methods predominantly depend on single models such \\nas logistic regression and decision trees without conducting feature importance \\nselection, resulting in lower prediction accuracy [3]. Recent studies have introduced \\nensemble models but have not systematically compared their performance with single \\nmodels, nor explored how different hyperparameter tuning methods influence \\nprediction model performance in this dataset. \\nTo address these challenges, this study employs advanced feature engineering \\ntechniques to extract new features, utilizes the relationships between features and \\neXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) for missing value imputation, applies feature \\nselection techniques like random forests and XGBoost to identify key features for \\nsurvival prediction, and performs hyperparameter tuning of logistic regression, \\nrandom forests, and XGBoost models using grid search, random search, and Bayesian \\noptimization. Based on these methods, soft voting and stacking ensemble models are \\ntrained, and the performance of models under various parameter conditions is further \\ncompared. \\n2 Methods \\n2.1 DataSet \\nThis study is based on the Titanic dataset provided by the Kaggle platform [4]. The \\ndataset consists of two CSV files: the training set and the test set. The training set \\ncontains 891 samples, while the test set contains 418 samples. The data features \\ninclude PassengerId, Name, Pclass, Sex, Age, SibSp, Parch, Ticket, Fare, Cabin, and \\nEmbarked. Additionally, the training set includes an additional target variable, \\n\\\"Survived\\\". Analysis reveals missing values in the Age, Cabin, and Embarked \\ncolumns in the training set, and the Age, Cabin, and Fare columns in the test set, with \\nAge and Cabin having a relatively high proportion of missing values [2]. \\n2.2 Data Processing \\nTo facilitate data processing, this study first combined the training set and the test set\\nto form a complete dataset, called the \\\"merged set\\\". The missing values in the\\nTitanic Survival Prediction Enhanced by Innovative Feature … 209\\nEmbarked and Fare columns, which had relatively few missing values, were filled \\nfirst. By analyzing the sample features corresponding to the missing values in \\nEmbarked, it was found that these samples all had a Pclass of 1, a Fare of 80.0, a \\nCabin of B28, and a Sex of female. Considering the correlations between features, a \\nstrong relationship among Pclass, Fare, and Embarked was assumed. Based on this \\nassumption, box plots of Fare distribution under different combinations of Embarked \\nand Pclass were created (Figure 1), and it was determined that when Fare is 80 and \\nPclass is 1, Embarked is more likely to be 'C'. Therefore, the missing Embarked \\nvalues were filled with 'C'. Similarly, for cases where Embarked = 'S' and Pclass = 3, \\nthe median Fare was calculated and used to fill missing Fare values in the test set [2]. \\nFig. 1. Fare Distribution by Embarked and Pclass (Photo/Picture credit: Original). \\nNext, the Cabin column was processed. Due to the high number of missing values, the \\nanalysis was based only on available information. Records with Cabin information \\nwere filtered, and the distribution of cabin classes between survivors and \\nnon-survivors was compared. Cabin values containing multiple cabins were split into \\nlists, and the data was expanded row-wise to generate new features. Two new features \\nwere extracted: Deck (the letter part, filled with \\\"U\\\" if none) and Cabin number (the \\nnumeric part, converted to a numeric type). The Cabin number was further binned, \\nand survival rates within different intervals were analyzed [5]. The analysis revealed \\nthat passengers in cabin numbers ranging from 0-50 had a survival rate of \\napproximately 45%, while those in ranges 51-100 showed a higher survival rate of \\naround 60%. Passengers in cabin numbers above 100 had mixed survival rates, \\nranging from 40% to 55%, depending on the specific range. Meanwhile, specific \\nsurvival rates for each Deck were calculated, which showed notable variations: Deck \\nB had the highest survival rate at approximately 74%, followed by Decks D and E at \\naround 75% and 75%, respectively, while Deck U (unknown) had the lowest survival \\nrate at about 30%. Finally, the expanded data was re-aggregated into the original \\nmerged dataset (Fig. 1). \\nThe Title (such as \\\"Mr\\\", \\\"Mrs\\\") was extracted from the Name column as a new\\nfeature.

The “lore” of the competition is not so important, what you need to know is to develop a machine learning algorithm capable of correctly predicting the outcome of the spaceship’s passengers.\\n\\n## Import libraries\\n\\n```\\nimport pandas as pdimport numpy as npimport matplotlib.pyplot as pltimport seaborn as snsfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split,GridSearchCV,cross_val_score,StratifiedKFoldimport xgboost as xgbimport category_encoders as cefrom sklearn.impute import SimpleImputerfrom sklearn.pipeline import Pipelinefrom sklearn.pipeline import make_pipelinefrom sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformerfrom sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, roc_auc_score, precision_score, recall_score,f1_score, confusion_matrixfrom category_encoders import TargetEncoderfrom sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer,KNNImputerfrom lightgbm import LGBMClassifier\\n```\\n\\n## Let’s Start\\n\\nAs you can see, after I loaded the dataset, I removed both the “Passenger Id” and “Name” columns. They are not going to provide any useful or important information to the prediction. Someone’s name or Id does not change the probability of being Transported.\\n\\n```\\ndf = pd.read_csv(\\\"train.csv\\\")df.drop(columns=[\\\"PassengerId\\\",\\\"Name\\\"],inplace=True)\\n```\\n\\nNow, we are going to discuss a fundamental step I came across after trying to improve my score a thousand times. This step relies on exploring the “Cabin” column. Notice that the rows on the “Cabin” column follow a specific pattern. Something like this: “A/5/S”, “C/1/S”, “F/7/P”. And I decided to investigate it. So, to make things simple I split the rows of the “Cabin” into three columns based on both slashes (”/”) of the rows. For example, the “A/5/S” row would be transformed into three new columns: The first one is named “cabin\\\\_code” referring tothe character behind the first slash (A). The second one named “id\\\\_cabin” refers to the character behind the second slash (5). The third one named “cabin\\\\_sector” refers to the character after the second slash (S). And we end up with three new columns.\\n\\n```\\n#Splittingdf[[\\\"cabin_code\\\",\\\"id_cabin\\\",\\\"cabin_sector\\\"]] = df[\\\"Cabin\\\"].str.split(\\\"/\\\", n=2, expand=True)df.head(4)\\n```\\n\\nFirst of all, I noticed that “cabin\\\\_code” only has 8 different characters which means that the cabins are, somehow, divided into 8 sections.\\n\\nAlso, I asked myself if passengers from a specific section had a higher chance of being transported or if this statement was not true. With the plot below we can conclude that passengers from the B and C sections have a greater chance of surviving and passengers from the E section have a lower chance of surviving.\\n\\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\\n\\nI did the same thing with the “cabin\\\\_sector” column and also noticed that there was a difference between the sectors. Passengers from the P sector have a lower chance of being transported, while in the S sector, the opposite happens.\\n\\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\\n\\nThis means that this exploration of the original “Cabin” column is worth it since new insights are being added to the model.\\n\\nNow, we can finally delete the “Cabin” column. It will not provide any useful information for the model anymore. We have already extracted everything useful from it.\\n\\nI also removed the “cabin\\\\_id” and the column that I had created. As I said before, the Id will not interfere with the model’s predictive ability.\\n\\nSo used: df.drop(columns=\\\\[“Cabin”,”id\\\\_cabin”\\\\], inplace=True) to drop both columns\\n\\nBefore splitting our data, the “Transported” column must be in a binary format. As you can see, I switched “True” for 1 and “False” for 0.\\n\\nBinary transformation: df\\\\[“Transported”\\\\] = df\\\\[“Transported”\\\\].map({True:1, False:0})\\n\\nI also removed every row that had missing values in the “cabin\\\\_code” column.\\n\\n```\\n#BINARY TRANSFORMATIONdf[\\\"Transported\\\"] = df[\\\"Transported\\\"].map({True:1, False:0})#DROPPING COLUMNSdf.drop(columns=[\\\"Cabin\\\",\\\"id_cabin\\\"], inplace=True)#DROPPING NULLSdf.dropna(subset=[\\\"cabin_code\\\"], inplace=True)\\n```\\n\\nNow, we can finally split the data and proceed to develop our model.\\n\\nAfter splitting in train and test, I separated the test data into two categories: numerical and categorical. Why is that? We are going to perform different operations depending on the type of the variable. Categorical data must be encoded since most models are not able to understand categorical values and it must be converted to numerical values. Also, we are going to apply different techniques to fill the null values in our dataset, but I will talk more about it later on.\\n\\n```\\n#Define X and yX = df.iloc[:,0:12]y = df[\\\"Transported\\\"]\\n```\\n\\n```\\n#Splitting DataX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X,y,random_state=42,test_size=0.25)\\n```\\n\\n```\\n#Separate categorical and numerical featurescat_feat = np.array([coluna for coluna in X_train.columns if X_train[coluna].dtype.name == 'object'])num_feat = np.array([coluna for coluna in X_train.columns if coluna not in cat_feat])\\n```\\n\\nWe can now create our pipeline. There are going to be two pipelines: one is going to handle the categorical data and the other one is going to handle numerical data. The missing values of the categorical data will be filled with the most frequent value (mode) and after the Target Encoder will be applied to transform categorical variables into numerical variables. The numerical data missing values will be filled with a strategy called **K-nearest neighbors,** which uses the Euclidean distance between the data points to find the best number to fill the missing values. If don’t know how this Pipeline technique works, I recommend you check [my article about Pipelines.](https://medium.com/@fernandao.lacerda.dantas/boost-your-pipelines-with-columntransformer-b2c009db096f)\\n\\n```\\n#Categorical and numerical pipelinescat_pipe = Pipeline([(\\\"imputer_cat\\\", SimpleImputer(strategy=\\\"most_frequent\\\")),(\\\"encoder\\\", ce.TargetEncoder()),                    ])num_pipe = Pipeline([(\\\"imputer_num\\\", KNNImputer(n_neighbors=3))])\\n```\\n\\nAnd with column transformer, we can attach both transformations to one variable that I named “transformer”. Observe that we also have to specify the type of data to which the pipeline will be applied t...\\n\\n--- Result 5 ---\\nTitle: Titanic dataset Analysis (~80% accuracy) - Analytics Vidhya - Medium\\nURL: https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/titanic-dataset-analysis-80-accuracy-9480cf3db538\\n\\nContent:\\n[Sitemap](https://medium.com/sitemap/sitemap.xml)\\n\\n[Open in app](https://rsci.app.link/?%24canonical_url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2Fp%2F9480cf3db538&%7Efeature=LoOpenInAppButton&%7Echannel=ShowPostUnderCollection&%7Estage=mobileNavBar&source=post_page---top_nav_layout_nav-----------------------------------------)\\n\\nSign up\\n\\n[Sign in](https://medium.com/m/signin?operation=login&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2Fanalytics-vidhya%2Ftitanic-dataset-analysis-80-accuracy-9480cf3db538&source=post_page---top_nav_layout_nav-----------------------global_nav------------------)\\n\\n[Medium Logo](https://medium.com/?source=post_page---top_nav_layout_nav-----------------------------------------)\\n\\n[Write](https://medium.com/m/signin?operation=register&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2Fnew-story&source=---top_nav_layout_nav-----------------------new_post_topnav------------------)\\n\\nSign up\\n\\n[Sign in](https://medium.com/m/signin?operation=login&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2Fanalytics-vidhya%2Ftitanic-dataset-analysis-80-accuracy-9480cf3db538&source=post_page---top_nav_layout_nav-----------------------global_nav------------------)\\n\\n[**Analytics Vidhya**](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya?source=post_page---publication_nav-7219b4dc6c4c-9480cf3db538---------------------------------------)\\n\\n·\\n\\nAnalytics Vidhya is a community of Generative AI and Data Science professionals.

RMS Titanic was a British passenger ship that hit an iceberg while on its voyage from Southampton to New York City, and sank in the North Atlantic ocean, leaving hundreds of passengers to die in the aftermath of the deadly incident. Some of the passengers who survived till help arrived were rescued while many lost their lives helplessly waiting for help to arrive.\\n\\nThe legendary Kaggle problem, [Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic), based on the tragedic sinking of the RMS Titanic records data about 891 passengers of RMS Titanic, and we are required to predict if they have survived or not, based on the information we have available about the passengers and the outcome after the sinking of the ship.\\n\\nNote: This notebook is my analysis of the titanic dataset to obtain any meaningful insights from the data and scores an accuracy of ~80 percent (top 5 percent of 14k entries on Kaggle) .\\n\\nLet’s get started!\\n\\n## Contents:\\n\\n1\\\\.

Then a bunch of numeric variables, like ids, ages of the passengers, etc. followed by categorical variables like class of the ticket, and strings like name, etc.\\n\\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\\n\\nExample RMS Titanic ticket : [Source](https://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/titanic-tickets/)\\n\\nPrinting first 5 rows of given dataset..\\n\\n## Problem definition and metrics\\n\\nThe problem is a **binary class classification** problem. We can use **binary crossentropy** or logistic loss as the loss function and any metric like **accuracy** or/and **ROC AUC score** as a metric to evaluate the results.\\n\\n## EDA\\n\\n### Correlation between features:\\n\\nDrawing insights from the correlation between features..\\n\\n- Fare and Pclass are negatively correlated (with a Pearson’s correlation coefficient of -0.55) ; Obviously, **higher fares imply better better ticket classes** (lower the class number) and vice versa.\\n- Pclass and the target feature are moderately negatively correlated (-0.34) implying **better the ticket class, higher the chance of survival.**\\n- A similar pattern can be observed with the features Parch, SibSp and Age; Both the features, Parch and SibSp are very slightly correlated with all the features except Age feature, and both have a negative correlation (-0.19 and -0.31 respectively) with Age ; **Lower the age, more the number of family accompanying the passenger**\\n- SibSp and Parch features are positively correlated which are both indicative of the number of family members accompanying passenger\\n- PClass and Age are negatively correlated (-0.37) implying **higher the age, better the ticket class**\\n\\n### Missing data\\n\\n**Age** : Contains 177 nan values out of 891 entries. Imputed with median gave best results.\\n\\n**Embarked** : Contains 2 nan values. Imputed with mode of existing data.\\n\\n**Cabin** : 687 out of 891 Cabin entries are nans, i.e. more than 50 percent of the total data exists as missing data or Nans so assumed its better to derive other features from this feature.\\n\\nNow, printing the correlation heatmap after handling missing data and converting categorical strings to encodings (0,1,2..)..\\n\\n- Embarked also has slight correlation with the target variable (-0.17), the **port at which the ship was boarded by the passengers did determine their chance of survival**\\n- Sex is also highly correlated with the target variable (-0.54), indicating the **passenger’s gender had a high effect on their chance of survival**\\n- Embarked and Fare of the passengers are negatively correlated (-0.22); obviously, fare depends on the port a passenger boards the ship from.\\n- Embarked and Sex also seem slightly correlated (0.11) indicating the **port the passenger boarded from was dependent on the gender of the passenger**; Embarked and Pclass are also correlated (0.16) indicating a **1st class passenger probably boarded at a different port than a 3rd class passenger**.\\n- Sex and Fare, Sex and Parch, SibSp, Sex and Pclass all seem slightly correlated (-0.18, -0.25, -0.11, 0.13 respectively); i.e the **fare the passenger paid, the family aboard, and the class of the ticket was seem slightly dependent on the gender of the passenger**.\\n\\n**Question 1: How do the features ‘Age’, ‘Sex’, ‘Fare’, ‘Embarked’ affect the chance of a passenger’s survival?**\\n\\nAge :\\n\\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\\n\\n- Both distributions, of people who didn’t survive and the ones who did, are normal with a spike around age 30 for passengers who did not survive i.e. for **people around the age 30 had a higher chance of not surviving**\\n- People of ages > ~51 are considered outliers in the distribution of people who did not survive. owing to the fact **people above the age of ~51 are very less** and people of age ~55 above are outliers in the distribution of people who did survive, i.e. **very few people above ~55 actually did survive**\\n\\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\\n\\nSex:\\n\\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\\n\\n- From the above stacked plots, it is clear **more percentage of female passengers survived** i.e. 74.2 % while only 18.9 % of male passengers survived, even though more male passesngers were aboard\\n\\nFare :\\n\\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\\n\\n- Distribution of fares of survivors clearly has a higher median value, hence **passengers who survived had higher average fares**\\n- Lots of outliers in the distribution of both\\n- A huge spike in the distribution of the people who didn’t survive, or the probability that the person who didn’t survive had a fare of ~10 units of currency is very high\\n\\nEmbarked:\\n\\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\\n\\n- Maximum passengers seem to have boarded the ship at Southampton port and only 33 percent of them survived; out of the total passengers who boarded the ship at Queenstown, a simi...\\n\\n--- Result 6 ---\\nTitle: Search code, repositories, users, issues, pull requests...\\nURL: https://github.com/SamanthaZhang25/Kaggle-Titanic--Machine-Learning--Random-Forest-78.708\\n\\nContent:\\nGitHub - SamanthaZhang25/Kaggle-Titanic--Machine-Learning--Random-Forest-78.708: Predict Titanic survival using targeted feature engineering (Cabin presence, FamilySize, IsAlone, Title, Age bins) and compare popular models (RF, SVM, KNN, XGBoost, LightGBM).

The notebooks are named in pseudo-chronological order. I say \\\"pseudo\\\" because whenever I revisited a process, I edited the relevant existing notebook without creating a new one. Hence, some code and results in earlier notebooks may not have been used in the next few notebooks, but were used at some point in the entire project.\\n\\n## Exploratory Data Analysis\\n\\nFirst, I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on all features in the dataset ( [1\\\\. EDA.ipynb](https://github.com/chrischow/kaggle_titanic/blob/master/Notebooks/1.%20EDA.ipynb)). Concurrently, I cleaned the data and generated new features.\\n\\n## Modelling\\n\\n### Random Forest ( `sklearn`)\\n\\nNext, I experimented with the `sklearn` implementation of Random Forest ( [2\\\\. Random Forest - Low Depth.ipynb](https://github.com/chrischow/kaggle_titanic/blob/master/Notebooks/2.%20Random%20Forest%20-%20Low%20Depth.ipynb)). By the final iteration in the optimisation process, the accuracy was **82.47%**. However, the `sklearn` implementation ( `RandomForestClassifier`) was extremely slow. Hence, I switched over to the `lightgbm` implementation of the Random Forest algorithm.\\n\\n### Random Forest ( `lightgbm`)\\n\\nThe `lightgbm` implementation of the Random Forest algorithm was **much** faster. The subsequent three notebooks captured my attempts at figuring out the best sequence for the tuning of parameters. The best approach was to:\\n\\n1. Tune the number of trees/estimators\\n2. Perform Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) with cross-validation (CV)\\n3. Tune the proportion of observations sampled\\n4. Tune the maximum features used per split\\n5. Tune the minimum samples in each terminal node\\n6. Tune alpha, the L1 regularisation parameter\\n7. Tune lambda, the L1 regularisation parameter\\n\\nThis tuning sequence resulted in a 5-fold CV test score of **83.46%**.\\n\\n### Regenerating Features\\n\\nThen, I realised that I made a mistake in the feature generation process. I had generated encoded features using the entire training set. This resulted in contamination, which meant that the pseudo-test sets in CV contained information about the target, and this could have inflated the test scores. Instead, I should have (1) performed data cleaning on the competition training and test sets together, (2) encoded the training set while saving the mappings, and (3) performed mappings on the test set. Hence, I created the [`kaggle_titanic` module](https://github.com/chrischow/kaggle_titanic/blob/master/Modules/kaggle_titanic.py) to perform these three data cleaning functions, and many other functions for machine learning.\\n\\n### Model Tuning I - Improper Cross Validation\\n\\nI created pipelines for performing feature selection for and tuning the various models:\\n\\n1. LightGBM RF with low depth\\n2. LightGBM RF with high depth\\n3. LightGBM GBM with low depth\\n4. LightGBM GBM with high depth\\n5. XGBoost GBM with low depth\\n6. XGBoost GBM with high depth\\n7. Logistic Regression\\n8. Ridge Regression\\n9. Linear Support Vector Classifier (SVC)\\n\\nHaving completed the tuning for the above models, I discovered another source of contamination: in the cross validation process. I was using cross validation to both (1) tune hyperparameters and (2) score models. These two processes should have been separate. The correct way to have performed cross validation was:\\n\\n1. Split data into **meta folds** (e.g. 5 repeats of 5 folds)\\n2. For each **meta fold**:\\na. Split training data into folds (e.g. 5 repeats of 5 folds)\\nb. Run feature selection and hyperparameter tuning algorithms using cross validation\\nc. Score the model on the test set of the **meta fold**\\nd. Move on to next **meta fold** and repeat\\n3. Evaluate results for all **meta folds**\\n\\nThe first important thing I learned was that although feature selection and parameter tuning require cross validation, **all processes from data cleaning to feature generation to feature selection to hyperparameter tuning** require cross validation as well. In other words, **cross validation should be used to validate the full approach**. My mistake was that I saw hyperparameter tuning with cross validation as the end stage of testing. This was wrong. The second important thing I learned was that it was better to place feature selection before hyperparameter tuning. This is because changes in hyperparameter levels do not change how important or unimportant the features are. We only need the initial parameters for running RFE to not prevent the algorithm from letting the important features surface. For example, in tree-based models, increasing the number of trees, depth, or features sampled per tree would help to ensure that sufficient features are evaluated. The tradeoff to increasing these hyperparameters would be the computational cost. These two objectives should be balanced well.\\n\\n## About\\n\\nKaggle Competition - Titanic Dataset\\n\\n### Resources\\n\\n[Readme](https://github.com/chrischow/kaggle_titanic#readme-ov-file)\\n\\n[Activity](https://github.com/chrischow/kaggle_titanic/activity)\\n\\n### Stars\\n\\n[**1**\\\\\\nstar](https://github.com/chrischow/kaggle_titanic/stargazers)\\n\\n### Watchers\\n\\n[**2**\\\\\\nwatching](https://github.com/chrischow/kaggle_titanic/watchers)\\n\\n### Forks\\n\\n[**0**\\\\\\nforks](https://github.com/chrischow/kaggle_titanic/forks)\\n\\n[Report repository](https:...\\n\\n--- Result 8 ---\\nTitle: Building a Classification Model To Score 80+% Accuracy on the Spaceship Titanic Kaggle Dataset\\nURL: https://pub.towardsai.net/building-a-classification-model-to-score-80-accuracy-on-the-spaceship-titanic-kaggle-dataset-40a0aa184c1c\\n\\nContent:\\nBuilding a Classification Model To Score 80+% Accuracy on the Spaceship Titanic Kaggle Dataset | by Devang Chavda | Towards AI\\n[Sitemap](https://pub.towardsai.net/sitemap/sitemap.xml)\\n[Open in app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.medium.reader&amp;referrer=utm_source=mobileNavBar&amp;source=post_page---top_nav_layout_nav-----------------------------------------)\\nSign up\\n[Sign in](https://medium.com/m/signin?operation=login&amp;redirect=https://pub.towardsai.net/building-a-classification-model-to-score-80-accuracy-on-the-spaceship-titanic-kaggle-dataset-40a0aa184c1c&amp;source=post_page---top_nav_layout_nav-----------------------global_nav------------------)\\n[Medium Logo](https://medium.com/?source=post_page---top_nav_layout_nav-----------------------------------------)\\n[\\nWrite\\n](https://medium.com/m/signin?operation=register&amp;redirect=https://medium.com/new-story&amp;source=---top_nav_layout_nav-----------------------new_post_topnav------------------)\\n[\\nSearch\\n](https://medium.com/search?source=post_page---top_nav_layout_nav-----------------------------------------)\\nSign up\\n[Sign in](https://medium.com/m/signin?operation=login&amp;redirect=https://pub.towardsai.net/building-a-classification-model-to-score-80-accuracy-on-the-spaceship-titanic-kaggle-dataset-40a0aa184c1c&amp;source=post_page---top_nav_layout_nav-----------------------global_nav------------------)\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:64:64/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png)\\n[## Towards AI\\n](https://pub.towardsai.net/?source=post_page---publication_nav-98111c9905da-40a0aa184c1c---------------------------------------)\\n·Follow publication\\n[\\n![Towards AI](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:76:76/1*JyIThO-cLjlChQLb6kSlVQ.png)\\n](https://pub.towardsai.net/?source=post_page---post_publication_sidebar-98111c9905da-40a0aa184c1c---------------------------------------)\\nMaking AI accessible to 100K+ learners.

On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships\\n\\nOne of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.\\n\\n## Cross validation results\\n\\nAfter applying the appropriate preprocessing, each model was evaluated using 10-fold cross validation.

This study enhances Titanic survival prediction through advanced \\nfeature engineering and ensemble model optimization. The Titanic dataset \\npresents a classic binary classification problem requiring the prediction of \\npassenger survival based on demographic and ticket information. Our \\nmethodology employs systematic preprocessing where missing values are \\nintelligently imputed, including eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) \\npredictions for age values. Novel features were extracted from passenger \\nnames, cabin information, and family relationships to improve predictive \\npower. Feature importance was evaluated using Random Forest and XGBoost \\nalgorithms, with SelectFromModel and Recursive Feature Elimination applied \\nfor effective feature selection. Three classification algorithms—logistic \\nregression, random forest, and XGBoost—were systematically optimized using \\ngrid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization techniques. Based on \\nthese optimized models, soft voting and stacking ensemble approaches were \\nimplemented. Cross-validation results demonstrate that ensemble methods \\nachieved superior accuracy (0.8361) compared to individual models: logistic \\nregression (0.8339), random forest (0.8350), and XGBoost (0.8204). This \\nresearch provides valuable optimization strategies for similar classification \\ntasks, particularly highlighting how feature engineering combined with \\nensemble methods can substantially enhance predictive performance while \\nmaintaining computational efficiency. \\nKeywords: Titanic Survival Prediction, Feature Engineering, Ensemble \\nLearning, Hyperparameter Tuning. \\n1 Introduction \\nThe collision of the Titanic with an iceberg in 1912 was the cause of this catastrophe \\nthat left 1,517 lives lost and is one of the most dangerous maritime accidents of the \\ntwentieth century. Its historical significance and the multidimensional nature of \\npassenger data (including social class, gender, age, family relationships, etc.) have \\nestablished it as a classic binary classification benchmark dataset in machine learning. \\n© The Author(s) 2025\\nY. Sun (ed.), Proceedings of the 2025 3rd International Conference on Image, Algorithms, and Artificial\\nIntelligence (ICIAAI 2025), Advances in Computer Science Research 122,\\nhttps://doi.org/10.2991/978-94-6463-823-3_19\\n208 H. Li\\nDespite extensive research on this problem, traditional methods exhibit \\nsignificant limitations. Early studies predominantly focused on the direct application \\nof basic features, achieving prediction accuracy generally below 80% [1]. For \\ninstance, simple rules based on gender and passenger class could rapidly distinguish \\nsurvival groups. However, these methods failed to fully explore nonlinear interactions \\nbetween features and higher-order features. Moreover, approximately 20% of the age \\nfield and 68% of the cabin number field (Cabin) are missing in the dataset. Traditional \\napproaches often rely on mean imputation or directly delete missing values, leading to \\ninformation loss and model bias [2]. \\nAccording to previous research, traditional classification methods applied to the \\nTitanic dataset achieved limited accuracy. These methods were constrained by their \\ninability to capture complex feature interactions and their sensitivity to missing values \\n[2]. Simultaneously, traditional methods predominantly depend on single models such \\nas logistic regression and decision trees without conducting feature importance \\nselection, resulting in lower prediction accuracy [3]. Recent studies have introduced \\nensemble models but have not systematically compared their performance with single \\nmodels, nor explored how different hyperparameter tuning methods influence \\nprediction model performance in this dataset. \\nTo address these challenges, this study employs advanced feature engineering \\ntechniques to extract new features, utilizes the relationships between features and \\neXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) for missing value imputation, applies feature \\nselection techniques like random forests and XGBoost to identify key features for \\nsurvival prediction, and performs hyperparameter tuning of logistic regression, \\nrandom forests, and XGBoost models using grid search, random search, and Bayesian \\noptimization. Based on these methods, soft voting and stacking ensemble models are \\ntrained, and the performance of models under various parameter conditions is further \\ncompared. \\n2 Methods \\n2.1 DataSet \\nThis study is based on the Titanic dataset provided by the Kaggle platform [4]. The \\ndataset consists of two CSV files: the training set and the test set. The training set \\ncontains 891 samples, while the test set contains 418 samples. The data features \\ninclude PassengerId, Name, Pclass, Sex, Age, SibSp, Parch, Ticket, Fare, Cabin, and \\nEmbarked. Additionally, the training set includes an additional target variable, \\n\\\"Survived\\\". Analysis reveals missing values in the Age, Cabin, and Embarked \\ncolumns in the training set, and the Age, Cabin, and Fare columns in the test set, with \\nAge and Cabin having a relatively high proportion of missing values [2]. \\n2.2 Data Processing \\nTo facilitate data processing, this study first combined the training set and the test set\\nto form a complete dataset, called the \\\"merged set\\\". The missing values in the\\nTitanic Survival Prediction Enhanced by Innovative Feature … 209\\nEmbarked and Fare columns, which had relatively few missing values, were filled \\nfirst. By analyzing the sample features corresponding to the missing values in \\nEmbarked, it was found that these samples all had a Pclass of 1, a Fare of 80.0, a \\nCabin of B28, and a Sex of female. Considering the correlations between features, a \\nstrong relationship among Pclass, Fare, and Embarked was assumed. Based on this \\nassumption, box plots of Fare distribution under different combinations of Embarked \\nand Pclass were created (Figure 1), and it was determined that when Fare is 80 and \\nPclass is 1, Embarked is more likely to be 'C'. Therefore, the missing Embarked \\nvalues were filled with 'C'. Similarly, for cases where Embarked = 'S' and Pclass = 3, \\nthe median Fare was calculated and used to fill missing Fare values in the test set [2]. \\nFig. 1. Fare Distribution by Embarked and Pclass (Photo/Picture credit: Original). \\nNext, the Cabin column was processed. Due to the high number of missing values, the \\nanalysis was based only on available information. Records with Cabin information \\nwere filtered, and the distribution of cabin classes between survivors and \\nnon-survivors was compared. Cabin values containing multiple cabins were split into \\nlists, and the data was expanded row-wise to generate new features. Two new features \\nwere extracted: Deck (the letter part, filled with \\\"U\\\" if none) and Cabin number (the \\nnumeric part, converted to a numeric type). The Cabin number was further binned, \\nand survival rates within different intervals were analyzed [5]. The analysis revealed \\nthat passengers in cabin numbers ranging from 0-50 had a survival rate of \\napproximately 45%, while those in ranges 51-100 showed a higher survival rate of \\naround 60%. Passengers in cabin numbers above 100 had mixed survival rates, \\nranging from 40% to 55%, depending on the specific range. Meanwhile, specific \\nsurvival rates for each Deck were calculated, which showed notable variations: Deck \\nB had the highest survival rate at approximately 74%, followed by Decks D and E at \\naround 75% and 75%, respectively, while Deck U (unknown) had the lowest survival \\nrate at about 30%. Finally, the expanded data was re-aggregated into the original \\nmerged dataset (Fig. 1). \\nThe Title (such as \\\"Mr\\\", \\\"Mrs\\\") was extracted from the Name column as a new\\nfeature.

Given a dataset, we are required to predict which passengers were transported or not by an “anomaly” using records recovered from the spaceship’s damaged computer system. The “lore” of the competition is not so important, what you need to know is to develop a machine learning algorithm capable of correctly predicting the outcome of the spaceship’s passengers.\\n\\n## Import libraries\\n\\n```\\nimport pandas as pdimport numpy as npimport matplotlib.pyplot as pltimport seaborn as snsfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split,GridSearchCV,cross_val_score,StratifiedKFoldimport xgboost as xgbimport category_encoders as cefrom sklearn.impute import SimpleImputerfrom sklearn.pipeline import Pipelinefrom sklearn.pipeline import make_pipelinefrom sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformerfrom sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, roc_auc_score, precision_score, recall_score,f1_score, confusion_matrixfrom category_encoders import TargetEncoderfrom sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer,KNNImputerfrom lightgbm import LGBMClassifier\\n```\\n\\n## Let’s Start\\n\\nAs you can see, after I loaded the dataset, I removed both the “Passenger Id” and “Name” columns. They are not going to provide any useful or important information to the prediction. Someone’s name or Id does not change the probability of being Transported.\\n\\n```\\ndf = pd.read_csv(\\\"train.csv\\\")df.drop(columns=[\\\"PassengerId\\\",\\\"Name\\\"],inplace=True)\\n```\\n\\nNow, we are going to discuss a fundamental step I came across after trying to improve my score a thousand times. This step relies on exploring the “Cabin” column. Notice that the rows on the “Cabin” column follow a specific pattern. Something like this: “A/5/S”, “C/1/S”, “F/7/P”. And I decided to investigate it. So, to make things simple I split the rows of the “Cabin” into three columns based on both slashes (”/”) of the rows. For example, the “A/5/S” row would be transformed into three new columns: The first one is named “cabin\\\\_code” referring tothe character behind the first slash (A). The second one named “id\\\\_cabin” refers to the character behind the second slash (5). The third one named “cabin\\\\_sector” refers to the character after the second slash (S). And we end up with three new columns.\\n\\n```\\n#Splittingdf[[\\\"cabin_code\\\",\\\"id_cabin\\\",\\\"cabin_sector\\\"]] = df[\\\"Cabin\\\"].str.split(\\\"/\\\", n=2, expand=True)df.head(4)\\n```\\n\\nFirst of all, I noticed that “cabin\\\\_code” only has 8 different characters which means that the cabins are, somehow, divided into 8 sections.\\n\\nAlso, I asked myself if passengers from a specific section had a higher chance of being transported or if this statement was not true. With the plot below we can conclude that passengers from the B and C sections have a greater chance of surviving and passengers from the E section have a lower chance of surviving.\\n\\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\\n\\nI did the same thing with the “cabin\\\\_sector” column and also noticed that there was a difference between the sectors. Passengers from the P sector have a lower chance of being transported, while in the S sector, the opposite happens.\\n\\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\\n\\nThis means that this exploration of the original “Cabin” column is worth it since new insights are being added to the model.\\n\\nNow, we can finally delete the “Cabin” column. It will not provide any useful information for the model anymore. We have already extracted everything useful from it.\\n\\nI also removed the “cabin\\\\_id” and the column that I had created. As I said before, the Id will not interfere with the model’s predictive ability.\\n\\nSo used: df.drop(columns=\\\\[“Cabin”,”id\\\\_cabin”\\\\], inplace=True) to drop both columns\\n\\nBefore splitting our data, the “Transported” column must be in a binary format. As you can see, I switched “True” for 1 and “False” for 0.\\n\\nBinary transformation: df\\\\[“Transported”\\\\] = df\\\\[“Transported”\\\\].map({True:1, False:0})\\n\\nI also removed every row that had missing values in the “cabin\\\\_code” column.\\n\\n```\\n#BINARY TRANSFORMATIONdf[\\\"Transported\\\"] = df[\\\"Transported\\\"].map({True:1, False:0})#DROPPING COLUMNSdf.drop(columns=[\\\"Cabin\\\",\\\"id_cabin\\\"], inplace=True)#DROPPING NULLSdf.dropna(subset=[\\\"cabin_code\\\"], inplace=True)\\n```\\n\\nNow, we can finally split the data and proceed to develop our model.\\n\\nAfter splitting in train and test, I separated the test data into two categories: numerical and categorical. Why is that? We are going to perform different operations depending on the type of the variable. Categorical data must be encoded since most models are not able to understand categorical values and it must be converted to numerical values. Also, we are going to apply different techniques to fill the null values in our dataset, but I will talk more about it later on.\\n\\n```\\n#Define X and yX = df.iloc[:,0:12]y = df[\\\"Transported\\\"]\\n```\\n\\n```\\n#Splitting DataX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X,y,random_state=42,test_size=0.25)\\n```\\n\\n```\\n#Separate categorical and numerical featurescat_feat = np.array([coluna for coluna in X_train.columns if X_train[coluna].dtype.name == 'object'])num_feat = np.array([coluna for coluna in X_train.columns if coluna not in cat_feat])\\n```\\n\\nWe can now create our pipeline. There are going to be two pipelines: one is going to handle the categorical data and the other one is going to handle numerical data. The missing values of the categorical data will be filled with the most frequent value (mode) and after the Target Encoder will be applied to transform categorical variables into numerical variables. The numerical data missing values will be filled with a strategy called **K-nearest neighbors,** which uses the Euclidean distance between the data points to find the best number to fill the missing values. If don’t know how this Pipeline technique works, I recommend you check [my article about Pipelines.](https://medium.com/@fernandao.lacerda.dantas/boost-your-pipelines-with-columntransformer-b2c009db096f)\\n\\n```\\n#Categorical and numerical pipelinescat_pipe = Pipeline([(\\\"imputer_cat\\\", SimpleImputer(strategy=\\\"most_frequent\\\")),(\\\"encoder\\\", ce.TargetEncoder()),                    ])num_pipe = Pipeline([(\\\"imputer_num\\\", KNNImputer(n_neighbors=3))])\\n```\\n\\nAnd with column transformer, we can attach both transformations to one variable that I named “transformer”.

RMS Titanic was a British passenger ship that hit an iceberg while on its voyage from Southampton to New York City, and sank in the North Atlantic ocean, leaving hundreds of passengers to die in the aftermath of the deadly incident. Some of the passengers who survived till help arrived were rescued while many lost their lives helplessly waiting for help to arrive.\\n\\nThe legendary Kaggle problem, [Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic), based on the tragedic sinking of the RMS Titanic records data about 891 passengers of RMS Titanic, and we are required to predict if they have survived or not, based on the information we have available about the passengers and the outcome after the sinking of the ship.\\n\\nNote: This notebook is my analysis of the titanic dataset to obtain any meaningful insights from the data and scores an accuracy of ~80 percent (top 5 percent of 14k entries on Kaggle) .\\n\\nLet’s get started!\\n\\n## Contents:\\n\\n1\\\\.

Then a bunch of numeric variables, like ids, ages of the passengers, etc. followed by categorical variables like class of the ticket, and strings like name, etc.\\n\\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\\n\\nExample RMS Titanic ticket : [Source](https://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/titanic-tickets/)\\n\\nPrinting first 5 rows of given dataset..\\n\\n## Problem definition and metrics\\n\\nThe problem is a **binary class classification** problem. We can use **binary crossentropy** or logistic loss as the loss function and any metric like **accuracy** or/and **ROC AUC score** as a metric to evaluate the results.\\n\\n## EDA\\n\\n### Correlation between features:\\n\\nDrawing insights from the correlation between features..\\n\\n- Fare and Pclass are negatively correlated (with a Pearson’s correlation coefficient of -0.55) ; Obviously, **higher fares imply better better ticket classes** (lower the class number) and vice versa.\\n- Pclass and the target feature are moderately negatively correlated (-0.34) implying **better the ticket class, higher the chance of survival.**\\n- A similar pattern can be observed with the features Parch, SibSp and Age; Both the features, Parch and SibSp are very slightly correlated with all the features except Age feature, and both have a negative correlation (-0.19 and -0.31 respectively) with Age ; **Lower the age, more the number of family accompanying the passenger**\\n- SibSp and Parch features are positively correlated which are both indicative of the number of family members accompanying passenger\\n- PClass and Age are negatively correlated (-0.37) implying **higher the age, better the ticket class**\\n\\n### Missing data\\n\\n**Age** : Contains 177 nan values out of 891 entries. Imputed with median gave best results.\\n\\n**Embarked** : Contains 2 nan values. Imputed with mode of existing data.\\n\\n**Cabin** : 687 out of 891 Cabin entries are nans, i.e. more than 50 percent of the total data exists as missing data or Nans so assumed its better to derive other features from this feature.\\n\\nNow, printing the correlation heatmap after handling missing data and converting categorical strings to encodings (0,1,2..)..\\n\\n- Embarked also has slight correlation with the target variable (-0.17), the **port at which the ship was boarded by the passengers did determine their chance of survival**\\n- Sex is also highly correlated with the target variable (-0.54), indicating the **passenger’s gender had a high effect on their chance of survival**\\n- Embarked and Fare of the passengers are negatively correlated (-0.22); obviously, fare depends on the port a passenger boards the ship from.\\n- Embarked and Sex also seem slightly correlated (0.11) indicating the **port the passenger boarded from was dependent on the gender of the passenger**; Embarked and Pclass are also correlated (0.16) indicating a **1st class passenger probably boarded at a different port than a 3rd class passenger**.\\n- Sex and Fare, Sex and Parch, SibSp, Sex and Pclass all seem slightly correlated (-0.18, -0.25, -0.11, 0.13 respectively); i.e the **fare the passenger paid, the family aboard, and the class of the ticket was seem slightly dependent on the gender of the passenger**.\\n\\n**Question 1: How do the features ‘Age’, ‘Sex’, ‘Fare’, ‘Embarked’ affect the chance of a passenger’s survival?**\\n\\nAge :\\n\\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\\n\\n- Both distributions, of people who didn’t survive and the ones who did, are normal with a spike around age 30 for passengers who did not survive i.e. for **people around the age 30 had a higher chance of not surviving**\\n- People of ages > ~51 are considered outliers in the distribution of people who did not survive. owing to the fact **people above the age of ~51 are very less** and people of age ~55 above are outliers in the distribution of people who did survive, i.e. **very few people above ~55 actually did survive**\\n\\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\\n\\nSex:\\n\\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\\n\\n- From the above stacked plots, it is clear **more percentage of female passengers survived** i.e. 74.2 % while only 18.9 % of male passengers survived, even though more male passesngers were aboard\\n\\nFare :\\n\\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\\n\\n- Distribution of fares of survivors clearly has a higher median value, hence **passengers who survived had higher average fares**\\n- Lots of outliers in the distribution of both\\n- A huge spike in the distribution of the people who didn’t survive, or the probability that the person who didn’t survive had a fare of ~10 units of currency is very high\\n\\nEmbarked:\\n\\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\\n\\n- Maximum passengers seem to have boarded the ship at Southampton port and only 33 percent of them survived; out of the total passengers who boarded the ship at Queenstown, a simi...\", \"url\": \"https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/titanic-dataset-analysis-80-accuracy-9480cf3db538\"}, {\"title\": \"Search code, repositories, users, issues, pull requests...\", \"text\": \"GitHub - SamanthaZhang25/Kaggle-Titanic--Machine-Learning--Random-Forest-78.708: Predict Titanic survival using targeted feature engineering (Cabin presence, FamilySize, IsAlone, Title, Age bins) and compare popular models (RF, SVM, KNN, XGBoost, LightGBM).

The notebooks are named in pseudo-chronological order. I say \\\"pseudo\\\" because whenever I revisited a process, I edited the relevant existing notebook without creating a new one. Hence, some code and results in earlier notebooks may not have been used in the next few notebooks, but were used at some point in the entire project.\\n\\n## Exploratory Data Analysis\\n\\nFirst, I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on all features in the dataset ( [1\\\\. EDA.ipynb](https://github.com/chrischow/kaggle_titanic/blob/master/Notebooks/1.%20EDA.ipynb)). Concurrently, I cleaned the data and generated new features.\\n\\n## Modelling\\n\\n### Random Forest ( `sklearn`)\\n\\nNext, I experimented with the `sklearn` implementation of Random Forest ( [2\\\\. Random Forest - Low Depth.ipynb](https://github.com/chrischow/kaggle_titanic/blob/master/Notebooks/2.%20Random%20Forest%20-%20Low%20Depth.ipynb)). By the final iteration in the optimisation process, the accuracy was **82.47%**. However, the `sklearn` implementation ( `RandomForestClassifier`) was extremely slow. Hence, I switched over to the `lightgbm` implementation of the Random Forest algorithm.\\n\\n### Random Forest ( `lightgbm`)\\n\\nThe `lightgbm` implementation of the Random Forest algorithm was **much** faster. The subsequent three notebooks captured my attempts at figuring out the best sequence for the tuning of parameters. The best approach was to:\\n\\n1. Tune the number of trees/estimators\\n2. Perform Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) with cross-validation (CV)\\n3. Tune the proportion of observations sampled\\n4. Tune the maximum features used per split\\n5. Tune the minimum samples in each terminal node\\n6. Tune alpha, the L1 regularisation parameter\\n7. Tune lambda, the L1 regularisation parameter\\n\\nThis tuning sequence resulted in a 5-fold CV test score of **83.46%**.\\n\\n### Regenerating Features\\n\\nThen, I realised that I made a mistake in the feature generation process. I had generated encoded features using the entire training set. This resulted in contamination, which meant that the pseudo-test sets in CV contained information about the target, and this could have inflated the test scores. Instead, I should have (1) performed data cleaning on the competition training and test sets together, (2) encoded the training set while saving the mappings, and (3) performed mappings on the test set. Hence, I created the [`kaggle_titanic` module](https://github.com/chrischow/kaggle_titanic/blob/master/Modules/kaggle_titanic.py) to perform these three data cleaning functions, and many other functions for machine learning.\\n\\n### Model Tuning I - Improper Cross Validation\\n\\nI created pipelines for performing feature selection for and tuning the various models:\\n\\n1. LightGBM RF with low depth\\n2. LightGBM RF with high depth\\n3. LightGBM GBM with low depth\\n4. LightGBM GBM with high depth\\n5. XGBoost GBM with low depth\\n6. XGBoost GBM with high depth\\n7. Logistic Regression\\n8. Ridge Regression\\n9. Linear Support Vector Classifier (SVC)\\n\\nHaving completed the tuning for the above models, I discovered another source of contamination: in the cross validation process. I was using cross validation to both (1) tune hyperparameters and (2) score models. These two processes should have been separate. The correct way to have performed cross validation was:\\n\\n1. Split data into **meta folds** (e.g. 5 repeats of 5 folds)\\n2. For each **meta fold**:\\na. Split training data into folds (e.g. 5 repeats of 5 folds)\\nb. Run feature selection and hyperparameter tuning algorithms using cross validation\\nc. Score the model on the test set of the **meta fold**\\nd. Move on to next **meta fold** and repeat\\n3. Evaluate results for all **meta folds**\\n\\nThe first important thing I learned was that although feature selection and parameter tuning require cross validation, **all processes from data cleaning to feature generation to feature selection to hyperparameter tuning** require cross validation as well. In other words, **cross validation should be used to validate the full approach**. My mistake was that I saw hyperparameter tuning with cross validation as the end stage of testing. This was wrong. The second important thing I learned was that it was better to place feature selection before hyperparameter tuning. This is because changes in hyperparameter levels do not change how important or unimportant the features are. We only need the initial parameters for running RFE to not prevent the algorithm from letting the important features surface. For example, in tree-based models, increasing the number of trees, depth, or features sampled per tree would help to ensure that sufficient features are evaluated.

Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.\n\nWhile there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.\n\nIn this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).\n\n> #### Recommended Tutorial\n> We highly recommend [Alexis Cook’s Titanic Tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/titanic-tutorial) that walks you through making your very first submission step by step and [this starter notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/gusthema/titanic-competition-w-tensorflow-decision-forests) to get started.\n\n## How Kaggle’s Competitions Work\n1. **Join the Competition**\nRead about the challenge description, accept the Competition Rules and gain access to the competition dataset.\n1.  **Get to Work**\nDownload the data, build models on it locally or on Kaggle Notebooks (our no-setup, customizable Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs) and generate a prediction file.\n1.  **Make a Submission**\nUpload your prediction as a submission on Kaggle and receive an accuracy score.\n1.  **Check the Leaderboard**\nSee how your model ranks against other Kagglers on our leaderboard. \n1.  **Improve Your Score**\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a> to find lots of tutorials and insights from other competitors.\n\n> #### Kaggle Lingo Video\n> You may run into unfamiliar lingo as you dig into the Kaggle discussion forums and public notebooks. Check out  Dr. Rachael Tatman’s [video on Kaggle Lingo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEJHyuWKd-s) to get up to speed!\n\n## What Data Will I Use in This Competition?\nIn this competition, you’ll gain access to two similar datasets that include passenger information like name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc. One dataset is titled `train.csv` and the other is titled `test.csv`.\n\n`Train.csv` will contain the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 to be exact) and importantly, will reveal whether they survived or not, also known as the “ground truth”.\n\nThe `test.csv` dataset contains similar information but does not disclose the “ground truth” for each passenger.

They are a great place to begin if you are new to data science or just finished a MOOC and want to get involved in Kaggle.</p>\n<p>Getting Started competitions are a non-competitive way to get familiar with Kaggle’s platform, learn basic machine learning concepts, and start meeting people in the community. They have no cash prize and are on a rolling timeline.</p>\n<h2>How do I create and manage a team?</h2>\n<p>When you accept the competition rules, a team will be created for you. You can invite others to your team, accept a merger with another team, and update basic information like team name by going to the More &gt; <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/team\" target=\"_blank\">Team</a> page.</p>\n<p>We've heard from many Kagglers that teaming up is the best way to learn new skills AND have fun. If you don't have a teammate already, consider asking if anyone wants to team up in the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a>.</p>\n<h2>What are Notebooks?</h2>\n<p>Kaggle Notebooks is a cloud computational environment that enables reproducible and collaborative analysis. Notebooks support scripts in Python and R, Jupyter Notebooks, and RMarkdown reports. You can visit the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/notebooks\" target=\"_blank\">Notebooks</a> tab to view all of the publicly shared code for the Titanic competition. For more on how to use Notebooks to learn data science, check out our <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview\" target=\"&quot;_blank\">Courses</a>!</p>\n<h2>Why did my team disappear from the leaderboard?</h2>\n<p>To keep with the spirit of getting-started competitions, we have implemented a two month rolling window on submissions. Once a submission is more than two months old, it will be invalidated and no longer count towards the leaderboard.</p>\n<p>If your team has no submissions in the previous two months, the team will also drop from the leaderboard. This will keep the leaderboard at a manageable size, freshen it up, and prevent newcomers from getting lost in a sea of abandoned scores.</p>\n<p><i>\"I worked so hard to get that score!

In laymen terms this means, it either occurred or did not occur. For example, you won or did not win, you passed the test or did not pass the test, you were accepted or not accepted, and you get the point. A common business application is churn or customer retention. Another popular use case is, healthcare's mortality rate or survival analysis. Binary events create an interesting dynamic, because we know statistically, a random guess should achieve a 50% accuracy rate, without creating one single algorithm or writing one single line of code. However, just like autocorrect spellcheck technology, sometimes we humans can be too smart for our own good and actually underperform a coin flip. In this kernel, I use Kaggle's Getting Started Competition, Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster, to walk the reader through, how-to use the data science framework to beat the odds.\\n   \\n*What happens when technology is too smart for its own good?*\\n![Funny Autocorrect](http://15858-presscdn-0-65.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/hilarious-autocorrect-fails-20x.jpg)\",\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"metadata\":{\"_cell_guid\":\"ec31d549-537e-4f35-8594-22ef03079081\",\"_uuid\":\"ff6c70c884a8a5fb3258e7f3fefc9e55261df1df\"}},{\"source\":\"<a id=\\\"ch2\\\"></a>\\n# A Data Science Framework\\n1. **Define the Problem:** If data science, big data, machine learning, predictive analytics, business intelligence, or any other buzzword is the solution, then what is the problem? As the saying goes, don't put the cart before the horse. Problems before requirements, requirements before solutions, solutions before design, and design before technology. Too often we are quick to jump on the new shiny technology, tool, or algorithm before determining the actual problem we are trying to solve.\\n2. **Gather the Data:** John Naisbitt wrote in his 1984 (yes, 1984) book Megatrends, we are “drowning in data, yet staving for knowledge.\\\" So, chances are, the dataset(s) already exist somewhere, in some format. It may be external or internal, structured or unstructured, static or streamed, objective or subjective, etc. As the saying goes, you don't have to reinvent the wheel, you just have to know where to find it. In the next step, we will worry about transforming \\\"dirty data\\\" to \\\"clean data.\\\"\\n3. **Prepare Data for Consumption:** This step is often referred to as data wrangling, a required process to turn “wild” data into “manageable” data. Data wrangling includes implementing data architectures for storage and processing, developing data governance standards for quality and control, data extraction (i.e. ETL and web scraping), and data cleaning to identify aberrant, missing, or outlier data points.\\n4. **Perform Exploratory Analysis:** Anybody who has ever worked with data knows, garbage-in, garbage-out (GIGO). Therefore, it is important to deploy descriptive and graphical statistics to look for potential problems, patterns, classifications, correlations and comparisons in the dataset. In addition, data categorization (i.e. qualitative vs quantitative) is also important to understand and select the correct hypothesis test or data model.\\n5. **Model Data:** Like descriptive and inferential statistics, data modeling can either summarize the data or predict future outcomes. Your dataset and expected results, will determine the algorithms available for use. It's important to remember, algorithms are tools and not magical wands or silver bullets. You must still be the master craft (wo)man that knows how-to select the right tool for the job. An analogy would be asking someone to hand you a Philip screwdriver, and they hand you a flathead screwdriver or worst a hammer. At best, it shows a complete lack of understanding. At worst, it makes completing the project impossible. The same is true in data modelling. The wrong model can lead to poor performance at best and the wrong conclusion (that’s used as actionable intelligence) at worst.\\n6. **Validate and Implement Data Model:** After you've trained your model based on a subset of your data, it's time to test your model. This helps ensure you haven't overfit your model or made it so specific to the selected subset, that it does not accurately fit another subset from the same dataset. In this step we determine if our [model overfit, generalize, or underfit our dataset](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/latest/dg/model-fit-underfitting-vs-overfitting.html).\\n7. **Optimize and Strategize:** This is the \\\"bionic man\\\" step, where you iterate back through the process to make it better...stronger...faster than it was before. As a data scientist, your strategy should be to outsource developer operations and application plumbing, so you have more time to focus on recommendations and design. Once you're able to package your ideas, this becomes your “currency exchange\\\" rate.\",\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"metadata\":{\"_cell_guid\":\"8514a868-6816-494a-9e9c-dba14cb36f42\",\"_uuid\":\"bd2a68dcaace0c1371f2994f0204dce65800cc20\"}},{\"source\":\"<a id=\\\"ch3\\\"></a>\\n# Step 1: Define the Problem\\nFor this project, the problem statement is given to us on a golden plater, develop an algorithm to predict the survival outcome of passengers on the Titanic.\\n\\n......\\n\\n**Project Summary:**\\nThe sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.\\n\\nOne of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.\\n\\nIn this challenge, we ask you to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular, we ask you to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.\\n\\nPractice Skills\\n* Binary classification\\n* Python and R basics\\n\\n# Step 2: Gather the Data\\n\\nThe dataset is also given to us on a golden plater with test and train data at [Kaggle's Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)\\n\",\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"metadata\":{\"_cell_guid\":\"22ba49b5-b3b6-4129-8c57-623e0d863ab3\",\"_uuid\":\"ff014109d795c5d1bfcc66c9761730406124ebe4\"}},{\"source\":\"<a id=\\\"ch4\\\"></a>\\n# Step 3: Prepare Data for Consumption\\nSince step 2 was provided to us on a golden plater, so is step 3.

Using the same dataset and different implementation of a decision tree (adaboost, random forest, gradient boost, xgboost, etc.) with tuning does not exceed the 0.77990 submission accuracy. Interesting for this dataset, the simple decision tree algorithm had the best default submission score and with tuning achieved the same best accuracy score.\\n\\nWhile no general conclusions can be made from testing a handful of algorithms on a single dataset, there are several observations on the mentioned dataset. \\n1. The train dataset has a different distribution than the test/validation dataset and population. This created wide margins between the cross validation (CV) accuracy score and Kaggle submission accuracy score.\\n2. Given the same dataset, decision tree based algorithms, seemed to converge on the same accuracy score after proper tuning.\\n3. Despite tuning, no machine learning algorithm, exceeded the homemade algorithm. The author will theorize, that for small datasets, a manmade algorithm is the bar to beat. \\n\\nWith that in mind, for iteration two, I would spend more time on preprocessing and feature engineering. In order to better align the CV score and Kaggle score and improve the overall accuracy.\\n\\n\",\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"metadata\":{\"_cell_guid\":\"a6d34edc-1265-41e8-b163-0b817cd3b6a5\",\"_uuid\":\"c476df95925d67809975caca4ea4dcb4b2a0b277\"}},{\"source\":\"<a id=\\\"ch90\\\"></a>\\n## Change Log:\\n11/22/17 Please note, this kernel is currently in progress, but open to feedback.

In a nutshell stacking uses as a first-level (base), the predictions of a few basic classifiers and then uses another model at the second-level to predict the output from the earlier first-level predictions.\\n\\nThe Titanic dataset is a prime candidate for introducing this concept as many newcomers to Kaggle start out here. Furthermore even though stacking has been responsible for many a team winning Kaggle competitions there seems to be a dearth of kernels on this topic so I hope this notebook can fill somewhat of that void.\\n\\nI myself am quite a newcomer to the Kaggle scene as well and the first proper ensembling/stacking script that I managed to chance upon and study was one written in the AllState Severity Claims competition by the great Faron. The material in this notebook borrows heavily from Faron's script although ported to factor in ensembles of classifiers whilst his was ensembles of regressors. Anyway please check out his script here:\\n\\n[Stacking Starter][1] : by Faron \\n\\n\\nNow onto the notebook at hand and I hope that it manages to do justice and convey the concept of ensembling in an intuitive and concise manner.  My other standalone Kaggle [script][2] which implements exactly the same ensembling steps (albeit with different parameters) discussed below gives a Public LB score of 0.808 which is good enough to get to the top 9% and runs just under 4 minutes. Therefore I am pretty sure there is a lot of room to improve and add on to that script. Anyways please feel free to leave me any comments with regards to how I can improve\\n\\n\\n  [1]: https://www.kaggle.com/mmueller/allstate-claims-severity/stacking-starter/run/390867\\n  [2]: https://www.kaggle.com/arthurtok/titanic/simple-stacking-with-xgboost-0-808\"},{\"metadata\":{\"_execution_state\":\"idle\",\"_cell_guid\":\"14630296-b1aa-759e-bafa-b6a73f3896ed\",\"_uuid\":\"2e37a274400cfeb472b6405d524325245588dd66\",\"trusted\":true},\"cell_type\":\"code\",\"source\":\"# Load in our libraries\\nimport pandas as pd\\nimport numpy as np\\nimport re\\nimport sklearn\\nimport xgboost as xgb\\nimport seaborn as sns\\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\\n%matplotlib inline\\n\\nimport plotly.offline as py\\npy.init_notebook_mode(connected=True)\\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\\nimport plotly.tools as tls\\n\\nimport warnings\\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\\n\\n# Going to use these 5 base models for the stacking\\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import (RandomForestClassifier, AdaBoostClassifier, \\n                              GradientBoostingClassifier, ExtraTreesClassifier)\\nfrom sklearn.svm import SVC\\nfrom sklearn.cross_validation import KFold\",\"execution_count\":1,\"outputs\":[]},{\"metadata\":{\"_uuid\":\"8b590aafe06a2ac55daae9d2456155e457914f5f\",\"_cell_guid\":\"d647b74c-099b-851a-dcd2-3a58c9e8f10c\"},\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"source\":\"# Feature Exploration, Engineering and Cleaning \\n\\nNow we will proceed much like how most kernels in general are structured, and that is to first explore the data on hand, identify possible feature engineering opportunities as well as numerically encode any categorical features.\"},{\"metadata\":{\"_execution_state\":\"idle\",\"_cell_guid\":\"5937fd72-d1ad-f678-cc82-f08a96e4cad0\",\"_uuid\":\"b2ad78041b69ce13d1f41bd9bc8c93cafaf7b8ac\",\"trusted\":true},\"cell_type\":\"code\",\"source\":\"# Load in the train and test datasets\\ntrain = pd.read_csv('../input/train.csv')\\ntest = pd.read_csv('../input/test.csv')\\n\\n# Store our passenger ID for easy access\\nPassengerId = test['PassengerId']\\n\\ntrain.head(3)\",\"execution_count\":2,\"outputs\":[]},{\"metadata\":{\"_uuid\":\"81378834770e55c76751347588322fe32acf5737\",\"_cell_guid\":\"dff1c1dd-1e59-3907-88fa-1a1d699122be\"},\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"source\":\"Well it is no surprise that our task is to somehow extract the information out of the categorical variables \\n\\n**Feature Engineering**\\n\\nHere, credit must be extended to Sina's very comprehensive and well-thought out notebook for the feature engineering ideas so please check out his work \\n\\n[Titanic Best Working Classfier][1] : by Sina\\n\\n\\n  [1]: https://www.kaggle.com/sinakhorami/titanic/titanic-best-working-classifier\"},{\"metadata\":{\"collapsed\":true,\"_execution_state\":\"idle\",\"_cell_guid\":\"e85b2a80-88a4-928f-f2b2-24895dea38f3\",\"_uuid\":\"b1c67249f91768ce8e5e2751364d32c87446cf55\",\"trusted\":true},\"cell_type\":\"code\",\"source\":\"full_data = [train, test]\\n\\n# Some features of my own that I have added in\\n# Gives the length of the name\\ntrain['Name_length'] = train['Name'].apply(len)\\ntest['Name_length'] = test['Name'].apply(len)\\n# Feature that tells whether a passenger had a cabin on the Titanic\\ntrain['Has_Cabin'] = train[\\\"Cabin\\\"].apply(lambda x: 0 if type(x) == float else 1)\\ntest['Has_Cabin'] = test[\\\"Cabin\\\"].apply(lambda x: 0 if type(x) == float else 1)\\n\\n# Feature engineering steps taken from Sina\\n# Create new feature FamilySize as a combination of SibSp and Parch\\nfor dataset in full_data:\\n    dataset['FamilySize'] = dataset['SibSp'] + dataset['Parch'] + 1\\n# Create new feature IsAlone from FamilySize\\nfor dataset in full_data:\\n    dataset['IsAlone'] = 0\\n    dataset.loc[dataset['FamilySize'] == 1, 'IsAlone'] = 1\\n# Remove all NULLS in the Embarked column\\nfor dataset in full_data:\\n    dataset['Embarked'] = dataset['Embarked'].fillna('S')\\n# Remove all NULLS in the Fare column and create a new feature CategoricalFare\\nfor dataset in full_data:\\n    dataset['Fare'] = dataset['Fare'].fillna(train['Fare'].median())\\ntrain['CategoricalFare'] = pd.qcut(train['Fare'], 4)\\n# Create a New feature CategoricalAge\\nfor dataset in full_data:\\n    age_avg = dataset['Age'].mean()\\n    age_std = dataset['Age'].std()\\n    age_null_count = dataset['Age'].isnull().sum()\\n    age_null_random_list = np.random.randint(age_avg -

However many will skip some of the explanation on how the solution is developed as these notebooks are developed by experts for experts. The objective of this notebook is to follow a step-by-step workflow, explaining each step and rationale for every decision we take during solution development.\\n\\n## Workflow stages\\n\\nThe competition solution workflow goes through seven stages described in the Data Science Solutions book.\\n\\n1. Question or problem definition.\\n2. Acquire training and testing data.\\n3. Wrangle, prepare, cleanse the data.\\n4. Analyze, identify patterns, and explore the data.\\n5. Model, predict and solve the problem.\\n6. Visualize, report, and present the problem solving steps and final solution.\\n7. Supply or submit the results.\\n\\nThe workflow indicates general sequence of how each stage may follow the other. However there are use cases with exceptions.\\n\\n- We may combine mulitple workflow stages. We may analyze by visualizing data.\\n- Perform a stage earlier than indicated. We may analyze data before and after wrangling.\\n- Perform a stage multiple times in our workflow. Visualize stage may be used multiple times.\\n- Drop a stage altogether. We may not need supply stage to productize or service enable our dataset for a competition.\\n\\n\\n## Question and problem definition\\n\\nCompetition sites like Kaggle define the problem to solve or questions to ask while providing the datasets for training your data science model and testing the model results against a test dataset. The question or problem definition for Titanic Survival competition is [described here at Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).\\n\\n> Knowing from a training set of samples listing passengers who survived or did not survive the Titanic disaster, can our model determine based on a given test dataset not containing the survival information, if these passengers in the test dataset survived or not.\\n\\nWe may also want to develop some early understanding about the domain of our problem. This is described on the [Kaggle competition description page here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). Here are the highlights to note.\\n\\n- On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. Translated 32% survival rate.\\n- One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew.\\n- Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.\\n\\n## Workflow goals\\n\\nThe data science solutions workflow solves for seven major goals.\\n\\n**Classifying.** We may want to classify or categorize our samples. We may also want to understand the implications or correlation of different classes with our solution goal.\\n\\n**Correlating.** One can approach the problem based on available features within the training dataset. Which features within the dataset contribute significantly to our solution goal? Statistically speaking is there a [correlation](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Correlation) among a feature and solution goal? As the feature values change does the solution state change as well, and visa-versa? This can be tested both for numerical and categorical features in the given dataset. We may also want to determine correlation among features other than survival for subsequent goals and workflow stages. Correlating certain features may help in creating, completing, or correcting features.\\n\\n**Converting.** For modeling stage, one needs to prepare the data. Depending on the choice of model algorithm one may require all features to be converted to numerical equivalent values. So for instance converting text categorical values to numeric values.\\n\\n**Completing.** Data preparation may also require us to estimate any missing values within a feature. Model algorithms may work best when there are no missing values.\\n\\n**Correcting.** We may also analyze the given training dataset for errors or possibly innacurate values within features and try to corrent these values or exclude the samples containing the errors. One way to do this is to detect any outliers among our samples or features. We may also completely discard a feature if it is not contribting to the analysis or may significantly skew the results.\\n\\n**Creating.** Can we create new features based on an existing feature or a set of features, such that the new feature follows the correlation, conversion, completeness goals.\\n\\n**Charting.** How to select the right visualization plots and charts depending on nature of the data and the solution goals.\"},{\"metadata\":{\"_uuid\":\"960f8b1937dc4915ce1eb0f82614b1985c4321a4\",\"_cell_guid\":\"56a3be4e-76ef-20c6-25e8-da16147cf6d7\"},\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"source\":\"## Refactor Release 2017-Jan-29\\n\\nWe are significantly refactoring the notebook based on (a) comments received by readers, (b) issues in porting notebook from Jupyter kernel (2.7) to Kaggle kernel (3.5), and (c) review of few more best practice kernels.\\n\\n### User comments\\n\\n- Combine training and test data for certain operations like converting titles across dataset to numerical values.

On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships\n\nOne of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.\n\n## Cross validation results\n\nAfter applying the appropriate preprocessing, each model was evaluated using 10-fold cross validation.

This study enhances Titanic survival prediction through advanced \nfeature engineering and ensemble model optimization. The Titanic dataset \npresents a classic binary classification problem requiring the prediction of \npassenger survival based on demographic and ticket information. Our \nmethodology employs systematic preprocessing where missing values are \nintelligently imputed, including eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) \npredictions for age values. Novel features were extracted from passenger \nnames, cabin information, and family relationships to improve predictive \npower. Feature importance was evaluated using Random Forest and XGBoost \nalgorithms, with SelectFromModel and Recursive Feature Elimination applied \nfor effective feature selection. Three classification algorithms—logistic \nregression, random forest, and XGBoost—were systematically optimized using \ngrid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization techniques. Based on \nthese optimized models, soft voting and stacking ensemble approaches were \nimplemented. Cross-validation results demonstrate that ensemble methods \nachieved superior accuracy (0.8361) compared to individual models: logistic \nregression (0.8339), random forest (0.8350), and XGBoost (0.8204). This \nresearch provides valuable optimization strategies for similar classification \ntasks, particularly highlighting how feature engineering combined with \nensemble methods can substantially enhance predictive performance while \nmaintaining computational efficiency. \nKeywords: Titanic Survival Prediction, Feature Engineering, Ensemble \nLearning, Hyperparameter Tuning. \n1 Introduction \nThe collision of the Titanic with an iceberg in 1912 was the cause of this catastrophe \nthat left 1,517 lives lost and is one of the most dangerous maritime accidents of the \ntwentieth century. Its historical significance and the multidimensional nature of \npassenger data (including social class, gender, age, family relationships, etc.) have \nestablished it as a classic binary classification benchmark dataset in machine learning. \n© The Author(s) 2025\nY. Sun (ed.), Proceedings of the 2025 3rd International Conference on Image, Algorithms, and Artificial\nIntelligence (ICIAAI 2025), Advances in Computer Science Research 122,\nhttps://doi.org/10.2991/978-94-6463-823-3_19\n208 H. Li\nDespite extensive research on this problem, traditional methods exhibit \nsignificant limitations. Early studies predominantly focused on the direct application \nof basic features, achieving prediction accuracy generally below 80% [1]. For \ninstance, simple rules based on gender and passenger class could rapidly distinguish \nsurvival groups. However, these methods failed to fully explore nonlinear interactions \nbetween features and higher-order features. Moreover, approximately 20% of the age \nfield and 68% of the cabin number field (Cabin) are missing in the dataset. Traditional \napproaches often rely on mean imputation or directly delete missing values, leading to \ninformation loss and model bias [2]. \nAccording to previous research, traditional classification methods applied to the \nTitanic dataset achieved limited accuracy. These methods were constrained by their \ninability to capture complex feature interactions and their sensitivity to missing values \n[2]. Simultaneously, traditional methods predominantly depend on single models such \nas logistic regression and decision trees without conducting feature importance \nselection, resulting in lower prediction accuracy [3]. Recent studies have introduced \nensemble models but have not systematically compared their performance with single \nmodels, nor explored how different hyperparameter tuning methods influence \nprediction model performance in this dataset. \nTo address these challenges, this study employs advanced feature engineering \ntechniques to extract new features, utilizes the relationships between features and \neXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) for missing value imputation, applies feature \nselection techniques like random forests and XGBoost to identify key features for \nsurvival prediction, and performs hyperparameter tuning of logistic regression, \nrandom forests, and XGBoost models using grid search, random search, and Bayesian \noptimization. Based on these methods, soft voting and stacking ensemble models are \ntrained, and the performance of models under various parameter conditions is further \ncompared. \n2 Methods \n2.1 DataSet \nThis study is based on the Titanic dataset provided by the Kaggle platform [4]. The \ndataset consists of two CSV files: the training set and the test set. The training set \ncontains 891 samples, while the test set contains 418 samples. The data features \ninclude PassengerId, Name, Pclass, Sex, Age, SibSp, Parch, Ticket, Fare, Cabin, and \nEmbarked. Additionally, the training set includes an additional target variable, \n\"Survived\". Analysis reveals missing values in the Age, Cabin, and Embarked \ncolumns in the training set, and the Age, Cabin, and Fare columns in the test set, with \nAge and Cabin having a relatively high proportion of missing values [2]. \n2.2 Data Processing \nTo facilitate data processing, this study first combined the training set and the test set\nto form a complete dataset, called the \"merged set\". The missing values in the\nTitanic Survival Prediction Enhanced by Innovative Feature … 209\nEmbarked and Fare columns, which had relatively few missing values, were filled \nfirst. By analyzing the sample features corresponding to the missing values in \nEmbarked, it was found that these samples all had a Pclass of 1, a Fare of 80.0, a \nCabin of B28, and a Sex of female. Considering the correlations between features, a \nstrong relationship among Pclass, Fare, and Embarked was assumed. Based on this \nassumption, box plots of Fare distribution under different combinations of Embarked \nand Pclass were created (Figure 1), and it was determined that when Fare is 80 and \nPclass is 1, Embarked is more likely to be 'C'. Therefore, the missing Embarked \nvalues were filled with 'C'. Similarly, for cases where Embarked = 'S' and Pclass = 3, \nthe median Fare was calculated and used to fill missing Fare values in the test set [2]. \nFig. 1. Fare Distribution by Embarked and Pclass (Photo/Picture credit: Original). \nNext, the Cabin column was processed. Due to the high number of missing values, the \nanalysis was based only on available information. Records with Cabin information \nwere filtered, and the distribution of cabin classes between survivors and \nnon-survivors was compared. Cabin values containing multiple cabins were split into \nlists, and the data was expanded row-wise to generate new features. Two new features \nwere extracted: Deck (the letter part, filled with \"U\" if none) and Cabin number (the \nnumeric part, converted to a numeric type). The Cabin number was further binned, \nand survival rates within different intervals were analyzed [5]. The analysis revealed \nthat passengers in cabin numbers ranging from 0-50 had a survival rate of \napproximately 45%, while those in ranges 51-100 showed a higher survival rate of \naround 60%. Passengers in cabin numbers above 100 had mixed survival rates, \nranging from 40% to 55%, depending on the specific range. Meanwhile, specific \nsurvival rates for each Deck were calculated, which showed notable variations: Deck \nB had the highest survival rate at approximately 74%, followed by Decks D and E at \naround 75% and 75%, respectively, while Deck U (unknown) had the lowest survival \nrate at about 30%.

Given a dataset, we are required to predict which passengers were transported or not by an “anomaly” using records recovered from the spaceship’s damaged computer system. The “lore” of the competition is not so important, what you need to know is to develop a machine learning algorithm capable of correctly predicting the outcome of the spaceship’s passengers.\n\n## Import libraries\n\n```\nimport pandas as pdimport numpy as npimport matplotlib.pyplot as pltimport seaborn as snsfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split,GridSearchCV,cross_val_score,StratifiedKFoldimport xgboost as xgbimport category_encoders as cefrom sklearn.impute import SimpleImputerfrom sklearn.pipeline import Pipelinefrom sklearn.pipeline import make_pipelinefrom sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformerfrom sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, roc_auc_score, precision_score, recall_score,f1_score, confusion_matrixfrom category_encoders import TargetEncoderfrom sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer,KNNImputerfrom lightgbm import LGBMClassifier\n```\n\n## Let’s Start\n\nAs you can see, after I loaded the dataset, I removed both the “Passenger Id” and “Name” columns. They are not going to provide any useful or important information to the prediction. Someone’s name or Id does not change the probability of being Transported.\n\n```\ndf = pd.read_csv(\"train.csv\")df.drop(columns=[\"PassengerId\",\"Name\"],inplace=True)\n```\n\nNow, we are going to discuss a fundamental step I came across after trying to improve my score a thousand times. This step relies on exploring the “Cabin” column. Notice that the rows on the “Cabin” column follow a specific pattern. Something like this: “A/5/S”, “C/1/S”, “F/7/P”. And I decided to investigate it. So, to make things simple I split the rows of the “Cabin” into three columns based on both slashes (”/”) of the rows. For example, the “A/5/S” row would be transformed into three new columns: The first one is named “cabin\\_code” referring tothe character behind the first slash (A). The second one named “id\\_cabin” refers to the character behind the second slash (5). The third one named “cabin\\_sector” refers to the character after the second slash (S). And we end up with three new columns.\n\n```\n#Splittingdf[[\"cabin_code\",\"id_cabin\",\"cabin_sector\"]] = df[\"Cabin\"].str.split(\"/\", n=2, expand=True)df.head(4)\n```\n\nFirst of all, I noticed that “cabin\\_code” only has 8 different characters which means that the cabins are, somehow, divided into 8 sections.\n\nAlso, I asked myself if passengers from a specific section had a higher chance of being transported or if this statement was not true. With the plot below we can conclude that passengers from the B and C sections have a greater chance of surviving and passengers from the E section have a lower chance of surviving.\n\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\n\nI did the same thing with the “cabin\\_sector” column and also noticed that there was a difference between the sectors. Passengers from the P sector have a lower chance of being transported, while in the S sector, the opposite happens.\n\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\n\nThis means that this exploration of the original “Cabin” column is worth it since new insights are being added to the model.\n\nNow, we can finally delete the “Cabin” column. It will not provide any useful information for the model anymore. We have already extracted everything useful from it.\n\nI also removed the “cabin\\_id” and the column that I had created. As I said before, the Id will not interfere with the model’s predictive ability.\n\nSo used: df.drop(columns=\\[“Cabin”,”id\\_cabin”\\], inplace=True) to drop both columns\n\nBefore splitting our data, the “Transported” column must be in a binary format. As you can see, I switched “True” for 1 and “False” for 0.\n\nBinary transformation: df\\[“Transported”\\] = df\\[“Transported”\\].map({True:1, False:0})\n\nI also removed every row that had missing values in the “cabin\\_code” column.\n\n```\n#BINARY TRANSFORMATIONdf[\"Transported\"] = df[\"Transported\"].map({True:1, False:0})#DROPPING COLUMNSdf.drop(columns=[\"Cabin\",\"id_cabin\"], inplace=True)#DROPPING NULLSdf.dropna(subset=[\"cabin_code\"], inplace=True)\n```\n\nNow, we can finally split the data and proceed to develop our model.\n\nAfter splitting in train and test, I separated the test data into two categories: numerical and categorical. Why is that? We are going to perform different operations depending on the type of the variable. Categorical data must be encoded since most models are not able to understand categorical values and it must be converted to numerical values. Also, we are going to apply different techniques to fill the null values in our dataset, but I will talk more about it later on.\n\n```\n#Define X and yX = df.iloc[:,0:12]y = df[\"Transported\"]\n```\n\n```\n#Splitting DataX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X,y,random_state=42,test_size=0.25)\n```\n\n```\n#Separate categorical and numerical featurescat_feat = np.array([coluna for coluna in X_train.columns if X_train[coluna].dtype.name == 'object'])num_feat = np.array([coluna for coluna in X_train.columns if coluna not in cat_feat])\n```\n\nWe can now create our pipeline. There are going to be two pipelines: one is going to handle the categorical data and the other one is going to handle numerical data. The missing values of the categorical data will be filled with the most frequent value (mode) and after the Target Encoder will be applied to transform categorical variables into numerical variables. The numerical data missing values will be filled with a strategy called **K-nearest neighbors,** which uses the Euclidean distance between the data points to find the best number to fill the missing values. If don’t know how this Pipeline technique works, I recommend you check [my article about Pipelines.](https://medium.com/@fernandao.lacerda.dantas/boost-your-pipelines-with-columntransformer-b2c009db096f)\n\n```\n#Categorical and numerical pipelinescat_pipe = Pipeline([(\"imputer_cat\", SimpleImputer(strategy=\"most_frequent\")),(\"encoder\", ce.TargetEncoder()),                    ])num_pipe = Pipeline([(\"imputer_num\", KNNImputer(n_neighbors=3))])\n```\n\nAnd with column transformer, we can attach both transformations to one variable that I named “transformer”. Observe that we also have to specify the type of data to which the pipeline will be applied t...\n\n--- Result 5 ---\nTitle: Titanic dataset Analysis (~80% accuracy) - Analytics Vidhya - Medium\nURL: https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/titanic-dataset-analysis-80-accuracy-9480cf3db538\n\nContent:\n[Sitemap](https://medium.com/sitemap/sitemap.xml)\n\n[Open in app](https://rsci.app.link/?%24canonical_url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2Fp%2F9480cf3db538&%7Efeature=LoOpenInAppButton&%7Echannel=ShowPostUnderCollection&%7Estage=mobileNavBar&source=post_page---top_nav_layout_nav-----------------------------------------)\n\nSign up\n\n[Sign in](https://medium.com/m/signin?operation=login&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2Fanalytics-vidhya%2Ftitanic-dataset-analysis-80-accuracy-9480cf3db538&source=post_page---top_nav_layout_nav-----------------------global_nav------------------)\n\n[Medium Logo](https://medium.com/?source=post_page---top_nav_layout_nav-----------------------------------------)\n\n[Write](https://medium.com/m/signin?operation=register&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2Fnew-story&source=---top_nav_layout_nav-----------------------new_post_topnav------------------)\n\nSign up\n\n[Sign in](https://medium.com/m/signin?operation=login&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2Fanalytics-vidhya%2Ftitanic-dataset-analysis-80-accuracy-9480cf3db538&source=post_page---top_nav_layout_nav-----------------------global_nav------------------)\n\n[**Analytics Vidhya**](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya?source=post_page---publication_nav-7219b4dc6c4c-9480cf3db538---------------------------------------)\n\n·\n\nAnalytics Vidhya is a community of Generative AI and Data Science professionals.

RMS Titanic was a British passenger ship that hit an iceberg while on its voyage from Southampton to New York City, and sank in the North Atlantic ocean, leaving hundreds of passengers to die in the aftermath of the deadly incident. Some of the passengers who survived till help arrived were rescued while many lost their lives helplessly waiting for help to arrive.\n\nThe legendary Kaggle problem, [Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic), based on the tragedic sinking of the RMS Titanic records data about 891 passengers of RMS Titanic, and we are required to predict if they have survived or not, based on the information we have available about the passengers and the outcome after the sinking of the ship.\n\nNote: This notebook is my analysis of the titanic dataset to obtain any meaningful insights from the data and scores an accuracy of ~80 percent (top 5 percent of 14k entries on Kaggle) .\n\nLet’s get started!\n\n## Contents:\n\n1\\.

Then a bunch of numeric variables, like ids, ages of the passengers, etc. followed by categorical variables like class of the ticket, and strings like name, etc.\n\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\n\nExample RMS Titanic ticket : [Source](https://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/titanic-tickets/)\n\nPrinting first 5 rows of given dataset..\n\n## Problem definition and metrics\n\nThe problem is a **binary class classification** problem. We can use **binary crossentropy** or logistic loss as the loss function and any metric like **accuracy** or/and **ROC AUC score** as a metric to evaluate the results.\n\n## EDA\n\n### Correlation between features:\n\nDrawing insights from the correlation between features..\n\n- Fare and Pclass are negatively correlated (with a Pearson’s correlation coefficient of -0.55) ; Obviously, **higher fares imply better better ticket classes** (lower the class number) and vice versa.\n- Pclass and the target feature are moderately negatively correlated (-0.34) implying **better the ticket class, higher the chance of survival.**\n- A similar pattern can be observed with the features Parch, SibSp and Age; Both the features, Parch and SibSp are very slightly correlated with all the features except Age feature, and both have a negative correlation (-0.19 and -0.31 respectively) with Age ; **Lower the age, more the number of family accompanying the passenger**\n- SibSp and Parch features are positively correlated which are both indicative of the number of family members accompanying passenger\n- PClass and Age are negatively correlated (-0.37) implying **higher the age, better the ticket class**\n\n### Missing data\n\n**Age** : Contains 177 nan values out of 891 entries. Imputed with median gave best results.\n\n**Embarked** : Contains 2 nan values. Imputed with mode of existing data.\n\n**Cabin** : 687 out of 891 Cabin entries are nans, i.e. more than 50 percent of the total data exists as missing data or Nans so assumed its better to derive other features from this feature.\n\nNow, printing the correlation heatmap after handling missing data and converting categorical strings to encodings (0,1,2..)..\n\n- Embarked also has slight correlation with the target variable (-0.17), the **port at which the ship was boarded by the passengers did determine their chance of survival**\n- Sex is also highly correlated with the target variable (-0.54), indicating the **passenger’s gender had a high effect on their chance of survival**\n- Embarked and Fare of the passengers are negatively correlated (-0.22); obviously, fare depends on the port a passenger boards the ship from.\n- Embarked and Sex also seem slightly correlated (0.11) indicating the **port the passenger boarded from was dependent on the gender of the passenger**; Embarked and Pclass are also correlated (0.16) indicating a **1st class passenger probably boarded at a different port than a 3rd class passenger**.\n- Sex and Fare, Sex and Parch, SibSp, Sex and Pclass all seem slightly correlated (-0.18, -0.25, -0.11, 0.13 respectively); i.e the **fare the passenger paid, the family aboard, and the class of the ticket was seem slightly dependent on the gender of the passenger**.\n\n**Question 1: How do the features ‘Age’, ‘Sex’, ‘Fare’, ‘Embarked’ affect the chance of a passenger’s survival?**\n\nAge :\n\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\n\n- Both distributions, of people who didn’t survive and the ones who did, are normal with a spike around age 30 for passengers who did not survive i.e. for **people around the age 30 had a higher chance of not surviving**\n- People of ages > ~51 are considered outliers in the distribution of people who did not survive. owing to the fact **people above the age of ~51 are very less** and people of age ~55 above are outliers in the distribution of people who did survive, i.e. **very few people above ~55 actually did survive**\n\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\n\nSex:\n\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\n\n- From the above stacked plots, it is clear **more percentage of female passengers survived** i.e. 74.2 % while only 18.9 % of male passengers survived, even though more male passesngers were aboard\n\nFare :\n\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\n\n- Distribution of fares of survivors clearly has a higher median value, hence **passengers who survived had higher average fares**\n- Lots of outliers in the distribution of both\n- A huge spike in the distribution of the people who didn’t survive, or the probability that the person who didn’t survive had a fare of ~10 units of currency is very high\n\nEmbarked:\n\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\n\n- Maximum passengers seem to have boarded the ship at Southampton port and only 33 percent of them survived; out of the total passengers who boarded the ship at Queenstown, a simi...\n\n--- Result 6 ---\nTitle: Search code, repositories, users, issues, pull requests...\nURL: https://github.com/SamanthaZhang25/Kaggle-Titanic--Machine-Learning--Random-Forest-78.708\n\nContent:\nGitHub - SamanthaZhang25/Kaggle-Titanic--Machine-Learning--Random-Forest-78.708: Predict Titanic survival using targeted feature engineering (Cabin presence, FamilySize, IsAlone, Title, Age bins) and compare popular models (RF, SVM, KNN, XGBoost, LightGBM).

The notebooks are named in pseudo-chronological order. I say \"pseudo\" because whenever I revisited a process, I edited the relevant existing notebook without creating a new one. Hence, some code and results in earlier notebooks may not have been used in the next few notebooks, but were used at some point in the entire project.\n\n## Exploratory Data Analysis\n\nFirst, I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on all features in the dataset ( [1\\. EDA.ipynb](https://github.com/chrischow/kaggle_titanic/blob/master/Notebooks/1.%20EDA.ipynb)). Concurrently, I cleaned the data and generated new features.\n\n## Modelling\n\n### Random Forest ( `sklearn`)\n\nNext, I experimented with the `sklearn` implementation of Random Forest ( [2\\. Random Forest - Low Depth.ipynb](https://github.com/chrischow/kaggle_titanic/blob/master/Notebooks/2.%20Random%20Forest%20-%20Low%20Depth.ipynb)). By the final iteration in the optimisation process, the accuracy was **82.47%**. However, the `sklearn` implementation ( `RandomForestClassifier`) was extremely slow. Hence, I switched over to the `lightgbm` implementation of the Random Forest algorithm.\n\n### Random Forest ( `lightgbm`)\n\nThe `lightgbm` implementation of the Random Forest algorithm was **much** faster. The subsequent three notebooks captured my attempts at figuring out the best sequence for the tuning of parameters. The best approach was to:\n\n1. Tune the number of trees/estimators\n2. Perform Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) with cross-validation (CV)\n3. Tune the proportion of observations sampled\n4. Tune the maximum features used per split\n5. Tune the minimum samples in each terminal node\n6. Tune alpha, the L1 regularisation parameter\n7. Tune lambda, the L1 regularisation parameter\n\nThis tuning sequence resulted in a 5-fold CV test score of **83.46%**.\n\n### Regenerating Features\n\nThen, I realised that I made a mistake in the feature generation process. I had generated encoded features using the entire training set. This resulted in contamination, which meant that the pseudo-test sets in CV contained information about the target, and this could have inflated the test scores. Instead, I should have (1) performed data cleaning on the competition training and test sets together, (2) encoded the training set while saving the mappings, and (3) performed mappings on the test set. Hence, I created the [`kaggle_titanic` module](https://github.com/chrischow/kaggle_titanic/blob/master/Modules/kaggle_titanic.py) to perform these three data cleaning functions, and many other functions for machine learning.\n\n### Model Tuning I - Improper Cross Validation\n\nI created pipelines for performing feature selection for and tuning the various models:\n\n1. LightGBM RF with low depth\n2. LightGBM RF with high depth\n3. LightGBM GBM with low depth\n4. LightGBM GBM with high depth\n5. XGBoost GBM with low depth\n6. XGBoost GBM with high depth\n7. Logistic Regression\n8. Ridge Regression\n9. Linear Support Vector Classifier (SVC)\n\nHaving completed the tuning for the above models, I discovered another source of contamination: in the cross validation process. I was using cross validation to both (1) tune hyperparameters and (2) score models. These two processes should have been separate. The correct way to have performed cross validation was:\n\n1. Split data into **meta folds** (e.g. 5 repeats of 5 folds)\n2. For each **meta fold**:\na. Split training data into folds (e.g. 5 repeats of 5 folds)\nb. Run feature selection and hyperparameter tuning algorithms using cross validation\nc. Score the model on the test set of the **meta fold**\nd. Move on to next **meta fold** and repeat\n3. Evaluate results for all **meta folds**\n\nThe first important thing I learned was that although feature selection and parameter tuning require cross validation, **all processes from data cleaning to feature generation to feature selection to hyperparameter tuning** require cross validation as well. In other words, **cross validation should be used to validate the full approach**. My mistake was that I saw hyperparameter tuning with cross validation as the end stage of testing. This was wrong. The second important thing I learned was that it was better to place feature selection before hyperparameter tuning. This is because changes in hyperparameter levels do not change how important or unimportant the features are. We only need the initial parameters for running RFE to not prevent the algorithm from letting the important features surface. For example, in tree-based models, increasing the number of trees, depth, or features sampled per tree would help to ensure that sufficient features are evaluated. The tradeoff to increasing these hyperparameters would be the computational cost. These two objectives should be balanced well.\n\n## About\n\nKaggle Competition - Titanic Dataset\n\n### Resources\n\n[Readme](https://github.com/chrischow/kaggle_titanic#readme-ov-file)\n\n[Activity](https://github.com/chrischow/kaggle_titanic/activity)\n\n### Stars\n\n[**1**\\\nstar](https://github.com/chrischow/kaggle_titanic/stargazers)\n\n### Watchers\n\n[**2**\\\nwatching](https://github.com/chrischow/kaggle_titanic/watchers)\n\n### Forks\n\n[**0**\\\nforks](https://github.com/chrischow/kaggle_titanic/forks)\n\n[Report repository](https:...\n\n--- Result 8 ---\nTitle: Building a Classification Model To Score 80+% Accuracy on the Spaceship Titanic Kaggle Dataset\nURL: https://pub.towardsai.net/building-a-classification-model-to-score-80-accuracy-on-the-spaceship-titanic-kaggle-dataset-40a0aa184c1c\n\nContent:\nBuilding a Classification Model To Score 80+% Accuracy on the Spaceship Titanic Kaggle Dataset | by Devang Chavda | Towards AI\n[Sitemap](https://pub.towardsai.net/sitemap/sitemap.xml)\n[Open in app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.medium.reader&amp;referrer=utm_source=mobileNavBar&amp;source=post_page---top_nav_layout_nav-----------------------------------------)\nSign up\n[Sign in](https://medium.com/m/signin?operation=login&amp;redirect=https://pub.towardsai.net/building-a-classification-model-to-score-80-accuracy-on-the-spaceship-titanic-kaggle-dataset-40a0aa184c1c&amp;source=post_page---top_nav_layout_nav-----------------------global_nav------------------)\n[Medium Logo](https://medium.com/?source=post_page---top_nav_layout_nav-----------------------------------------)\n[\nWrite\n](https://medium.com/m/signin?operation=register&amp;redirect=https://medium.com/new-story&amp;source=---top_nav_layout_nav-----------------------new_post_topnav------\n\n[... truncated 15258 characters ...]",

Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.\\n\\nWhile there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.\\n\\nIn this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).\\n\\n> #### Recommended Tutorial\\n> We highly recommend [Alexis Cook’s Titanic Tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/titanic-tutorial) that walks you through making your very first submission step by step and [this starter notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/gusthema/titanic-competition-w-tensorflow-decision-forests) to get started.\\n\\n## How Kaggle’s Competitions Work\\n1. **Join the Competition**\\nRead about the challenge description, accept the Competition Rules and gain access to the competition dataset.\\n1.  **Get to Work**\\nDownload the data, build models on it locally or on Kaggle Notebooks (our no-setup, customizable Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs) and generate a prediction file.\\n1.  **Make a Submission**\\nUpload your prediction as a submission on Kaggle and receive an accuracy score.\\n1.  **Check the Leaderboard**\\nSee how your model ranks against other Kagglers on our leaderboard. \\n1.  **Improve Your Score**\\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a> to find lots of tutorials and insights from other competitors.\\n\\n> #### Kaggle Lingo Video\\n> You may run into unfamiliar lingo as you dig into the Kaggle discussion forums and public notebooks.

It’s your job to predict these outcomes.\\n\\nUsing the patterns you find in the `train.csv` data, predict whether the other 418 passengers on board (found in `test.csv`) survived.\\n\\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data\">“Data” tab</a> to explore the datasets even further. Once you feel you’ve created a competitive model, submit it to Kaggle to see where your model stands on our leaderboard against other Kagglers.\\n\\n## How to Submit your Prediction to Kaggle\\nOnce you’re ready to make a submission and get on the leaderboard:\\n\\n1. Click on the “Submit Predictions” button\\n<img width=\"699\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen1.png\">\\n1.

Your submission will show an error if you have extra columns (beyond `PassengerId` and `Survived`) or rows.\\n\\nThe file should have exactly 2 columns:\\n- `PassengerId` (sorted in any order)\\n- `Survived` (contains your binary predictions: 1 for survived, 0 for deceased)\\n\\n## Got it! I’m ready to get started. Where do I get help if I need it?\\n- For Competition Help: <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\">Titanic Discussion Forum</a>\\n\\nKaggle doesn’t have a dedicated team to help troubleshoot your code so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. The forums are full of useful information on the data, metric, and different approaches. We encourage you to use the forums often. If you share your knowledge, you\\'ll find that others will share a lot in turn!\\n\\n## A Last Word on Kaggle Notebooks\\nAs we mentioned before, Kaggle Notebooks is our no-setup, customizable, Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs and a huge repository of community published data &amp; code.\\n\\nIn every competition, you’ll find many Notebooks shared with incredible insights. It’s an invaluable resource worth becoming familiar with.

They are a great place to begin if you are new to data science or just finished a MOOC and want to get involved in Kaggle.</p>\\n<p>Getting Started competitions are a non-competitive way to get familiar with Kaggle’s platform, learn basic machine learning concepts, and start meeting people in the community. They have no cash prize and are on a rolling timeline.</p>\\n<h2>How do I create and manage a team?</h2>\\n<p>When you accept the competition rules, a team will be created for you. You can invite others to your team, accept a merger with another team, and update basic information like team name by going to the More &gt; <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/team\" target=\"_blank\">Team</a> page.</p>\\n<p>We\\'ve heard from many Kagglers that teaming up is the best way to learn new skills AND have fun. If you don\\'t have a teammate already, consider asking if anyone wants to team up in the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a>.</p>\\n<h2>What are Notebooks?</h2>\\n<p>Kaggle Notebooks is a cloud computational environment that enables reproducible and collaborative analysis. Notebooks support scripts in Python and R, Jupyter Notebooks, and RMarkdown reports. You can visit the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/notebooks\" target=\"_blank\">Notebooks</a> tab to view all of the publicly shared code for the Titanic competition. For more on how to use Notebooks to learn data science, check out our <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview\" target=\"&quot;_blank\">Courses</a>!</p>\\n<h2>Why did my team disappear from the leaderboard?</h2>\\n<p>To keep with the spirit of getting-started competitions, we have implemented a two month rolling window on submissions. Once a submission is more than two months old, it will be invalidated and no longer count towards the leaderboard.</p>\\n<p>If your team has no submissions in the previous two months, the team will also drop from the leaderboard. This will keep the leaderboard at a manageable size, freshen it up, and prevent newcomers from getting lost in a sea of abandoned scores.</p>\\n<p><i>\"I worked so hard to get that score! Give it back!\"</i> Read more about our decision to implement a rolling leaderboard <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion/6240\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\\n<h2>How do I contact Support?</h2>\\n<p>Kaggle does not have a dedicated support team so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. (For this competition, you’ll want to use the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">Titanic discussion forum)</a>.</p>\\n<p>Support is only able to help with issues that are being experienced by all participants. Before contacting support, please check the discussion forum for information on your problem. If you can’t find it, you can post your problem in the forum so a fellow participant or a Kaggle team member can provide help.

If you don\\'t understand something in the code the print() function is your best friend. In coding, it\\'s okay to try, fail, and try again. If you do run into problems, Google is your second best friend, because 99.99% of the time, someone else had the same question/problem and already asked the coding community. If you\\'ve exhausted all your resources, the Kaggle Community via forums and comments can help too.\",\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"metadata\":{\"_cell_guid\":\"ea24845a-4a15-4235-9ed2-4823acbf4317\",\"_uuid\":\"89022d89e1603ef3869a96b9da78da38b0b33b14\"}},{\"source\":\"<a id=\\\\\"ch1\\\\\"></a>\\\\n# How a Data Scientist Beat the Odds\\\\nIt\\'s the classical problem, predict the outcome of a binary event. In laymen terms this means, it either occurred or did not occur. For example, you won or did not win, you passed the test or did not pass the test, you were accepted or not accepted, and you get the point. A common business application is churn or customer retention. Another popular use case is, healthcare\\'s mortality rate or survival analysis. Binary events create an interesting dynamic, because we know statistically, a random guess should achieve a 50% accuracy rate, without creating one single algorithm or writing one single line of code. However, just like autocorrect spellcheck technology, sometimes we humans can be too smart for our own good and actually underperform a coin flip. In this kernel, I use Kaggle\\'s Getting Started Competition, Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster, to walk the reader through, how-to use the data science framework to beat the odds.\\\\n   \\\\n*What happens when technology is too smart for its own good?*\\\\n![Funny Autocorrect](http://15858-presscdn-0-65.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/hilarious-autocorrect-fails-20x.jpg)\",\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"metadata\":{\"_cell_guid\":\"ec31d549-537e-4f35-8594-22ef03079081\",\"_uuid\":\"ff6c70c884a8a5fb3258e7f3fefc9e55261df1df\"}},{\"source\":\"<a id=\\\\\"ch2\\\\\"></a>\\\\n# A Data Science Framework\\\\n1. **Define the Problem:** If data science, big data, machine learning, predictive analytics, business intelligence, or any other buzzword is the solution, then what is the problem? As the saying goes, don\\'t put the cart before the horse. Problems before requirements, requirements before solutions, solutions before design, and design before technology. Too often we are quick to jump on the new shiny technology, tool, or algorithm before determining the actual problem we are trying to solve.\\\\n2. **Gather the Data:** John Naisbitt wrote in his 1984 (yes, 1984) book Megatrends, we are “drowning in data, yet staving for knowledge.\\\\\" So, chances are, the dataset(s) already exist somewhere, in some format. It may be external or internal, structured or unstructured, static or streamed, objective or subjective, etc. As the saying goes, you don\\'t have to reinvent the wheel, you just have to know where to find it. In the next step, we will worry about transforming \\\\\"dirty data\\\\\" to \\\\\"clean data.\\\\\"\\\\n3. **Prepare Data for Consumption:** This step is often referred to as data wrangling, a required process to turn “wild” data into “manageable” data. Data wrangling includes implementing data architectures for storage and processing, developing data governance standards for quality and control, data extraction (i.e. ETL and web scraping), and data cleaning to identify aberrant, missing, or outlier data points.\\\\n4. **Perform Exploratory Analysis:** Anybody who has ever worked with data knows, garbage-in, garbage-out (GIGO). Therefore, it is important to deploy descriptive and graphical statistics to look for potential problems, patterns, classifications, correlations and comparisons in the dataset. In addition, data categorization (i.e. qualitative vs quantitative) is also important to understand and select the correct hypothesis test or data model.\\\\n5. **Model Data:** Like descriptive and inferential statistics, data modeling can either summarize the data or predict future outcomes. Your dataset and expected results, will determine the algorithms available for use. It\\'s important to remember, algorithms are tools and not magical wands or silver bullets. You must still be the master craft (wo)man that knows how-to select the right tool for the job. An analogy would be asking someone to hand you a Philip screwdriver, and they hand you a flathead screwdriver or worst a hammer. At best, it shows a complete lack of understanding. At worst, it makes completing the project impossible. The same is true in data modelling. The wrong model can lead to poor performance at best and the wrong conclusion (that’s used as actionable intelligence) at worst.\\\\n6. **Validate and Implement Data Model:** After you\\'ve trained your model based on a subset of your data, it\\'s time to test your model. This helps ensure you haven\\'t overfit your model or made it so specific to the selected subset, that it does not accurately fit another subset from the same dataset. In this step we determine if our [model overfit, generalize, or underfit our dataset](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/latest/dg/model-fit-underfitting-vs-overfitting.html).\\\\n7. **Optimize and Strategize:** This is the \\\\\"bionic man\\\\\" step, where you iterate back through the process to make it better...stronger...faster than it was before. As a data scientist, your strategy should be to outsource developer operations and application plumbing, so you have more time to focus on recommendations and design. Once you\\'re able to package your ideas, this becomes your “currency exchange\\\\\" rate.\",\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"metadata\":{\"_cell_guid\":\"8514a868-6816-494a-9e9c-dba14cb36f42\",\"_uuid\":\"bd2a68dcaace0c1371f2994f0204dce65800cc20\"}},{\"source\":\"<a id=\\\\\"ch3\\\\\"></a>\\\\n# Step 1: Define the Problem\\\\nFor this project, the problem statement is given to us on a golden plater, develop an algorithm to predict the survival outcome of passengers on the Titanic.\\\\n\\\\n......\\\\n\\\\n**Project Summary:**\\\\nThe sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.\\\\n\\\\nOne of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.\\\\n\\\\nIn this challenge, we ask you to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular, we ask you to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.\\\\n\\\\nPractice Skills\\\\n* Binary classification\\\\n* Python and R basics\\\\n\\\\n# Step 2: Gather the Data\\\\n\\\\nThe dataset is also given to us on a golden plater with test and train data at [Kaggle\\'s Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)\\\\n\",\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"metadata\":{\"_cell_guid\":\"22ba49b5-b3b6-4129-8c57-623e0d863ab3\",\"_uuid\":\"ff014109d795c5d1bfcc66c9761730406124ebe4\"}},{\"source\":\"<a id=\\\\\"ch4\\\\\"></a>\\\\n# Step 3: Prepare Data for Consumption\\\\nSince step 2 was provided to us on a golden plater, so is step 3.

Using the same dataset and different implementation of a decision tree (adaboost, random forest, gradient boost, xgboost, etc.) with tuning does not exceed the 0.77990 submission accuracy. Interesting for this dataset, the simple decision tree algorithm had the best default submission score and with tuning achieved the same best accuracy score.\\\\n\\\\nWhile no general conclusions can be made from testing a handful of algorithms on a single dataset, there are several observations on the mentioned dataset. \\\\n1. The train dataset has a different distribution than the test/validation dataset and population. This created wide margins between the cross validation (CV) accuracy score and Kaggle submission accuracy score.\\\\n2. Given the same dataset, decision tree based algorithms, seemed to converge on the same accuracy score after proper tuning.\\\\n3. Despite tuning, no machine learning algorithm, exceeded the homemade algorithm. The author will theorize, that for small datasets, a manmade algorithm is the bar to beat. \\\\n\\\\nWith that in mind, for iteration two, I would spend more time on preprocessing and feature engineering. In order to better align the CV score and Kaggle score and improve the overall accuracy.\\\\n\\\\n\",\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"metadata\":{\"_cell_guid\":\"a6d34edc-1265-41e8-b163-0b817cd3b6a5\",\"_uuid\":\"c476df95925d67809975caca4ea4dcb4b2a0b277\"}},{\"source\":\"<a id=\\\\\"ch90\\\\\"></a>\\\\n## Change Log:\\\\n11/22/17 Please note, this kernel is currently in progress, but open to feedback.

In a nutshell stacking uses as a first-level (base), the predictions of a few basic classifiers and then uses another model at the second-level to predict the output from the earlier first-level predictions.\\\\n\\\\nThe Titanic dataset is a prime candidate for introducing this concept as many newcomers to Kaggle start out here. Furthermore even though stacking has been responsible for many a team winning Kaggle competitions there seems to be a dearth of kernels on this topic so I hope this notebook can fill somewhat of that void.\\\\n\\\\nI myself am quite a newcomer to the Kaggle scene as well and the first proper ensembling/stacking script that I managed to chance upon and study was one written in the AllState Severity Claims competition by the great Faron. The material in this notebook borrows heavily from Faron\\'s script although ported to factor in ensembles of classifiers whilst his was ensembles of regressors. Anyway please check out his script here:\\\\n\\\\n[Stacking Starter][1] : by Faron \\\\n\\\\n\\\\nNow onto the notebook at hand and I hope that it manages to do justice and convey the concept of ensembling in an intuitive and concise manner.  My other standalone Kaggle [script][2] which implements exactly the same ensembling steps (albeit with different parameters) discussed below gives a Public LB score of 0.808 which is good enough to get to the top 9% and runs just under 4 minutes. Therefore I am pretty sure there is a lot of room to improve and add on to that script.

However many will skip some of the explanation on how the solution is developed as these notebooks are developed by experts for experts. The objective of this notebook is to follow a step-by-step workflow, explaining each step and rationale for every decision we take during solution development.\\\\n\\\\n## Workflow stages\\\\n\\\\nThe competition solution workflow goes through seven stages described in the Data Science Solutions book.\\\\n\\\\n1. Question or problem definition.\\\\n2. Acquire training and testing data.\\\\n3. Wrangle, prepare, cleanse the data.\\\\n4. Analyze, identify patterns, and explore the data.\\\\n5. Model, predict and solve the problem.\\\\n6. Visualize, report, and present the problem solving steps and final solution.\\\\n7. Supply or submit the results.\\\\n\\\\nThe workflow indicates general sequence of how each stage may follow the other. However there are use cases with exceptions.\\\\n\\\\n- We may combine mulitple workflow stages. We may analyze by visualizing data.\\\\n- Perform a stage earlier than indicated. We may analyze data before and after wrangling.\\\\n- Perform a stage multiple times in our workflow. Visualize stage may be used multiple times.\\\\n- Drop a stage altogether. We may not need supply stage to productize or service enable our dataset for a competition.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Question and problem definition\\\\n\\\\nCompetition sites like Kaggle define the problem to solve or questions to ask while providing the datasets for training your data science model and testing the model results against a test dataset. The question or problem definition for Titanic Survival competition is [described here at Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).\\\\n\\\\n> Knowing from a training set of samples listing passengers who survived or did not survive the Titanic disaster, can our model determine based on a given test dataset not containing the survival information, if these passengers in the test dataset survived or not.\\\\n\\\\nWe may also want to develop some early understanding about the domain of our problem. This is described on the [Kaggle competition description page here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). Here are the highlights to note.\\\\n\\\\n- On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. Translated 32% survival rate.\\\\n- One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew.\\\\n- Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.\\\\n\\\\n## Workflow goals\\\\n\\\\nThe data science solutions workflow solves for seven major goals.\\\\n\\\\n**Classifying.** We may want to classify or categorize our samples. We may also want to understand the implications or correlation of different classes with our solution goal.\\\\n\\\\n**Correlating.** One can approach the problem based on available features within the training dataset. Which features within the dataset contribute significantly to our solution goal? Statistically speaking is there a [correlation](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Correlation) among a feature and solution goal? As the feature values change does the solution state change as well, and visa-versa? This can be tested both for numerical and categorical features in the given dataset. We may also want to determine correlation among features other than survival for subsequent goals and workflow stages. Correlating certain features may help in creating, completing, or correcting features.\\\\n\\\\n**Converting.** For modeling stage, one needs to prepare the data. Depending on the choice of model algorithm one may require all features to be converted to numerical equivalent values. So for instance converting text categorical values to numeric values.\\\\n\\\\n**Completing.** Data preparation may also require us to estimate any missing values within a feature. Model algorithms may work best when there are no missing values.\\\\n\\\\n**Correcting.** We may also analyze the given training dataset for errors or possibly innacurate values within features and try to corrent these values or exclude the samples containing the errors. One way to do this is to detect any outliers among our samples or features. We may also completely discard a feature if it is not contribting to the analysis or may significantly skew the results.\\\\n\\\\n**Creating.** Can we create new features based on an existing feature or a set of features, such that the new feature follows the correlation, conversion, completeness goals.\\\\n\\\\n**Charting.** How to select the right visualization plots and charts depending on nature of the data and the solution goals.\"},{\"metadata\":{\"_uuid\":\"960f8b1937dc4915ce1eb0f82614b1985c4321a4\",\"_cell_guid\":\"56a3be4e-76ef-20c6-25e8-da16147cf6d7\"},\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"source\":\"## Refactor Release 2017-Jan-29\\\\n\\\\nWe are significantly refactoring the notebook based on (a) comments received by readers, (b) issues in porting notebook from Jupyter kernel (2.7) to Kaggle kernel (3.5), and (c) review of few more best practice kernels.\\\\n\\\\n### User comments\\\\n\\\\n- Combine training and test data for certain operations like converting titles across dataset to numerical values.

On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships\\n\\nOne of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.\\n\\n## Cross validation results\\n\\nAfter applying the appropriate preprocessing, each model was evaluated using 10-fold cross validation.

This study enhances Titanic survival prediction through advanced \\nfeature engineering and ensemble model optimization. The Titanic dataset \\npresents a classic binary classification problem requiring the prediction of \\npassenger survival based on demographic and ticket information. Our \\nmethodology employs systematic preprocessing where missing values are \\nintelligently imputed, including eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) \\npredictions for age values. Novel features were extracted from passenger \\nnames, cabin information, and family relationships to improve predictive \\npower. Feature importance was evaluated using Random Forest and XGBoost \\nalgorithms, with SelectFromModel and Recursive Feature Elimination applied \\nfor effective feature selection. Three classification algorithms—logistic \\nregression, random forest, and XGBoost—were systematically optimized using \\ngrid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization techniques. Based on \\nthese optimized models, soft voting and stacking ensemble approaches were \\nimplemented. Cross-validation results demonstrate that ensemble methods \\nachieved superior accuracy (0.8361) compared to individual models: logistic \\nregression (0.8339), random forest (0.8350), and XGBoost (0.8204). This \\nresearch provides valuable optimization strategies for similar classification \\ntasks, particularly highlighting how feature engineering combined with \\nensemble methods can substantially enhance predictive performance while \\nmaintaining computational efficiency. \\nKeywords: Titanic Survival Prediction, Feature Engineering, Ensemble \\nLearning, Hyperparameter Tuning. \\n1 Introduction \\nThe collision of the Titanic with an iceberg in 1912 was the cause of this catastrophe \\nthat left 1,517 lives lost and is one of the most dangerous maritime accidents of the \\ntwentieth century. Its historical significance and the multidimensional nature of \\npassenger data (including social class, gender, age, family relationships, etc.) have \\nestablished it as a classic binary classification benchmark dataset in machine learning. \\n© The Author(s) 2025\\nY. Sun (ed.), Proceedings of the 2025 3rd International Conference on Image, Algorithms, and Artificial\\nIntelligence (ICIAAI 2025), Advances in Computer Science Research 122,\\nhttps://doi.org/10.2991/978-94-6463-823-3_19\\n208 H. Li\\nDespite extensive research on this problem, traditional methods exhibit \\nsignificant limitations. Early studies predominantly focused on the direct application \\nof basic features, achieving prediction accuracy generally below 80% [1]. For \\ninstance, simple rules based on gender and passenger class could rapidly distinguish \\nsurvival groups. However, these methods failed to fully explore nonlinear interactions \\nbetween features and higher-order features. Moreover, approximately 20% of the age \\nfield and 68% of the cabin number field (Cabin) are missing in the dataset. Traditional \\napproaches often rely on mean imputation or directly delete missing values, leading to \\ninformation loss and model bias [2]. \\nAccording to previous research, traditional classification methods applied to the \\nTitanic dataset achieved limited accuracy. These methods were constrained by their \\ninability to capture complex feature interactions and their sensitivity to missing values \\n[2]. Simultaneously, traditional methods predominantly depend on single models such \\nas logistic regression and decision trees without conducting feature importance \\nselection, resulting in lower prediction accuracy [3]. Recent studies have introduced \\nensemble models but have not systematically compared their performance with single \\nmodels, nor explored how different hyperparameter tuning methods influence \\nprediction model performance in this dataset. \\nTo address these challenges, this study employs advanced feature engineering \\ntechniques to extract new features, utilizes the relationships between features and \\neXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) for missing value imputation, applies feature \\nselection techniques like random forests and XGBoost to identify key features for \\nsurvival prediction, and performs hyperparameter tuning of logistic regression, \\nrandom forests, and XGBoost models using grid search, random search, and Bayesian \\noptimization. Based on these methods, soft voting and stacking ensemble models are \\ntrained, and the performance of models under various parameter conditions is further \\ncompared. \\n2 Methods \\n2.1 DataSet \\nThis study is based on the Titanic dataset provided by the Kaggle platform [4]. The \\ndataset consists of two CSV files: the training set and the test set. The training set \\ncontains 891 samples, while the test set contains 418 samples. The data features \\ninclude PassengerId, Name, Pclass, Sex, Age, SibSp, Parch, Ticket, Fare, Cabin, and \\nEmbarked. Additionally, the training set includes an additional target variable, \\n\"Survived\". Analysis reveals missing values in the Age, Cabin, and Embarked \\ncolumns in the training set, and the Age, Cabin, and Fare columns in the test set, with \\nAge and Cabin having a relatively high proportion of missing values [2]. \\n2.2 Data Processing \\nTo facilitate data processing, this study first combined the training set and the test set\\nto form a complete dataset, called the \"merged set\". The missing values in the\\nTitanic Survival Prediction Enhanced by Innovative Feature … 209\\nEmbarked and Fare columns, which had relatively few missing values, were filled \\nfirst. By analyzing the sample features corresponding to the missing values in \\nEmbarked, it was found that these samples all had a Pclass of 1, a Fare of 80.0, a \\nCabin of B28, and a Sex of female. Considering the correlations between features, a \\nstrong relationship among Pclass, Fare, and Embarked was assumed. Based on this \\nassumption, box plots of Fare distribution under different combinations of Embarked \\nand Pclass were created (Figure 1), and it was determined that when Fare is 80 and \\nPclass is 1, Embarked is more likely to be \\'C\\'. Therefore, the missing Embarked \\nvalues were filled with \\'C\\'. Similarly, for cases where Embarked = \\'S\\' and Pclass = 3, \\nthe median Fare was calculated and used to fill missing Fare values in the test set [2]. \\nFig. 1. Fare Distribution by Embarked and Pclass (Photo/Picture credit: Original). \\nNext, the Cabin column was processed. Due to the high number of missing values, the \\nanalysis was based only on available information. Records with Cabin information \\nwere filtered, and the distribution of cabin classes between survivors and \\nnon-survivors was compared. Cabin values containing multiple cabins were split into \\nlists, and the data was expanded row-wise to generate new features. Two new features \\nwere extracted: Deck (the letter part, filled with \"U\" if none) and Cabin number (the \\nnumeric part, converted to a numeric type). The Cabin number was further binned, \\nand survival rates within different intervals were analyzed [5]. The analysis revealed \\nthat passengers in cabin numbers ranging from 0-50 had a survival rate of \\napproximately 45%, while those in ranges 51-100 showed a higher survival rate of \\naround 60%. Passengers in cabin numbers above 100 had mixed survival rates, \\nranging from 40% to 55%, depending on the specific range. Meanwhile, specific \\nsurvival rates for each Deck were calculated, which showed notable variations: Deck \\nB had the highest survival rate at approximately 74%, followed by Decks D and E at \\naround 75% and 75%, respectively, while Deck U (unknown) had the lowest survival \\nrate at about 30%. Finally, the expanded data was re-aggregated into the original \\nmerged dataset (Fig. 1). \\nThe Title (such as \"Mr\", \"Mrs\") was extracted from the Name column as a new\\nfeature.

Given a dataset, we are required to predict which passengers were transported or not by an “anomaly” using records recovered from the spaceship’s damaged computer system. The “lore” of the competition is not so important, what you need to know is to develop a machine learning algorithm capable of correctly predicting the outcome of the spaceship’s passengers.\\n\\n## Import libraries\\n\\n```\\nimport pandas as pdimport numpy as npimport matplotlib.pyplot as pltimport seaborn as snsfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split,GridSearchCV,cross_val_score,StratifiedKFoldimport xgboost as xgbimport category_encoders as cefrom sklearn.impute import SimpleImputerfrom sklearn.pipeline import Pipelinefrom sklearn.pipeline import make_pipelinefrom sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformerfrom sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, roc_auc_score, precision_score, recall_score,f1_score, confusion_matrixfrom category_encoders import TargetEncoderfrom sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer,KNNImputerfrom lightgbm import LGBMClassifier\\n```\\n\\n## Let’s Start\\n\\nAs you can see, after I loaded the dataset, I removed both the “Passenger Id” and “Name” columns. They are not going to provide any useful or important information to the prediction. Someone’s name or Id does not change the probability of being Transported.\\n\\n```\\ndf = pd.read_csv(\"train.csv\")df.drop(columns=[\"PassengerId\",\"Name\"],inplace=True)\\n```\\n\\nNow, we are going to discuss a fundamental step I came across after trying to improve my score a thousand times. This step relies on exploring the “Cabin” column. Notice that the rows on the “Cabin” column follow a specific pattern. Something like this: “A/5/S”, “C/1/S”, “F/7/P”. And I decided to investigate it. So, to make things simple I split the rows of the “Cabin” into three columns based on both slashes (”/”) of the rows. For example, the “A/5/S” row would be transformed into three new columns: The first one is named “cabin\\\\_code” referring tothe character behind the first slash (A). The second one named “id\\\\_cabin” refers to the character behind the second slash (5). The third one named “cabin\\\\_sector” refers to the character after the second slash (S). And we end up with three new columns.\\n\\n```\\n#Splittingdf[[\"cabin_code\",\"id_cabin\",\"cabin_sector\"]] = df[\"Cabin\"].str.split(\"/\", n=2, expand=True)df.head(4)\\n```\\n\\nFirst of all, I noticed that “cabin\\\\_code” only has 8 different characters which means that the cabins are, somehow, divided into 8 sections.\\n\\nAlso, I asked myself if passengers from a specific section had a higher chance of being transported or if this statement was not true. With the plot below we can conclude that passengers from the B and C sections have a greater chance of surviving and passengers from the E section have a lower chance of surviving.\\n\\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\\n\\nI did the same thing with the “cabin\\\\_sector” column and also noticed that there was a difference between the sectors. Passengers from the P sector have a lower chance of being transported, while in the S sector, the opposite happens.\\n\\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\\n\\nThis means that this exploration of the original “Cabin” column is worth it since new insights are being added to the model.\\n\\nNow, we can finally delete the “Cabin” column. It will not provide any useful information for the model anymore. We have already extracted everything useful from it.\\n\\nI also removed the “cabin\\\\_id” and the column that I had created. As I said before, the Id will not interfere with the model’s predictive ability.\\n\\nSo used: df.drop(columns=\\\\[“Cabin”,”id\\\\_cabin”\\\\], inplace=True) to drop both columns\\n\\nBefore splitting our data, the “Transported” column must be in a binary format. As you can see, I switched “True” for 1 and “False” for 0.\\n\\nBinary transformation: df\\\\[“Transported”\\\\] = df\\\\[“Transported”\\\\].map({True:1, False:0})\\n\\nI also removed every row that had missing values in the “cabin\\\\_code” column.\\n\\n```\\n#BINARY TRANSFORMATIONdf[\"Transported\"] = df[\"Transported\"].map({True:1, False:0})#DROPPING COLUMNSdf.drop(columns=[\"Cabin\",\"id_cabin\"], inplace=True)#DROPPING NULLSdf.dropna(subset=[\"cabin_code\"], inplace=True)\\n```\\n\\nNow, we can finally split the data and proceed to develop our model.\\n\\nAfter splitting in train and test, I separated the test data into two categories: numerical and categorical. Why is that? We are going to perform different operations depending on the type of the variable. Categorical data must be encoded since most models are not able to understand categorical values and it must be converted to numerical values. Also, we are going to apply different techniques to fill the null values in our dataset, but I will talk more about it later on.\\n\\n```\\n#Define X and yX = df.iloc[:,0:12]y = df[\"Transported\"]\\n```\\n\\n```\\n#Splitting DataX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X,y,random_state=42,test_size=0.25)\\n```\\n\\n```\\n#Separate categorical and numerical featurescat_feat = np.array([coluna for coluna in X_train.columns if X_train[coluna].dtype.name == \\'object\\'])num_feat = np.array([coluna for coluna in X_train.columns if coluna not in cat_feat])\\n```\\n\\nWe can now create our pipeline. There are going to be two pipelines: one is going to handle the categorical data and the other one is going to handle numerical data. The missing values of the categorical data will be filled with the most frequent value (mode) and after the Target Encoder will be applied to transform categorical variables into numerical variables. The numerical data missing values will be filled with a strategy called **K-nearest neighbors,** which uses the Euclidean distance between the data points to find the best number to fill the missing values. If don’t know how this Pipeline technique works, I recommend you check [my article about Pipelines.](https://medium.com/@fernandao.lacerda.dantas/boost-your-pipelines-with-columntransformer-b2c009db096f)\\n\\n```\\n#Categorical and numerical pipelinescat_pipe = Pipeline([(\"imputer_cat\", SimpleImputer(strategy=\"most_frequent\")),(\"encoder\", ce.TargetEncoder()),                    ])num_pipe = Pipeline([(\"imputer_num\", KNNImputer(n_neighbors=3))])\\n```\\n\\nAnd with column transformer, we can attach both transformations to one variable that I named “transformer”. Observe that we also have to specify the type of data to which the pipeline will be applied t...\\n\\n--- Result 5 ---\\nTitle: Titanic dataset Analysis (~80% accuracy) - Analytics Vidhya - Medium\\nURL: https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/titanic-dataset-analysis-80-accuracy-9480cf3db538\\n\\nContent:\\n[Sitemap](https://medium.com/sitemap/sitemap.xml)\\n\\n[Open in app](https://rsci.app.link/?%24canonical_url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2Fp%2F9480cf3db538&%7Efeature=LoOpenInAppButton&%7Echannel=ShowPostUnderCollection&%7Estage=mobileNavBar&source=post_page---top_nav_layout_nav-----------------------------------------)\\n\\nSign up\\n\\n[Sign in](https://medium.com/m/signin?operation=login&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2Fanalytics-vidhya%2Ftitanic-dataset-analysis-80-accuracy-9480cf3db538&source=post_page---top_nav_layout_nav-----------------------global_nav------------------)\\n\\n[Medium Logo](https://medium.com/?source=post_page---top_nav_layout_nav-----------------------------------------)\\n\\n[Write](https://medium.com/m/signin?operation=register&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2Fnew-story&source=---top_nav_layout_nav-----------------------new_post_topnav------------------)\\n\\nSign up\\n\\n[Sign in](https://medium.com/m/signin?operation=login&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2Fanalytics-vidhya%2Ftitanic-dataset-analysis-80-accuracy-9480cf3db538&source=post_page---top_nav_layout_nav-----------------------global_nav------------------)\\n\\n[**Analytics Vidhya**](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya?source=post_page---publication_nav-7219b4dc6c4c-9480cf3db538---------------------------------------)\\n\\n·\\n\\nAnalytics Vidhya is a community of Generative AI and Data Science professionals.

RMS Titanic was a British passenger ship that hit an iceberg while on its voyage from Southampton to New York City, and sank in the North Atlantic ocean, leaving hundreds of passengers to die in the aftermath of the deadly incident. Some of the passengers who survived till help arrived were rescued while many lost their lives helplessly waiting for help to arrive.\\n\\nThe legendary Kaggle problem, [Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic), based on the tragedic sinking of the RMS Titanic records data about 891 passengers of RMS Titanic, and we are required to predict if they have survived or not, based on the information we have available about the passengers and the outcome after the sinking of the ship.\\n\\nNote: This notebook is my analysis of the titanic dataset to obtain any meaningful insights from the data and scores an accuracy of ~80 percent (top 5 percent of 14k entries on Kaggle) .\\n\\nLet’s get started!\\n\\n## Contents:\\n\\n1\\\\.

Results and conclusion\\n\\n## About the data:\\n\\nFirst, we have the prediction variable, that is if they survived the sinking or not. Then a bunch of numeric variables, like ids, ages of the passengers, etc. followed by categorical variables like class of the ticket, and strings like name, etc.\\n\\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\\n\\nExample RMS Titanic ticket : [Source](https://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/titanic-tickets/)\\n\\nPrinting first 5 rows of given dataset..\\n\\n## Problem definition and metrics\\n\\nThe problem is a **binary class classification** problem. We can use **binary crossentropy** or logistic loss as the loss function and any metric like **accuracy** or/and **ROC AUC score** as a metric to evaluate the results.\\n\\n## EDA\\n\\n### Correlation between features:\\n\\nDrawing insights from the correlation between features..\\n\\n- Fare and Pclass are negatively correlated (with a Pearson’s correlation coefficient of -0.55) ; Obviously, **higher fares imply better better ticket classes** (lower the class number) and vice versa.\\n- Pclass and the target feature are moderately negatively correlated (-0.34) implying **better the ticket class, higher the chance of survival.**\\n- A similar pattern can be observed with the features Parch, SibSp and Age; Both the features, Parch and SibSp are very slightly correlated with all the features except Age feature, and both have a negative correlation (-0.19 and -0.31 respectively) with Age ; **Lower the age, more the number of family accompanying the passenger**\\n- SibSp and Parch features are positively correlated which are both indicative of the number of family members accompanying passenger\\n- PClass and Age are negatively correlated (-0.37) implying **higher the age, better the ticket class**\\n\\n### Missing data\\n\\n**Age** : Contains 177 nan values out of 891 entries. Imputed with median gave best results.\\n\\n**Embarked** : Contains 2 nan values. Imputed with mode of existing data.\\n\\n**Cabin** : 687 out of 891 Cabin entries are nans, i.e. more than 50 percent of the total data exists as missing data or Nans so assumed its better to derive other features from this feature.\\n\\nNow, printing the correlation heatmap after handling missing data and converting categorical strings to encodings (0,1,2..)..\\n\\n- Embarked also has slight correlation with the target variable (-0.17), the **port at which the ship was boarded by the passengers did determine their chance of survival**\\n- Sex is also highly correlated with the target variable (-0.54), indicating the **passenger’s gender had a high effect on their chance of survival**\\n- Embarked and Fare of the passengers are negatively correlated (-0.22); obviously, fare depends on the port a passenger boards the ship from.\\n- Embarked and Sex also seem slightly correlated (0.11) indicating the **port the passenger boarded from was dependent on the gender of the passenger**; Embarked and Pclass are also correlated (0.16) indicating a **1st class passenger probably boarded at a different port than a 3rd class passenger**.\\n- Sex and Fare, Sex and Parch, SibSp, Sex and Pclass all seem slightly correlated (-0.18, -0.25, -0.11, 0.13 respectively); i.e the **fare the passenger paid, the family aboard, and the class of the ticket was seem slightly dependent on the gender of the passenger**.\\n\\n**Question 1: How do the features ‘Age’, ‘Sex’, ‘Fare’, ‘Embarked’ affect the chance of a passenger’s survival?**\\n\\nAge :\\n\\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\\n\\n- Both distributions, of people who didn’t survive and the ones who did, are normal with a spike around age 30 for passengers who did not survive i.e. for **people around the age 30 had a higher chance of not surviving**\\n- People of ages > ~51 are considered outliers in the distribution of people who did not survive. owing to the fact **people above the age of ~51 are very less** and people of age ~55 above are outliers in the distribution of people who did survive, i.e. **very few people above ~55 actually did survive**\\n\\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\\n\\nSex:\\n\\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\\n\\n- From the above stacked plots, it is clear **more percentage of female passengers survived** i.e. 74.2 % while only 18.9 % of male passengers survived, even though more male passesngers were aboard\\n\\nFare :\\n\\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\\n\\n- Distribution of fares of survivors clearly has a higher median value, hence **passengers who survived had higher average fares**\\n- Lots of outliers in the distribution of both\\n- A huge spike in the distribution of the people who didn’t survive, or the probability that the person who didn’t survive had a fare of ~10 units of currency is very high\\n\\nEmbarked:\\n\\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\\n\\n- Maximum passengers seem to have boarded the ship at Southampton port and only 33 percent of them survived; out of the total passengers who boarded the ship at Queenstown, a simi...\\n\\n--- Result 6 ---\\nTitle: Search code, repositories, users, issues, pull requests...\\nURL: https://github.com/SamanthaZhang25/Kaggle-Titanic--Machine-Learning--Random-Forest-78.708\\n\\nContent:\\nGitHub - SamanthaZhang25/Kaggle-Titanic--Machine-Learning--Random-Forest-78.708: Predict Titanic survival using targeted feature engineering (Cabin presence, FamilySize, IsAlone, Title, Age bins) and compare popular models (RF, SVM, KNN, XGBoost, LightGBM).

The notebooks are named in pseudo-chronological order. I say \"pseudo\" because whenever I revisited a process, I edited the relevant existing notebook without creating a new one. Hence, some code and results in earlier notebooks may not have been used in the next few notebooks, but were used at some point in the entire project.\\n\\n## Exploratory Data Analysis\\n\\nFirst, I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on all features in the dataset ( [1\\\\. EDA.ipynb](https://github.com/chrischow/kaggle_titanic/blob/master/Notebooks/1.%20EDA.ipynb)). Concurrently, I cleaned the data and generated new features.\\n\\n## Modelling\\n\\n### Random Forest ( `sklearn`)\\n\\nNext, I experimented with the `sklearn` implementation of Random Forest ( [2\\\\. Random Forest - Low Depth.ipynb](https://github.com/chrischow/kaggle_titanic/blob/master/Notebooks/2.%20Random%20Forest%20-%20Low%20Depth.ipynb)). By the final iteration in the optimisation process, the accuracy was **82.47%**. However, the `sklearn` implementation ( `RandomForestClassifier`) was extremely slow. Hence, I switched over to the `lightgbm` implementation of the Random Forest algorithm.\\n\\n### Random Forest ( `lightgbm`)\\n\\nThe `lightgbm` implementation of the Random Forest algorithm was **much** faster. The subsequent three notebooks captured my attempts at figuring out the best sequence for the tuning of parameters. The best approach was to:\\n\\n1. Tune the number of trees/estimators\\n2. Perform Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) with cross-validation (CV)\\n3. Tune the proportion of observations sampled\\n4. Tune the maximum features used per split\\n5. Tune the minimum samples in each terminal node\\n6. Tune alpha, the L1 regularisation parameter\\n7. Tune lambda, the L1 regularisation parameter\\n\\nThis tuning sequence resulted in a 5-fold CV test score of **83.46%**.\\n\\n### Regenerating Features\\n\\nThen, I realised that I made a mistake in the feature generation process. I had generated encoded features using the entire training set. This resulted in contamination, which meant that the pseudo-test sets in CV contained information about the target, and this could have inflated the test scores. Instead, I should have (1) performed data cleaning on the competition training and test sets together, (2) encoded the training set while saving the mappings, and (3) performed mappings on the test set. Hence, I created the [`kaggle_titanic` module](https://github.com/chrischow/kaggle_titanic/blob/master/Modules/kaggle_titanic.py) to perform these three data cleaning functions, and many other functions for machine learning.\\n\\n### Model Tuning I - Improper Cross Validation\\n\\nI created pipelines for performing feature selection for and tuning the various models:\\n\\n1. LightGBM RF with low depth\\n2. LightGBM RF with high depth\\n3. LightGBM GBM with low depth\\n4. LightGBM GBM with high depth\\n5. XGBoost GBM with low depth\\n6. XGBoost GBM with high depth\\n7. Logistic Regression\\n8. Ridge Regression\\n9. Linear Support Vector Classifier (SVC)\\n\\nHaving completed the tuning for the above models, I discovered another source of contamination: in the cross validation process. I was using cross validation to both (1) tune hyperparameters and (2) score models. These two processes should have been separate. The correct way to have performed cross validation was:\\n\\n1. Split data into **meta folds** (e.g. 5 repeats of 5 folds)\\n2. For each **meta fold**:\\na. Split training data into folds (e.g. 5 repeats of 5 folds)\\nb. Run feature selection and hyperparameter tuning algorithms using cross validation\\nc. Score the model on the test set of the **meta fold**\\nd. Move on to next **meta fold** and repeat\\n3. Evaluate results for all **meta folds**\\n\\nThe first important thing I learned was that although feature selection and parameter tuning require cross validation, **all processes from data cleaning to feature generation to feature selection to hyperparameter tuning** require cross validation as well. In other words, **cross validation should be used to validate the full approach**. My mistake was that I saw hyperparameter tuning with cross validation as the end stage of testing. This was wrong. The second important thing I learned was that it was better to place feature selection before hyperparameter tuning. This is because changes in hyperparameter levels do not change how important or unimportant the features are. We only need the initial parameters for running RFE to not prevent the algorithm from letting the important features surface. For example, in tree-based models, increasing the number of trees, depth, or features sampled per tree would help to ensure that sufficient features are evaluated. The tradeoff to increasing these hyperparameters would be the computational cost. These two objectives should be balanced well.\\n\\n## About\\n\\nKaggle Competition - Titanic Dataset\\n\\n### Resources\\n\\n[Readme](https://github.com/chrischow/kaggle_titanic#readme-ov-file)\\n\\n[Activity](https://github.com/chrischow/kaggle_titanic/activity)\\n\\n### Stars\\n\\n[**1**\\\\\\nstar](https://github.com/chrischow/kaggle_titanic/stargazers)\\n\\n### Watchers\\n\\n[**2**\\\\\\nwatching](https://github.com/chrischow/kaggle_titanic/watchers)\\n\\n### Forks\\n\\n[**0**\\\\\\nforks](https://github.com/chrischow/kaggle_titanic/forks)\\n\\n[Report repository](https:...\\n\\n--- Result 8 ---\\nTitle: Building a Classification Model To Score 80+% Accuracy on the Spaceship Titanic Kaggle Dataset\\nURL: https://pub.towardsai.net/building-a-classification-model-to-score-80-accuracy-on-the-spaceship-titanic-kaggle-dataset-40a0aa184c1c\\n\\nContent:\\nBuilding a Classification Model To Score 80+% Accuracy on the Spaceship Titanic Kaggle Dataset | by Devang Chavda | Towards AI\\n[Sitemap](https://pub.towardsai.net/sitemap/sitemap.xml)\\n[Open in app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.medium.reader&amp;referrer=utm_source=mobileNavBar&amp;source=post_page---top_nav_layout_nav-----------------------------------------)\\nSign up\\n[Sign in](https://medium.com/m/signin?operation=login&amp;redirect=https://pub.towardsai.net/building-a-classification-model-to-score-80-accuracy-on-the-spaceship-titanic-kaggle-dataset-40a0aa184c1c&amp;source=post_page---top_nav_layout_nav-----------------------global_nav------------------)\\n[Medium Logo](https://medium.com/?source=post_page---top_nav_layout_nav-----------------------------------------)\\n[\\nWrite\\n](https://medium.com/m/signin?operation=register&amp;redirect=https://medium.com/new-story&amp;source=---top_nav_layout_nav-----------------------new_post_topnav------\\n\\n[... truncated 15258 characters ...]'}]",
