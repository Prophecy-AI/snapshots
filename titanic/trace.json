We've got channels for competitions, job postings and career discussions, resources, and socializing with your fellow data scientists. Follow the link here:** https://discord.gg/kaggle\\n\\nThe competition is simple: use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.\\n\\nRead on or watch the video below to explore more details. Once you’re ready to start competing, click on the <a href=\\\"https://www.kaggle.com/account/login?returnUrl=%2Fc%2Ftitanic\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">\\\"Join Competition button</a> to create an account and gain access to the <a href=\\\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">competition data</a>. Then check out <a href=\\\"https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/titanic-tutorial\\\">Alexis Cook’s Titanic Tutorial</a> that walks you through step by step how to make your first submission!\\n\\n<iframe width=\\\"699\\\" height=\\\"368\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8yZMXCaFshs\\\" title=\\\"YouTube video | How to Get Started with Kaggle’s Titanic Competition | Kaggle\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allow=\\\"encrypted-media\\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n\\n## The Challenge\\nThe sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.\\n\\nOn April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.\\n\\nWhile there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.\\n\\nIn this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).\\n\\n> #### Recommended Tutorial\\n> We highly recommend [Alexis Cook’s Titanic Tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/titanic-tutorial) that walks you through making your very first submission step by step and [this starter notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/gusthema/titanic-competition-w-tensorflow-decision-forests) to get started.\\n\\n## How Kaggle’s Competitions Work\\n1. **Join the Competition**\\nRead about the challenge description, accept the Competition Rules and gain access to the competition dataset.\\n1.  **Get to Work**\\nDownload the data, build models on it locally or on Kaggle Notebooks (our no-setup, customizable Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs) and generate a prediction file.\\n1.  **Make a Submission**\\nUpload your prediction as a submission on Kaggle and receive an accuracy score.\\n1.  **Check the Leaderboard**\\nSee how your model ranks against other Kagglers on our leaderboard. \\n1.  **Improve Your Score**\\nCheck out the <a href=\\\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">discussion forum</a> to find lots of tutorials and insights from other competitors.\\n\\n> #### Kaggle Lingo Video\\n> You may run into unfamiliar lingo as you dig into the Kaggle discussion forums and public notebooks. Check out  Dr. Rachael Tatman’s [video on Kaggle Lingo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEJHyuWKd-s) to get up to speed!\\n\\n## What Data Will I Use in This Competition?\\nIn this competition, you’ll gain access to two similar datasets that include passenger information like name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc. One dataset is titled `train.csv` and the other is titled `test.csv`.\\n\\n`Train.csv` will contain the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 to be exact) and importantly, will reveal whether they survived or not, also known as the “ground truth”.\\n\\nThe `test.csv` dataset contains similar information but does not disclose the “ground truth” for each passenger. It’s your job to predict these outcomes.\\n\\nUsing the patterns you find in the `train.csv` data, predict whether the other 418 passengers on board (found in `test.csv`) survived.\\n\\nCheck out the <a href=\\\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data\\\">“Data” tab</a> to explore the datasets even further. Once you feel you’ve created a competitive model, submit it to Kaggle to see where your model stands on our leaderboard against other Kagglers.\\n\\n## How to Submit your Prediction to Kaggle\\nOnce you’re ready to make a submission and get on the leaderboard:\\n\\n1. Click on the “Submit Predictions” button\\n<img width=\\\"699\\\" align=\\\"center\\\" src=\\\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen1.png\\\">\\n1. Upload a CSV file in the submission file format. You’re able to submit 10 submissions a day.\\n<img width=\\\"699\\\" align=\\\"center\\\" src=\\\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen2.png\\\">\\n\\n## Submission File Format:\\nYou should submit a csv file with exactly 418 entries plus a header row. Your submission will show an error if you have extra columns (beyond `PassengerId` and `Survived`) or rows.\\n\\nThe file should have exactly 2 columns:\\n- `PassengerId` (sorted in any order)\\n- `Survived` (contains your binary predictions: 1 for survived, 0 for deceased)\\n\\n## Got it! I’m ready to get started. Where do I get help if I need it?\\n- For Competition Help: <a href=\\\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\\\">Titanic Discussion Forum</a>\\n\\nKaggle doesn’t have a dedicated team to help troubleshoot your code so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. The forums are full of useful information on the data, metric, and different approaches. We encourage you to use the forums often. If you share your knowledge, you'll find that others will share a lot in turn!\\n\\n## A Last Word on Kaggle Notebooks\\nAs we mentioned before, Kaggle Notebooks is our no-setup, customizable, Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs and a huge repository of community published data &amp; code.\\n\\nIn every competition, you’ll find many Notebooks shared with incredible insights. It’s an invaluable resource worth becoming familiar with. Check out this competition’s Notebooks <a href=\\\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/notebooks\\\">here</a>.\\n\\n## 🏃‍♀Ready to Compete? <a href=\\\"https://www.kaggle.com/account/login?returnUrl=%2Fc%2Ftitanic\\\">Join the Competition Here!</a>\\n\\n## Evaluation\\n\\n<h2>Goal</h2>\\n<p>It is your job to predict if a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic or not. <br>For each  in the test set, you must predict a 0 or 1 value for the  variable.</p>\\n<h2>Metric</h2>\\n<p>Your score is the percentage of passengers you correctly predict. This is known as <a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision#In_binary_classification\\\">accuracy</a>.</p>\\n<h2>Submission File Format</h2>\\n<p>You should submit a csv file with exactly 418 entries <b>plus</b> a header row. Your submission will show an error if you have extra columns (beyond PassengerId and Survived) or rows.<br><br>The file should have exactly 2 columns:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>PassengerId (sorted in any order)</li>\\n<li>Survived (contains your binary predictions: 1 for survived, 0 for deceased)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<pre><b>PassengerId,Survived</b><br>892,0<br>893,1<br>894,0<br>Etc.</pre>\\n<p>You can download an example submission file (gender_submission.csv) on the <a href=\\\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data\\\">Data page</a>.</p>\\n\\n## data-description\\n\\n<h3>Overview</h3>\\n<p>The data has been split into two groups:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>training set (train.csv)</li>\\n<li>test set (test.csv)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><b> The training set </b>should be used to build your machine learning models. For the training set, we provide the outcome (also known as the “ground truth”) for each passenger. Your model will be based on “features” like passengers’ gender and class. You can also use <a href=\\\"https://triangleinequality.wordpress.com/2013/09/08/basic-feature-engineering-with-the-titanic-data/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\"> feature engineering </a>to create new features.</p>\\n<p><b>The test set </b>should be used to see how well your model performs on unseen data. For the test set, we do not provide the ground truth for each passenger. It is your job to predict these outcomes. For each passenger in the test set, use the model you trained to predict whether or not they survived the sinking of the Titanic.</p>\\n<p>We also include <b>gender_submission.csv</b>, a set of predictions that assume all and only female passengers survive, as an example of what a submission file should look like.</p>\\n<h3>Data Dictionary</h3>\\n<table style=\\\"width: 100%;\\\">\\n<tbody>\\n<tr><th><b>Variable</b></th><th><b>Definition</b></th><th><b>Key</b></th></tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>survival</td>\\n<td>Survival</td>\\n<td>0 = No, 1 = Yes</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>pclass</td>\\n<td>Ticket class</td>\\n<td>1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>sex</td>\\n<td>Sex</td>\\n<td></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Age</td>\\n<td>Age in years</td>\\n<td></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>sibsp</td>\\n<td># of siblings / spouses aboard the Titanic</td>\\n<td></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>parch</td>\\n<td># of parents / children aboard the Titanic</td>\\n<td></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>ticket</td>\\n<td>Ticket number</td>\\n<td></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>fare</td>\\n<td>Passenger fare</td>\\n<td></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>cabin</td>\\n<td>Cabin number</td>\\n<td></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>embarked</td>\\n<td>Port of Embarkation</td>\\n<td>C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton</td>\\n</tr>\\n</tbody>\\n</table>\\n<h3>Variable Notes</h3>\\n<p><b>pclass</b>: A proxy for socio-economic status (SES)<br /> 1st = Upper<br /> 2nd = Middle<br /> 3rd = Lower<br /><br /> <b>age</b>: Age is fractional if less than 1.

They are a great place to begin if you are new to data science or just finished a MOOC and want to get involved in Kaggle.</p>\\n<p>Getting Started competitions are a non-competitive way to get familiar with Kaggle’s platform, learn basic machine learning concepts, and start meeting people in the community. They have no cash prize and are on a rolling timeline.</p>\\n<h2>How do I create and manage a team?</h2>\\n<p>When you accept the competition rules, a team will be created for you. You can invite others to your team, accept a merger with another team, and update basic information like team name by going to the More &gt; <a href=\\\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/team\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Team</a> page.</p>\\n<p>We've heard from many Kagglers that teaming up is the best way to learn new skills AND have fun. If you don't have a teammate already, consider asking if anyone wants to team up in the <a href=\\\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">discussion forum</a>.</p>\\n<h2>What are Notebooks?</h2>\\n<p>Kaggle Notebooks is a cloud computational environment that enables reproducible and collaborative analysis. Notebooks support scripts in Python and R, Jupyter Notebooks, and RMarkdown reports. You can visit the <a href=\\\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/notebooks\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Notebooks</a> tab to view all of the publicly shared code for the Titanic competition. For more on how to use Notebooks to learn data science, check out our <a href=\\\"https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview\\\" target=\\\"&quot;_blank\\\">Courses</a>!</p>\\n<h2>Why did my team disappear from the leaderboard?</h2>\\n<p>To keep with the spirit of getting-started competitions, we have implemented a two month rolling window on submissions. Once a submission is more than two months old, it will be invalidated and no longer count towards the leaderboard.</p>\\n<p>If your team has no submissions in the previous two months, the team will also drop from the leaderboard. This will keep the leaderboard at a manageable size, freshen it up, and prevent newcomers from getting lost in a sea of abandoned scores.</p>\\n<p><i>\\\"I worked so hard to get that score! Give it back!\\\"</i> Read more about our decision to implement a rolling leaderboard <a href=\\\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion/6240\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">here</a>.</p>\\n<h2>How do I contact Support?</h2>\\n<p>Kaggle does not have a dedicated support team so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. (For this competition, you’ll want to use the <a href=\\\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Titanic discussion forum)</a>.</p>\\n<p>Support is only able to help with issues that are being experienced by all participants. Before contacting support, please check the discussion forum for information on your problem. If you can’t find it, you can post your problem in the forum so a fellow participant or a Kaggle team member can provide help. The forums are full of useful information on the data, metric, and different approaches. We encourage you to use the forums often. If you share your knowledge, you'll find that others will share a lot in turn!</p>\\n<p>If your problem persists or it seems to be effective all participants then please <a href=\\\"https://www.kaggle.com/contact\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">contact us</a>.</p>\", \"is_error\": false}",

You’re in the right place. \nThis is the legendary Titanic ML competition – the best, first challenge for you to dive into ML competitions and familiarize yourself with how the Kaggle platform works.\n\n**If you want to talk with other users about this competition, come join our Discord! We've got channels for competitions, job postings and career discussions, resources, and socializing with your fellow data scientists. Follow the link here:** https://discord.gg/kaggle\n\nThe competition is simple: use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.\n\nRead on or watch the video below to explore more details. Once you’re ready to start competing, click on the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/account/login?returnUrl=%2Fc%2Ftitanic\" target=\"_blank\">\"Join Competition button</a> to create an account and gain access to the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data\" target=\"_blank\">competition data</a>. Then check out <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/titanic-tutorial\">Alexis Cook’s Titanic Tutorial</a> that walks you through step by step how to make your first submission!\n\n<iframe width=\"699\" height=\"368\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8yZMXCaFshs\" title=\"YouTube video | How to Get Started with Kaggle’s Titanic Competition | Kaggle\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n## The Challenge\nThe sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.\n\nOn April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.\n\nWhile there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.\n\nIn this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).\n\n> #### Recommended Tutorial\n> We highly recommend [Alexis Cook’s Titanic Tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/titanic-tutorial) that walks you through making your very first submission step by step and [this starter notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/gusthema/titanic-competition-w-tensorflow-decision-forests) to get started.\n\n## How Kaggle’s Competitions Work\n1. **Join the Competition**\nRead about the challenge description, accept the Competition Rules and gain access to the competition dataset.\n1.  **Get to Work**\nDownload the data, build models on it locally or on Kaggle Notebooks (our no-setup, customizable Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs) and generate a prediction file.\n1.  **Make a Submission**\nUpload your prediction as a submission on Kaggle and receive an accuracy score.\n1.  **Check the Leaderboard**\nSee how your model ranks against other Kagglers on our leaderboard. \n1.  **Improve Your Score**\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a> to find lots of tutorials and insights from other competitors.\n\n> #### Kaggle Lingo Video\n> You may run into unfamiliar lingo as you dig into the Kaggle discussion forums and public notebooks. Check out  Dr. Rachael Tatman’s [video on Kaggle Lingo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEJHyuWKd-s) to get up to speed!\n\n## What Data Will I Use in This Competition?\nIn this competition, you’ll gain access to two similar datasets that include passenger information like name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc. One dataset is titled `train.csv` and the other is titled `test.csv`.\n\n`Train.csv` will contain the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 to be exact) and importantly, will reveal whether they survived or not, also known as the “ground truth”.\n\nThe `test.csv` dataset contains similar information but does not disclose the “ground truth” for each passenger. It’s your job to predict these outcomes.\n\nUsing the patterns you find in the `train.csv` data, predict whether the other 418 passengers on board (found in `test.csv`) survived.\n\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data\">“Data” tab</a> to explore the datasets even further. Once you feel you’ve created a competitive model, submit it to Kaggle to see where your model stands on our leaderboard against other Kagglers.\n\n## How to Submit your Prediction to Kaggle\nOnce you’re ready to make a submission and get on the leaderboard:\n\n1. Click on the “Submit Predictions” button\n<img width=\"699\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen1.png\">\n1. Upload a CSV file in the submission file format. You’re able to submit 10 submissions a day.\n<img width=\"699\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen2.png\">\n\n## Submission File Format:\nYou should submit a csv file with exactly 418 entries plus a header row. Your submission will show an error if you have extra columns (beyond `PassengerId` and `Survived`) or rows.\n\nThe file should have exactly 2 columns:\n- `PassengerId` (sorted in any order)\n- `Survived` (contains your binary predictions: 1 for survived, 0 for deceased)\n\n## Got it! I’m ready to get started. Where do I get help if I need it?\n- For Competition Help: <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\">Titanic Discussion Forum</a>\n\nKaggle doesn’t have a dedicated team to help troubleshoot your code so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. The forums are full of useful information on the data, metric, and different approaches. We encourage you to use the forums often. If you share your knowledge, you'll find that others will share a lot in turn!\n\n## A Last Word on Kaggle Notebooks\nAs we mentioned before, Kaggle Notebooks is our no-setup, customizable, Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs and a huge repository of community published data &amp; code.\n\nIn every competition, you’ll find many Notebooks shared with incredible insights. It’s an invaluable resource worth becoming familiar with. Check out this competition’s Notebooks <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/notebooks\">here</a>.\n\n## 🏃‍♀Ready to Compete? <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/account/login?returnUrl=%2Fc%2Ftitanic\">Join the Competition Here!</a>\n\n## Evaluation\n\n<h2>Goal</h2>\n<p>It is your job to predict if a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic or not. <br>For each  in the test set, you must predict a 0 or 1 value for the  variable.</p>\n<h2>Metric</h2>\n<p>Your score is the percentage of passengers you correctly predict.

They are a great place to begin if you are new to data science or just finished a MOOC and want to get involved in Kaggle.</p>\n<p>Getting Started competitions are a non-competitive way to get familiar with Kaggle’s platform, learn basic machine learning concepts, and start meeting people in the community. They have no cash prize and are on a rolling timeline.</p>\n<h2>How do I create and manage a team?</h2>\n<p>When you accept the competition rules, a team will be created for you. You can invite others to your team, accept a merger with another team, and update basic information like team name by going to the More &gt; <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/team\" target=\"_blank\">Team</a> page.</p>\n<p>We've heard from many Kagglers that teaming up is the best way to learn new skills AND have fun. If you don't have a teammate already, consider asking if anyone wants to team up in the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a>.</p>\n<h2>What are Notebooks?</h2>\n<p>Kaggle Notebooks is a cloud computational environment that enables reproducible and collaborative analysis. Notebooks support scripts in Python and R, Jupyter Notebooks, and RMarkdown reports. You can visit the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/notebooks\" target=\"_blank\">Notebooks</a> tab to view all of the publicly shared code for the Titanic competition. For more on how to use Notebooks to learn data science, check out our <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview\" target=\"&quot;_blank\">Courses</a>!</p>\n<h2>Why did my team disappear from the leaderboard?</h2>\n<p>To keep with the spirit of getting-started competitions, we have implemented a two month rolling window on submissions. Once a submission is more than two months old, it will be invalidated and no longer count towards the leaderboard.</p>\n<p>If your team has no submissions in the previous two months, the team will also drop from the leaderboard. This will keep the leaderboard at a manageable size, freshen it up, and prevent newcomers from getting lost in a sea of abandoned scores.</p>\n<p><i>\"I worked so hard to get that score! Give it back!\"</i> Read more about our decision to implement a rolling leaderboard <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion/6240\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n<h2>How do I contact Support?</h2>\n<p>Kaggle does not have a dedicated support team so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. (For this competition, you’ll want to use the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">Titanic discussion forum)</a>.</p>\n<p>Support is only able to help with issues that are being experienced by all participants. Before contacting support, please check the discussion forum for information on your problem. If you can’t find it, you can post your problem in the forum so a fellow participant or a Kaggle team member can provide help. The forums are full of useful information on the data, metric, and different approaches. We encourage you to use the forums often. If you share your knowledge, you'll find that others will share a lot in turn!</p>\n<p>If your problem persists or it seems to be effective all participants then please <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/contact\" target=\"_blank\">contact us</a>.</p>\ntool: Not a directory: /home/code/exploration/../research/writeups\ntool: /home/code/exploration/../research/kernels:\n[DIR]  alexisbcook_exercise-arithmetic-and-variables/\n[DIR]  alexisbcook_titanic-tutorial/\n[DIR]  arthurtok_introduction-to-ensembling-stacking-in-python/\n[DIR]  ldfreeman3_a-data-science-framework-to-achieve-99-accuracy/\n[FILE] metadata.json (1.7KB)\n[DIR]  startupsci_titanic-data-science-solutions/\ntool: /home/data:\n[FILE] description.md (13.6KB)\n[FILE] gender_submission.csv (3.2KB)\n[FILE] test.csv (28.0KB)\n[FILE] train.csv (59.8KB)",

We've got channels for competitions, job postings and career discussions, resources, and socializing with your fellow data scientists. Follow the link here:** https://discord.gg/kaggle\n\nThe competition is simple: use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.\n\nRead on or watch the video below to explore more details. Once you’re ready to start competing, click on the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/account/login?returnUrl=%2Fc%2Ftitanic\" target=\"_blank\">\"Join Competition button</a> to create an account and gain access to the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data\" target=\"_blank\">competition data</a>. Then check out <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/titanic-tutorial\">Alexis Cook’s Titanic Tutorial</a> that walks you through step by step how to make your first submission!\n\n<iframe width=\"699\" height=\"368\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8yZMXCaFshs\" title=\"YouTube video | How to Get Started with Kaggle’s Titanic Competition | Kaggle\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n## The Challenge\nThe sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.\n\nOn April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.\n\nWhile there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.\n\nIn this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).\n\n> #### Recommended Tutorial\n> We highly recommend [Alexis Cook’s Titanic Tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/titanic-tutorial) that walks you through making your very first submission step by step and [this starter notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/gusthema/titanic-competition-w-tensorflow-decision-forests) to get started.\n\n## How Kaggle’s Competitions Work\n1. **Join the Competition**\nRead about the challenge description, accept the Competition Rules and gain access to the competition dataset.\n1.  **Get to Work**\nDownload the data, build models on it locally or on Kaggle Notebooks (our no-setup, customizable Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs) and generate a prediction file.\n1.  **Make a Submission**\nUpload your prediction as a submission on Kaggle and receive an accuracy score.\n1.  **Check the Leaderboard**\nSee how your model ranks against other Kagglers on our leaderboard. \n1.  **Improve Your Score**\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a> to find lots of tutorials and insights from other competitors.\n\n> #### Kaggle Lingo Video\n> You may run into unfamiliar lingo as you dig into the Kaggle discussion forums and public notebooks. Check out  Dr. Rachael Tatman’s [video on Kaggle Lingo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEJHyuWKd-s) to get up to speed!\n\n## What Data Will I Use in This Competition?\nIn this competition, you’ll gain access to two similar datasets that include passenger information like name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc. One dataset is titled `train.csv` and the other is titled `test.csv`.\n\n`Train.csv` will contain the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 to be exact) and importantly, will reveal whether they survived or not, also known as the “ground truth”.\n\nThe `test.csv` dataset contains similar information but does not disclose the “ground truth” for each passenger. It’s your job to predict these outcomes.\n\nUsing the patterns you find in the `train.csv` data, predict whether the other 418 passengers on board (found in `test.csv`) survived.\n\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data\">“Data” tab</a> to explore the datasets even further. Once you feel you’ve created a competitive model, submit it to Kaggle to see where your model stands on our leaderboard against other Kagglers.\n\n## How to Submit your Prediction to Kaggle\nOnce you’re ready to make a submission and get on the leaderboard:\n\n1. Click on the “Submit Predictions” button\n<img width=\"699\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen1.png\">\n1. Upload a CSV file in the submission file format. You’re able to submit 10 submissions a day.\n<img width=\"699\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen2.png\">\n\n## Submission File Format:\nYou should submit a csv file with exactly 418 entries plus a header row. Your submission will show an error if you have extra columns (beyond `PassengerId` and `Survived`) or rows.\n\nThe file should have exactly 2 columns:\n- `PassengerId` (sorted in any order)\n- `Survived` (contains your binary predictions: 1 for survived, 0 for deceased)\n\n## Got it! I’m ready to get started. Where do I get help if I need it?\n- For Competition Help: <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\">Titanic Discussion Forum</a>\n\nKaggle doesn’t have a dedicated team to help troubleshoot your code so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. The forums are full of useful information on the data, metric, and different approaches. We encourage you to use the forums often. If you share your knowledge, you'll find that others will share a lot in turn!\n\n## A Last Word on Kaggle Notebooks\nAs we mentioned before, Kaggle Notebooks is our no-setup, customizable, Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs and a huge repository of community published data &amp; code.\n\nIn every competition, you’ll find many Notebooks shared with incredible insights. It’s an invaluable resource worth becoming familiar with.

Once you’re ready to start competing, click on the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/account/login?returnUrl=%2Fc%2Ftitanic\" target=\"_blank\">\"Join Competition button</a> to create an account and gain access to the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data\" target=\"_blank\">competition data</a>. Then check out <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/titanic-tutorial\">Alexis Cook’s Titanic Tutorial</a> that walks you through step by step how to make your first submission!\\n\\n<iframe width=\"699\" height=\"368\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8yZMXCaFshs\" title=\"YouTube video | How to Get Started with Kaggle’s Titanic Competition | Kaggle\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n\\n## The Challenge\\nThe sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.\\n\\nOn April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.\\n\\nWhile there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.\\n\\nIn this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).\\n\\n> #### Recommended Tutorial\\n> We highly recommend [Alexis Cook’s Titanic Tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/titanic-tutorial) that walks you through making your very first submission step by step and [this starter notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/gusthema/titanic-competition-w-tensorflow-decision-forests) to get started.\\n\\n## How Kaggle’s Competitions Work\\n1. **Join the Competition**\\nRead about the challenge description, accept the Competition Rules and gain access to the competition dataset.\\n1.  **Get to Work**\\nDownload the data, build models on it locally or on Kaggle Notebooks (our no-setup, customizable Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs) and generate a prediction file.\\n1.  **Make a Submission**\\nUpload your prediction as a submission on Kaggle and receive an accuracy score.\\n1.  **Check the Leaderboard**\\nSee how your model ranks against other Kagglers on our leaderboard. \\n1.  **Improve Your Score**\\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a> to find lots of tutorials and insights from other competitors.\\n\\n> #### Kaggle Lingo Video\\n> You may run into unfamiliar lingo as you dig into the Kaggle discussion forums and public notebooks. Check out  Dr. Rachael Tatman’s [video on Kaggle Lingo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEJHyuWKd-s) to get up to speed!\\n\\n## What Data Will I Use in This Competition?\\nIn this competition, you’ll gain access to two similar datasets that include passenger information like name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc. One dataset is titled `train.csv` and the other is titled `test.csv`.\\n\\n`Train.csv` will contain the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 to be exact) and importantly, will reveal whether they survived or not, also known as the “ground truth”.\\n\\nThe `test.csv` dataset contains similar information but does not disclose the “ground truth” for each passenger. It’s your job to predict these outcomes.\\n\\nUsing the patterns you find in the `train.csv` data, predict whether the other 418 passengers on board (found in `test.csv`) survived.\\n\\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data\">“Data” tab</a> to explore the datasets even further. Once you feel you’ve created a competitive model, submit it to Kaggle to see where your model stands on our leaderboard against other Kagglers.\\n\\n## How to Submit your Prediction to Kaggle\\nOnce you’re ready to make a submission and get on the leaderboard:\\n\\n1. Click on the “Submit Predictions” button\\n<img width=\"699\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen1.png\">\\n1. Upload a CSV file in the submission file format. You’re able to submit 10 submissions a day.\\n<img width=\"699\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen2.png\">\\n\\n## Submission File Format:\\nYou should submit a csv file with exactly 418 entries plus a header row. Your submission will show an error if you have extra columns (beyond `PassengerId` and `Survived`) or rows.\\n\\nThe file should have exactly 2 columns:\\n- `PassengerId` (sorted in any order)\\n- `Survived` (contains your binary predictions: 1 for survived, 0 for deceased)\\n\\n## Got it! I’m ready to get started. Where do I get help if I need it?\\n- For Competition Help: <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\">Titanic Discussion Forum</a>\\n\\nKaggle doesn’t have a dedicated team to help troubleshoot your code so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. The forums are full of useful information on the data, metric, and different approaches. We encourage you to use the forums often. If you share your knowledge, you\\'ll find that others will share a lot in turn!\\n\\n## A Last Word on Kaggle Notebooks\\nAs we mentioned before, Kaggle Notebooks is our no-setup, customizable, Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs and a huge repository of community published data &amp; code.\\n\\nIn every competition, you’ll find many Notebooks shared with incredible insights. It’s an invaluable resource worth becoming familiar with. Check out this competition’s Notebooks <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/notebooks\">here</a>.\\n\\n## 🏃\\u200d♀Ready to Compete? <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/account/login?returnUrl=%2Fc%2Ftitanic\">Join the Competition Here!</a>\\n\\n## Evaluation\\n\\n<h2>Goal</h2>\\n<p>It is your job to predict if a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic or not. <br>For each  in the test set, you must predict a 0 or 1 value for the  variable.</p>\\n<h2>Metric</h2>\\n<p>Your score is the percentage of passengers you correctly predict. This is known as <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision#In_binary_classification\">accuracy</a>.</p>\\n<h2>Submission File Format</h2>\\n<p>You should submit a csv file with exactly 418 entries <b>plus</b> a header row. Your submission will show an error if you have extra columns (beyond PassengerId and Survived) or rows.<br><br>The file should have exactly 2 columns:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>PassengerId (sorted in any order)</li>\\n<li>Survived (contains your binary predictions: 1 for survived, 0 for deceased)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<pre><b>PassengerId,Survived</b><br>892,0<br>893,1<br>894,0<br>Etc.</pre>\\n<p>You can download an example submission file (gender_submission.csv) on the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data\">Data page</a>.</p>\\n\\n## data-description\\n\\n<h3>Overview</h3>\\n<p>The data has been split into two groups:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>training set (train.csv)</li>\\n<li>test set (test.csv)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><b> The training set </b>should be used to build your machine learning models. For the training set, we provide the outcome (also known as the “ground truth”) for each passenger. Your model will be based on “features” like passengers’ gender and class. You can also use <a href=\"https://triangleinequality.wordpress.com/2013/09/08/basic-feature-engineering-with-the-titanic-data/\" target=\"_blank\"> feature engineering </a>to create new features.</p>\\n<p><b>The test set </b>should be used to see how well your model performs on unseen data. For the test set, we do not provide the ground truth for each passenger. It is your job to predict these outcomes. For each passenger in the test set, use the model you trained to predict whether or not they survived the sinking of the Titanic.</p>\\n<p>We also include <b>gender_submission.csv</b>, a set of predictions that assume all and only female passengers survive, as an example of what a submission file should look like.</p>\\n<h3>Data Dictionary</h3>\\n<table style=\"width: 100%;\">\\n<tbody>\\n<tr><th><b>Variable</b></th><th><b>Definition</b></th><th><b>Key</b></th></tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>survival</td>\\n<td>Survival</td>\\n<td>0 = No, 1 = Yes</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>pclass</td>\\n<td>Ticket class</td>\\n<td>1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>sex</td>\\n<td>Sex</td>\\n<td></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Age</td>\\n<td>Age in years</td>\\n<td></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>sibsp</td>\\n<td># of siblings / spouses aboard the Titanic</td>\\n<td></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>parch</td>\\n<td># of parents / children aboard the Titanic</td>\\n<td></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>ticket</td>\\n<td>Ticket number</td>\\n<td></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>fare</td>\\n<td>Passenger fare</td>\\n<td></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>cabin</td>\\n<td>Cabin number</td>\\n<td></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>embarked</td>\\n<td>Port of Embarkation</td>\\n<td>C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton</td>\\n</tr>\\n</tbody>\\n</table>\\n<h3>Variable Notes</h3>\\n<p><b>pclass</b>: A proxy for socio-economic status (SES)<br /> 1st = Upper<br /> 2nd = Middle<br /> 3rd = Lower<br /><br /> <b>age</b>: Age is fractional if less than 1.

They are a great place to begin if you are new to data science or just finished a MOOC and want to get involved in Kaggle.</p>\\n<p>Getting Started competitions are a non-competitive way to get familiar with Kaggle’s platform, learn basic machine learning concepts, and start meeting people in the community. They have no cash prize and are on a rolling timeline.</p>\\n<h2>How do I create and manage a team?</h2>\\n<p>When you accept the competition rules, a team will be created for you. You can invite others to your team, accept a merger with another team, and update basic information like team name by going to the More &gt; <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/team\" target=\"_blank\">Team</a> page.</p>\\n<p>We\\'ve heard from many Kagglers that teaming up is the best way to learn new skills AND have fun. If you don\\'t have a teammate already, consider asking if anyone wants to team up in the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a>.</p>\\n<h2>What are Notebooks?</h2>\\n<p>Kaggle Notebooks is a cloud computational environment that enables reproducible and collaborative analysis. Notebooks support scripts in Python and R, Jupyter Notebooks, and RMarkdown reports. You can visit the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/notebooks\" target=\"_blank\">Notebooks</a> tab to view all of the publicly shared code for the Titanic competition. For more on how to use Notebooks to learn data science, check out our <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview\" target=\"&quot;_blank\">Courses</a>!</p>\\n<h2>Why did my team disappear from the leaderboard?</h2>\\n<p>To keep with the spirit of getting-started competitions, we have implemented a two month rolling window on submissions. Once a submission is more than two months old, it will be invalidated and no longer count towards the leaderboard.</p>\\n<p>If your team has no submissions in the previous two months, the team will also drop from the leaderboard. This will keep the leaderboard at a manageable size, freshen it up, and prevent newcomers from getting lost in a sea of abandoned scores.</p>\\n<p><i>\"I worked so hard to get that score! Give it back!\"</i> Read more about our decision to implement a rolling leaderboard <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion/6240\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\\n<h2>How do I contact Support?</h2>\\n<p>Kaggle does not have a dedicated support team so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. (For this competition, you’ll want to use the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">Titanic discussion forum)</a>.</p>\\n<p>Support is only able to help with issues that are being experienced by all participants. Before contacting support, please check the discussion forum for information on your problem. If you can’t find it, you can post your problem in the forum so a fellow participant or a Kaggle team member can provide help. The forums are full of useful information on the data, metric, and different approaches. We encourage you to use the forums often. If you share your knowledge, you\\'ll find that others will share a lot in turn!</p>\\n<p>If your problem persists or it seems to be effective all participants then please <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/contact\" target=\"_blank\">contact us</a>.</p>'}, {'role': 'tool', 'content': 'Not a directory: /home/code/exploration/../research/writeups'}, {'role': 'tool', 'content': '/home/code/exploration/../research/kernels:\\n[DIR]  alexisbcook_exercise-arithmetic-and-variables/\\n[DIR]  alexisbcook_titanic-tutorial/\\n[DIR]  arthurtok_introduction-to-ensembling-stacking-in-python/\\n[DIR]  ldfreeman3_a-data-science-framework-to-achieve-99-accuracy/\\n[FILE] metadata.json (1.7KB)\\n[DIR]  startupsci_titanic-data-science-solutions/'}, {'role': 'tool', 'content': '/home/data:\\n[FILE] description.md (13.6KB)\\n[FILE] gender_submission.csv (3.2KB)\\n[FILE] test.csv (28.0KB)\\n[FILE] train.csv (59.8KB)'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': \"REASONING: Good, I can see this is the classic Titanic survival prediction problem - binary classification with accuracy as the metric.

We've got channels for competitions, job postings and career discussions, resources, and socializing with your fellow data scientists. Follow the link here:** https://discord.gg/kaggle\n\nThe competition is simple: use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.\n\nRead on or watch the video below to explore more details. Once you’re ready to start competing, click on the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/account/login?returnUrl=%2Fc%2Ftitanic\" target=\"_blank\">\"Join Competition button</a> to create an account and gain access to the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data\" target=\"_blank\">competition data</a>. Then check out <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/titanic-tutorial\">Alexis Cook’s Titanic Tutorial</a> that walks you through step by step how to make your first submission!\n\n<iframe width=\"699\" height=\"368\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8yZMXCaFshs\" title=\"YouTube video | How to Get Started with Kaggle’s Titanic Competition | Kaggle\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n## The Challenge\nThe sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.\n\nOn April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.\n\nWhile there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.\n\nIn this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).\n\n> #### Recommended Tutorial\n> We highly recommend [Alexis Cook’s Titanic Tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/titanic-tutorial) that walks you through making your very first submission step by step and [this starter notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/gusthema/titanic-competition-w-tensorflow-decision-forests) to get started.\n\n## How Kaggle’s Competitions Work\n1. **Join the Competition**\nRead about the challenge description, accept the Competition Rules and gain access to the competition dataset.\n1.  **Get to Work**\nDownload the data, build models on it locally or on Kaggle Notebooks (our no-setup, customizable Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs) and generate a prediction file.\n1.  **Make a Submission**\nUpload your prediction as a submission on Kaggle and receive an accuracy score.\n1.  **Check the Leaderboard**\nSee how your model ranks against other Kagglers on our leaderboard. \n1.  **Improve Your Score**\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a> to find lots of tutorials and insights from other competitors.\n\n> #### Kaggle Lingo Video\n> You may run into unfamiliar lingo as you dig into the Kaggle discussion forums and public notebooks. Check out  Dr. Rachael Tatman’s [video on Kaggle Lingo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEJHyuWKd-s) to get up to speed!\n\n## What Data Will I Use in This Competition?\nIn this competition, you’ll gain access to two similar datasets that include passenger information like name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc. One dataset is titled `train.csv` and the other is titled `test.csv`.\n\n`Train.csv` will contain the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 to be exact) and importantly, will reveal whether they survived or not, also known as the “ground truth”.\n\nThe `test.csv` dataset contains similar information but does not disclose the “ground truth” for each passenger. It’s your job to predict these outcomes.\n\nUsing the patterns you find in the `train.csv` data, predict whether the other 418 passengers on board (found in `test.csv`) survived.\n\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data\">“Data” tab</a> to explore the datasets even further. Once you feel you’ve created a competitive model, submit it to Kaggle to see where your model stands on our leaderboard against other Kagglers.\n\n## How to Submit your Prediction to Kaggle\nOnce you’re ready to make a submission and get on the leaderboard:\n\n1. Click on the “Submit Predictions” button\n<img width=\"699\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen1.png\">\n1. Upload a CSV file in the submission file format. You’re able to submit 10 submissions a day.\n<img width=\"699\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen2.png\">\n\n## Submission File Format:\nYou should submit a csv file with exactly 418 entries plus a header row. Your submission will show an error if you have extra columns (beyond `PassengerId` and `Survived`) or rows.\n\nThe file should have exactly 2 columns:\n- `PassengerId` (sorted in any order)\n- `Survived` (contains your binary predictions: 1 for survived, 0 for deceased)\n\n## Got it! I’m ready to get started. Where do I get help if I need it?\n- For Competition Help: <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\">Titanic Discussion Forum</a>\n\nKaggle doesn’t have a dedicated team to help troubleshoot your code so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. The forums are full of useful information on the data, metric, and different approaches. We encourage you to use the forums often. If you share your knowledge, you'll find that others will share a lot in turn!\n\n## A Last Word on Kaggle Notebooks\nAs we mentioned before, Kaggle Notebooks is our no-setup, customizable, Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs and a huge repository of community published data &amp; code.\n\nIn every competition, you’ll find many Notebooks shared with incredible insights. It’s an invaluable resource worth becoming familiar with.

They are a great place to begin if you are new to data science or just finished a MOOC and want to get involved in Kaggle.</p>\n<p>Getting Started competitions are a non-competitive way to get familiar with Kaggle’s platform, learn basic machine learning concepts, and start meeting people in the community. They have no cash prize and are on a rolling timeline.</p>\n<h2>How do I create and manage a team?</h2>\n<p>When you accept the competition rules, a team will be created for you. You can invite others to your team, accept a merger with another team, and update basic information like team name by going to the More &gt; <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/team\" target=\"_blank\">Team</a> page.</p>\n<p>We've heard from many Kagglers that teaming up is the best way to learn new skills AND have fun. If you don't have a teammate already, consider asking if anyone wants to team up in the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a>.</p>\n<h2>What are Notebooks?</h2>\n<p>Kaggle Notebooks is a cloud computational environment that enables reproducible and collaborative analysis. Notebooks support scripts in Python and R, Jupyter Notebooks, and RMarkdown reports. You can visit the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/notebooks\" target=\"_blank\">Notebooks</a> tab to view all of the publicly shared code for the Titanic competition. For more on how to use Notebooks to learn data science, check out our <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview\" target=\"&quot;_blank\">Courses</a>!</p>\n<h2>Why did my team disappear from the leaderboard?</h2>\n<p>To keep with the spirit of getting-started competitions, we have implemented a two month rolling window on submissions. Once a submission is more than two months old, it will be invalidated and no longer count towards the leaderboard.</p>\n<p>If your team has no submissions in the previous two months, the team will also drop from the leaderboard. This will keep the leaderboard at a manageable size, freshen it up, and prevent newcomers from getting lost in a sea of abandoned scores.</p>\n<p><i>\"I worked so hard to get that score! Give it back!\"</i> Read more about our decision to implement a rolling leaderboard <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion/6240\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n<h2>How do I contact Support?</h2>\n<p>Kaggle does not have a dedicated support team so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. (For this competition, you’ll want to use the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">Titanic discussion forum)</a>.</p>\n<p>Support is only able to help with issues that are being experienced by all participants. Before contacting support, please check the discussion forum for information on your problem. If you can’t find it, you can post your problem in the forum so a fellow participant or a Kaggle team member can provide help. The forums are full of useful information on the data, metric, and different approaches. We encourage you to use the forums often.

They are a great place to begin if you are new to data science or just finished a MOOC and want to get involved in Kaggle.</p>\\n<p>Getting Started competitions are a non-competitive way to get familiar with Kaggle’s platform, learn basic machine learning concepts, and start meeting people in the community. They have no cash prize and are on a rolling timeline.</p>\\n<h2>How do I create and manage a team?</h2>\\n<p>When you accept the competition rules, a team will be created for you. You can invite others to your team, accept a merger with another team, and update basic information like team name by going to the More &gt; <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/team\" target=\"_blank\">Team</a> page.</p>\\n<p>We\\'ve heard from many Kagglers that teaming up is the best way to learn new skills AND have fun. If you don\\'t have a teammate already, consider asking if anyone wants to team up in the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a>.</p>\\n<h2>What are Notebooks?</h2>\\n<p>Kaggle Notebooks is a cloud computational environment that enables reproducible and collaborative analysis. Notebooks support scripts in Python and R, Jupyter Notebooks, and RMarkdown reports. You can visit the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/notebooks\" target=\"_blank\">Notebooks</a> tab to view all of the publicly shared code for the Titanic competition. For more on how to use Notebooks to learn data science, check out our <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview\" target=\"&quot;_blank\">Courses</a>!</p>\\n<h2>Why did my team disappear from the leaderboard?</h2>\\n<p>To keep with the spirit of getting-started competitions, we have implemented a two month rolling window on submissions. Once a submission is more than two months old, it will be invalidated and no longer count towards the leaderboard.</p>\\n<p>If your team has no submissions in the previous two months, the team will also drop from the leaderboard. This will keep the leaderboard at a manageable size, freshen it up, and prevent newcomers from getting lost in a sea of abandoned scores.</p>\\n<p><i>\"I worked so hard to get that score! Give it back!\"</i> Read more about our decision to implement a rolling leaderboard <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion/6240\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\\n<h2>How do I contact Support?</h2>\\n<p>Kaggle does not have a dedicated support team so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. (For this competition, you’ll want to use the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">Titanic discussion forum)</a>.</p>\\n<p>Support is only able to help with issues that are being experienced by all participants. Before contacting support, please check the discussion forum for information on your problem. If you can’t find it, you can post your problem in the forum so a fellow participant or a Kaggle team member can provide help. The forums are full of useful information on the data, metric, and different approaches. We encourage you to use the forums often. If you share your knowledge, you\\'ll find that others will share a lot in turn!</p>\\n<p>If your problem persists or it seems to be effective all participants then please <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/contact\" target=\"_blank\">contact us</a>.</p>'}, {'role': 'tool', 'content': 'Not a directory: /home/code/exploration/../research/writeups'}, {'role': 'tool', 'content': '/home/code/exploration/../research/kernels:\\n[DIR]  alexisbcook_exercise-arithmetic-and-variables/\\n[DIR]  alexisbcook_titanic-tutorial/\\n[DIR]  arthurtok_introduction-to-ensembling-stacking-in-python/\\n[DIR]  ldfreeman3_a-data-science-framework-to-achieve-99-accuracy/\\n[FILE] metadata.json (1.7KB)\\n[DIR]  startupsci_titanic-data-science-solutions/'}, {'role': 'tool', 'content': '/home/data:\\n[FILE] description.md (13.6KB)\\n[FILE] gender_submission.csv (3.2KB)\\n[FILE] test.csv (28.0KB)\\n[FILE] train.csv (59.8KB)'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': \"REASONING: Good, I can see this is the classic Titanic survival prediction problem - binary classification with accuracy as the metric.

Most beginners get lost in the field, because they fall into the black box approach, using libraries and algorithms they don't understand. This tutorial will give you a 1-2-year head start over your peers, by providing a framework that teaches you how-to think like a data scientist vs what to think/code. Not only will you be able to submit your first competition, but you’ll be able to solve any problem\\n\\n=== MARKDOWN 1 ===\\n<a id=\\\"ch1\\\"></a>\\n# How a Data Scientist Beat the Odds\\nIt's the classical problem, predict the outcome of a binary event. In laymen terms this means, it either occurred or did not occur. For example, you won or did not win, you passed the test or did not pass the test, you were accepted or not accepted, and you get the point. A common business application is churn or customer retention. Another popular use case is, healthcare's mortality rate or survival analysis. Binary events create an interest\\n\\n=== MARKDOWN 2 ===\\n<a id=\\\"ch2\\\"></a>\\n# A Data Science Framework\\n1. **Define the Problem:** If data science, big data, machine learning, predictive analytics, business intelligence, or any other buzzword is the solution, then what is the problem?

On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the inter\\n\\n=== MARKDOWN 4 ===\\n<a id=\\\"ch4\\\"></a>\\n# Step 3: Prepare Data for Consumption\\nSince step 2 was provided to us on a golden plater, so is step 3.

Thus, only data cleaning is in scope.\\n\\n## 3.1 Import Libraries\\nThe following code is written in Python 3.x. Libraries provide pre-written functionality to perform necessary tasks.

Then check out <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/titanic-tutorial\">Alexis Cook’s Titanic Tutorial</a> that walks you through step by step how to make your first submission!\n\n<iframe width=\"699\" height=\"368\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8yZMXCaFshs\" title=\"YouTube video | How to Get Started with Kaggle’s Titanic Competition | Kaggle\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n## The Challenge\nThe sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.\n\nOn April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.\n\nWhile there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.\n\nIn this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).\n\n> #### Recommended Tutorial\n> We highly recommend [Alexis Cook’s Titanic Tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/titanic-tutorial) that walks you through making your very first submission step by step and [this starter notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/gusthema/titanic-competition-w-tensorflow-decision-forests) to get started.\n\n## How Kaggle’s Competitions Work\n1. **Join the Competition**\nRead about the challenge description, accept the Competition Rules and gain access to the competition dataset.\n1.  **Get to Work**\nDownload the data, build models on it locally or on Kaggle Notebooks (our no-setup, customizable Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs) and generate a prediction file.\n1.  **Make a Submission**\nUpload your prediction as a submission on Kaggle and receive an accuracy score.\n1.  **Check the Leaderboard**\nSee how your model ranks against other Kagglers on our leaderboard. \n1.  **Improve Your Score**\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a> to find lots of tutorials and insights from other competitors.\n\n> #### Kaggle Lingo Video\n> You may run into unfamiliar lingo as you dig into the Kaggle discussion forums and public notebooks. Check out  Dr. Rachael Tatman’s [video on Kaggle Lingo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEJHyuWKd-s) to get up to speed!\n\n## What Data Will I Use in This Competition?\nIn this competition, you’ll gain access to two similar datasets that include passenger information like name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc. One dataset is titled `train.csv` and the other is titled `test.csv`.\n\n`Train.csv` will contain the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 to be exact) and importantly, will reveal whether they survived or not, also known as the “ground truth”.\n\nThe `test.csv` dataset contains similar information but does not disclose the “ground truth” for each passenger. It’s your job to predict these outcomes.\n\nUsing the patterns you find in the `train.csv` data, predict whether the other 418 passengers on board (found in `test.csv`) survived.\n\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data\">“Data” tab</a> to explore the datasets even further. Once you feel you’ve created a competitive model, submit it to Kaggle to see where your model stands on our leaderboard against other Kagglers.\n\n## How to Submit your Prediction to Kaggle\nOnce you’re ready to make a submission and get on the leaderboard:\n\n1. Click on the “Submit Predictions” button\n<img width=\"699\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen1.png\">\n1. Upload a CSV file in the submission file format. You’re able to submit 10 submissions a day.\n<img width=\"699\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen2.png\">\n\n## Submission File Format:\nYou should submit a csv file with exactly 418 entries plus a header row. Your submission will show an error if you have extra columns (beyond `PassengerId` and `Survived`) or rows.\n\nThe file should have exactly 2 columns:\n- `PassengerId` (sorted in any order)\n- `Survived` (contains your binary predictions: 1 for survived, 0 for deceased)\n\n## Got it! I’m ready to get started. Where do I get help if I need it?\n- For Competition Help: <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\">Titanic Discussion Forum</a>\n\nKaggle doesn’t have a dedicated team to help troubleshoot your code so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. The forums are full of useful information on the data, metric, and different approaches. We encourage you to use the forums often. If you share your knowledge, you'll find that others will share a lot in turn!\n\n## A Last Word on Kaggle Notebooks\nAs we mentioned before, Kaggle Notebooks is our no-setup, customizable, Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs and a huge repository of community published data &amp; code.\n\nIn every competition, you’ll find many Notebooks shared with incredible insights. It’s an invaluable resource worth becoming familiar with. Check out this competition’s Notebooks <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/notebooks\">here</a>.\n\n## 🏃‍♀Ready to Compete? <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/account/login?returnUrl=%2Fc%2Ftitanic\">Join the Competition Here!</a>\n\n## Evaluation\n\n<h2>Goal</h2>\n<p>It is your job to predict if a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic or not. <br>For each  in the test set, you must predict a 0 or 1 value for the  variable.</p>\n<h2>Metric</h2>\n<p>Your score is the percentage of passengers you correctly predict.

Most beginners get lost in the field, because they fall into the black box approach, using libraries and algorithms they don't understand. This tutorial will give you a 1-2-year head start over your peers, by providing a framework that teaches you how-to think like a data scientist vs what to think/code. Not only will you be able to submit your first competition, but you’ll be able to solve any problem\n\n=== MARKDOWN 1 ===\n<a id=\"ch1\"></a>\n# How a Data Scientist Beat the Odds\nIt's the classical problem, predict the outcome of a binary event. In laymen terms this means, it either occurred or did not occur. For example, you won or did not win, you passed the test or did not pass the test, you were accepted or not accepted, and you get the point. A common business application is churn or customer retention. Another popular use case is, healthcare's mortality rate or survival analysis.

Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.\\n\\nWhile there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.\\n\\nIn this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).\\n\\n> #### Recommended Tutorial\\n> We highly recommend [Alexis Cook’s Titanic Tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/titanic-tutorial) that walks you through making your very first submission step by step and [this starter notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/gusthema/titanic-competition-w-tensorflow-decision-forests) to get started.\\n\\n## How Kaggle’s Competitions Work\\n1. **Join the Competition**\\nRead about the challenge description, accept the Competition Rules and gain access to the competition dataset.\\n1.  **Get to Work**\\nDownload the data, build models on it locally or on Kaggle Notebooks (our no-setup, customizable Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs) and generate a prediction file.\\n1.  **Make a Submission**\\nUpload your prediction as a submission on Kaggle and receive an accuracy score.\\n1.  **Check the Leaderboard**\\nSee how your model ranks against other Kagglers on our leaderboard. \\n1.  **Improve Your Score**\\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a> to find lots of tutorials and insights from other competitors.\\n\\n> #### Kaggle Lingo Video\\n> You may run into unfamiliar lingo as you dig into the Kaggle discussion forums and public notebooks. Check out  Dr. Rachael Tatman’s [video on Kaggle Lingo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEJHyuWKd-s) to get up to speed!\\n\\n## What Data Will I Use in This Competition?\\nIn this competition, you’ll gain access to two similar datasets that include passenger information like name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc. One dataset is titled `train.csv` and the other is titled `test.csv`.\\n\\n`Train.csv` will contain the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 to be exact) and importantly, will reveal whether they survived or not, also known as the “ground truth”.\\n\\nThe `test.csv` dataset contains similar information but does not disclose the “ground truth” for each passenger. It’s your job to predict these outcomes.\\n\\nUsing the patterns you find in the `train.csv` data, predict whether the other 418 passengers on board (found in `test.csv`) survived.\\n\\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data\">“Data” tab</a> to explore the datasets even further. Once you feel you’ve created a competitive model, submit it to Kaggle to see where your model stands on our leaderboard against other Kagglers.\\n\\n## How to Submit your Prediction to Kaggle\\nOnce you’re ready to make a submission and get on the leaderboard:\\n\\n1. Click on the “Submit Predictions” button\\n<img width=\"699\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen1.png\">\\n1. Upload a CSV file in the submission file format. You’re able to submit 10 submissions a day.\\n<img width=\"699\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen2.png\">\\n\\n## Submission File Format:\\nYou should submit a csv file with exactly 418 entries plus a header row. Your submission will show an error if you have extra columns (beyond `PassengerId` and `Survived`) or rows.\\n\\nThe file should have exactly 2 columns:\\n- `PassengerId` (sorted in any order)\\n- `Survived` (contains your binary predictions: 1 for survived, 0 for deceased)\\n\\n## Got it! I’m ready to get started. Where do I get help if I need it?\\n- For Competition Help: <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\">Titanic Discussion Forum</a>\\n\\nKaggle doesn’t have a dedicated team to help troubleshoot your code so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. The forums are full of useful information on the data, metric, and different approaches. We encourage you to use the forums often. If you share your knowledge, you\\'ll find that others will share a lot in turn!\\n\\n## A Last Word on Kaggle Notebooks\\nAs we mentioned before, Kaggle Notebooks is our no-setup, customizable, Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs and a huge repository of community published data &amp; code.\\n\\nIn every competition, you’ll find many Notebooks shared with incredible insights. It’s an invaluable resource worth becoming familiar with.

They are a great place to begin if you are new to data science or just finished a MOOC and want to get involved in Kaggle.</p>\\n<p>Getting Started competitions are a non-competitive way to get familiar with Kaggle’s platform, learn basic machine learning concepts, and start meeting people in the community. They have no cash prize and are on a rolling timeline.</p>\\n<h2>How do I create and manage a team?</h2>\\n<p>When you accept the competition rules, a team will be created for you. You can invite others to your team, accept a merger with another team, and update basic information like team name by going to the More &gt; <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/team\" target=\"_blank\">Team</a> page.</p>\\n<p>We\\'ve heard from many Kagglers that teaming up is the best way to learn new skills AND have fun. If you don\\'t have a teammate already, consider asking if anyone wants to team up in the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a>.</p>\\n<h2>What are Notebooks?</h2>\\n<p>Kaggle Notebooks is a cloud computational environment that enables reproducible and collaborative analysis. Notebooks support scripts in Python and R, Jupyter Notebooks, and RMarkdown reports. You can visit the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/notebooks\" target=\"_blank\">Notebooks</a> tab to view all of the publicly shared code for the Titanic competition. For more on how to use Notebooks to learn data science, check out our <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview\" target=\"&quot;_blank\">Courses</a>!</p>\\n<h2>Why did my team disappear from the leaderboard?</h2>\\n<p>To keep with the spirit of getting-started competitions, we have implemented a two month rolling window on submissions. Once a submission is more than two months old, it will be invalidated and no longer count towards the leaderboard.</p>\\n<p>If your team has no submissions in the previous two months, the team will also drop from the leaderboard. This will keep the leaderboard at a manageable size, freshen it up, and prevent newcomers from getting lost in a sea of abandoned scores.</p>\\n<p><i>\"I worked so hard to get that score! Give it back!\"</i> Read more about our decision to implement a rolling leaderboard <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion/6240\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\\n<h2>How do I contact Support?</h2>\\n<p>Kaggle does not have a dedicated support team so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. (For this competition, you’ll want to use the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">Titanic discussion forum)</a>.</p>\\n<p>Support is only able to help with issues that are being experienced by all participants. Before contacting support, please check the discussion forum for information on your problem. If you can’t find it, you can post your problem in the forum so a fellow participant or a Kaggle team member can provide help. The forums are full of useful information on the data, metric, and different approaches. We encourage you to use the forums often.

In a nutshell stacking uses as a first-level (base), the predictions of a few basic classifiers and then uses another model at the second-level to predict the output from the earlier first-level predictions.\\n\\nThe Titanic dataset is a prime candidate for introducing this concept as many newcomers to Kaggle start out here.

However before we proceed let us generate some simple correlation and distribution plots of our transformed dataset to observe ho\\n\\n## Visualisations \\n\\n=== CODE 8 ===\\ntrain.head(3)\\n\\n=== MARKDOWN 9 ===\\n**Pearson Correlation Heatmap**\\n\\nlet us generate some correlation plots of the features to see how related one feature is to the next. To do so, we will utilise the Seaborn plotting package which allows us to plot heatmaps very conveniently as follows\\n\\n=== CODE 10 ===\\ncolormap = plt.cm.RdBu\\nplt.figure(figsize=(14,12))\\nplt.title('Pearson Correlation of Features', y=1.05, size=15)\\nsns.heatmap(train.astype(float).corr(),linewidths=0.1,vmax=1.0, \\n            square=True, cmap=colormap, linecolor='white', annot=True)\\n\\n=== MARKDOWN 11 ===\\n**Takeaway from the Plots**\\n\\nOne thing that that the Pearson Correlation plot can tell us is that there are not too many features strongly correlated with one another. This is good from a point of view of feeding these features into your learning model because this means that there isn't much redundant or superfluous data in our training set and we are happy that each feature carries with it some unique information. Here are two most correlated features are that of Family size and Parch (Parents and Children). I'll still leave both features in for the purposes of this exercise.\\n\\n**Pairplots**\\n\\n\\n=== CODE 12 ===\\ng = sns.pairplot(train[[u'Survived', u'Pclass', u'Sex', u'Age', u'Parch', u'Fare', u'Embarked',\\n       u'FamilySize', u'Title']], hue='Survived', palette = 'seismic',size=1.2,diag_kind = 'kde',diag_kws=dict(shade=True),plot_kws=dict(s=10) )\\ng.set(xticklabels=[])\\n\\n=== MARKDOWN 13 ===\\n# Ensembling & Stacking models\\n\\nFinally after that brief whirlwind detour with regards to feature engineering and formatting, we finally arrive at the meat and gist of the this notebook.\\n\\nCreating a Stacking ensemble!\\n\\n=== MARKDOWN 14 ===\\n### Helpers via Python Classes\\n\\nHere we invoke the use of Python's classes to help make it more convenient for us. For any newcomers to programming, one normally hears Classes being used in conjunction with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). In short, a class helps to extend some code/program for creating objects (variables for old-school peeps) as well as to implement functions and methods specific to that class.\\n\\nIn the section of code below, we essentially write a class *SklearnHelper* that allows one to extend the inbuilt methods (such as train, predict and fit) common to all the Sklearn c\\n\\n=== CODE 15 ===\\n# Some useful parameters which will come in handy later on\\nntrain = train.shape[0]\\nntest = test.shape[0]\\nSEED = 0 # for reproducibility\\nNFOLDS = 5 # set folds for out-of-fold prediction\\nkf = KFold(ntrain, n_folds= NFOLDS, random_state=SEED)\\n\\n# Class to extend the Sklearn classifier\\nclass SklearnHelper(object):\\n    def __init__(self, clf, seed=0, params=None):\\n        params['random_state'] = seed\\n        self.clf = clf(**params)\\n\\n    def train(self, x_train, y_train):\\n        self.clf.fit(x_train, y_train)\\n\\n    def predict(self, x):\\n        return self.clf.predict(x)\\n    \\n    def fit(self,x,y)\\n\\n=== MARKDOWN 16 ===\\nBear with me for those who already know this but for people who have not created classes or objects in Python before, let me explain what the code given above does. In creating my base classifiers, I will only use the models already present in the Sklearn library and therefore only extend the class for that.\\n\\n**def init** : Python standard for invoking the default constructor for the class. This means that when you want to create an object (classifier), you have to give it the parameters of clf (what sklearn classifier you want), seed (random seed) and params (parameters for the classifiers).\\n\\n\\n=== MARKDOWN 17 ===\\n### Out-of-Fold Predictions\\n\\nNow as alluded to above in the introductory section, stacking uses predictions of base classifiers as input for training to a second-level model. However one cannot simply train the base models on the full training data, generate predictions on the full test set and then output these for the second-level training. This runs the risk of your base model predictions already having \\\"seen\\\" the test set and therefore overfitting when feeding these predictions.\\n\\n=== CODE 18 ===\\ndef get_oof(clf, x_train, y_train, x_test):\\n    oof_train = np.zeros((ntrain,))\\n    oof_test = np.zeros((ntest,))\\n    oof_test_skf = np.empty((NFOLDS, ntest))\\n\\n    for i, (train_index, test_index) in enumerate(kf):\\n        x_tr = x_train[train_index]\\n        y_tr = y_train[train_index]\\n        x_te = x_train[test_index]\\n\\n        clf.train(x_tr, y_tr)\\n\\n        oof_train[test_index] = clf.predict(x_te)\\n        oof_test_skf[i, :] = clf.predict(x_test)\\n\\n    oof_test[:] = oof_test_skf.mean(axis=0)\\n    return oof_train.reshape(-1, 1), oof_test.reshape(-1, 1)\\n\\n=== MARKDOWN 19 ===\\n# Generating our Base First-Level Models \\n\\nSo now let us prepare five learning models as our first level classification. These models can all be conveniently invoked via the Sklearn library and are listed as follows:\\n\\n 1. Random Forest classifier\\n 2. Extra Trees classifier\\n 3. AdaBoost classifer\\n 4. Gradient Boosting classifer\\n 5. Support Vector Machine\\n\\n=== MARKDOWN 20 ===\\n**Parameters**\\n\\nJust a quick summary of the parameters that we will be listing here for completeness,\\n\\n**n_jobs** : Number of cores used for the training process. If set to -1, all cores are used.\\n\\n**n_estimators** : Number of classification trees in your learning model ( set to 10 per default)\\n\\n**max_depth** : Maximum depth of tree, or how much a node should be expanded. Beware if set to too high  a number would run the risk of overfitting as one would be growing the tree too deep\\n\\n**verbose** : Controls whether you want to output any text during the learning process. A value of 0 suppresses \\n\\n=== CODE 21 ===\\n# Put in our parameters for said classifiers\\n# Random Forest parameters\\nrf_params = {\\n    'n_jobs': -1,\\n    'n_estimators': 500,\\n     'warm_start': True, \\n     #'max_features': 0.2,\\n    'max_depth': 6,\\n    'min_samples_leaf': 2,\\n    'max_features' : 'sqrt',\\n    'verbose': 0\\n}\\n\\n# Extra Trees Parameters\\net_params = {\\n    'n_jobs': -1,\\n    'n_estimators':500,\\n    #'max_features': 0.5,\\n    'max_depth': 8,\\n    'min_samples_leaf': 2,\\n    'verbose': 0\\n}\\n\\n# AdaBoost parameters\\nada_params = {\\n    'n_estimators': 500,\\n    'learning_rate' : 0.75\\n}\\n\\n# Gradient Boosting parameters\\ngb_params = {\\n    'n_esti\\n\\n=== MARKDOWN 22 ===\\nFurthermore, since having mentioned about Objects and classes within the OOP framework, let us now create 5 objects that represent our 5 learning models via our Helper Sklearn Class we defined earlier.\\n\\n=== CODE 23 ===\\n# Create 5 objects that\\n...(truncated)...\\n\\n# Create Numpy arrays of train, test and target ( Survived) dataframes to feed into our models\\ny_train = train['Survived'].ravel()\\ntrain = train.drop(['Survived'], axis=1)\\nx_train = train.values # Creates an array of the train data\\nx_test = test.values # Creats an array of the test data\\n\\n=== MARKDOWN 26 ===\\n**Output of the First level Predictions** \\n\\nWe now feed the training and test data into our 5 base classifiers and use the Out-of-Fold prediction function we defined earlier to generate our first level predictions. Allow a handful of minutes for the chunk of code below to run.\\n\\n=== CODE 27 ===\\n# Create our OOF train and test predictions. These base results will be used as new features\\net_oof_train, et_oof_test = get_oof(et, x_train, y_train, x_test) # Extra Trees\\nrf_oof_train, rf_oof_test = get_oof(rf,x_train, y_train, x_test) # Random Forest\\nada_oof_train, ada_oof_test = get_oof(ada, x_train, y_train, x_test) # AdaBoost \\ngb_oof_train, gb_oof_test = get_oof(gb,x_train, y_train, x_test) # Gradient Boost\\nsvc_oof_train, svc_oof_test = get_oof(svc,x_train, y_train, x_test) # Support Vector Classifier\\n\\nprint(\\\"Training is complete\\\")\\n\\n=== MARKDOWN 28 ===\\n**Feature importances generated from the different classifiers**\\n\\nNow having learned our the first-level classifiers, we can utilise a very nifty feature of the Sklearn models and that is to output the importances of the various features in the training and test sets with one very simple line of code.\\n\\nAs per the Sklearn documentation, most of the classifiers are built in with an attribute which returns feature importances by simply typing in **.feature_importances_**. Therefore we will invoke this very useful attribute via our function earliand plot the feature importances as such\\n\\n=== CODE 29 ===\\nrf_feature = rf.feature_importances(x_train,y_train)\\net_feature = et.feature_importances(x_train, y_train)\\nada_feature = ada.feature_importances(x_train, y_train)\\ngb_feature = gb.feature_importances(x_train,y_train)\\n\\n=== MARKDOWN 30 ===\\nSo I have not yet figured out how to assign and store the feature importances outright.

It was built to optimize large-scale boosted tree algorithms. For further information about the algorithm, check out the [official documentation][1].\\n\\n  [1]: https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\\n\\nAnyways, we call an XGBClassifier and fit it to the first-level train and target data and use the learned model to predict the test data as follows:\\n\\n=== CODE 49 ===\\ngbm = xgb.XGBClassifier(\\n    #learning_rate = 0.02,\\n n_estimators= 2000,\\n max_depth= 4,\\n min_child_weight= 2,\\n #gamma=1,\\n gamma=0.9,                        \\n subsample=0.8,\\n colsample_bytree=0.8,\\n objective= 'binary:logistic',\\n nthread= -1,\\n scale_pos_weight=1).fit(x_train, y_train)\\npredictions = gbm.predict(x_test)\\n\\n=== MARKDOWN 50 ===\\nJust a quick run down of the XGBoost parameters used in the model:\\n\\n**max_depth** : How deep you want to grow your tree. Beware if set to too high a number might run the risk of overfitting.\\n\\n**gamma** : minimum loss reduction required to make a further partition on a leaf node of the tree. The larger, the more conservative the algorithm will be.\\n\\n**eta** : step size shrinkage used in each boosting step to prevent overfitting\\n\\n=== MARKDOWN 51 ===\\n**Producing the Submission file**\\n\\nFinally having trained and fit all our first-level and second-level models, we can now output the predictions into the proper format for submission to the Titanic competition as follows:\\n\\n=== CODE 52 ===\\n# Generate Submission File \\nStackingSubmission = pd.DataFrame({ 'PassengerId': PassengerId,\\n                            'Survived': predictions })\\nStackingSubmission.to_csv(\\\"StackingSubmission.csv\\\", index=False)\\n\\n=== MARKDOWN 53 ===\\n**Steps for Further Improvement**\\n\\nAs a closing remark it must be noted that the steps taken above just show a very simple way of producing an ensemble stacker. You hear of ensembles created at the highest level of Kaggle competitions which involves monstrous combinations of stacked classifiers as well as levels of stacking which go to more than 2 levels. \\n\\nSome additional steps that may be taken to improve one's score could be:\\n\\n 1. Implementing a good cross-validation strategy in training the models to find optimal parameter values\\n 2. Introduce a greater variety of base models for learning.\\n\\n=== MARKDOWN 54 ===\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nI have this notebook has been helpful somewhat in introducing a working script for stacking learning models.

Then check out <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/titanic-tutorial\">Alexis Cook’s Titanic Tutorial</a> that walks you through step by step how to make your first submission!\n\n<iframe width=\"699\" height=\"368\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8yZMXCaFshs\" title=\"YouTube video | How to Get Started with Kaggle’s Titanic Competition | Kaggle\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n## The Challenge\nThe sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.\n\nOn April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.\n\nWhile there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.\n\nIn this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).\n\n> #### Recommended Tutorial\n> We highly recommend [Alexis Cook’s Titanic Tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/titanic-tutorial) that walks you through making your very first submission step by step and [this starter notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/gusthema/titanic-competition-w-tensorflow-decision-forests) to get started.\n\n## How Kaggle’s Competitions Work\n1. **Join the Competition**\nRead about the challenge description, accept the Competition Rules and gain access to the competition dataset.\n1.  **Get to Work**\nDownload the data, build models on it locally or on Kaggle Notebooks (our no-setup, customizable Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs) and generate a prediction file.\n1.  **Make a Submission**\nUpload your prediction as a submission on Kaggle and receive an accuracy score.\n1.  **Check the Leaderboard**\nSee how your model ranks against other Kagglers on our leaderboard. \n1.  **Improve Your Score**\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a> to find lots of tutorials and insights from other competitors.\n\n> #### Kaggle Lingo Video\n> You may run into unfamiliar lingo as you dig into the Kaggle discussion forums and public notebooks. Check out  Dr. Rachael Tatman’s [video on Kaggle Lingo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEJHyuWKd-s) to get up to speed!\n\n## What Data Will I Use in This Competition?\nIn this competition, you’ll gain access to two similar datasets that include passenger information like name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc. One dataset is titled `train.csv` and the other is titled `test.csv`.\n\n`Train.csv` will contain the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 to be exact) and importantly, will reveal whether they survived or not, also known as the “ground truth”.\n\nThe `test.csv` dataset contains similar information but does not disclose the “ground truth” for each passenger. It’s your job to predict these outcomes.\n\nUsing the patterns you find in the `train.csv` data, predict whether the other 418 passengers on board (found in `test.csv`) survived.\n\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data\">“Data” tab</a> to explore the datasets even further. Once you feel you’ve created a competitive model, submit it to Kaggle to see where your model stands on our leaderboard against other Kagglers.\n\n## How to Submit your Prediction to Kaggle\nOnce you’re ready to make a submission and get on the leaderboard:\n\n1. Click on the “Submit Predictions” button\n<img width=\"699\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen1.png\">\n1. Upload a CSV file in the submission file format. You’re able to submit 10 submissions a day.\n<img width=\"699\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen2.png\">\n\n## Submission File Format:\nYou should submit a csv file with exactly 418 entries plus a header row. Your submission will show an error if you have extra columns (beyond `PassengerId` and `Survived`) or rows.\n\nThe file should have exactly 2 columns:\n- `PassengerId` (sorted in any order)\n- `Survived` (contains your binary predictions: 1 for survived, 0 for deceased)\n\n## Got it! I’m ready to get started. Where do I get help if I need it?\n- For Competition Help: <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\">Titanic Discussion Forum</a>\n\nKaggle doesn’t have a dedicated team to help troubleshoot your code so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. The forums are full of useful information on the data, metric, and different approaches. We encourage you to use the forums often. If you share your knowledge, you'll find that others will share a lot in turn!\n\n## A Last Word on Kaggle Notebooks\nAs we mentioned before, Kaggle Notebooks is our no-setup, customizable, Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs and a huge repository of community published data &amp; code.\n\nIn every competition, you’ll find many Notebooks shared with incredible insights. It’s an invaluable resource worth becoming familiar with.

They are a great place to begin if you are new to data science or just finished a MOOC and want to get involved in Kaggle.</p>\n<p>Getting Started competitions are a non-competitive way to get familiar with Kaggle’s platform, learn basic machine learning concepts, and start meeting people in the community. They have no cash prize and are on a rolling timeline.</p>\n<h2>How do I create and manage a team?</h2>\n<p>When you accept the competition rules, a team will be created for you. You can invite others to your team, accept a merger with another team, and update basic information like team name by going to the More &gt; <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/team\" target=\"_blank\">Team</a> page.</p>\n<p>We've heard from many Kagglers that teaming up is the best way to learn new skills AND have fun. If you don't have a teammate already, consider asking if anyone wants to team up in the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a>.</p>\n<h2>What are Notebooks?</h2>\n<p>Kaggle Notebooks is a cloud computational environment that enables reproducible and collaborative analysis. Notebooks support scripts in Python and R, Jupyter Notebooks, and RMarkdown reports.

In laymen terms this means, it either occurred or did not occur. For example, you won or did not win, you passed the test or did not pass the test, you were accepted or not accepted, and you get the point. A common business application is churn or customer retention. Another popular use case is, healthcare's mortality rate or survival analysis.

In a nutshell stacking uses as a first-level (base), the predictions of a few basic classifiers and then uses another model at the second-level to predict the output from the earlier first-level predictions.\n\nThe Titanic dataset is a prime candidate for introducing this concept as many newcomers to Kaggle start out here. Furthermore even though stacking has been responsible for many a team winning K\n\n=== CODE 1 ===\n# Load in our libraries\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport re\nimport sklearn\nimport xgboost as xgb\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline\n\nimport plotly.offline as py\npy.init_notebook_mode(connected=True)\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\nimport plotly.tools as tls\n\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\n\n# Going to use these 5 base models for the stacking\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import (RandomForestClassifier, AdaBoostClassifier, \n                              GradientBoostingClassifier, ExtraTreesClassifier)\nfrom sklearn.svm import SVC\nfrom \n\n=== MARKDOWN 2 ===\n# Feature Exploration, Engineering and Cleaning \n\nNow we will proceed much like how most kernels in general are structured, and that is to first explore the data on hand, identify possible feature engineering opportunities as well as numerically encode any categorical features.\n\n=== CODE 3 ===\n# Load in the train and test datasets\ntrain = pd.read_csv('../input/train.csv')\ntest = pd.read_csv('../input/test.csv')\n\n# Store our passenger ID for easy access\nPassengerId = test['PassengerId']\n\ntrain.head(3)\n\n=== MARKDOWN 4 ===\nWell it is no surprise that our task is to somehow extract the information out of the categorical variables \n\n**Feature Engineering**\n\nHere, credit must be extended to Sina's very comprehensive and well-thought out notebook for the feature engineering ideas so please check out his work \n\n[Titanic Best Working Classfier][1] : by Sina\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.kaggle.com/sinakhorami/titanic/titanic-best-working-classifier\n\n=== CODE 5 ===\nfull_data = [train, test]\n\n# Some features of my own that I have added in\n# Gives the length of the name\ntrain['Name_length'] = train['Name'].apply(len)\ntest['Name_length'] = test['Name'].apply(len)\n# Feature that tells whether a passenger had a cabin on the Titanic\ntrain['Has_Cabin'] = train[\"Cabin\"].apply(lambda x: 0 if type(x) == float else 1)\ntest['Has_Cabin'] = test[\"Cabin\"].apply(lambda x: 0 if type(x) == float else 1)\n\n# Feature engineering steps taken from Sina\n# Create new feature FamilySize as a combination of SibSp and Parch\nfor dataset in full_data:\n    dataset['FamilySize'] = data\n\n=== CODE 6 ===\n# Feature selection\ndrop_elements = ['PassengerId', 'Name', 'Ticket', 'Cabin', 'SibSp']\ntrain = train.drop(drop_elements, axis = 1)\ntrain = train.drop(['CategoricalAge', 'CategoricalFare'], axis = 1)\ntest  = test.drop(drop_elements, axis = 1)\n\n=== MARKDOWN 7 ===\nAll right so now having cleaned the features and extracted relevant information and dropped the categorical columns our features should now all be numeric, a format suitable to feed into our Machine Learning models.

To do so, we will utilise the Seaborn plotting package which allows us to plot heatmaps very conveniently as follows\n\n=== CODE 10 ===\ncolormap = plt.cm.RdBu\nplt.figure(figsize=(14,12))\nplt.title('Pearson Correlation of Features', y=1.05, size=15)\nsns.heatmap(train.astype(float).corr(),linewidths=0.1,vmax=1.0, \n            square=True, cmap=colormap, linecolor='white', annot=True)\n\n=== MARKDOWN 11 ===\n**Takeaway from the Plots**\n\nOne thing that that the Pearson Correlation plot can tell us is that there are not too many features strongly correlated with one another. This is good from a point of view of feeding these features into your learning model because this means that there isn't much redundant or superfluous data in our training set and we are happy that each feature carries with it some unique information. Here are two most correlated features are that of Family size and Parch (Parents and Children). I'll still leave both features in for the purposes of this exercise.\n\n**Pairplots**\n\n\n=== CODE 12 ===\ng = sns.pairplot(train[[u'Survived', u'Pclass', u'Sex', u'Age', u'Parch', u'Fare', u'Embarked',\n       u'FamilySize', u'Title']], hue='Survived', palette = 'seismic',size=1.2,diag_kind = 'kde',diag_kws=dict(shade=True),plot_kws=dict(s=10) )\ng.set(xticklabels=[])\n\n=== MARKDOWN 13 ===\n# Ensembling & Stacking models\n\nFinally after that brief whirlwind detour with regards to feature engineering and formatting, we finally arrive at the meat and gist of the this notebook.\n\nCreating a Stacking ensemble!\n\n=== MARKDOWN 14 ===\n### Helpers via Python Classes\n\nHere we invoke the use of Python's classes to help make it more convenient for us. For any newcomers to programming, one normally hears Classes being used in conjunction with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). In short, a class helps to extend some code/program for creating objects (variables for old-school peeps) as well as to implement functions and methods specific to that class.\n\nIn the section of code below, we essentially write a class *SklearnHelper* that allows one to extend the inbuilt methods (such as train, predict and fit) common to all the Sklearn c\n\n=== CODE 15 ===\n# Some useful parameters which will come in handy later on\nntrain = train.shape[0]\nntest = test.shape[0]\nSEED = 0 # for reproducibility\nNFOLDS = 5 # set folds for out-of-fold prediction\nkf = KFold(ntrain, n_folds= NFOLDS, random_state=SEED)\n\n# Class to extend the Sklearn classifier\nclass SklearnHelper(object):\n    def __init__(self, clf, seed=0, params=None):\n        params['random_state'] = seed\n        self.clf = clf(**params)\n\n    def train(self, x_train, y_train):\n        self.clf.fit(x_train, y_train)\n\n    def predict(self, x):\n        return self.clf.predict(x)\n    \n    def fit(self,x,y)\n\n=== MARKDOWN 16 ===\nBear with me for those who already know this but for people who have not created classes or objects in Python before, let me explain what the code given above does. In creating my base classifiers, I will only use the models already present in the Sklearn library and therefore only extend the class for that.\n\n**def init** : Python standard for invoking the default constructor for the class. This means that when you want to create an object (classifier), you have to give it the parameters of clf (what sklearn classifier you want), seed (random seed) and params (parameters for the classifiers).\n\n\n=== MARKDOWN 17 ===\n### Out-of-Fold Predictions\n\nNow as alluded to above in the introductory section, stacking uses predictions of base classifiers as input for training to a second-level model. However one cannot simply train the base models on the full training data, generate predictions on the full test set and then output these for the second-level training. This runs the risk of your base model predictions already having \"seen\" the test set and therefore overfitting when feeding these predictions.\n\n=== CODE 18 ===\ndef get_oof(clf, x_train, y_train, x_test):\n    oof_train = np.zeros((ntrain,))\n    oof_test = np.zeros((ntest,))\n    oof_test_skf = np.empty((NFOLDS, ntest))\n\n    for i, (train_index, test_index) in enumerate(kf):\n        x_tr = x_train[train_index]\n        y_tr = y_train[train_index]\n        x_te = x_train[test_index]\n\n        clf.train(x_tr, y_tr)\n\n        oof_train[test_index] = clf.predict(x_te)\n        oof_test_skf[i, :] = clf.predict(x_test)\n\n    oof_test[:] = oof_test_skf.mean(axis=0)\n    return oof_train.reshape(-1, 1), oof_test.reshape(-1, 1)\n\n=== MARKDOWN 19 ===\n# Generating our Base First-Level Models \n\nSo now let us prepare five learning models as our first level classification. These models can all be conveniently invoked via the Sklearn library and are listed as follows:\n\n 1. Random Forest classifier\n 2. Extra Trees classifier\n 3. AdaBoost classifer\n 4.

As per the code below, we are therefore having as our new columns the first-level predictions from our earlier classifiers and we train the next classifier on this.\n\n=== CODE 42 ===\nbase_predictions_train = pd.DataFrame( {'RandomForest': rf_oof_train.ravel(),\n     'ExtraTrees': et_oof_train.ravel(),\n     'AdaBoost': ada_oof_train.ravel(),\n      'GradientBoost': gb_oof_train.ravel()\n    })\nbase_predictions_train.head()\n\n=== MARKDOWN 43 ===\n**Correlation Heatmap of the Second Level Training set**\n\n=== CODE 44 ===\ndata = [\n    go.Heatmap(\n        z= base_predictions_train.astype(float).corr().values ,\n        x=base_predictions_train.columns.values,\n        y= base_predictions_train.columns.values,\n          colorscale='Viridis',\n            showscale=True,\n            reversescale = True\n    )\n]\npy.iplot(data, filename='labelled-heatmap')\n\n=== MARKDOWN 45 ===\nThere have been quite a few articles and Kaggle competition winner stories about the merits of having trained models that are more uncorrelated with one another producing better scores.\n\n=== CODE 46 ===\nx_train = np.concatenate(( et_oof_train, rf_oof_train, ada_oof_train, gb_oof_train, svc_oof_train), axis=1)\nx_test = np.concatenate(( et_oof_test, rf_oof_test, ada_oof_test, gb_oof_test, svc_oof_test), axis=1)\n\n=== MARKDOWN 47 ===\nHaving now concatenated and joined both the first-level train and test predictions as x_train and x_test, we can now fit a second-level learning model.\n\n=== MARKDOWN 48 ===\n### Second level learning model via XGBoost\n\nHere we choose the eXtremely famous library for boosted tree learning model, XGBoost. It was built to optimize large-scale boosted tree algorithms. For further information about the algorithm, check out the [official documentation][1].\n\n  [1]: https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n\nAnyways, we call an XGBClassifier and fit it to the first-level train and target data and use the learned model to predict the test data as follows:\n\n=== CODE 49 ===\ngbm = xgb.XGBClassifier(\n    #learning_rate = 0.02,\n n_estimators= 2000,\n max_depth= 4,\n min_child_weight= 2,\n #gamma=1,\n gamma=0.9,                        \n subsample=0.8,\n colsample_bytree=0.8,\n objective= 'binary:logistic',\n nthread= -1,\n scale_pos_weight=1).fit(x_train, y_train)\npredictions = gbm.predict(x_test)\n\n=== MARKDOWN 50 ===\nJust a quick run down of the XGBoost parameters used in the model:\n\n**max_depth** : How deep you want to grow your tree. Beware if set to too high a number might run the risk of overfitting.\n\n**gamma** : minimum loss reduction required to make a further partition on a leaf node of the tree. The larger, the more conservative the algorithm will be.\n\n**eta** : step size shrinkage used in each boosting step to prevent overfitting\n\n=== MARKDOWN 51 ===\n**Producing the Submission file**\n\nFinally having trained and fit all our first-level and second-level models, we can now output the predictions into the proper format for submission to the Titanic competition as follows:\n\n=== CODE 52 ===\n# Generate Submission File \nStackingSubmission = pd.DataFrame({ 'PassengerId': PassengerId,\n                            'Survived': predictions })\nStackingSubmission.to_csv(\"StackingSubmission.csv\", index=False)\n\n=== MARKDOWN 53 ===\n**Steps for Further Improvement**\n\nAs a closing remark it must be noted that the steps taken above just show a very simple way of producing an ensemble stacker. You hear of ensembles created at the highest level of Kaggle competitions which involves monstrous combinations of stacked classifiers as well as levels of stacking which go to more than 2 levels. \n\nSome additional steps that may be taken to improve one's score could be:\n\n 1. Implementing a good cross-validation strategy in training the models to find optimal parameter values\n 2. Introduce a greater variety of base models for learning.\n\n=== MARKDOWN 54 ===\n### Conclusion\n\nI have this notebook has been helpful somewhat in introducing a working script for stacking learning models. Again credit must be extended to Faron and Sina. \n\nFor other excellent material on stacking or ensembling in general, refer to the de-facto Must read article on the website MLWave: [Kaggle Ensembling Guide][1]. \n\nTill next time, Peace Out\n\n  [1]: http://mlwave.com/kaggle-ensembling-guide/\n\n=== CODE 55 ===\n\n\n",

Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.\\n\\nWhile there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.\\n\\nIn this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).\\n\\n> #### Recommended Tutorial\\n> We highly recommend [Alexis Cook’s Titanic Tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/titanic-tutorial) that walks you through making your very first submission step by step and [this starter notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/gusthema/titanic-competition-w-tensorflow-decision-forests) to get started.\\n\\n## How Kaggle’s Competitions Work\\n1. **Join the Competition**\\nRead about the challenge description, accept the Competition Rules and gain access to the competition dataset.\\n1.  **Get to Work**\\nDownload the data, build models on it locally or on Kaggle Notebooks (our no-setup, customizable Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs) and generate a prediction file.\\n1.  **Make a Submission**\\nUpload your prediction as a submission on Kaggle and receive an accuracy score.\\n1.  **Check the Leaderboard**\\nSee how your model ranks against other Kagglers on our leaderboard. \\n1.  **Improve Your Score**\\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a> to find lots of tutorials and insights from other competitors.\\n\\n> #### Kaggle Lingo Video\\n> You may run into unfamiliar lingo as you dig into the Kaggle discussion forums and public notebooks. Check out  Dr. Rachael Tatman’s [video on Kaggle Lingo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEJHyuWKd-s) to get up to speed!\\n\\n## What Data Will I Use in This Competition?\\nIn this competition, you’ll gain access to two similar datasets that include passenger information like name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc. One dataset is titled `train.csv` and the other is titled `test.csv`.\\n\\n`Train.csv` will contain the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 to be exact) and importantly, will reveal whether they survived or not, also known as the “ground truth”.\\n\\nThe `test.csv` dataset contains similar information but does not disclose the “ground truth” for each passenger. It’s your job to predict these outcomes.\\n\\nUsing the patterns you find in the `train.csv` data, predict whether the other 418 passengers on board (found in `test.csv`) survived.\\n\\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data\">“Data” tab</a> to explore the datasets even further. Once you feel you’ve created a competitive model, submit it to Kaggle to see where your model stands on our leaderboard against other Kagglers.\\n\\n## How to Submit your Prediction to Kaggle\\nOnce you’re ready to make a submission and get on the leaderboard:\\n\\n1. Click on the “Submit Predictions” button\\n<img width=\"699\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen1.png\">\\n1. Upload a CSV file in the submission file format. You’re able to submit 10 submissions a day.\\n<img width=\"699\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen2.png\">\\n\\n## Submission File Format:\\nYou should submit a csv file with exactly 418 entries plus a header row. Your submission will show an error if you have extra columns (beyond `PassengerId` and `Survived`) or rows.\\n\\nThe file should have exactly 2 columns:\\n- `PassengerId` (sorted in any order)\\n- `Survived` (contains your binary predictions: 1 for survived, 0 for deceased)\\n\\n## Got it! I’m ready to get started. Where do I get help if I need it?\\n- For Competition Help: <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\">Titanic Discussion Forum</a>\\n\\nKaggle doesn’t have a dedicated team to help troubleshoot your code so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. The forums are full of useful information on the data, metric, and different approaches. We encourage you to use the forums often. If you share your knowledge, you\\'ll find that others will share a lot in turn!\\n\\n## A Last Word on Kaggle Notebooks\\nAs we mentioned before, Kaggle Notebooks is our no-setup, customizable, Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs and a huge repository of community published data &amp; code.\\n\\nIn every competition, you’ll find many Notebooks shared with incredible insights. It’s an invaluable resource worth becoming familiar with.

They are a great place to begin if you are new to data science or just finished a MOOC and want to get involved in Kaggle.</p>\\n<p>Getting Started competitions are a non-competitive way to get familiar with Kaggle’s platform, learn basic machine learning concepts, and start meeting people in the community. They have no cash prize and are on a rolling timeline.</p>\\n<h2>How do I create and manage a team?</h2>\\n<p>When you accept the competition rules, a team will be created for you. You can invite others to your team, accept a merger with another team, and update basic information like team name by going to the More &gt; <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/team\" target=\"_blank\">Team</a> page.</p>\\n<p>We\\'ve heard from many Kagglers that teaming up is the best way to learn new skills AND have fun. If you don\\'t have a teammate already, consider asking if anyone wants to team up in the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a>.</p>\\n<h2>What are Notebooks?</h2>\\n<p>Kaggle Notebooks is a cloud computational environment that enables reproducible and collaborative analysis. Notebooks support scripts in Python and R, Jupyter Notebooks, and RMarkdown reports. You can visit the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/notebooks\" target=\"_blank\">Notebooks</a> tab to view all of the publicly shared code for the Titanic competition. For more on how to use Notebooks to learn data science, check out our <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview\" target=\"&quot;_blank\">Courses</a>!</p>\\n<h2>Why did my team disappear from the leaderboard?</h2>\\n<p>To keep with the spirit of getting-started competitions, we have implemented a two month rolling window on submissions. Once a submission is more than two months old, it will be invalidated and no longer count towards the leaderboard.</p>\\n<p>If your team has no submissions in the previous two months, the team will also drop from the leaderboard. This will keep the leaderboard at a manageable size, freshen it up, and prevent newcomers from getting lost in a sea of abandoned scores.</p>\\n<p><i>\"I worked so hard to get that score! Give it back!\"</i> Read more about our decision to implement a rolling leaderboard <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion/6240\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\\n<h2>How do I contact Support?</h2>\\n<p>Kaggle does not have a dedicated support team so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. (For this competition, you’ll want to use the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">Titanic discussion forum)</a>.</p>\\n<p>Support is only able to help with issues that are being experienced by all participants. Before contacting support, please check the discussion forum for information on your problem.

In a nutshell stacking uses as a first-level (base), the predictions of a few basic classifiers and then uses another model at the second-level to predict the output from the earlier first-level predictions.\\n\\nThe Titanic dataset is a prime candidate for introducing this concept as many newcomers to Kaggle start out here.

This is good from a point of view of feeding these features into your learning model because this means that there isn\\'t much redundant or superfluous data in our training set and we are happy that each feature carries with it some unique information. Here are two most correlated features are that of Family size and Parch (Parents and Children). I\\'ll still leave both features in for the purposes of this exercise.\\n\\n**Pairplots**\\n\\n\\n=== CODE 12 ===\\ng = sns.pairplot(train[[u\\'Survived\\', u\\'Pclass\\', u\\'Sex\\', u\\'Age\\', u\\'Parch\\', u\\'Fare\\', u\\'Embarked\\',\\n       u\\'FamilySize\\', u\\'Title\\']], hue=\\'Survived\\', palette = \\'seismic\\',size=1.2,diag_kind = \\'kde\\',diag_kws=dict(shade=True),plot_kws=dict(s=10) )\\ng.set(xticklabels=[])\\n\\n=== MARKDOWN 13 ===\\n# Ensembling & Stacking models\\n\\nFinally after that brief whirlwind detour with regards to feature engineering and formatting, we finally arrive at the meat and gist of the this notebook.\\n\\nCreating a Stacking ensemble!\\n\\n=== MARKDOWN 14 ===\\n### Helpers via Python Classes\\n\\nHere we invoke the use of Python\\'s classes to help make it more convenient for us. For any newcomers to programming, one normally hears Classes being used in conjunction with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). In short, a class helps to extend some code/program for creating objects (variables for old-school peeps) as well as to implement functions and methods specific to that class.\\n\\nIn the section of code below, we essentially write a class *SklearnHelper* that allows one to extend the inbuilt methods (such as train, predict and fit) common to all the Sklearn c\\n\\n=== CODE 15 ===\\n# Some useful parameters which will come in handy later on\\nntrain = train.shape[0]\\nntest = test.shape[0]\\nSEED = 0 # for reproducibility\\nNFOLDS = 5 # set folds for out-of-fold prediction\\nkf = KFold(ntrain, n_folds= NFOLDS, random_state=SEED)\\n\\n# Class to extend the Sklearn classifier\\nclass SklearnHelper(object):\\n    def __init__(self, clf, seed=0, params=None):\\n        params[\\'random_state\\'] = seed\\n        self.clf = clf(**params)\\n\\n    def train(self, x_train, y_train):\\n        self.clf.fit(x_train, y_train)\\n\\n    def predict(self, x):\\n        return self.clf.predict(x)\\n    \\n    def fit(self,x,y)\\n\\n=== MARKDOWN 16 ===\\nBear with me for those who already know this but for people who have not created classes or objects in Python before, let me explain what the code given above does. In creating my base classifiers, I will only use the models already present in the Sklearn library and therefore only extend the class for that.\\n\\n**def init** : Python standard for invoking the default constructor for the class. This means that when you want to create an object (classifier), you have to give it the parameters of clf (what sklearn classifier you want), seed (random seed) and params (parameters for the classifiers).\\n\\n\\n=== MARKDOWN 17 ===\\n### Out-of-Fold Predictions\\n\\nNow as alluded to above in the introductory section, stacking uses predictions of base classifiers as input for training to a second-level model. However one cannot simply train the base models on the full training data, generate predictions on the full test set and then output these for the second-level training. This runs the risk of your base model predictions already having \"seen\" the test set and therefore overfitting when feeding these predictions.\\n\\n=== CODE 18 ===\\ndef get_oof(clf, x_train, y_train, x_test):\\n    oof_train = np.zeros((ntrain,))\\n    oof_test = np.zeros((ntest,))\\n    oof_test_skf = np.empty((NFOLDS, ntest))\\n\\n    for i, (train_index, test_index) in enumerate(kf):\\n        x_tr = x_train[train_index]\\n        y_tr = y_train[train_index]\\n        x_te = x_train[test_index]\\n\\n        clf.train(x_tr, y_tr)\\n\\n        oof_train[test_index] = clf.predict(x_te)\\n        oof_test_skf[i, :] = clf.predict(x_test)\\n\\n    oof_test[:] = oof_test_skf.mean(axis=0)\\n    return oof_train.reshape(-1, 1), oof_test.reshape(-1, 1)\\n\\n=== MARKDOWN 19 ===\\n# Generating our Base First-Level Models \\n\\nSo now let us prepare five learning models as our first level classification. These models can all be conveniently invoked via the Sklearn library and are listed as follows:\\n\\n 1. Random Forest classifier\\n 2. Extra Trees classifier\\n 3. AdaBoost classifer\\n 4.

We've got channels for competitions, job postings and career discussions, resources, and socializing with your fellow data scientists. Follow the link here:** https://discord.gg/kaggle\n\nThe competition is simple: use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.\n\nRead on or watch the video below to explore more details. Once you’re ready to start competing, click on the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/account/login?returnUrl=%2Fc%2Ftitanic\" target=\"_blank\">\"Join Competition button</a> to create an account and gain access to the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data\" target=\"_blank\">competition data</a>. Then check out <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/titanic-tutorial\">Alexis Cook’s Titanic Tutorial</a> that walks you through step by step how to make your first submission!\n\n<iframe width=\"699\" height=\"368\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8yZMXCaFshs\" title=\"YouTube video | How to Get Started with Kaggle’s Titanic Competition | Kaggle\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n## The Challenge\nThe sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.\n\nOn April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.\n\nWhile there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.\n\nIn this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).\n\n> #### Recommended Tutorial\n> We highly recommend [Alexis Cook’s Titanic Tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/titanic-tutorial) that walks you through making your very first submission step by step and [this starter notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/gusthema/titanic-competition-w-tensorflow-decision-forests) to get started.\n\n## How Kaggle’s Competitions Work\n1. **Join the Competition**\nRead about the challenge description, accept the Competition Rules and gain access to the competition dataset.\n1.  **Get to Work**\nDownload the data, build models on it locally or on Kaggle Notebooks (our no-setup, customizable Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs) and generate a prediction file.\n1.  **Make a Submission**\nUpload your prediction as a submission on Kaggle and receive an accuracy score.\n1.  **Check the Leaderboard**\nSee how your model ranks against other Kagglers on our leaderboard. \n1.  **Improve Your Score**\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a> to find lots of tutorials and insights from other competitors.\n\n> #### Kaggle Lingo Video\n> You may run into unfamiliar lingo as you dig into the Kaggle discussion forums and public notebooks. Check out  Dr. Rachael Tatman’s [video on Kaggle Lingo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEJHyuWKd-s) to get up to speed!\n\n## What Data Will I Use in This Competition?\nIn this competition, you’ll gain access to two similar datasets that include passenger information like name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc. One dataset is titled `train.csv` and the other is titled `test.csv`.\n\n`Train.csv` will contain the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 to be exact) and importantly, will reveal whether they survived or not, also known as the “ground truth”.\n\nThe `test.csv` dataset contains similar information but does not disclose the “ground truth” for each passenger. It’s your job to predict these outcomes.\n\nUsing the patterns you find in the `train.csv` data, predict whether the other 418 passengers on board (found in `test.csv`) survived.\n\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data\">“Data” tab</a> to explore the datasets even further. Once you feel you’ve created a competitive model, submit it to Kaggle to see where your model stands on our leaderboard against other Kagglers.\n\n## How to Submit your Prediction to Kaggle\nOnce you’re ready to make a submission and get on the leaderboard:\n\n1. Click on the “Submit Predictions” button\n<img width=\"699\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen1.png\">\n1. Upload a CSV file in the submission file format. You’re able to submit 10 submissions a day.\n<img width=\"699\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen2.png\">\n\n## Submission File Format:\nYou should submit a csv file with exactly 418 entries plus a header row. Your submission will show an error if you have extra columns (beyond `PassengerId` and `Survived`) or rows.\n\nThe file should have exactly 2 columns:\n- `PassengerId` (sorted in any order)\n- `Survived` (contains your binary predictions: 1 for survived, 0 for deceased)\n\n## Got it! I’m ready to get started. Where do I get help if I need it?\n- For Competition Help: <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\">Titanic Discussion Forum</a>\n\nKaggle doesn’t have a dedicated team to help troubleshoot your code so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. The forums are full of useful information on the data, metric, and different approaches. We encourage you to use the forums often. If you share your knowledge, you'll find that others will share a lot in turn!\n\n## A Last Word on Kaggle Notebooks\nAs we mentioned before, Kaggle Notebooks is our no-setup, customizable, Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs and a huge repository of community published data &amp; code.\n\nIn every competition, you’ll find many Notebooks shared with incredible insights. It’s an invaluable resource worth becoming familiar with. Check out this competition’s Notebooks <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/notebooks\">here</a>.\n\n## 🏃‍♀Ready to Compete? <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/account/login?returnUrl=%2Fc%2Ftitanic\">Join the Competition Here!</a>\n\n## Evaluation\n\n<h2>Goal</h2>\n<p>It is your job to predict if a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic or not. <br>For each  in the test set, you must predict a 0 or 1 value for the  variable.</p>\n<h2>Metric</h2>\n<p>Your score is the percentage of passengers you correctly predict. This is known as <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision#In_binary_classification\">accuracy</a>.</p>\n<h2>Submission File Format</h2>\n<p>You should submit a csv file with exactly 418 entries <b>plus</b> a header row. Your submission will show an error if you have extra columns (beyond PassengerId and Survived) or rows.<br><br>The file should have exactly 2 columns:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>PassengerId (sorted in any order)</li>\n<li>Survived (contains your binary predictions: 1 for survived, 0 for deceased)</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><b>PassengerId,Survived</b><br>892,0<br>893,1<br>894,0<br>Etc.</pre>\n<p>You can download an example submission file (gender_submission.csv) on the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data\">Data page</a>.</p>\n\n## data-description\n\n<h3>Overview</h3>\n<p>The data has been split into two groups:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>training set (train.csv)</li>\n<li>test set (test.csv)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b> The training set </b>should be used to build your machine learning models. For the training set, we provide the outcome (also known as the “ground truth”) for each passenger. Your model will be based on “features” like passengers’ gender and class. You can also use <a href=\"https://triangleinequality.wordpress.com/2013/09/08/basic-feature-engineering-with-the-titanic-data/\" target=\"_blank\"> feature engineering </a>to create new features.</p>\n<p><b>The test set </b>should be used to see how well your model performs on unseen data. For the test set, we do not provide the ground truth for each passenger. It is your job to predict these outcomes. For each passenger in the test set, use the model you trained to predict whether or not they survived the sinking of the Titanic.</p>\n<p>We also include <b>gender_submission.csv</b>, a set of predictions that assume all and only female passengers survive, as an example of what a submission file should look like.</p>\n<h3>Data Dictionary</h3>\n<table style=\"width: 100%;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr><th><b>Variable</b></th><th><b>Definition</b></th><th><b>Key</b></th></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>survival</td>\n<td>Survival</td>\n<td>0 = No, 1 = Yes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>pclass</td>\n<td>Ticket class</td>\n<td>1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>sex</td>\n<td>Sex</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Age</td>\n<td>Age in years</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>sibsp</td>\n<td># of siblings / spouses aboard the Titanic</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>parch</td>\n<td># of parents / children aboard the Titanic</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>ticket</td>\n<td>Ticket number</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>fare</td>\n<td>Passenger fare</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>cabin</td>\n<td>Cabin number</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>embarked</td>\n<td>Port of Embarkation</td>\n<td>C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>Variable Notes</h3>\n<p><b>pclass</b>: A proxy for socio-economic status (SES)<br /> 1st = Upper<br /> 2nd = Middle<br /> 3rd = Lower<br /><br /> <b>age</b>: Age is fractional if less than 1.

They are a great place to begin if you are new to data science or just finished a MOOC and want to get involved in Kaggle.</p>\n<p>Getting Started competitions are a non-competitive way to get familiar with Kaggle’s platform, learn basic machine learning concepts, and start meeting people in the community. They have no cash prize and are on a rolling timeline.</p>\n<h2>How do I create and manage a team?</h2>\n<p>When you accept the competition rules, a team will be created for you. You can invite others to your team, accept a merger with another team, and update basic information like team name by going to the More &gt; <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/team\" target=\"_blank\">Team</a> page.</p>\n<p>We've heard from many Kagglers that teaming up is the best way to learn new skills AND have fun. If you don't have a teammate already, consider asking if anyone wants to team up in the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a>.</p>\n<h2>What are Notebooks?</h2>\n<p>Kaggle Notebooks is a cloud computational environment that enables reproducible and collaborative analysis. Notebooks support scripts in Python and R, Jupyter Notebooks, and RMarkdown reports. You can visit the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/notebooks\" target=\"_blank\">Notebooks</a> tab to view all of the publicly shared code for the Titanic competition. For more on how to use Notebooks to learn data science, check out our <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview\" target=\"&quot;_blank\">Courses</a>!</p>\n<h2>Why did my team disappear from the leaderboard?</h2>\n<p>To keep with the spirit of getting-started competitions, we have implemented a two month rolling window on submissions. Once a submission is more than two months old, it will be invalidated and no longer count towards the leaderboard.</p>\n<p>If your team has no submissions in the previous two months, the team will also drop from the leaderboard. This will keep the leaderboard at a manageable size, freshen it up, and prevent newcomers from getting lost in a sea of abandoned scores.</p>\n<p><i>\"I worked so hard to get that score! Give it back!\"</i> Read more about our decision to implement a rolling leaderboard <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion/6240\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n<h2>How do I contact Support?</h2>\n<p>Kaggle does not have a dedicated support team so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. (For this competition, you’ll want to use the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">Titanic discussion forum)</a>.</p>\n<p>Support is only able to help with issues that are being experienced by all participants. Before contacting support, please check the discussion forum for information on your problem. If you can’t find it, you can post your problem in the forum so a fellow participant or a Kaggle team member can provide help. The forums are full of useful information on the data, metric, and different approaches. We encourage you to use the forums often. If you share your knowledge, you'll find that others will share a lot in turn!</p>\n<p>If your problem persists or it seems to be effective all participants then please <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/contact\" target=\"_blank\">contact us</a>.</p>\ntool: Not a directory: /home/code/exploration/../research/writeups\ntool: /home/code/exploration/../research/kernels:\n[DIR]  alexisbcook_exercise-arithmetic-and-variables/\n[DIR]  alexisbcook_titanic-tutorial/\n[DIR]  arthurtok_introduction-to-ensembling-stacking-in-python/\n[DIR]  ldfreeman3_a-data-science-framework-to-achieve-99-accuracy/\n[FILE] metadata.json (1.7KB)\n[DIR]  startupsci_titanic-data-science-solutions/\ntool: /home/data:\n[FILE] description.md (13.6KB)\n[FILE] gender_submission.csv (3.2KB)\n[FILE] test.csv (28.0KB)\n[FILE] train.csv (59.8KB)\ntool: Error: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/home/code/exploration/../research/kernels/ldfreeman3_a-data-science-framework-to-achieve-99-accuracy/ldfreeman3_a-data-science-framework-to-achieve-99-accuracy.py'\ntool: Error: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/home/code/exploration/../research/kernels/arthurtok_introduction-to-ensembling-stacking-in-python/arthurtok_introduction-to-ensembling-stacking-in-python.py'\ntool: /home/code/exploration/../research/kernels/ldfreeman3_a-data-science-framework-to-achieve-99-accuracy:\n[FILE] a-data-science-framework-to-achieve-99-accuracy.ipynb (107.1KB)\n[FILE] kernel-metadata.json (732.0B)\ntool: /home/code/exploration/../research/kernels/arthurtok_introduction-to-ensembling-stacking-in-python:\n[FILE] introduction-to-ensembling-stacking-in-python.ipynb (39.3KB)\n[FILE] kernel-metadata.json (687.0B)\ntool: /home/code/exploration/../research/kernels/startupsci_titanic-data-science-solutions:\n[FILE] kernel-metadata.json (661.0B)\n[FILE] titanic-data-science-solutions.ipynb (55.5KB)\ntool: === MARKDOWN 0 ===\n\n>Hello and Welcome to Kaggle, the online Data Science Community to learn, share, and compete. Most beginners get lost in the field, because they fall into the black box approach, using libraries and algorithms they don't understand. This tutorial will give you a 1-2-year head start over your peers, by providing a framework that teaches you how-to think like a data scientist vs what to think/code. Not only will you be able to submit your first competition, but you’ll be able to solve any problem\n\n=== MARKDOWN 1 ===\n<a id=\"ch1\"></a>\n# How a Data Scientist Beat the Odds\nIt's the classical problem, predict the outcome of a binary event. In laymen terms this means, it either occurred or did not occur. For example, you won or did not win, you passed the test or did not pass the test, you were accepted or not accepted, and you get the point. A common business application is churn or customer retention. Another popular use case is, healthcare's mortality rate or survival analysis.

Furthermore even though stacking has been responsible for many a team winning K\n\n=== CODE 1 ===\n# Load in our libraries\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport re\nimport sklearn\nimport xgboost as xgb\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline\n\nimport plotly.offline as py\npy.init_notebook_mode(connected=True)\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\nimport plotly.tools as tls\n\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\n\n# Going to use these 5 base models for the stacking\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import (RandomForestClassifier, AdaBoostClassifier, \n                              GradientBoostingClassifier, ExtraTreesClassifier)\nfrom sklearn.svm import SVC\nfrom \n\n=== MARKDOWN 2 ===\n# Feature Exploration, Engineering and Cleaning \n\nNow we will proceed much like how most kernels in general are structured, and that is to first explore the data on hand, identify possible feature engineering opportunities as well as numerically encode any categorical features.\n\n=== CODE 3 ===\n# Load in the train and test datasets\ntrain = pd.read_csv('../input/train.csv')\ntest = pd.read_csv('../input/test.csv')\n\n# Store our passenger ID for easy access\nPassengerId = test['PassengerId']\n\ntrain.head(3)\n\n=== MARKDOWN 4 ===\nWell it is no surprise that our task is to somehow extract the information out of the categorical variables \n\n**Feature Engineering**\n\nHere, credit must be extended to Sina's very comprehensive and well-thought out notebook for the feature engineering ideas so please check out his work \n\n[Titanic Best Working Classfier][1] : by Sina\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.kaggle.com/sinakhorami/titanic/titanic-best-working-classifier\n\n=== CODE 5 ===\nfull_data = [train, test]\n\n# Some features of my own that I have added in\n# Gives the length of the name\ntrain['Name_length'] = train['Name'].apply(len)\ntest['Name_length'] = test['Name'].apply(len)\n# Feature that tells whether a passenger had a cabin on the Titanic\ntrain['Has_Cabin'] = train[\"Cabin\"].apply(lambda x: 0 if type(x) == float else 1)\ntest['Has_Cabin'] = test[\"Cabin\"].apply(lambda x: 0 if type(x) == float else 1)\n\n# Feature engineering steps taken from Sina\n# Create new feature FamilySize as a combination of SibSp and Parch\nfor dataset in full_data:\n    dataset['FamilySize'] = data\n\n=== CODE 6 ===\n# Feature selection\ndrop_elements = ['PassengerId', 'Name', 'Ticket', 'Cabin', 'SibSp']\ntrain = train.drop(drop_elements, axis = 1)\ntrain = train.drop(['CategoricalAge', 'CategoricalFare'], axis = 1)\ntest  = test.drop(drop_elements, axis = 1)\n\n=== MARKDOWN 7 ===\nAll right so now having cleaned the features and extracted relevant information and dropped the categorical columns our features should now all be numeric, a format suitable to feed into our Machine Learning models. However before we proceed let us generate some simple correlation and distribution plots of our transformed dataset to observe ho\n\n## Visualisations \n\n=== CODE 8 ===\ntrain.head(3)\n\n=== MARKDOWN 9 ===\n**Pearson Correlation Heatmap**\n\nlet us generate some correlation plots of the features to see how related one feature is to the next. To do so, we will utilise the Seaborn plotting package which allows us to plot heatmaps very conveniently as follows\n\n=== CODE 10 ===\ncolormap = plt.cm.RdBu\nplt.figure(figsize=(14,12))\nplt.title('Pearson Correlation of Features', y=1.05, size=15)\nsns.heatmap(train.astype(float).corr(),linewidths=0.1,vmax=1.0, \n            square=True, cmap=colormap, linecolor='white', annot=True)\n\n=== MARKDOWN 11 ===\n**Takeaway from the Plots**\n\nOne thing that that the Pearson Correlation plot can tell us is that there are not too many features strongly correlated with one another. This is good from a point of view of feeding these features into your learning model because this means that there isn't much redundant or superfluous data in our training set and we are happy that each feature carries with it some unique information. Here are two most correlated features are that of Family size and Parch (Parents and Children). I'll still leave both features in for the purposes of this exercise.\n\n**Pairplots**\n\n\n=== CODE 12 ===\ng = sns.pairplot(train[[u'Survived', u'Pclass', u'Sex', u'Age', u'Parch', u'Fare', u'Embarked',\n       u'FamilySize', u'Title']], hue='Survived', palette = 'seismic',size=1.2,diag_kind = 'kde',diag_kws=dict(shade=True),plot_kws=dict(s=10) )\ng.set(xticklabels=[])\n\n=== MARKDOWN 13 ===\n# Ensembling & Stacking models\n\nFinally after that brief whirlwind detour with regards to feature engineering and formatting, we finally arrive at the meat and gist of the this notebook.\n\nCreating a Stacking ensemble!\n\n=== MARKDOWN 14 ===\n### Helpers via Python Classes\n\nHere we invoke the use of Python's classes to help make it more convenient for us. For any newcomers to programming, one normally hears Classes being used in conjunction with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). In short, a class helps to extend some code/program for creating objects (variables for old-school peeps) as well as to implement functions and methods specific to that class.\n\nIn the section of code below, we essentially write a class *SklearnHelper* that allows one to extend the inbuilt methods (such as train, predict and fit) common to all the Sklearn c\n\n=== CODE 15 ===\n# Some useful parameters which will come in handy later on\nntrain = train.shape[0]\nntest = test.shape[0]\nSEED = 0 # for reproducibility\nNFOLDS = 5 # set folds for out-of-fold prediction\nkf = KFold(ntrain, n_folds= NFOLDS, random_state=SEED)\n\n# Class to extend the Sklearn classifier\nclass SklearnHelper(object):\n    def __init__(self, clf, seed=0, params=None):\n        params['random_state'] = seed\n        self.clf = clf(**params)\n\n    def train(self, x_train, y_train):\n        self.clf.fit(x_train, y_train)\n\n    def predict(self, x):\n        return self.clf.predict(x)\n    \n    def fit(self,x,y)\n\n=== MARKDOWN 16 ===\nBear with me for those who already know this but for people who have not created classes or objects in Python before, let me explain what the code given above does. In creating my base classifiers, I will only use the models already present in the Sklearn library and therefore only extend the class for that.\n\n**def init** : Python standard for invoking the default constructor for the class. This means that when you want to create an object (classifier), you have to give it the parameters of clf (what sklearn classifier you want), seed (random seed) and params (parameters for the classifiers).\n\n\n=== MARKDOWN 17 ===\n### Out-of-Fold Predictions\n\nNow as alluded to above in the introductory section, stacking uses predictions of base classifiers as input for training to a second-level model. However one cannot simply train the base models on the full training data, generate predictions on the full test set and then output these for the second-level training. This runs the risk of your base model predictions already having \"seen\" the test set and therefore overfitting when feeding these predictions.\n\n=== CODE 18 ===\ndef get_oof(clf, x_train, y_train, x_test):\n    oof_train = np.zeros((ntrain,))\n    oof_test = np.zeros((ntest,))\n    oof_test_skf = np.empty((NFOLDS, ntest))\n\n    for i, (train_index, test_index) in enumerate(kf):\n        x_tr = x_train[train_index]\n        y_tr = y_train[train_index]\n        x_te = x_train[test_index]\n\n        clf.train(x_tr, y_tr)\n\n        oof_train[test_index] = clf.predict(x_te)\n        oof_test_skf[i, :] = clf.predict(x_test)\n\n    oof_test[:] = oof_test_skf.mean(axis=0)\n    return oof_train.reshape(-1, 1), oof_test.reshape(-1, 1)\n\n=== MARKDOWN 19 ===\n# Generating our Base First-Level Models \n\nSo now let us prepare five learning models as our first level classification. These models can all be conveniently invoked via the Sklearn library and are listed as follows:\n\n 1. Random Forest classifier\n 2. Extra Trees classifier\n 3. AdaBoost classifer\n 4. Gradient Boosting classifer\n 5. Support Vector Machine\n\n=== MARKDOWN 20 ===\n**Parameters**\n\nJust a quick summary of the parameters that we will be listing here for completeness,\n\n**n_jobs** : Number of cores used for the training process. If set to -1, all cores are used.\n\n**n_estimators** : Number of classification trees in your learning model ( set to 10 per default)\n\n**max_depth** : Maximum depth of tree, or how much a node should be expanded. Beware if set to too high  a number would run the risk of overfitting as one would be growing the tree too deep\n\n**verbose** : Controls whether you want to output any text during the learning process. A value of 0 suppresses \n\n=== CODE 21 ===\n# Put in our parameters for said classifiers\n# Random Forest parameters\nrf_params = {\n    'n_jobs': -1,\n    'n_estimators': 500,\n     'warm_start': True, \n     #'max_features': 0.2,\n    'max_depth': 6,\n    'min_samples_leaf': 2,\n    'max_features' : 'sqrt',\n    'verbose': 0\n}\n\n# Extra Trees Parameters\net_params = {\n    'n_jobs': -1,\n    'n_estimators':500,\n    #'max_features': 0.5,\n    'max_depth': 8,\n    'min_samples_leaf': 2,\n    'verbose': 0\n}\n\n# AdaBoost parameters\nada_params = {\n    'n_estimators': 500,\n    'learning_rate' : 0.75\n}\n\n# Gradient Boosting parameters\ngb_params = {\n    'n_esti\n\n=== MARKDOWN 22 ===\nFurthermore, since having mentioned about Objects and classes within the OOP framework, let us now create 5 objects that represent our 5 learning models via our Helper Sklearn Class we defined earlier.\n\n=== CODE 23 ===\n# Create 5 objects that\n...(truncated)...\n\n# Create Numpy arrays of train, test and target ( Survived) dataframes to feed into our models\ny_train = train['Survived'].ravel()\ntrain = train.drop(['Survived'], axis=1)\nx_train = train.values # Creates an array of the train data\nx_test = test.values # Creats an array of the test data\n\n=== MARKDOWN 26 ===\n**Output of the First level Predictions** \n\nWe now feed the training and test data into our 5 base classifiers and use the Out-of-Fold prediction function we defined earlier to generate our first level predictions. Allow a handful of minutes for the chunk of code below to run.\n\n=== CODE 27 ===\n# Create our OOF train and test predictions. These base results will be used as new features\net_oof_train, et_oof_test = get_oof(et, x_train, y_train, x_test) # Extra Trees\nrf_oof_train, rf_oof_test = get_oof(rf,x_train, y_train, x_test) # Random Forest\nada_oof_train, ada_oof_test = get_oof(ada, x_train, y_train, x_test) # AdaBoost \ngb_oof_train, gb_oof_test = get_oof(gb,x_train, y_train, x_test) # Gradient Boost\nsvc_oof_train, svc_oof_test = get_oof(svc,x_train, y_train, x_test) # Support Vector Classifier\n\nprint(\"Training is complete\")\n\n=== MARKDOWN 28 ===\n**Feature importances generated from the different classifiers**\n\nNow having learned our the first-level classifiers, we can utilise a very nifty feature of the Sklearn models and that is to output the importances of the various features in the training and test sets with one very simple line of code.\n\nAs per the Sklearn documentation, most of the classifiers are built in with an attribute which returns feature importances by simply typing in **.feature_importances_**. Therefore we will invoke this very useful attribute via our function earliand plot the feature importances as such\n\n=== CODE 29 ===\nrf_feature = rf.feature_importances(x_train,y_train)\net_feature = et.feature_importances(x_train, y_train)\nada_feature = ada.feature_importances(x_train, y_train)\ngb_feature = gb.feature_importances(x_train,y_train)\n\n=== MARKDOWN 30 ===\nSo I have not yet figured out how to assign and store the feature importances outright.

You hear of ensembles created at the highest level of Kaggle competitions which involves monstrous combinations of stacked classifiers as well as levels of stacking which go to more than 2 levels. \n\nSome additional steps that may be taken to improve one's score could be:\n\n 1. Implementing a good cross-validation strategy in training the models to find optimal parameter values\n 2. Introduce a greater variety of base models for learning.\n\n=== MARKDOWN 54 ===\n### Conclusion\n\nI have this notebook has been helpful somewhat in introducing a working script for stacking learning models.

Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.\\n\\nWhile there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.\\n\\nIn this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).\\n\\n> #### Recommended Tutorial\\n> We highly recommend [Alexis Cook’s Titanic Tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/titanic-tutorial) that walks you through making your very first submission step by step and [this starter notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/gusthema/titanic-competition-w-tensorflow-decision-forests) to get started.\\n\\n## How Kaggle’s Competitions Work\\n1. **Join the Competition**\\nRead about the challenge description, accept the Competition Rules and gain access to the competition dataset.\\n1.  **Get to Work**\\nDownload the data, build models on it locally or on Kaggle Notebooks (our no-setup, customizable Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs) and generate a prediction file.\\n1.  **Make a Submission**\\nUpload your prediction as a submission on Kaggle and receive an accuracy score.\\n1.  **Check the Leaderboard**\\nSee how your model ranks against other Kagglers on our leaderboard. \\n1.  **Improve Your Score**\\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a> to find lots of tutorials and insights from other competitors.\\n\\n> #### Kaggle Lingo Video\\n> You may run into unfamiliar lingo as you dig into the Kaggle discussion forums and public notebooks. Check out  Dr. Rachael Tatman’s [video on Kaggle Lingo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEJHyuWKd-s) to get up to speed!\\n\\n## What Data Will I Use in This Competition?\\nIn this competition, you’ll gain access to two similar datasets that include passenger information like name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc. One dataset is titled `train.csv` and the other is titled `test.csv`.\\n\\n`Train.csv` will contain the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 to be exact) and importantly, will reveal whether they survived or not, also known as the “ground truth”.\\n\\nThe `test.csv` dataset contains similar information but does not disclose the “ground truth” for each passenger. It’s your job to predict these outcomes.\\n\\nUsing the patterns you find in the `train.csv` data, predict whether the other 418 passengers on board (found in `test.csv`) survived.\\n\\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data\">“Data” tab</a> to explore the datasets even further. Once you feel you’ve created a competitive model, submit it to Kaggle to see where your model stands on our leaderboard against other Kagglers.\\n\\n## How to Submit your Prediction to Kaggle\\nOnce you’re ready to make a submission and get on the leaderboard:\\n\\n1. Click on the “Submit Predictions” button\\n<img width=\"699\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen1.png\">\\n1. Upload a CSV file in the submission file format. You’re able to submit 10 submissions a day.\\n<img width=\"699\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen2.png\">\\n\\n## Submission File Format:\\nYou should submit a csv file with exactly 418 entries plus a header row. Your submission will show an error if you have extra columns (beyond `PassengerId` and `Survived`) or rows.\\n\\nThe file should have exactly 2 columns:\\n- `PassengerId` (sorted in any order)\\n- `Survived` (contains your binary predictions: 1 for survived, 0 for deceased)\\n\\n## Got it! I’m ready to get started. Where do I get help if I need it?\\n- For Competition Help: <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\">Titanic Discussion Forum</a>\\n\\nKaggle doesn’t have a dedicated team to help troubleshoot your code so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. The forums are full of useful information on the data, metric, and different approaches. We encourage you to use the forums often. If you share your knowledge, you\\'ll find that others will share a lot in turn!\\n\\n## A Last Word on Kaggle Notebooks\\nAs we mentioned before, Kaggle Notebooks is our no-setup, customizable, Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs and a huge repository of community published data &amp; code.\\n\\nIn every competition, you’ll find many Notebooks shared with incredible insights. It’s an invaluable resource worth becoming familiar with.

They are a great place to begin if you are new to data science or just finished a MOOC and want to get involved in Kaggle.</p>\\n<p>Getting Started competitions are a non-competitive way to get familiar with Kaggle’s platform, learn basic machine learning concepts, and start meeting people in the community. They have no cash prize and are on a rolling timeline.</p>\\n<h2>How do I create and manage a team?</h2>\\n<p>When you accept the competition rules, a team will be created for you. You can invite others to your team, accept a merger with another team, and update basic information like team name by going to the More &gt; <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/team\" target=\"_blank\">Team</a> page.</p>\\n<p>We\\'ve heard from many Kagglers that teaming up is the best way to learn new skills AND have fun. If you don\\'t have a teammate already, consider asking if anyone wants to team up in the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a>.</p>\\n<h2>What are Notebooks?</h2>\\n<p>Kaggle Notebooks is a cloud computational environment that enables reproducible and collaborative analysis. Notebooks support scripts in Python and R, Jupyter Notebooks, and RMarkdown reports. You can visit the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/notebooks\" target=\"_blank\">Notebooks</a> tab to view all of the publicly shared code for the Titanic competition. For more on how to use Notebooks to learn data science, check out our <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview\" target=\"&quot;_blank\">Courses</a>!</p>\\n<h2>Why did my team disappear from the leaderboard?</h2>\\n<p>To keep with the spirit of getting-started competitions, we have implemented a two month rolling window on submissions. Once a submission is more than two months old, it will be invalidated and no longer count towards the leaderboard.</p>\\n<p>If your team has no submissions in the previous two months, the team will also drop from the leaderboard. This will keep the leaderboard at a manageable size, freshen it up, and prevent newcomers from getting lost in a sea of abandoned scores.</p>\\n<p><i>\"I worked so hard to get that score! Give it back!\"</i> Read more about our decision to implement a rolling leaderboard <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion/6240\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\\n<h2>How do I contact Support?</h2>\\n<p>Kaggle does not have a dedicated support team so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. (For this competition, you’ll want to use the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">Titanic discussion forum)</a>.</p>\\n<p>Support is only able to help with issues that are being experienced by all participants. Before contacting support, please check the discussion forum for information on your problem. If you can’t find it, you can post your problem in the forum so a fellow participant or a Kaggle team member can provide help. The forums are full of useful information on the data, metric, and different approaches. We encourage you to use the forums often.

This is good from a point of view of feeding these features into your learning model because this means that there isn\\'t much redundant or superfluous data in our training set and we are happy that each feature carries with it some unique information. Here are two most correlated features are that of Family size and Parch (Parents and Children).

For any newcomers to programming, one normally hears Classes being used in conjunction with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). In short, a class helps to extend some code/program for creating objects (variables for old-school peeps) as well as to implement functions and methods specific to that class.\\n\\nIn the section of code below, we essentially write a class *SklearnHelper* that allows one to extend the inbuilt methods (such as train, predict and fit) common to all the Sklearn c\\n\\n=== CODE 15 ===\\n# Some useful parameters which will come in handy later on\\nntrain = train.shape[0]\\nntest = test.shape[0]\\nSEED = 0 # for reproducibility\\nNFOLDS = 5 # set folds for out-of-fold prediction\\nkf = KFold(ntrain, n_folds= NFOLDS, random_state=SEED)\\n\\n# Class to extend the Sklearn classifier\\nclass SklearnHelper(object):\\n    def __init__(self, clf, seed=0, params=None):\\n        params[\\'random_state\\'] = seed\\n        self.clf = clf(**params)\\n\\n    def train(self, x_train, y_train):\\n        self.clf.fit(x_train, y_train)\\n\\n    def predict(self, x):\\n        return self.clf.predict(x)\\n    \\n    def fit(self,x,y)\\n\\n=== MARKDOWN 16 ===\\nBear with me for those who already know this but for people who have not created classes or objects in Python before, let me explain what the code given above does. In creating my base classifiers, I will only use the models already present in the Sklearn library and therefore only extend the class for that.\\n\\n**def init** : Python standard for invoking the default constructor for the class. This means that when you want to create an object (classifier), you have to give it the parameters of clf (what sklearn classifier you want), seed (random seed) and params (parameters for the classifiers).\\n\\n\\n=== MARKDOWN 17 ===\\n### Out-of-Fold Predictions\\n\\nNow as alluded to above in the introductory section, stacking uses predictions of base classifiers as input for training to a second-level model. However one cannot simply train the base models on the full training data, generate predictions on the full test set and then output these for the second-level training. This runs the risk of your base model predictions already having \"seen\" the test set and therefore overfitting when feeding these predictions.\\n\\n=== CODE 18 ===\\ndef get_oof(clf, x_train, y_train, x_test):\\n    oof_train = np.zeros((ntrain,))\\n    oof_test = np.zeros((ntest,))\\n    oof_test_skf = np.empty((NFOLDS, ntest))\\n\\n    for i, (train_index, test_index) in enumerate(kf):\\n        x_tr = x_train[train_index]\\n        y_tr = y_train[train_index]\\n        x_te = x_train[test_index]\\n\\n        clf.train(x_tr, y_tr)\\n\\n        oof_train[test_index] = clf.predict(x_te)\\n        oof_test_skf[i, :] = clf.predict(x_test)\\n\\n    oof_test[:] = oof_test_skf.mean(axis=0)\\n    return oof_train.reshape(-1, 1), oof_test.reshape(-1, 1)\\n\\n=== MARKDOWN 19 ===\\n# Generating our Base First-Level Models \\n\\nSo now let us prepare five learning models as our first level classification.

It was built to optimize large-scale boosted tree algorithms. For further information about the algorithm, check out the [official documentation][1].\\n\\n  [1]: https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\\n\\nAnyways, we call an XGBClassifier and fit it to the first-level train and target data and use the learned model to predict the test data as follows:\\n\\n=== CODE 49 ===\\ngbm = xgb.XGBClassifier(\\n    #learning_rate = 0.02,\\n n_estimators= 2000,\\n max_depth= 4,\\n min_child_weight= 2,\\n #gamma=1,\\n gamma=0.9,                        \\n subsample=0.8,\\n colsample_bytree=0.8,\\n objective= \\'binary:logistic\\',\\n nthread= -1,\\n scale_pos_weight=1).fit(x_train, y_train)\\npredictions = gbm.predict(x_test)\\n\\n=== MARKDOWN 50 ===\\nJust a quick run down of the XGBoost parameters used in the model:\\n\\n**max_depth** : How deep you want to grow your tree. Beware if set to too high a number might run the risk of overfitting.\\n\\n**gamma** : minimum loss reduction required to make a further partition on a leaf node of the tree. The larger, the more conservative the algorithm will be.\\n\\n**eta** : step size shrinkage used in each boosting step to prevent overfitting\\n\\n=== MARKDOWN 51 ===\\n**Producing the Submission file**\\n\\nFinally having trained and fit all our first-level and second-level models, we can now output the predictions into the proper format for submission to the Titanic competition as follows:\\n\\n=== CODE 52 ===\\n# Generate Submission File \\nStackingSubmission = pd.DataFrame({ \\'PassengerId\\': PassengerId,\\n                            \\'Survived\\': predictions })\\nStackingSubmission.to_csv(\"StackingSubmission.csv\", index=False)\\n\\n=== MARKDOWN 53 ===\\n**Steps for Further Improvement**\\n\\nAs a closing remark it must be noted that the steps taken above just show a very simple way of producing an ensemble stacker. You hear of ensembles created at the highest level of Kaggle competitions which involves monstrous combinations of stacked classifiers as well as levels of stacking which go to more than 2 levels. \\n\\nSome additional steps that may be taken to improve one\\'s score could be:\\n\\n 1. Implementing a good cross-validation strategy in training the models to find optimal parameter values\\n 2. Introduce a greater variety of base models for learning.\\n\\n=== MARKDOWN 54 ===\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nI have this notebook has been helpful somewhat in introducing a working script for stacking learning models.

Then check out <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/titanic-tutorial\">Alexis Cook’s Titanic Tutorial</a> that walks you through step by step how to make your first submission!\n\n<iframe width=\"699\" height=\"368\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8yZMXCaFshs\" title=\"YouTube video | How to Get Started with Kaggle’s Titanic Competition | Kaggle\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n## The Challenge\nThe sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.\n\nOn April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.\n\nWhile there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.\n\nIn this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).\n\n> #### Recommended Tutorial\n> We highly recommend [Alexis Cook’s Titanic Tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/titanic-tutorial) that walks you through making your very first submission step by step and [this starter notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/gusthema/titanic-competition-w-tensorflow-decision-forests) to get started.\n\n## How Kaggle’s Competitions Work\n1. **Join the Competition**\nRead about the challenge description, accept the Competition Rules and gain access to the competition dataset.\n1.  **Get to Work**\nDownload the data, build models on it locally or on Kaggle Notebooks (our no-setup, customizable Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs) and generate a prediction file.\n1.  **Make a Submission**\nUpload your prediction as a submission on Kaggle and receive an accuracy score.\n1.  **Check the Leaderboard**\nSee how your model ranks against other Kagglers on our leaderboard. \n1.  **Improve Your Score**\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a> to find lots of tutorials and insights from other competitors.\n\n> #### Kaggle Lingo Video\n> You may run into unfamiliar lingo as you dig into the Kaggle discussion forums and public notebooks. Check out  Dr. Rachael Tatman’s [video on Kaggle Lingo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEJHyuWKd-s) to get up to speed!\n\n## What Data Will I Use in This Competition?\nIn this competition, you’ll gain access to two similar datasets that include passenger information like name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc. One dataset is titled `train.csv` and the other is titled `test.csv`.\n\n`Train.csv` will contain the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 to be exact) and importantly, will reveal whether they survived or not, also known as the “ground truth”.\n\nThe `test.csv` dataset contains similar information but does not disclose the “ground truth” for each passenger. It’s your job to predict these outcomes.\n\nUsing the patterns you find in the `train.csv` data, predict whether the other 418 passengers on board (found in `test.csv`) survived.\n\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data\">“Data” tab</a> to explore the datasets even further. Once you feel you’ve created a competitive model, submit it to Kaggle to see where your model stands on our leaderboard against other Kagglers.\n\n## How to Submit your Prediction to Kaggle\nOnce you’re ready to make a submission and get on the leaderboard:\n\n1. Click on the “Submit Predictions” button\n<img width=\"699\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen1.png\">\n1. Upload a CSV file in the submission file format. You’re able to submit 10 submissions a day.\n<img width=\"699\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen2.png\">\n\n## Submission File Format:\nYou should submit a csv file with exactly 418 entries plus a header row. Your submission will show an error if you have extra columns (beyond `PassengerId` and `Survived`) or rows.\n\nThe file should have exactly 2 columns:\n- `PassengerId` (sorted in any order)\n- `Survived` (contains your binary predictions: 1 for survived, 0 for deceased)\n\n## Got it! I’m ready to get started. Where do I get help if I need it?\n- For Competition Help: <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\">Titanic Discussion Forum</a>\n\nKaggle doesn’t have a dedicated team to help troubleshoot your code so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. The forums are full of useful information on the data, metric, and different approaches. We encourage you to use the forums often. If you share your knowledge, you'll find that others will share a lot in turn!\n\n## A Last Word on Kaggle Notebooks\nAs we mentioned before, Kaggle Notebooks is our no-setup, customizable, Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs and a huge repository of community published data &amp; code.\n\nIn every competition, you’ll find many Notebooks shared with incredible insights. It’s an invaluable resource worth becoming familiar with. Check out this competition’s Notebooks <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/notebooks\">here</a>.\n\n## 🏃‍♀Ready to Compete? <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/account/login?returnUrl=%2Fc%2Ftitanic\">Join the Competition Here!</a>\n\n## Evaluation\n\n<h2>Goal</h2>\n<p>It is your job to predict if a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic or not. <br>For each  in the test set, you must predict a 0 or 1 value for the  variable.</p>\n<h2>Metric</h2>\n<p>Your score is the percentage of passengers you correctly predict. This is known as <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision#In_binary_classification\">accuracy</a>.</p>\n<h2>Submission File Format</h2>\n<p>You should submit a csv file with exactly 418 entries <b>plus</b> a header row. Your submission will show an error if you have extra columns (beyond PassengerId and Survived) or rows.<br><br>The file should have exactly 2 columns:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>PassengerId (sorted in any order)</li>\n<li>Survived (contains your binary predictions: 1 for survived, 0 for deceased)</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><b>PassengerId,Survived</b><br>892,0<br>893,1<br>894,0<br>Etc.</pre>\n<p>You can download an example submission file (gender_submission.csv) on the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data\">Data page</a>.</p>\n\n## data-description\n\n<h3>Overview</h3>\n<p>The data has been split into two groups:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>training set (train.csv)</li>\n<li>test set (test.csv)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b> The training set </b>should be used to build your machine learning models. For the training set, we provide the outcome (also known as the “ground truth”) for each passenger. Your model will be based on “features” like passengers’ gender and class. You can also use <a href=\"https://triangleinequality.wordpress.com/2013/09/08/basic-feature-engineering-with-the-titanic-data/\" target=\"_blank\"> feature engineering </a>to create new features.</p>\n<p><b>The test set </b>should be used to see how well your model performs on unseen data. For the test set, we do not provide the ground truth for each passenger. It is your job to predict these outcomes. For each passenger in the test set, use the model you trained to predict whether or not they survived the sinking of the Titanic.</p>\n<p>We also include <b>gender_submission.csv</b>, a set of predictions that assume all and only female passengers survive, as an example of what a submission file should look like.</p>\n<h3>Data Dictionary</h3>\n<table style=\"width: 100%;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr><th><b>Variable</b></th><th><b>Definition</b></th><th><b>Key</b></th></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>survival</td>\n<td>Survival</td>\n<td>0 = No, 1 = Yes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>pclass</td>\n<td>Ticket class</td>\n<td>1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>sex</td>\n<td>Sex</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Age</td>\n<td>Age in years</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>sibsp</td>\n<td># of siblings / spouses aboard the Titanic</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>parch</td>\n<td># of parents / children aboard the Titanic</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>ticket</td>\n<td>Ticket number</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>fare</td>\n<td>Passenger fare</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>cabin</td>\n<td>Cabin number</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>embarked</td>\n<td>Port of Embarkation</td>\n<td>C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>Variable Notes</h3>\n<p><b>pclass</b>: A proxy for socio-economic status (SES)<br /> 1st = Upper<br /> 2nd = Middle<br /> 3rd = Lower<br /><br /> <b>age</b>: Age is fractional if less than 1.

They are a great place to begin if you are new to data science or just finished a MOOC and want to get involved in Kaggle.</p>\n<p>Getting Started competitions are a non-competitive way to get familiar with Kaggle’s platform, learn basic machine learning concepts, and start meeting people in the community. They have no cash prize and are on a rolling timeline.</p>\n<h2>How do I create and manage a team?</h2>\n<p>When you accept the competition rules, a team will be created for you. You can invite others to your team, accept a merger with another team, and update basic information like team name by going to the More &gt; <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/team\" target=\"_blank\">Team</a> page.</p>\n<p>We've heard from many Kagglers that teaming up is the best way to learn new skills AND have fun. If you don't have a teammate already, consider asking if anyone wants to team up in the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a>.</p>\n<h2>What are Notebooks?</h2>\n<p>Kaggle Notebooks is a cloud computational environment that enables reproducible and collaborative analysis. Notebooks support scripts in Python and R, Jupyter Notebooks, and RMarkdown reports. You can visit the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/notebooks\" target=\"_blank\">Notebooks</a> tab to view all of the publicly shared code for the Titanic competition. For more on how to use Notebooks to learn data science, check out our <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview\" target=\"&quot;_blank\">Courses</a>!</p>\n<h2>Why did my team disappear from the leaderboard?</h2>\n<p>To keep with the spirit of getting-started competitions, we have implemented a two month rolling window on submissions. Once a submission is more than two months old, it will be invalidated and no longer count towards the leaderboard.</p>\n<p>If your team has no submissions in the previous two months, the team will also drop from the leaderboard. This will keep the leaderboard at a manageable size, freshen it up, and prevent newcomers from getting lost in a sea of abandoned scores.</p>\n<p><i>\"I worked so hard to get that score! Give it back!\"</i> Read more about our decision to implement a rolling leaderboard <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion/6240\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n<h2>How do I contact Support?</h2>\n<p>Kaggle does not have a dedicated support team so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum.

Most beginners get lost in the field, because they fall into the black box approach, using libraries and algorithms they don't understand. This tutorial will give you a 1-2-year head start over your peers, by providing a framework that teaches you how-to think like a data scientist vs what to think/code. Not only will you be able to submit your first competition, but you’ll be able to solve any problem\n\n=== MARKDOWN 1 ===\n<a id=\"ch1\"></a>\n# How a Data Scientist Beat the Odds\nIt's the classical problem, predict the outcome of a binary event. In laymen terms this means, it either occurred or did not occur. For example, you won or did not win, you passed the test or did not pass the test, you were accepted or not accepted, and you get the point. A common business application is churn or customer retention. Another popular use case is, healthcare's mortality rate or survival analysis. Binary events create an interest\n\n=== MARKDOWN 2 ===\n<a id=\"ch2\"></a>\n# A Data Science Framework\n1. **Define the Problem:** If data science, big data, machine learning, predictive analytics, business intelligence, or any other buzzword is the solution, then what is the problem?

On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the inter\n\n=== MARKDOWN 4 ===\n<a id=\"ch4\"></a>\n# Step 3: Prepare Data for Consumption\nSince step 2 was provided to us on a golden plater, so is step 3. Therefore, normal processes in data wrangling, such as data architecture, governance, and extraction are out of scope. Thus, only data cleaning is in scope.\n\n## 3.1 Import Libraries\nThe following code is written in Python 3.x. Libraries provide pre-written functionality to perform necessary tasks.

multi-disciplinary field between mathematics (i.e. statistics, linear algebra, etc.), computer science (i.e. programming languages, computer systems, etc.) and business management (i.e. communication, subject-matter knowledge, etc.).

For example, if we're only going to increase our accuracy by 1/10th of a percent, is it really worth 3-months of development.

In a nutshell stacking uses as a first-level (base), the predictions of a few basic classifiers and then uses another model at the second-level to predict the output from the earlier first-level predictions.\n\nThe Titanic dataset is a prime candidate for introducing this concept as many newcomers to Kaggle start out here. Furthermore even though stacking has been responsible for many a team winning K\n\n=== CODE 1 ===\n# Load in our libraries\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport re\nimport sklearn\nimport xgboost as xgb\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline\n\nimport plotly.offline as py\npy.init_notebook_mode(connected=True)\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\nimport plotly.tools as tls\n\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\n\n# Going to use these 5 base models for the stacking\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import (RandomForestClassifier, AdaBoostClassifier, \n                              GradientBoostingClassifier, ExtraTreesClassifier)\nfrom sklearn.svm import SVC\nfrom \n\n=== MARKDOWN 2 ===\n# Feature Exploration, Engineering and Cleaning \n\nNow we will proceed much like how most kernels in general are structured, and that is to first explore the data on hand, identify possible feature engineering opportunities as well as numerically encode any categorical features.\n\n=== CODE 3 ===\n# Load in the train and test datasets\ntrain = pd.read_csv('../input/train.csv')\ntest = pd.read_csv('../input/test.csv')\n\n# Store our passenger ID for easy access\nPassengerId = test['PassengerId']\n\ntrain.head(3)\n\n=== MARKDOWN 4 ===\nWell it is no surprise that our task is to somehow extract the information out of the categorical variables \n\n**Feature Engineering**\n\nHere, credit must be extended to Sina's very comprehensive and well-thought out notebook for the feature engineering ideas so please check out his work \n\n[Titanic Best Working Classfier][1] : by Sina\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.kaggle.com/sinakhorami/titanic/titanic-best-working-classifier\n\n=== CODE 5 ===\nfull_data = [train, test]\n\n# Some features of my own that I have added in\n# Gives the length of the name\ntrain['Name_length'] = train['Name'].apply(len)\ntest['Name_length'] = test['Name'].apply(len)\n# Feature that tells whether a passenger had a cabin on the Titanic\ntrain['Has_Cabin'] = train[\"Cabin\"].apply(lambda x: 0 if type(x) == float else 1)\ntest['Has_Cabin'] = test[\"Cabin\"].apply(lambda x: 0 if type(x) == float else 1)\n\n# Feature engineering steps taken from Sina\n# Create new feature FamilySize as a combination of SibSp and Parch\nfor dataset in full_data:\n    dataset['FamilySize'] = data\n\n=== CODE 6 ===\n# Feature selection\ndrop_elements = ['PassengerId', 'Name', 'Ticket', 'Cabin', 'SibSp']\ntrain = train.drop(drop_elements, axis = 1)\ntrain = train.drop(['CategoricalAge', 'CategoricalFare'], axis = 1)\ntest  = test.drop(drop_elements, axis = 1)\n\n=== MARKDOWN 7 ===\nAll right so now having cleaned the features and extracted relevant information and dropped the categorical columns our features should now all be numeric, a format suitable to feed into our Machine Learning models.

To do so, we will utilise the Seaborn plotting package which allows us to plot heatmaps very conveniently as follows\n\n=== CODE 10 ===\ncolormap = plt.cm.RdBu\nplt.figure(figsize=(14,12))\nplt.title('Pearson Correlation of Features', y=1.05, size=15)\nsns.heatmap(train.astype(float).corr(),linewidths=0.1,vmax=1.0, \n            square=True, cmap=colormap, linecolor='white', annot=True)\n\n=== MARKDOWN 11 ===\n**Takeaway from the Plots**\n\nOne thing that that the Pearson Correlation plot can tell us is that there are not too many features strongly correlated with one another. This is good from a point of view of feeding these features into your learning model because this means that there isn't much redundant or superfluous data in our training set and we are happy that each feature carries with it some unique information. Here are two most correlated features are that of Family size and Parch (Parents and Children). I'll still leave both features in for the purposes of this exercise.\n\n**Pairplots**\n\n\n=== CODE 12 ===\ng = sns.pairplot(train[[u'Survived', u'Pclass', u'Sex', u'Age', u'Parch', u'Fare', u'Embarked',\n       u'FamilySize', u'Title']], hue='Survived', palette = 'seismic',size=1.2,diag_kind = 'kde',diag_kws=dict(shade=True),plot_kws=dict(s=10) )\ng.set(xticklabels=[])\n\n=== MARKDOWN 13 ===\n# Ensembling & Stacking models\n\nFinally after that brief whirlwind detour with regards to feature engineering and formatting, we finally arrive at the meat and gist of the this notebook.\n\nCreating a Stacking ensemble!\n\n=== MARKDOWN 14 ===\n### Helpers via Python Classes\n\nHere we invoke the use of Python's classes to help make it more convenient for us. For any newcomers to programming, one normally hears Classes being used in conjunction with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). In short, a class helps to extend some code/program for creating objects (variables for old-school peeps) as well as to implement functions and methods specific to that class.\n\nIn the section of code below, we essentially write a class *SklearnHelper* that allows one to extend the inbuilt methods (such as train, predict and fit) common to all the Sklearn c\n\n=== CODE 15 ===\n# Some useful parameters which will come in handy later on\nntrain = train.shape[0]\nntest = test.shape[0]\nSEED = 0 # for reproducibility\nNFOLDS = 5 # set folds for out-of-fold prediction\nkf = KFold(ntrain, n_folds= NFOLDS, random_state=SEED)\n\n# Class to extend the Sklearn classifier\nclass SklearnHelper(object):\n    def __init__(self, clf, seed=0, params=None):\n        params['random_state'] = seed\n        self.clf = clf(**params)\n\n    def train(self, x_train, y_train):\n        self.clf.fit(x_train, y_train)\n\n    def predict(self, x):\n        return self.clf.predict(x)\n    \n    def fit(self,x,y)\n\n=== MARKDOWN 16 ===\nBear with me for those who already know this but for people who have not created classes or objects in Python before, let me explain what the code given above does. In creating my base classifiers, I will only use the models already present in the Sklearn library and therefore only extend the class for that.\n\n**def init** : Python standard for invoking the default constructor for the class. This means that when you want to create an object (classifier), you have to give it the parameters of clf (what sklearn classifier you want), seed (random seed) and params (parameters for the classifiers).\n\n\n=== MARKDOWN 17 ===\n### Out-of-Fold Predictions\n\nNow as alluded to above in the introductory section, stacking uses predictions of base classifiers as input for training to a second-level model. However one cannot simply train the base models on the full training data, generate predictions on the full test set and then output these for the second-level training. This runs the risk of your base model predictions already having \"seen\" the test set and therefore overfitting when feeding these predictions.\n\n=== CODE 18 ===\ndef get_oof(clf, x_train, y_train, x_test):\n    oof_train = np.zeros((ntrain,))\n    oof_test = np.zeros((ntest,))\n    oof_test_skf = np.empty((NFOLDS, ntest))\n\n    for i, (train_index, test_index) in enumerate(kf):\n        x_tr = x_train[train_index]\n        y_tr = y_train[train_index]\n        x_te = x_train[test_index]\n\n        clf.train(x_tr, y_tr)\n\n        oof_train[test_index] = clf.predict(x_te)\n        oof_test_skf[i, :] = clf.predict(x_test)\n\n    oof_test[:] = oof_test_skf.mean(axis=0)\n    return oof_train.reshape(-1, 1), oof_test.reshape(-1, 1)\n\n=== MARKDOWN 19 ===\n# Generating our Base First-Level Models \n\nSo now let us prepare five learning models as our first level classification. These models can all be conveniently invoked via the Sklearn library and are listed as follows:\n\n 1. Random Forest classifier\n 2. Extra Trees classifier\n 3. AdaBoost classifer\n 4.

As per the code below, we are therefore having as our new columns the first-level predictions from our earlier classifiers and we train the next classifier on this.\n\n=== CODE 42 ===\nbase_predictions_train = pd.DataFrame( {'RandomForest': rf_oof_train.ravel(),\n     'ExtraTrees': et_oof_train.ravel(),\n     'AdaBoost': ada_oof_train.ravel(),\n      'GradientBoost': gb_oof_train.ravel()\n    })\nbase_predictions_train.head()\n\n=== MARKDOWN 43 ===\n**Correlation Heatmap of the Second Level Training set**\n\n=== CODE 44 ===\ndata = [\n    go.Heatmap(\n        z= base_predictions_train.astype(float).corr().values ,\n        x=base_predictions_train.columns.values,\n        y= base_predictions_train.columns.values,\n          colorscale='Viridis',\n            showscale=True,\n            reversescale = True\n    )\n]\npy.iplot(data, filename='labelled-heatmap')\n\n=== MARKDOWN 45 ===\nThere have been quite a few articles and Kaggle competition winner stories about the merits of having trained models that are more uncorrelated with one another producing better scores.\n\n=== CODE 46 ===\nx_train = np.concatenate(( et_oof_train, rf_oof_train, ada_oof_train, gb_oof_train, svc_oof_train), axis=1)\nx_test = np.concatenate(( et_oof_test, rf_oof_test, ada_oof_test, gb_oof_test, svc_oof_test), axis=1)\n\n=== MARKDOWN 47 ===\nHaving now concatenated and joined both the first-level train and test predictions as x_train and x_test, we can now fit a second-level learning model.\n\n=== MARKDOWN 48 ===\n### Second level learning model via XGBoost\n\nHere we choose the eXtremely famous library for boosted tree learning model, XGBoost. It was built to optimize large-scale boosted tree algorithms. For further information about the algorithm, check out the [official documentation][1].\n\n  [1]: https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n\nAnyways, we call an XGBClassifier and fit it to the first-level train and target data and use the learned model to predict the test data as follows:\n\n=== CODE 49 ===\ngbm = xgb.XGBClassifier(\n    #learning_rate = 0.02,\n n_estimators= 2000,\n max_depth= 4,\n min_child_weight= 2,\n #gamma=1,\n gamma=0.9,                        \n subsample=0.8,\n colsample_bytree=0.8,\n objective= 'binary:logistic',\n nthread= -1,\n scale_pos_weight=1).fit(x_train, y_train)\npredictions = gbm.predict(x_test)\n\n=== MARKDOWN 50 ===\nJust a quick run down of the XGBoost parameters used in the model:\n\n**max_depth** : How deep you want to grow your tree. Beware if set to too high a number might run the risk of overfitting.\n\n**gamma** : minimum loss reduction required to make a further partition on a leaf node of the tree. The larger, the more conservative the algorithm will be.\n\n**eta** : step size shrinkage used in each boosting step to prevent overfitting\n\n=== MARKDOWN 51 ===\n**Producing the Submission file**\n\nFinally having trained and fit all our first-level and second-level models, we can now output the predictions into the proper format for submission to the Titanic competition as follows:\n\n=== CODE 52 ===\n# Generate Submission File \nStackingSubmission = pd.DataFrame({ 'PassengerId': PassengerId,\n                            'Survived': predictions })\nStackingSubmission.to_csv(\"StackingSubmission.csv\", index=False)\n\n=== MARKDOWN 53 ===\n**Steps for Further Improvement**\n\nAs a closing remark it must be noted that the steps taken above just show a very simple way of producing an ensemble stacker. You hear of ensembles created at the highest level of Kaggle competitions which involves monstrous combinations of stacked classifiers as well as levels of stacking which go to more than 2 levels. \n\nSome additional steps that may be taken to improve one's score could be:\n\n 1. Implementing a good cross-validation strategy in training the models to find optimal parameter values\n 2. Introduce a greater variety of base models for learning.\n\n=== MARKDOWN 54 ===\n### Conclusion\n\nI have this notebook has been helpful somewhat in introducing a working script for stacking learning models. Again credit must be extended to Faron and Sina. \n\nFor other excellent material on stacking or ensembling in general, refer to the de-facto Must read article on the website MLWave: [Kaggle Ensembling Guide][1]. \n\nTill next time, Peace Out\n\n  [1]: http://mlwave.com/kaggle-ensembling-guide/\n\n=== CODE 55 ===\n\n\n\ntool: ✓ Recorded finding: Feature Engineering: FamilySize = SibSp + Parch + 1; IsAlone = 1 if FamilySize == 1; Title extracted...\n  Source: ../research/kernels/ldfreeman3_a-data-science-framework-to-achieve-99-accuracy\ntool: ✓ Recorded finding: Stacking Ensemble: Use 5 base models (RandomForest, ExtraTrees, AdaBoost, GradientBoosting, SVC) wit...\n  Source: ../research/kernels/arthurtok_introduction-to-ensembling-stacking-in-python\ntool: ✓ Recorded finding: Important features by importance: Title (especially 'Master' for male survival), Sex, Pclass, Age, F...\n  Source: ../research/kernels/arthurtok_introduction-to-ensembling-stacking-in-python\ntool: Created: /home/code/exploration/eda.ipynb\n\nStrong Note: OOM is unrecoverable.

Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.\\n\\nWhile there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.\\n\\nIn this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).\\n\\n> #### Recommended Tutorial\\n> We highly recommend [Alexis Cook’s Titanic Tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/titanic-tutorial) that walks you through making your very first submission step by step and [this starter notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/gusthema/titanic-competition-w-tensorflow-decision-forests) to get started.\\n\\n## How Kaggle’s Competitions Work\\n1. **Join the Competition**\\nRead about the challenge description, accept the Competition Rules and gain access to the competition dataset.\\n1.  **Get to Work**\\nDownload the data, build models on it locally or on Kaggle Notebooks (our no-setup, customizable Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs) and generate a prediction file.\\n1.  **Make a Submission**\\nUpload your prediction as a submission on Kaggle and receive an accuracy score.\\n1.  **Check the Leaderboard**\\nSee how your model ranks against other Kagglers on our leaderboard. \\n1.  **Improve Your Score**\\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a> to find lots of tutorials and insights from other competitors.\\n\\n> #### Kaggle Lingo Video\\n> You may run into unfamiliar lingo as you dig into the Kaggle discussion forums and public notebooks. Check out  Dr. Rachael Tatman’s [video on Kaggle Lingo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEJHyuWKd-s) to get up to speed!\\n\\n## What Data Will I Use in This Competition?\\nIn this competition, you’ll gain access to two similar datasets that include passenger information like name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc. One dataset is titled `train.csv` and the other is titled `test.csv`.\\n\\n`Train.csv` will contain the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 to be exact) and importantly, will reveal whether they survived or not, also known as the “ground truth”.\\n\\nThe `test.csv` dataset contains similar information but does not disclose the “ground truth” for each passenger. It’s your job to predict these outcomes.\\n\\nUsing the patterns you find in the `train.csv` data, predict whether the other 418 passengers on board (found in `test.csv`) survived.\\n\\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data\">“Data” tab</a> to explore the datasets even further. Once you feel you’ve created a competitive model, submit it to Kaggle to see where your model stands on our leaderboard against other Kagglers.\\n\\n## How to Submit your Prediction to Kaggle\\nOnce you’re ready to make a submission and get on the leaderboard:\\n\\n1. Click on the “Submit Predictions” button\\n<img width=\"699\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen1.png\">\\n1. Upload a CSV file in the submission file format. You’re able to submit 10 submissions a day.\\n<img width=\"699\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen2.png\">\\n\\n## Submission File Format:\\nYou should submit a csv file with exactly 418 entries plus a header row. Your submission will show an error if you have extra columns (beyond `PassengerId` and `Survived`) or rows.\\n\\nThe file should have exactly 2 columns:\\n- `PassengerId` (sorted in any order)\\n- `Survived` (contains your binary predictions: 1 for survived, 0 for deceased)\\n\\n## Got it! I’m ready to get started. Where do I get help if I need it?\\n- For Competition Help: <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\">Titanic Discussion Forum</a>\\n\\nKaggle doesn’t have a dedicated team to help troubleshoot your code so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. The forums are full of useful information on the data, metric, and different approaches. We encourage you to use the forums often. If you share your knowledge, you\\'ll find that others will share a lot in turn!\\n\\n## A Last Word on Kaggle Notebooks\\nAs we mentioned before, Kaggle Notebooks is our no-setup, customizable, Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs and a huge repository of community published data &amp; code.\\n\\nIn every competition, you’ll find many Notebooks shared with incredible insights. It’s an invaluable resource worth becoming familiar with.

They are a great place to begin if you are new to data science or just finished a MOOC and want to get involved in Kaggle.</p>\\n<p>Getting Started competitions are a non-competitive way to get familiar with Kaggle’s platform, learn basic machine learning concepts, and start meeting people in the community. They have no cash prize and are on a rolling timeline.</p>\\n<h2>How do I create and manage a team?</h2>\\n<p>When you accept the competition rules, a team will be created for you. You can invite others to your team, accept a merger with another team, and update basic information like team name by going to the More &gt; <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/team\" target=\"_blank\">Team</a> page.</p>\\n<p>We\\'ve heard from many Kagglers that teaming up is the best way to learn new skills AND have fun. If you don\\'t have a teammate already, consider asking if anyone wants to team up in the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a>.</p>\\n<h2>What are Notebooks?</h2>\\n<p>Kaggle Notebooks is a cloud computational environment that enables reproducible and collaborative analysis. Notebooks support scripts in Python and R, Jupyter Notebooks, and RMarkdown reports. You can visit the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/notebooks\" target=\"_blank\">Notebooks</a> tab to view all of the publicly shared code for the Titanic competition. For more on how to use Notebooks to learn data science, check out our <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview\" target=\"&quot;_blank\">Courses</a>!</p>\\n<h2>Why did my team disappear from the leaderboard?</h2>\\n<p>To keep with the spirit of getting-started competitions, we have implemented a two month rolling window on submissions. Once a submission is more than two months old, it will be invalidated and no longer count towards the leaderboard.</p>\\n<p>If your team has no submissions in the previous two months, the team will also drop from the leaderboard. This will keep the leaderboard at a manageable size, freshen it up, and prevent newcomers from getting lost in a sea of abandoned scores.</p>\\n<p><i>\"I worked so hard to get that score! Give it back!\"</i> Read more about our decision to implement a rolling leaderboard <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion/6240\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\\n<h2>How do I contact Support?</h2>\\n<p>Kaggle does not have a dedicated support team so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. (For this competition, you’ll want to use the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">Titanic discussion forum)</a>.</p>\\n<p>Support is only able to help with issues that are being experienced by all participants. Before contacting support, please check the discussion forum for information on your problem.

In a nutshell stacking uses as a first-level (base), the predictions of a few basic classifiers and then uses another model at the second-level to predict the output from the earlier first-level predictions.\\n\\nThe Titanic dataset is a prime candidate for introducing this concept as many newcomers to Kaggle start out here.

This is good from a point of view of feeding these features into your learning model because this means that there isn\\'t much redundant or superfluous data in our training set and we are happy that each feature carries with it some unique information. Here are two most correlated features are that of Family size and Parch (Parents and Children).

For any newcomers to programming, one normally hears Classes being used in conjunction with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). In short, a class helps to extend some code/program for creating objects (variables for old-school peeps) as well as to implement functions and methods specific to that class.\\n\\nIn the section of code below, we essentially write a class *SklearnHelper* that allows one to extend the inbuilt methods (such as train, predict and fit) common to all the Sklearn c\\n\\n=== CODE 15 ===\\n# Some useful parameters which will come in handy later on\\nntrain = train.shape[0]\\nntest = test.shape[0]\\nSEED = 0 # for reproducibility\\nNFOLDS = 5 # set folds for out-of-fold prediction\\nkf = KFold(ntrain, n_folds= NFOLDS, random_state=SEED)\\n\\n# Class to extend the Sklearn classifier\\nclass SklearnHelper(object):\\n    def __init__(self, clf, seed=0, params=None):\\n        params[\\'random_state\\'] = seed\\n        self.clf = clf(**params)\\n\\n    def train(self, x_train, y_train):\\n        self.clf.fit(x_train, y_train)\\n\\n    def predict(self, x):\\n        return self.clf.predict(x)\\n    \\n    def fit(self,x,y)\\n\\n=== MARKDOWN 16 ===\\nBear with me for those who already know this but for people who have not created classes or objects in Python before, let me explain what the code given above does. In creating my base classifiers, I will only use the models already present in the Sklearn library and therefore only extend the class for that.\\n\\n**def init** : Python standard for invoking the default constructor for the class. This means that when you want to create an object (classifier), you have to give it the parameters of clf (what sklearn classifier you want), seed (random seed) and params (parameters for the classifiers).\\n\\n\\n=== MARKDOWN 17 ===\\n### Out-of-Fold Predictions\\n\\nNow as alluded to above in the introductory section, stacking uses predictions of base classifiers as input for training to a second-level model. However one cannot simply train the base models on the full training data, generate predictions on the full test set and then output these for the second-level training. This runs the risk of your base model predictions already having \"seen\" the test set and therefore overfitting when feeding these predictions.\\n\\n=== CODE 18 ===\\ndef get_oof(clf, x_train, y_train, x_test):\\n    oof_train = np.zeros((ntrain,))\\n    oof_test = np.zeros((ntest,))\\n    oof_test_skf = np.empty((NFOLDS, ntest))\\n\\n    for i, (train_index, test_index) in enumerate(kf):\\n        x_tr = x_train[train_index]\\n        y_tr = y_train[train_index]\\n        x_te = x_train[test_index]\\n\\n        clf.train(x_tr, y_tr)\\n\\n        oof_train[test_index] = clf.predict(x_te)\\n        oof_test_skf[i, :] = clf.predict(x_test)\\n\\n    oof_test[:] = oof_test_skf.mean(axis=0)\\n    return oof_train.reshape(-1, 1), oof_test.reshape(-1, 1)\\n\\n=== MARKDOWN 19 ===\\n# Generating our Base First-Level Models \\n\\nSo now let us prepare five learning models as our first level classification. These models can all be conveniently invoked via the Sklearn library and are listed as follows:\\n\\n 1. Random Forest classifier\\n 2. Extra Trees classifier\\n 3. AdaBoost classifer\\n 4.

Then check out <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/titanic-tutorial\">Alexis Cook’s Titanic Tutorial</a> that walks you through step by step how to make your first submission!\n\n<iframe width=\"699\" height=\"368\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8yZMXCaFshs\" title=\"YouTube video | How to Get Started with Kaggle’s Titanic Competition | Kaggle\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n## The Challenge\nThe sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.\n\nOn April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.\n\nWhile there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.\n\nIn this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).\n\n> #### Recommended Tutorial\n> We highly recommend [Alexis Cook’s Titanic Tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/titanic-tutorial) that walks you through making your very first submission step by step and [this starter notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/gusthema/titanic-competition-w-tensorflow-decision-forests) to get started.\n\n## How Kaggle’s Competitions Work\n1. **Join the Competition**\nRead about the challenge description, accept the Competition Rules and gain access to the competition dataset.\n1.  **Get to Work**\nDownload the data, build models on it locally or on Kaggle Notebooks (our no-setup, customizable Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs) and generate a prediction file.\n1.  **Make a Submission**\nUpload your prediction as a submission on Kaggle and receive an accuracy score.\n1.  **Check the Leaderboard**\nSee how your model ranks against other Kagglers on our leaderboard. \n1.  **Improve Your Score**\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a> to find lots of tutorials and insights from other competitors.\n\n> #### Kaggle Lingo Video\n> You may run into unfamiliar lingo as you dig into the Kaggle discussion forums and public notebooks. Check out  Dr. Rachael Tatman’s [video on Kaggle Lingo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEJHyuWKd-s) to get up to speed!\n\n## What Data Will I Use in This Competition?\nIn this competition, you’ll gain access to two similar datasets that include passenger information like name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc. One dataset is titled `train.csv` and the other is titled `test.csv`.\n\n`Train.csv` will contain the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 to be exact) and importantly, will reveal whether they survived or not, also known as the “ground truth”.\n\nThe `test.csv` dataset contains similar information but does not disclose the “ground truth” for each passenger. It’s your job to predict these outcomes.\n\nUsing the patterns you find in the `train.csv` data, predict whether the other 418 passengers on board (found in `test.csv`) survived.\n\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data\">“Data” tab</a> to explore the datasets even further. Once you feel you’ve created a competitive model, submit it to Kaggle to see where your model stands on our leaderboard against other Kagglers.\n\n## How to Submit your Prediction to Kaggle\nOnce you’re ready to make a submission and get on the leaderboard:\n\n1. Click on the “Submit Predictions” button\n<img width=\"699\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen1.png\">\n1. Upload a CSV file in the submission file format. You’re able to submit 10 submissions a day.\n<img width=\"699\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen2.png\">\n\n## Submission File Format:\nYou should submit a csv file with exactly 418 entries plus a header row. Your submission will show an error if you have extra columns (beyond `PassengerId` and `Survived`) or rows.\n\nThe file should have exactly 2 columns:\n- `PassengerId` (sorted in any order)\n- `Survived` (contains your binary predictions: 1 for survived, 0 for deceased)\n\n## Got it! I’m ready to get started. Where do I get help if I need it?\n- For Competition Help: <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\">Titanic Discussion Forum</a>\n\nKaggle doesn’t have a dedicated team to help troubleshoot your code so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. The forums are full of useful information on the data, metric, and different approaches. We encourage you to use the forums often. If you share your knowledge, you'll find that others will share a lot in turn!\n\n## A Last Word on Kaggle Notebooks\nAs we mentioned before, Kaggle Notebooks is our no-setup, customizable, Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs and a huge repository of community published data &amp; code.\n\nIn every competition, you’ll find many Notebooks shared with incredible insights. It’s an invaluable resource worth becoming familiar with. Check out this competition’s Notebooks <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/notebooks\">here</a>.\n\n## 🏃‍♀Ready to Compete? <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/account/login?returnUrl=%2Fc%2Ftitanic\">Join the Competition Here!</a>\n\n## Evaluation\n\n<h2>Goal</h2>\n<p>It is your job to predict if a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic or not. <br>For each  in the test set, you must predict a 0 or 1 value for the  variable.</p>\n<h2>Metric</h2>\n<p>Your score is the percentage of passengers you correctly predict.

They are a great place to begin if you are new to data science or just finished a MOOC and want to get involved in Kaggle.</p>\n<p>Getting Started competitions are a non-competitive way to get familiar with Kaggle’s platform, learn basic machine learning concepts, and start meeting people in the community. They have no cash prize and are on a rolling timeline.</p>\n<h2>How do I create and manage a team?</h2>\n<p>When you accept the competition rules, a team will be created for you. You can invite others to your team, accept a merger with another team, and update basic information like team name by going to the More &gt; <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/team\" target=\"_blank\">Team</a> page.</p>\n<p>We've heard from many Kagglers that teaming up is the best way to learn new skills AND have fun. If you don't have a teammate already, consider asking if anyone wants to team up in the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a>.</p>\n<h2>What are Notebooks?</h2>\n<p>Kaggle Notebooks is a cloud computational environment that enables reproducible and collaborative analysis. Notebooks support scripts in Python and R, Jupyter Notebooks, and RMarkdown reports. You can visit the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/notebooks\" target=\"_blank\">Notebooks</a> tab to view all of the publicly shared code for the Titanic competition. For more on how to use Notebooks to learn data science, check out our <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview\" target=\"&quot;_blank\">Courses</a>!</p>\n<h2>Why did my team disappear from the leaderboard?</h2>\n<p>To keep with the spirit of getting-started competitions, we have implemented a two month rolling window on submissions. Once a submission is more than two months old, it will be invalidated and no longer count towards the leaderboard.</p>\n<p>If your team has no submissions in the previous two months, the team will also drop from the leaderboard. This will keep the leaderboard at a manageable size, freshen it up, and prevent newcomers from getting lost in a sea of abandoned scores.</p>\n<p><i>\"I worked so hard to get that score! Give it back!\"</i> Read more about our decision to implement a rolling leaderboard <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion/6240\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n<h2>How do I contact Support?</h2>\n<p>Kaggle does not have a dedicated support team so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. (For this competition, you’ll want to use the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">Titanic discussion forum)</a>.</p>\n<p>Support is only able to help with issues that are being experienced by all participants. Before contacting support, please check the discussion forum for information on your problem. If you can’t find it, you can post your problem in the forum so a fellow participant or a Kaggle team member can provide help. The forums are full of useful information on the data, metric, and different approaches. We encourage you to use the forums often.

Most beginners get lost in the field, because they fall into the black box approach, using libraries and algorithms they don't understand. This tutorial will give you a 1-2-year head start over your peers, by providing a framework that teaches you how-to think like a data scientist vs what to think/code. Not only will you be able to submit your first competition, but you’ll be able to solve any problem\n\n=== MARKDOWN 1 ===\n<a id=\"ch1\"></a>\n# How a Data Scientist Beat the Odds\nIt's the classical problem, predict the outcome of a binary event. In laymen terms this means, it either occurred or did not occur. For example, you won or did not win, you passed the test or did not pass the test, you were accepted or not accepted, and you get the point. A common business application is churn or customer retention. Another popular use case is, healthcare's mortality rate or survival analysis. Binary events create an interest\n\n=== MARKDOWN 2 ===\n<a id=\"ch2\"></a>\n# A Data Science Framework\n1. **Define the Problem:** If data science, big data, machine learning, predictive analytics, business intelligence, or any other buzzword is the solution, then what is the problem?

Furthermore even though stacking has been responsible for many a team winning K\n\n=== CODE 1 ===\n# Load in our libraries\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport re\nimport sklearn\nimport xgboost as xgb\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline\n\nimport plotly.offline as py\npy.init_notebook_mode(connected=True)\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\nimport plotly.tools as tls\n\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\n\n# Going to use these 5 base models for the stacking\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import (RandomForestClassifier, AdaBoostClassifier, \n                              GradientBoostingClassifier, ExtraTreesClassifier)\nfrom sklearn.svm import SVC\nfrom \n\n=== MARKDOWN 2 ===\n# Feature Exploration, Engineering and Cleaning \n\nNow we will proceed much like how most kernels in general are structured, and that is to first explore the data on hand, identify possible feature engineering opportunities as well as numerically encode any categorical features.\n\n=== CODE 3 ===\n# Load in the train and test datasets\ntrain = pd.read_csv('../input/train.csv')\ntest = pd.read_csv('../input/test.csv')\n\n# Store our passenger ID for easy access\nPassengerId = test['PassengerId']\n\ntrain.head(3)\n\n=== MARKDOWN 4 ===\nWell it is no surprise that our task is to somehow extract the information out of the categorical variables \n\n**Feature Engineering**\n\nHere, credit must be extended to Sina's very comprehensive and well-thought out notebook for the feature engineering ideas so please check out his work \n\n[Titanic Best Working Classfier][1] : by Sina\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.kaggle.com/sinakhorami/titanic/titanic-best-working-classifier\n\n=== CODE 5 ===\nfull_data = [train, test]\n\n# Some features of my own that I have added in\n# Gives the length of the name\ntrain['Name_length'] = train['Name'].apply(len)\ntest['Name_length'] = test['Name'].apply(len)\n# Feature that tells whether a passenger had a cabin on the Titanic\ntrain['Has_Cabin'] = train[\"Cabin\"].apply(lambda x: 0 if type(x) == float else 1)\ntest['Has_Cabin'] = test[\"Cabin\"].apply(lambda x: 0 if type(x) == float else 1)\n\n# Feature engineering steps taken from Sina\n# Create new feature FamilySize as a combination of SibSp and Parch\nfor dataset in full_data:\n    dataset['FamilySize'] = data\n\n=== CODE 6 ===\n# Feature selection\ndrop_elements = ['PassengerId', 'Name', 'Ticket', 'Cabin', 'SibSp']\ntrain = train.drop(drop_elements, axis = 1)\ntrain = train.drop(['CategoricalAge', 'CategoricalFare'], axis = 1)\ntest  = test.drop(drop_elements, axis = 1)\n\n=== MARKDOWN 7 ===\nAll right so now having cleaned the features and extracted relevant information and dropped the categorical columns our features should now all be numeric, a format suitable to feed into our Machine Learning models. However before we proceed let us generate some simple correlation and distribution plots of our transformed dataset to observe ho\n\n## Visualisations \n\n=== CODE 8 ===\ntrain.head(3)\n\n=== MARKDOWN 9 ===\n**Pearson Correlation Heatmap**\n\nlet us generate some correlation plots of the features to see how related one feature is to the next. To do so, we will utilise the Seaborn plotting package which allows us to plot heatmaps very conveniently as follows\n\n=== CODE 10 ===\ncolormap = plt.cm.RdBu\nplt.figure(figsize=(14,12))\nplt.title('Pearson Correlation of Features', y=1.05, size=15)\nsns.heatmap(train.astype(float).corr(),linewidths=0.1,vmax=1.0, \n            square=True, cmap=colormap, linecolor='white', annot=True)\n\n=== MARKDOWN 11 ===\n**Takeaway from the Plots**\n\nOne thing that that the Pearson Correlation plot can tell us is that there are not too many features strongly correlated with one another. This is good from a point of view of feeding these features into your learning model because this means that there isn't much redundant or superfluous data in our training set and we are happy that each feature carries with it some unique information. Here are two most correlated features are that of Family size and Parch (Parents and Children). I'll still leave both features in for the purposes of this exercise.\n\n**Pairplots**\n\n\n=== CODE 12 ===\ng = sns.pairplot(train[[u'Survived', u'Pclass', u'Sex', u'Age', u'Parch', u'Fare', u'Embarked',\n       u'FamilySize', u'Title']], hue='Survived', palette = 'seismic',size=1.2,diag_kind = 'kde',diag_kws=dict(shade=True),plot_kws=dict(s=10) )\ng.set(xticklabels=[])\n\n=== MARKDOWN 13 ===\n# Ensembling & Stacking models\n\nFinally after that brief whirlwind detour with regards to feature engineering and formatting, we finally arrive at the meat and gist of the this notebook.\n\nCreating a Stacking ensemble!\n\n=== MARKDOWN 14 ===\n### Helpers via Python Classes\n\nHere we invoke the use of Python's classes to help make it more convenient for us. For any newcomers to programming, one normally hears Classes being used in conjunction with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). In short, a class helps to extend some code/program for creating objects (variables for old-school peeps) as well as to implement functions and methods specific to that class.\n\nIn the section of code below, we essentially write a class *SklearnHelper* that allows one to extend the inbuilt methods (such as train, predict and fit) common to all the Sklearn c\n\n=== CODE 15 ===\n# Some useful parameters which will come in handy later on\nntrain = train.shape[0]\nntest = test.shape[0]\nSEED = 0 # for reproducibility\nNFOLDS = 5 # set folds for out-of-fold prediction\nkf = KFold(ntrain, n_folds= NFOLDS, random_state=SEED)\n\n# Class to extend the Sklearn classifier\nclass SklearnHelper(object):\n    def __init__(self, clf, seed=0, params=None):\n        params['random_state'] = seed\n        self.clf = clf(**params)\n\n    def train(self, x_train, y_train):\n        self.clf.fit(x_train, y_train)\n\n    def predict(self, x):\n        return self.clf.predict(x)\n    \n    def fit(self,x,y)\n\n=== MARKDOWN 16 ===\nBear with me for those who already know this but for people who have not created classes or objects in Python before, let me explain what the code given above does. In creating my base classifiers, I will only use the models already present in the Sklearn library and therefore only extend the class for that.\n\n**def init** : Python standard for invoking the default constructor for the class. This means that when you want to create an object (classifier), you have to give it the parameters of clf (what sklearn classifier you want), seed (random seed) and params (parameters for the classifiers).\n\n\n=== MARKDOWN 17 ===\n### Out-of-Fold Predictions\n\nNow as alluded to above in the introductory section, stacking uses predictions of base classifiers as input for training to a second-level model. However one cannot simply train the base models on the full training data, generate predictions on the full test set and then output these for the second-level training. This runs the risk of your base model predictions already having \"seen\" the test set and therefore overfitting when feeding these predictions.\n\n=== CODE 18 ===\ndef get_oof(clf, x_train, y_train, x_test):\n    oof_train = np.zeros((ntrain,))\n    oof_test = np.zeros((ntest,))\n    oof_test_skf = np.empty((NFOLDS, ntest))\n\n    for i, (train_index, test_index) in enumerate(kf):\n        x_tr = x_train[train_index]\n        y_tr = y_train[train_index]\n        x_te = x_train[test_index]\n\n        clf.train(x_tr, y_tr)\n\n        oof_train[test_index] = clf.predict(x_te)\n        oof_test_skf[i, :] = clf.predict(x_test)\n\n    oof_test[:] = oof_test_skf.mean(axis=0)\n    return oof_train.reshape(-1, 1), oof_test.reshape(-1, 1)\n\n=== MARKDOWN 19 ===\n# Generating our Base First-Level Models \n\nSo now let us prepare five learning models as our first level classification. These models can all be conveniently invoked via the Sklearn library and are listed as follows:\n\n 1. Random Forest classifier\n 2. Extra Trees classifier\n 3. AdaBoost classifer\n 4. Gradient Boosting classifer\n 5. Support Vector Machine\n\n=== MARKDOWN 20 ===\n**Parameters**\n\nJust a quick summary of the parameters that we will be listing here for completeness,\n\n**n_jobs** : Number of cores used for the training process. If set to -1, all cores are used.\n\n**n_estimators** : Number of classification trees in your learning model ( set to 10 per default)\n\n**max_depth** : Maximum depth of tree, or how much a node should be expanded. Beware if set to too high  a number would run the risk of overfitting as one would be growing the tree too deep\n\n**verbose** : Controls whether you want to output any text during the learning process. A value of 0 suppresses \n\n=== CODE 21 ===\n# Put in our parameters for said classifiers\n# Random Forest parameters\nrf_params = {\n    'n_jobs': -1,\n    'n_estimators': 500,\n     'warm_start': True, \n     #'max_features': 0.2,\n    'max_depth': 6,\n    'min_samples_leaf': 2,\n    'max_features' : 'sqrt',\n    'verbose': 0\n}\n\n# Extra Trees Parameters\net_params = {\n    'n_jobs': -1,\n    'n_estimators':500,\n    #'max_features': 0.5,\n    'max_depth': 8,\n    'min_samples_leaf': 2,\n    'verbose': 0\n}\n\n# AdaBoost parameters\nada_params = {\n    'n_estimators': 500,\n    'learning_rate' : 0.75\n}\n\n# Gradient Boosting parameters\ngb_params = {\n    'n_esti\n\n=== MARKDOWN 22 ===\nFurthermore, since having mentioned about Objects and classes within the OOP framework, let us now create 5 objects that represent our 5 learning models via our Helper Sklearn Class we defined earlier.\n\n=== CODE 23 ===\n# Create 5 objects that\n...(truncated)...\n\n# Create Numpy arrays of train, test and target ( Survived) dataframes to feed into our models\ny_train = train['Survived'].ravel()\ntrain = train.drop(['Survived'], axis=1)\nx_train = train.values # Creates an array of the train data\nx_test = test.values # Creats an array of the test data\n\n=== MARKDOWN 26 ===\n**Output of the First level Predictions** \n\nWe now feed the training and test data into our 5 base classifiers and use the Out-of-Fold prediction function we defined earlier to generate our first level predictions. Allow a handful of minutes for the chunk of code below to run.\n\n=== CODE 27 ===\n# Create our OOF train and test predictions. These base results will be used as new features\net_oof_train, et_oof_test = get_oof(et, x_train, y_train, x_test) # Extra Trees\nrf_oof_train, rf_oof_test = get_oof(rf,x_train, y_train, x_test) # Random Forest\nada_oof_train, ada_oof_test = get_oof(ada, x_train, y_train, x_test) # AdaBoost \ngb_oof_train, gb_oof_test = get_oof(gb,x_train, y_train, x_test) # Gradient Boost\nsvc_oof_train, svc_oof_test = get_oof(svc,x_train, y_train, x_test) # Support Vector Classifier\n\nprint(\"Training is complete\")\n\n=== MARKDOWN 28 ===\n**Feature importances generated from the different classifiers**\n\nNow having learned our the first-level classifiers, we can utilise a very nifty feature of the Sklearn models and that is to output the importances of the various features in the training and test sets with one very simple line of code.\n\nAs per the Sklearn documentation, most of the classifiers are built in with an attribute which returns feature importances by simply typing in **.feature_importances_**. Therefore we will invoke this very useful attribute via our function earliand plot the feature importances as such\n\n=== CODE 29 ===\nrf_feature = rf.feature_importances(x_train,y_train)\net_feature = et.feature_importances(x_train, y_train)\nada_feature = ada.feature_importances(x_train, y_train)\ngb_feature = gb.feature_importances(x_train,y_train)\n\n=== MARKDOWN 30 ===\nSo I have not yet figured out how to assign and store the feature importances outright.

You hear of ensembles created at the highest level of Kaggle competitions which involves monstrous combinations of stacked classifiers as well as levels of stacking which go to more than 2 levels. \n\nSome additional steps that may be taken to improve one's score could be:\n\n 1. Implementing a good cross-validation strategy in training the models to find optimal parameter values\n 2.

Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.\\n\\nWhile there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.\\n\\nIn this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).\\n\\n> #### Recommended Tutorial\\n> We highly recommend [Alexis Cook’s Titanic Tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/titanic-tutorial) that walks you through making your very first submission step by step and [this starter notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/gusthema/titanic-competition-w-tensorflow-decision-forests) to get started.\\n\\n## How Kaggle’s Competitions Work\\n1. **Join the Competition**\\nRead about the challenge description, accept the Competition Rules and gain access to the competition dataset.\\n1.  **Get to Work**\\nDownload the data, build models on it locally or on Kaggle Notebooks (our no-setup, customizable Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs) and generate a prediction file.\\n1.  **Make a Submission**\\nUpload your prediction as a submission on Kaggle and receive an accuracy score.\\n1.  **Check the Leaderboard**\\nSee how your model ranks against other Kagglers on our leaderboard. \\n1.  **Improve Your Score**\\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a> to find lots of tutorials and insights from other competitors.\\n\\n> #### Kaggle Lingo Video\\n> You may run into unfamiliar lingo as you dig into the Kaggle discussion forums and public notebooks. Check out  Dr. Rachael Tatman’s [video on Kaggle Lingo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEJHyuWKd-s) to get up to speed!\\n\\n## What Data Will I Use in This Competition?\\nIn this competition, you’ll gain access to two similar datasets that include passenger information like name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc. One dataset is titled `train.csv` and the other is titled `test.csv`.\\n\\n`Train.csv` will contain the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 to be exact) and importantly, will reveal whether they survived or not, also known as the “ground truth”.\\n\\nThe `test.csv` dataset contains similar information but does not disclose the “ground truth” for each passenger. It’s your job to predict these outcomes.\\n\\nUsing the patterns you find in the `train.csv` data, predict whether the other 418 passengers on board (found in `test.csv`) survived.\\n\\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data\">“Data” tab</a> to explore the datasets even further. Once you feel you’ve created a competitive model, submit it to Kaggle to see where your model stands on our leaderboard against other Kagglers.\\n\\n## How to Submit your Prediction to Kaggle\\nOnce you’re ready to make a submission and get on the leaderboard:\\n\\n1. Click on the “Submit Predictions” button\\n<img width=\"699\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen1.png\">\\n1. Upload a CSV file in the submission file format. You’re able to submit 10 submissions a day.\\n<img width=\"699\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen2.png\">\\n\\n## Submission File Format:\\nYou should submit a csv file with exactly 418 entries plus a header row. Your submission will show an error if you have extra columns (beyond `PassengerId` and `Survived`) or rows.\\n\\nThe file should have exactly 2 columns:\\n- `PassengerId` (sorted in any order)\\n- `Survived` (contains your binary predictions: 1 for survived, 0 for deceased)\\n\\n## Got it! I’m ready to get started. Where do I get help if I need it?\\n- For Competition Help: <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\">Titanic Discussion Forum</a>\\n\\nKaggle doesn’t have a dedicated team to help troubleshoot your code so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. The forums are full of useful information on the data, metric, and different approaches. We encourage you to use the forums often. If you share your knowledge, you\\'ll find that others will share a lot in turn!\\n\\n## A Last Word on Kaggle Notebooks\\nAs we mentioned before, Kaggle Notebooks is our no-setup, customizable, Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs and a huge repository of community published data &amp; code.\\n\\nIn every competition, you’ll find many Notebooks shared with incredible insights. It’s an invaluable resource worth becoming familiar with.

They are a great place to begin if you are new to data science or just finished a MOOC and want to get involved in Kaggle.</p>\\n<p>Getting Started competitions are a non-competitive way to get familiar with Kaggle’s platform, learn basic machine learning concepts, and start meeting people in the community. They have no cash prize and are on a rolling timeline.</p>\\n<h2>How do I create and manage a team?</h2>\\n<p>When you accept the competition rules, a team will be created for you. You can invite others to your team, accept a merger with another team, and update basic information like team name by going to the More &gt; <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/team\" target=\"_blank\">Team</a> page.</p>\\n<p>We\\'ve heard from many Kagglers that teaming up is the best way to learn new skills AND have fun. If you don\\'t have a teammate already, consider asking if anyone wants to team up in the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a>.</p>\\n<h2>What are Notebooks?</h2>\\n<p>Kaggle Notebooks is a cloud computational environment that enables reproducible and collaborative analysis. Notebooks support scripts in Python and R, Jupyter Notebooks, and RMarkdown reports. You can visit the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/notebooks\" target=\"_blank\">Notebooks</a> tab to view all of the publicly shared code for the Titanic competition. For more on how to use Notebooks to learn data science, check out our <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview\" target=\"&quot;_blank\">Courses</a>!</p>\\n<h2>Why did my team disappear from the leaderboard?</h2>\\n<p>To keep with the spirit of getting-started competitions, we have implemented a two month rolling window on submissions. Once a submission is more than two months old, it will be invalidated and no longer count towards the leaderboard.</p>\\n<p>If your team has no submissions in the previous two months, the team will also drop from the leaderboard. This will keep the leaderboard at a manageable size, freshen it up, and prevent newcomers from getting lost in a sea of abandoned scores.</p>\\n<p><i>\"I worked so hard to get that score! Give it back!\"</i> Read more about our decision to implement a rolling leaderboard <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion/6240\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\\n<h2>How do I contact Support?</h2>\\n<p>Kaggle does not have a dedicated support team so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. (For this competition, you’ll want to use the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">Titanic discussion forum)</a>.</p>\\n<p>Support is only able to help with issues that are being experienced by all participants. Before contacting support, please check the discussion forum for information on your problem. If you can’t find it, you can post your problem in the forum so a fellow participant or a Kaggle team member can provide help. The forums are full of useful information on the data, metric, and different approaches. We encourage you to use the forums often.

In laymen terms this means, it either occurred or did not occur. For example, you won or did not win, you passed the test or did not pass the test, you were accepted or not accepted, and you get the point. A common business application is churn or customer retention. Another popular use case is, healthcare\\'s mortality rate or survival analysis. Binary events create an interest\\n\\n=== MARKDOWN 2 ===\\n<a id=\"ch2\"></a>\\n# A Data Science Framework\\n1. **Define the Problem:** If data science, big data, machine learning, predictive analytics, business intelligence, or any other buzzword is the solution, then what is the problem? As the saying goes, don\\'t put the cart before the horse. Problems before requirements, requirements before solutions, solutions before design, and design before technology.

On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the inter\\n\\n=== MARKDOWN 4 ===\\n<a id=\"ch4\"></a>\\n# Step 3: Prepare Data for Consumption\\nSince step 2 was provided to us on a golden plater, so is step 3. Therefore, normal processes in data wrangling, such as data architecture, governance, and extraction are out of scope. Thus, only data cleaning is in scope.\\n\\n## 3.1 Import Libraries\\nThe following code is written in Python 3.x. Libraries provide pre-written functionality to perform necessary tasks. The idea is why write ten lines of code, when you can write one line. \\n\\n=== CODE 5 ===\\n# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\\n\\n#load packages\\nimport sys #access to system parameters https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html\\nprint(\"Python version: {}\". format(sys.version))\\n\\nimport pandas as pd #collection of functions for data processing and analysis modeled after R dataframes with SQL like features\\nprint(\"pandas version: {}\". format(pd.__version__)\\n\\n=== MARKDOWN 6 ===\\n## 3.11 Load Data Modelling Libraries\\n\\nWe will use the popular *scikit-learn* library to develop our machine learning algorithms. In *sklearn,* algorithms are called Estimators and implemented in their own classes. For data visualization, we will use the *matplotlib* and *seaborn* library.

To do so, we will utilise the Seaborn plotting package which allows us to plot heatmaps very conveniently as follows\\n\\n=== CODE 10 ===\\ncolormap = plt.cm.RdBu\\nplt.figure(figsize=(14,12))\\nplt.title(\\'Pearson Correlation of Features\\', y=1.05, size=15)\\nsns.heatmap(train.astype(float).corr(),linewidths=0.1,vmax=1.0, \\n            square=True, cmap=colormap, linecolor=\\'white\\', annot=True)\\n\\n=== MARKDOWN 11 ===\\n**Takeaway from the Plots**\\n\\nOne thing that that the Pearson Correlation plot can tell us is that there are not too many features strongly correlated with one another. This is good from a point of view of feeding these features into your learning model because this means that there isn\\'t much redundant or superfluous data in our training set and we are happy that each feature carries with it some unique information. Here are two most correlated features are that of Family size and Parch (Parents and Children). I\\'ll still leave both features in for the purposes of this exercise.\\n\\n**Pairplots**\\n\\n\\n=== CODE 12 ===\\ng = sns.pairplot(train[[u\\'Survived\\', u\\'Pclass\\', u\\'Sex\\', u\\'Age\\', u\\'Parch\\', u\\'Fare\\', u\\'Embarked\\',\\n       u\\'FamilySize\\', u\\'Title\\']], hue=\\'Survived\\', palette = \\'seismic\\',size=1.2,diag_kind = \\'kde\\',diag_kws=dict(shade=True),plot_kws=dict(s=10) )\\ng.set(xticklabels=[])\\n\\n=== MARKDOWN 13 ===\\n# Ensembling & Stacking models\\n\\nFinally after that brief whirlwind detour with regards to feature engineering and formatting, we finally arrive at the meat and gist of the this notebook.\\n\\nCreating a Stacking ensemble!\\n\\n=== MARKDOWN 14 ===\\n### Helpers via Python Classes\\n\\nHere we invoke the use of Python\\'s classes to help make it more convenient for us. For any newcomers to programming, one normally hears Classes being used in conjunction with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). In short, a class helps to extend some code/program for creating objects (variables for old-school peeps) as well as to implement functions and methods specific to that class.\\n\\nIn the section of code below, we essentially write a class *SklearnHelper* that allows one to extend the inbuilt methods (such as train, predict and fit) common to all the Sklearn c\\n\\n=== CODE 15 ===\\n# Some useful parameters which will come in handy later on\\nntrain = train.shape[0]\\nntest = test.shape[0]\\nSEED = 0 # for reproducibility\\nNFOLDS = 5 # set folds for out-of-fold prediction\\nkf = KFold(ntrain, n_folds= NFOLDS, random_state=SEED)\\n\\n# Class to extend the Sklearn classifier\\nclass SklearnHelper(object):\\n    def __init__(self, clf, seed=0, params=None):\\n        params[\\'random_state\\'] = seed\\n        self.clf = clf(**params)\\n\\n    def train(self, x_train, y_train):\\n        self.clf.fit(x_train, y_train)\\n\\n    def predict(self, x):\\n        return self.clf.predict(x)\\n    \\n    def fit(self,x,y)\\n\\n=== MARKDOWN 16 ===\\nBear with me for those who already know this but for people who have not created classes or objects in Python before, let me explain what the code given above does. In creating my base classifiers, I will only use the models already present in the Sklearn library and therefore only extend the class for that.\\n\\n**def init** : Python standard for invoking the default constructor for the class. This means that when you want to create an object (classifier), you have to give it the parameters of clf (what sklearn classifier you want), seed (random seed) and params (parameters for the classifiers).\\n\\n\\n=== MARKDOWN 17 ===\\n### Out-of-Fold Predictions\\n\\nNow as alluded to above in the introductory section, stacking uses predictions of base classifiers as input for training to a second-level model. However one cannot simply train the base models on the full training data, generate predictions on the full test set and then output these for the second-level training. This runs the risk of your base model predictions already having \"seen\" the test set and therefore overfitting when feeding these predictions.\\n\\n=== CODE 18 ===\\ndef get_oof(clf, x_train, y_train, x_test):\\n    oof_train = np.zeros((ntrain,))\\n    oof_test = np.zeros((ntest,))\\n    oof_test_skf = np.empty((NFOLDS, ntest))\\n\\n    for i, (train_index, test_index) in enumerate(kf):\\n        x_tr = x_train[train_index]\\n        y_tr = y_train[train_index]\\n        x_te = x_train[test_index]\\n\\n        clf.train(x_tr, y_tr)\\n\\n        oof_train[test_index] = clf.predict(x_te)\\n        oof_test_skf[i, :] = clf.predict(x_test)\\n\\n    oof_test[:] = oof_test_skf.mean(axis=0)\\n    return oof_train.reshape(-1, 1), oof_test.reshape(-1, 1)\\n\\n=== MARKDOWN 19 ===\\n# Generating our Base First-Level Models \\n\\nSo now let us prepare five learning models as our first level classification. These models can all be conveniently invoked via the Sklearn library and are listed as follows:\\n\\n 1. Random Forest classifier\\n 2. Extra Trees classifier\\n 3. AdaBoost classifer\\n 4.

If set to -1, all cores are used.\\n\\n**n_estimators** : Number of classification trees in your learning model ( set to 10 per default)\\n\\n**max_depth** : Maximum depth of tree, or how much a node should be expanded. Beware if set to too high  a number would run the risk of overfitting as one would be growing the tree too deep\\n\\n**verbose** : Controls whether you want to output any text during the learning process.

Then check out <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/titanic-tutorial\">Alexis Cook’s Titanic Tutorial</a> that walks you through step by step how to make your first submission!\n\n<iframe width=\"699\" height=\"368\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8yZMXCaFshs\" title=\"YouTube video | How to Get Started with Kaggle’s Titanic Competition | Kaggle\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n## The Challenge\nThe sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.\n\nOn April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.\n\nWhile there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.\n\nIn this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).\n\n> #### Recommended Tutorial\n> We highly recommend [Alexis Cook’s Titanic Tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/titanic-tutorial) that walks you through making your very first submission step by step and [this starter notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/gusthema/titanic-competition-w-tensorflow-decision-forests) to get started.\n\n## How Kaggle’s Competitions Work\n1. **Join the Competition**\nRead about the challenge description, accept the Competition Rules and gain access to the competition dataset.\n1.  **Get to Work**\nDownload the data, build models on it locally or on Kaggle Notebooks (our no-setup, customizable Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs) and generate a prediction file.\n1.  **Make a Submission**\nUpload your prediction as a submission on Kaggle and receive an accuracy score.\n1.  **Check the Leaderboard**\nSee how your model ranks against other Kagglers on our leaderboard. \n1.  **Improve Your Score**\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a> to find lots of tutorials and insights from other competitors.\n\n> #### Kaggle Lingo Video\n> You may run into unfamiliar lingo as you dig into the Kaggle discussion forums and public notebooks. Check out  Dr. Rachael Tatman’s [video on Kaggle Lingo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEJHyuWKd-s) to get up to speed!\n\n## What Data Will I Use in This Competition?\nIn this competition, you’ll gain access to two similar datasets that include passenger information like name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc. One dataset is titled `train.csv` and the other is titled `test.csv`.\n\n`Train.csv` will contain the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 to be exact) and importantly, will reveal whether they survived or not, also known as the “ground truth”.\n\nThe `test.csv` dataset contains similar information but does not disclose the “ground truth” for each passenger. It’s your job to predict these outcomes.\n\nUsing the patterns you find in the `train.csv` data, predict whether the other 418 passengers on board (found in `test.csv`) survived.\n\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data\">“Data” tab</a> to explore the datasets even further. Once you feel you’ve created a competitive model, submit it to Kaggle to see where your model stands on our leaderboard against other Kagglers.\n\n## How to Submit your Prediction to Kaggle\nOnce you’re ready to make a submission and get on the leaderboard:\n\n1. Click on the “Submit Predictions” button\n<img width=\"699\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen1.png\">\n1. Upload a CSV file in the submission file format. You’re able to submit 10 submissions a day.\n<img width=\"699\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen2.png\">\n\n## Submission File Format:\nYou should submit a csv file with exactly 418 entries plus a header row. Your submission will show an error if you have extra columns (beyond `PassengerId` and `Survived`) or rows.\n\nThe file should have exactly 2 columns:\n- `PassengerId` (sorted in any order)\n- `Survived` (contains your binary predictions: 1 for survived, 0 for deceased)\n\n## Got it! I’m ready to get started. Where do I get help if I need it?\n- For Competition Help: <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\">Titanic Discussion Forum</a>\n\nKaggle doesn’t have a dedicated team to help troubleshoot your code so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. The forums are full of useful information on the data, metric, and different approaches. We encourage you to use the forums often. If you share your knowledge, you'll find that others will share a lot in turn!\n\n## A Last Word on Kaggle Notebooks\nAs we mentioned before, Kaggle Notebooks is our no-setup, customizable, Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs and a huge repository of community published data &amp; code.\n\nIn every competition, you’ll find many Notebooks shared with incredible insights. It’s an invaluable resource worth becoming familiar with. Check out this competition’s Notebooks <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/notebooks\">here</a>.\n\n## 🏃‍♀Ready to Compete? <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/account/login?returnUrl=%2Fc%2Ftitanic\">Join the Competition Here!</a>\n\n## Evaluation\n\n<h2>Goal</h2>\n<p>It is your job to predict if a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic or not. <br>For each  in the test set, you must predict a 0 or 1 value for the  variable.</p>\n<h2>Metric</h2>\n<p>Your score is the percentage of passengers you correctly predict.

They are a great place to begin if you are new to data science or just finished a MOOC and want to get involved in Kaggle.</p>\n<p>Getting Started competitions are a non-competitive way to get familiar with Kaggle’s platform, learn basic machine learning concepts, and start meeting people in the community. They have no cash prize and are on a rolling timeline.</p>\n<h2>How do I create and manage a team?</h2>\n<p>When you accept the competition rules, a team will be created for you. You can invite others to your team, accept a merger with another team, and update basic information like team name by going to the More &gt; <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/team\" target=\"_blank\">Team</a> page.</p>\n<p>We've heard from many Kagglers that teaming up is the best way to learn new skills AND have fun. If you don't have a teammate already, consider asking if anyone wants to team up in the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a>.</p>\n<h2>What are Notebooks?</h2>\n<p>Kaggle Notebooks is a cloud computational environment that enables reproducible and collaborative analysis. Notebooks support scripts in Python and R, Jupyter Notebooks, and RMarkdown reports. You can visit the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/notebooks\" target=\"_blank\">Notebooks</a> tab to view all of the publicly shared code for the Titanic competition. For more on how to use Notebooks to learn data science, check out our <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview\" target=\"&quot;_blank\">Courses</a>!</p>\n<h2>Why did my team disappear from the leaderboard?</h2>\n<p>To keep with the spirit of getting-started competitions, we have implemented a two month rolling window on submissions. Once a submission is more than two months old, it will be invalidated and no longer count towards the leaderboard.</p>\n<p>If your team has no submissions in the previous two months, the team will also drop from the leaderboard. This will keep the leaderboard at a manageable size, freshen it up, and prevent newcomers from getting lost in a sea of abandoned scores.</p>\n<p><i>\"I worked so hard to get that score! Give it back!\"</i> Read more about our decision to implement a rolling leaderboard <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion/6240\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n<h2>How do I contact Support?</h2>\n<p>Kaggle does not have a dedicated support team so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. (For this competition, you’ll want to use the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">Titanic discussion forum)</a>.</p>\n<p>Support is only able to help with issues that are being experienced by all participants. Before contacting support, please check the discussion forum for information on your problem. If you can’t find it, you can post your problem in the forum so a fellow participant or a Kaggle team member can provide help.

Most beginners get lost in the field, because they fall into the black box approach, using libraries and algorithms they don't understand. This tutorial will give you a 1-2-year head start over your peers, by providing a framework that teaches you how-to think like a data scientist vs what to think/code. Not only will you be able to submit your first competition, but you’ll be able to solve any problem\n\n=== MARKDOWN 1 ===\n<a id=\"ch1\"></a>\n# How a Data Scientist Beat the Odds\nIt's the classical problem, predict the outcome of a binary event. In laymen terms this means, it either occurred or did not occur. For example, you won or did not win, you passed the test or did not pass the test, you were accepted or not accepted, and you get the point. A common business application is churn or customer retention. Another popular use case is, healthcare's mortality rate or survival analysis. Binary events create an interest\n\n=== MARKDOWN 2 ===\n<a id=\"ch2\"></a>\n# A Data Science Framework\n1. **Define the Problem:** If data science, big data, machine learning, predictive analytics, business intelligence, or any other buzzword is the solution, then what is the problem?

Therefore, normal processes in data wrangling, such as data architecture, governance, and extraction are out of scope. Thus, only data cleaning is in scope.\n\n## 3.1 Import Libraries\nThe following code is written in Python 3.x. Libraries provide pre-written functionality to perform necessary tasks.

Here are two most correlated features are that of Family size and Parch (Parents and Children). I'll still leave both features in for the purposes of this exercise.\n\n**Pairplots**\n\n\n=== CODE 12 ===\ng = sns.pairplot(train[[u'Survived', u'Pclass', u'Sex', u'Age', u'Parch', u'Fare', u'Embarked',\n       u'FamilySize', u'Title']], hue='Survived', palette = 'seismic',size=1.2,diag_kind = 'kde',diag_kws=dict(shade=True),plot_kws=dict(s=10) )\ng.set(xticklabels=[])\n\n=== MARKDOWN 13 ===\n# Ensembling & Stacking models\n\nFinally after that brief whirlwind detour with regards to feature engineering and formatting, we finally arrive at the meat and gist of the this notebook.\n\nCreating a Stacking ensemble!\n\n=== MARKDOWN 14 ===\n### Helpers via Python Classes\n\nHere we invoke the use of Python's classes to help make it more convenient for us. For any newcomers to programming, one normally hears Classes being used in conjunction with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). In short, a class helps to extend some code/program for creating objects (variables for old-school peeps) as well as to implement functions and methods specific to that class.\n\nIn the section of code below, we essentially write a class *SklearnHelper* that allows one to extend the inbuilt methods (such as train, predict and fit) common to all the Sklearn c\n\n=== CODE 15 ===\n# Some useful parameters which will come in handy later on\nntrain = train.shape[0]\nntest = test.shape[0]\nSEED = 0 # for reproducibility\nNFOLDS = 5 # set folds for out-of-fold prediction\nkf = KFold(ntrain, n_folds= NFOLDS, random_state=SEED)\n\n# Class to extend the Sklearn classifier\nclass SklearnHelper(object):\n    def __init__(self, clf, seed=0, params=None):\n        params['random_state'] = seed\n        self.clf = clf(**params)\n\n    def train(self, x_train, y_train):\n        self.clf.fit(x_train, y_train)\n\n    def predict(self, x):\n        return self.clf.predict(x)\n    \n    def fit(self,x,y)\n\n=== MARKDOWN 16 ===\nBear with me for those who already know this but for people who have not created classes or objects in Python before, let me explain what the code given above does. In creating my base classifiers, I will only use the models already present in the Sklearn library and therefore only extend the class for that.\n\n**def init** : Python standard for invoking the default constructor for the class. This means that when you want to create an object (classifier), you have to give it the parameters of clf (what sklearn classifier you want), seed (random seed) and params (parameters for the classifiers).\n\n\n=== MARKDOWN 17 ===\n### Out-of-Fold Predictions\n\nNow as alluded to above in the introductory section, stacking uses predictions of base classifiers as input for training to a second-level model. However one cannot simply train the base models on the full training data, generate predictions on the full test set and then output these for the second-level training. This runs the risk of your base model predictions already having \"seen\" the test set and therefore overfitting when feeding these predictions.\n\n=== CODE 18 ===\ndef get_oof(clf, x_train, y_train, x_test):\n    oof_train = np.zeros((ntrain,))\n    oof_test = np.zeros((ntest,))\n    oof_test_skf = np.empty((NFOLDS, ntest))\n\n    for i, (train_index, test_index) in enumerate(kf):\n        x_tr = x_train[train_index]\n        y_tr = y_train[train_index]\n        x_te = x_train[test_index]\n\n        clf.train(x_tr, y_tr)\n\n        oof_train[test_index] = clf.predict(x_te)\n        oof_test_skf[i, :] = clf.predict(x_test)\n\n    oof_test[:] = oof_test_skf.mean(axis=0)\n    return oof_train.reshape(-1, 1), oof_test.reshape(-1, 1)\n\n=== MARKDOWN 19 ===\n# Generating our Base First-Level Models \n\nSo now let us prepare five learning models as our first level classification. These models can all be conveniently invoked via the Sklearn library and are listed as follows:\n\n 1. Random Forest classifier\n 2. Extra Trees classifier\n 3. AdaBoost classifer\n 4. Gradient Boosting classifer\n 5. Support Vector Machine\n\n=== MARKDOWN 20 ===\n**Parameters**\n\nJust a quick summary of the parameters that we will be listing here for completeness,\n\n**n_jobs** : Number of cores used for the training process. If set to -1, all cores are used.\n\n**n_estimators** : Number of classification trees in your learning model ( set to 10 per default)\n\n**max_depth** : Maximum depth of tree, or how much a node should be expanded. Beware if set to too high  a number would run the risk of overfitting as one would be growing the tree too deep\n\n**verbose** : Controls whether you want to output any text during the learning process. A value of 0 suppresses \n\n=== CODE 21 ===\n# Put in our parameters for said classifiers\n# Random Forest parameters\nrf_params = {\n    'n_jobs': -1,\n    'n_estimators': 500,\n     'warm_start': True, \n     #'max_features': 0.2,\n    'max_depth': 6,\n    'min_samples_leaf': 2,\n    'max_features' : 'sqrt',\n    'verbose': 0\n}\n\n# Extra Trees Parameters\net_params = {\n    'n_jobs': -1,\n    'n_estimators':500,\n    #'max_features': 0.5,\n    'max_depth': 8,\n    'min_samples_leaf': 2,\n    'verbose': 0\n}\n\n# AdaBoost parameters\nada_params = {\n    'n_estimators': 500,\n    'learning_rate' : 0.75\n}\n\n# Gradient Boosting parameters\ngb_params = {\n    'n_esti\n\n=== MARKDOWN 22 ===\nFurthermore, since having mentioned about Objects and classes within the OOP framework, let us now create 5 objects that represent our 5 learning models via our Helper Sklearn Class we defined earlier.\n\n=== CODE 23 ===\n# Create 5 objects that\n...(truncated)...\n\n# Create Numpy arrays of train, test and target ( Survived) dataframes to feed into our models\ny_train = train['Survived'].ravel()\ntrain = train.drop(['Survived'], axis=1)\nx_train = train.values # Creates an array of the train data\nx_test = test.values # Creats an array of the test data\n\n=== MARKDOWN 26 ===\n**Output of the First level Predictions** \n\nWe now feed the training and test data into our 5 base classifiers and use the Out-of-Fold prediction function we defined earlier to generate our first level predictions. Allow a handful of minutes for the chunk of code below to run.\n\n=== CODE 27 ===\n# Create our OOF train and test predictions. These base results will be used as new features\net_oof_train, et_oof_test = get_oof(et, x_train, y_train, x_test) # Extra Trees\nrf_oof_train, rf_oof_test = get_oof(rf,x_train, y_train, x_test) # Random Forest\nada_oof_train, ada_oof_test = get_oof(ada, x_train, y_train, x_test) # AdaBoost \ngb_oof_train, gb_oof_test = get_oof(gb,x_train, y_train, x_test) # Gradient Boost\nsvc_oof_train, svc_oof_test = get_oof(svc,x_train, y_train, x_test) # Support Vector Classifier\n\nprint(\"Training is complete\")\n\n=== MARKDOWN 28 ===\n**Feature importances generated from the different classifiers**\n\nNow having learned our the first-level classifiers, we can utilise a very nifty feature of the Sklearn models and that is to output the importances of the various features in the training and test sets with one very simple line of code.\n\nAs per the Sklearn documentation, most of the classifiers are built in with an attribute which returns feature importances by simply typing in **.feature_importances_**. Therefore we will invoke this very useful attribute via our function earliand plot the feature importances as such\n\n=== CODE 29 ===\nrf_feature = rf.feature_importances(x_train,y_train)\net_feature = et.feature_importances(x_train, y_train)\nada_feature = ada.feature_importances(x_train, y_train)\ngb_feature = gb.feature_importances(x_train,y_train)\n\n=== MARKDOWN 30 ===\nSo I have not yet figured out how to assign and store the feature importances outright.

As per the code below, we are therefore having as our new columns the first-level predictions from our earlier classifiers and we train the next classifier on this.\n\n=== CODE 42 ===\nbase_predictions_train = pd.DataFrame( {'RandomForest': rf_oof_train.ravel(),\n     'ExtraTrees': et_oof_train.ravel(),\n     'AdaBoost': ada_oof_train.ravel(),\n      'GradientBoost': gb_oof_train.ravel()\n    })\nbase_predictions_train.head()\n\n=== MARKDOWN 43 ===\n**Correlation Heatmap of the Second Level Training set**\n\n=== CODE 44 ===\ndata = [\n    go.Heatmap(\n        z= base_predictions_train.astype(float).corr().values ,\n        x=base_predictions_train.columns.values,\n        y= base_predictions_train.columns.values,\n          colorscale='Viridis',\n            showscale=True,\n            reversescale = True\n    )\n]\npy.iplot(data, filename='labelled-heatmap')\n\n=== MARKDOWN 45 ===\nThere have been quite a few articles and Kaggle competition winner stories about the merits of having trained models that are more uncorrelated with one another producing better scores.\n\n=== CODE 46 ===\nx_train = np.concatenate(( et_oof_train, rf_oof_train, ada_oof_train, gb_oof_train, svc_oof_train), axis=1)\nx_test = np.concatenate(( et_oof_test, rf_oof_test, ada_oof_test, gb_oof_test, svc_oof_test), axis=1)\n\n=== MARKDOWN 47 ===\nHaving now concatenated and joined both the first-level train and test predictions as x_train and x_test, we can now fit a second-level learning model.\n\n=== MARKDOWN 48 ===\n### Second level learning model via XGBoost\n\nHere we choose the eXtremely famous library for boosted tree learning model, XGBoost. It was built to optimize large-scale boosted tree algorithms. For further information about the algorithm, check out the [official documentation][1].\n\n  [1]: https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n\nAnyways, we call an XGBClassifier and fit it to the first-level train and target data and use the learned model to predict the test data as follows:\n\n=== CODE 49 ===\ngbm = xgb.XGBClassifier(\n    #learning_rate = 0.02,\n n_estimators= 2000,\n max_depth= 4,\n min_child_weight= 2,\n #gamma=1,\n gamma=0.9,                        \n subsample=0.8,\n colsample_bytree=0.8,\n objective= 'binary:logistic',\n nthread= -1,\n scale_pos_weight=1).fit(x_train, y_train)\npredictions = gbm.predict(x_test)\n\n=== MARKDOWN 50 ===\nJust a quick run down of the XGBoost parameters used in the model:\n\n**max_depth** : How deep you want to grow your tree. Beware if set to too high a number might run the risk of overfitting.\n\n**gamma** : minimum loss reduction required to make a further partition on a leaf node of the tree. The larger, the more conservative the algorithm will be.\n\n**eta** : step size shrinkage used in each boosting step to prevent overfitting\n\n=== MARKDOWN 51 ===\n**Producing the Submission file**\n\nFinally having trained and fit all our first-level and second-level models, we can now output the predictions into the proper format for submission to the Titanic competition as follows:\n\n=== CODE 52 ===\n# Generate Submission File \nStackingSubmission = pd.DataFrame({ 'PassengerId': PassengerId,\n                            'Survived': predictions })\nStackingSubmission.to_csv(\"StackingSubmission.csv\", index=False)\n\n=== MARKDOWN 53 ===\n**Steps for Further Improvement**\n\nAs a closing remark it must be noted that the steps taken above just show a very simple way of producing an ensemble stacker. You hear of ensembles created at the highest level of Kaggle competitions which involves monstrous combinations of stacked classifiers as well as levels of stacking which go to more than 2 levels. \n\nSome additional steps that may be taken to improve one's score could be:\n\n 1. Implementing a good cross-validation strategy in training the models to find optimal parameter values\n 2. Introduce a greater variety of base models for learning.\n\n=== MARKDOWN 54 ===\n### Conclusion\n\nI have this notebook has been helpful somewhat in introducing a working script for stacking learning models.

Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.\\n\\nWhile there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.\\n\\nIn this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).\\n\\n> #### Recommended Tutorial\\n> We highly recommend [Alexis Cook’s Titanic Tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/titanic-tutorial) that walks you through making your very first submission step by step and [this starter notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/gusthema/titanic-competition-w-tensorflow-decision-forests) to get started.\\n\\n## How Kaggle’s Competitions Work\\n1. **Join the Competition**\\nRead about the challenge description, accept the Competition Rules and gain access to the competition dataset.\\n1.  **Get to Work**\\nDownload the data, build models on it locally or on Kaggle Notebooks (our no-setup, customizable Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs) and generate a prediction file.\\n1.  **Make a Submission**\\nUpload your prediction as a submission on Kaggle and receive an accuracy score.\\n1.  **Check the Leaderboard**\\nSee how your model ranks against other Kagglers on our leaderboard. \\n1.  **Improve Your Score**\\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a> to find lots of tutorials and insights from other competitors.\\n\\n> #### Kaggle Lingo Video\\n> You may run into unfamiliar lingo as you dig into the Kaggle discussion forums and public notebooks. Check out  Dr. Rachael Tatman’s [video on Kaggle Lingo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEJHyuWKd-s) to get up to speed!\\n\\n## What Data Will I Use in This Competition?\\nIn this competition, you’ll gain access to two similar datasets that include passenger information like name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc. One dataset is titled `train.csv` and the other is titled `test.csv`.\\n\\n`Train.csv` will contain the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 to be exact) and importantly, will reveal whether they survived or not, also known as the “ground truth”.\\n\\nThe `test.csv` dataset contains similar information but does not disclose the “ground truth” for each passenger. It’s your job to predict these outcomes.\\n\\nUsing the patterns you find in the `train.csv` data, predict whether the other 418 passengers on board (found in `test.csv`) survived.\\n\\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data\">“Data” tab</a> to explore the datasets even further. Once you feel you’ve created a competitive model, submit it to Kaggle to see where your model stands on our leaderboard against other Kagglers.\\n\\n## How to Submit your Prediction to Kaggle\\nOnce you’re ready to make a submission and get on the leaderboard:\\n\\n1. Click on the “Submit Predictions” button\\n<img width=\"699\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen1.png\">\\n1. Upload a CSV file in the submission file format. You’re able to submit 10 submissions a day.\\n<img width=\"699\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen2.png\">\\n\\n## Submission File Format:\\nYou should submit a csv file with exactly 418 entries plus a header row. Your submission will show an error if you have extra columns (beyond `PassengerId` and `Survived`) or rows.\\n\\nThe file should have exactly 2 columns:\\n- `PassengerId` (sorted in any order)\\n- `Survived` (contains your binary predictions: 1 for survived, 0 for deceased)\\n\\n## Got it! I’m ready to get started. Where do I get help if I need it?\\n- For Competition Help: <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\">Titanic Discussion Forum</a>\\n\\nKaggle doesn’t have a dedicated team to help troubleshoot your code so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. The forums are full of useful information on the data, metric, and different approaches. We encourage you to use the forums often. If you share your knowledge, you\\'ll find that others will share a lot in turn!\\n\\n## A Last Word on Kaggle Notebooks\\nAs we mentioned before, Kaggle Notebooks is our no-setup, customizable, Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs and a huge repository of community published data &amp; code.\\n\\nIn every competition, you’ll find many Notebooks shared with incredible insights. It’s an invaluable resource worth becoming familiar with. Check out this competition’s Notebooks <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/notebooks\">here</a>.\\n\\n## 🏃\\u200d♀Ready to Compete? <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/account/login?returnUrl=%2Fc%2Ftitanic\">Join the Competition Here!</a>\\n\\n## Evaluation\\n\\n<h2>Goal</h2>\\n<p>It is your job to predict if a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic or not. <br>For each  in the test set, you must predict a 0 or 1 value for the  variable.</p>\\n<h2>Metric</h2>\\n<p>Your score is the percentage of passengers you correctly predict. This is known as <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision#In_binary_classification\">accuracy</a>.</p>\\n<h2>Submission File Format</h2>\\n<p>You should submit a csv file with exactly 418 entries <b>plus</b> a header row. Your submission will show an error if you have extra columns (beyond PassengerId and Survived) or rows.<br><br>The file should have exactly 2 columns:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>PassengerId (sorted in any order)</li>\\n<li>Survived (contains your binary predictions: 1 for survived, 0 for deceased)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<pre><b>PassengerId,Survived</b><br>892,0<br>893,1<br>894,0<br>Etc.</pre>\\n<p>You can download an example submission file (gender_submission.csv) on the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data\">Data page</a>.</p>\\n\\n## data-description\\n\\n<h3>Overview</h3>\\n<p>The data has been split into two groups:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>training set (train.csv)</li>\\n<li>test set (test.csv)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><b> The training set </b>should be used to build your machine learning models. For the training set, we provide the outcome (also known as the “ground truth”) for each passenger. Your model will be based on “features” like passengers’ gender and class. You can also use <a href=\"https://triangleinequality.wordpress.com/2013/09/08/basic-feature-engineering-with-the-titanic-data/\" target=\"_blank\"> feature engineering </a>to create new features.</p>\\n<p><b>The test set </b>should be used to see how well your model performs on unseen data. For the test set, we do not provide the ground truth for each passenger. It is your job to predict these outcomes. For each passenger in the test set, use the model you trained to predict whether or not they survived the sinking of the Titanic.</p>\\n<p>We also include <b>gender_submission.csv</b>, a set of predictions that assume all and only female passengers survive, as an example of what a submission file should look like.</p>\\n<h3>Data Dictionary</h3>\\n<table style=\"width: 100%;\">\\n<tbody>\\n<tr><th><b>Variable</b></th><th><b>Definition</b></th><th><b>Key</b></th></tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>survival</td>\\n<td>Survival</td>\\n<td>0 = No, 1 = Yes</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>pclass</td>\\n<td>Ticket class</td>\\n<td>1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>sex</td>\\n<td>Sex</td>\\n<td></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Age</td>\\n<td>Age in years</td>\\n<td></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>sibsp</td>\\n<td># of siblings / spouses aboard the Titanic</td>\\n<td></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>parch</td>\\n<td># of parents / children aboard the Titanic</td>\\n<td></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>ticket</td>\\n<td>Ticket number</td>\\n<td></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>fare</td>\\n<td>Passenger fare</td>\\n<td></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>cabin</td>\\n<td>Cabin number</td>\\n<td></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>embarked</td>\\n<td>Port of Embarkation</td>\\n<td>C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton</td>\\n</tr>\\n</tbody>\\n</table>\\n<h3>Variable Notes</h3>\\n<p><b>pclass</b>: A proxy for socio-economic status (SES)<br /> 1st = Upper<br /> 2nd = Middle<br /> 3rd = Lower<br /><br /> <b>age</b>: Age is fractional if less than 1.

They are a great place to begin if you are new to data science or just finished a MOOC and want to get involved in Kaggle.</p>\\n<p>Getting Started competitions are a non-competitive way to get familiar with Kaggle’s platform, learn basic machine learning concepts, and start meeting people in the community. They have no cash prize and are on a rolling timeline.</p>\\n<h2>How do I create and manage a team?</h2>\\n<p>When you accept the competition rules, a team will be created for you. You can invite others to your team, accept a merger with another team, and update basic information like team name by going to the More &gt; <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/team\" target=\"_blank\">Team</a> page.</p>\\n<p>We\\'ve heard from many Kagglers that teaming up is the best way to learn new skills AND have fun. If you don\\'t have a teammate already, consider asking if anyone wants to team up in the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a>.</p>\\n<h2>What are Notebooks?</h2>\\n<p>Kaggle Notebooks is a cloud computational environment that enables reproducible and collaborative analysis. Notebooks support scripts in Python and R, Jupyter Notebooks, and RMarkdown reports. You can visit the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/notebooks\" target=\"_blank\">Notebooks</a> tab to view all of the publicly shared code for the Titanic competition. For more on how to use Notebooks to learn data science, check out our <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview\" target=\"&quot;_blank\">Courses</a>!</p>\\n<h2>Why did my team disappear from the leaderboard?</h2>\\n<p>To keep with the spirit of getting-started competitions, we have implemented a two month rolling window on submissions. Once a submission is more than two months old, it will be invalidated and no longer count towards the leaderboard.</p>\\n<p>If your team has no submissions in the previous two months, the team will also drop from the leaderboard. This will keep the leaderboard at a manageable size, freshen it up, and prevent newcomers from getting lost in a sea of abandoned scores.</p>\\n<p><i>\"I worked so hard to get that score! Give it back!\"</i> Read more about our decision to implement a rolling leaderboard <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion/6240\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\\n<h2>How do I contact Support?</h2>\\n<p>Kaggle does not have a dedicated support team so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. (For this competition, you’ll want to use the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">Titanic discussion forum)</a>.</p>\\n<p>Support is only able to help with issues that are being experienced by all participants. Before contacting support, please check the discussion forum for information on your problem. If you can’t find it, you can post your problem in the forum so a fellow participant or a Kaggle team member can provide help.

This is good from a point of view of feeding these features into your learning model because this means that there isn\\'t much redundant or superfluous data in our training set and we are happy that each feature carries with it some unique information. Here are two most correlated features are that of Family size and Parch (Parents and Children).

For any newcomers to programming, one normally hears Classes being used in conjunction with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). In short, a class helps to extend some code/program for creating objects (variables for old-school peeps) as well as to implement functions and methods specific to that class.\\n\\nIn the section of code below, we essentially write a class *SklearnHelper* that allows one to extend the inbuilt methods (such as train, predict and fit) common to all the Sklearn c\\n\\n=== CODE 15 ===\\n# Some useful parameters which will come in handy later on\\nntrain = train.shape[0]\\nntest = test.shape[0]\\nSEED = 0 # for reproducibility\\nNFOLDS = 5 # set folds for out-of-fold prediction\\nkf = KFold(ntrain, n_folds= NFOLDS, random_state=SEED)\\n\\n# Class to extend the Sklearn classifier\\nclass SklearnHelper(object):\\n    def __init__(self, clf, seed=0, params=None):\\n        params[\\'random_state\\'] = seed\\n        self.clf = clf(**params)\\n\\n    def train(self, x_train, y_train):\\n        self.clf.fit(x_train, y_train)\\n\\n    def predict(self, x):\\n        return self.clf.predict(x)\\n    \\n    def fit(self,x,y)\\n\\n=== MARKDOWN 16 ===\\nBear with me for those who already know this but for people who have not created classes or objects in Python before, let me explain what the code given above does. In creating my base classifiers, I will only use the models already present in the Sklearn library and therefore only extend the class for that.\\n\\n**def init** : Python standard for invoking the default constructor for the class. This means that when you want to create an object (classifier), you have to give it the parameters of clf (what sklearn classifier you want), seed (random seed) and params (parameters for the classifiers).\\n\\n\\n=== MARKDOWN 17 ===\\n### Out-of-Fold Predictions\\n\\nNow as alluded to above in the introductory section, stacking uses predictions of base classifiers as input for training to a second-level model. However one cannot simply train the base models on the full training data, generate predictions on the full test set and then output these for the second-level training. This runs the risk of your base model predictions already having \"seen\" the test set and therefore overfitting when feeding these predictions.\\n\\n=== CODE 18 ===\\ndef get_oof(clf, x_train, y_train, x_test):\\n    oof_train = np.zeros((ntrain,))\\n    oof_test = np.zeros((ntest,))\\n    oof_test_skf = np.empty((NFOLDS, ntest))\\n\\n    for i, (train_index, test_index) in enumerate(kf):\\n        x_tr = x_train[train_index]\\n        y_tr = y_train[train_index]\\n        x_te = x_train[test_index]\\n\\n        clf.train(x_tr, y_tr)\\n\\n        oof_train[test_index] = clf.predict(x_te)\\n        oof_test_skf[i, :] = clf.predict(x_test)\\n\\n    oof_test[:] = oof_test_skf.mean(axis=0)\\n    return oof_train.reshape(-1, 1), oof_test.reshape(-1, 1)\\n\\n=== MARKDOWN 19 ===\\n# Generating our Base First-Level Models \\n\\nSo now let us prepare five learning models as our first level classification.

It was built to optimize large-scale boosted tree algorithms. For further information about the algorithm, check out the [official documentation][1].\\n\\n  [1]: https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\\n\\nAnyways, we call an XGBClassifier and fit it to the first-level train and target data and use the learned model to predict the test data as follows:\\n\\n=== CODE 49 ===\\ngbm = xgb.XGBClassifier(\\n    #learning_rate = 0.02,\\n n_estimators= 2000,\\n max_depth= 4,\\n min_child_weight= 2,\\n #gamma=1,\\n gamma=0.9,                        \\n subsample=0.8,\\n colsample_bytree=0.8,\\n objective= \\'binary:logistic\\',\\n nthread= -1,\\n scale_pos_weight=1).fit(x_train, y_train)\\npredictions = gbm.predict(x_test)\\n\\n=== MARKDOWN 50 ===\\nJust a quick run down of the XGBoost parameters used in the model:\\n\\n**max_depth** : How deep you want to grow your tree. Beware if set to too high a number might run the risk of overfitting.\\n\\n**gamma** : minimum loss reduction required to make a further partition on a leaf node of the tree. The larger, the more conservative the algorithm will be.\\n\\n**eta** : step size shrinkage used in each boosting step to prevent overfitting\\n\\n=== MARKDOWN 51 ===\\n**Producing the Submission file**\\n\\nFinally having trained and fit all our first-level and second-level models, we can now output the predictions into the proper format for submission to the Titanic competition as follows:\\n\\n=== CODE 52 ===\\n# Generate Submission File \\nStackingSubmission = pd.DataFrame({ \\'PassengerId\\': PassengerId,\\n                            \\'Survived\\': predictions })\\nStackingSubmission.to_csv(\"StackingSubmission.csv\", index=False)\\n\\n=== MARKDOWN 53 ===\\n**Steps for Further Improvement**\\n\\nAs a closing remark it must be noted that the steps taken above just show a very simple way of producing an ensemble stacker. You hear of ensembles created at the highest level of Kaggle competitions which involves monstrous combinations of stacked classifiers as well as levels of stacking which go to more than 2 levels. \\n\\nSome additional steps that may be taken to improve one\\'s score could be:\\n\\n 1. Implementing a good cross-validation strategy in training the models to find optimal parameter values\\n 2. Introduce a greater variety of base models for learning.\\n\\n=== MARKDOWN 54 ===\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nI have this notebook has been helpful somewhat in introducing a working script for stacking learning models.

Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.\n\nWhile there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.\n\nIn this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).\n\n> #### Recommended Tutorial\n> We highly recommend [Alexis Cook’s Titanic Tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/titanic-tutorial) that walks you through making your very first submission step by step and [this starter notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/gusthema/titanic-competition-w-tensorflow-decision-forests) to get started.\n\n## How Kaggle’s Competitions Work\n1. **Join the Competition**\nRead about the challenge description, accept the Competition Rules and gain access to the competition dataset.\n1.  **Get to Work**\nDownload the data, build models on it locally or on Kaggle Notebooks (our no-setup, customizable Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs) and generate a prediction file.\n1.  **Make a Submission**\nUpload your prediction as a submission on Kaggle and receive an accuracy score.\n1.  **Check the Leaderboard**\nSee how your model ranks against other Kagglers on our leaderboard. \n1.  **Improve Your Score**\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a> to find lots of tutorials and insights from other competitors.\n\n> #### Kaggle Lingo Video\n> You may run into unfamiliar lingo as you dig into the Kaggle discussion forums and public notebooks. Check out  Dr. Rachael Tatman’s [video on Kaggle Lingo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEJHyuWKd-s) to get up to speed!\n\n## What Data Will I Use in This Competition?\nIn this competition, you’ll gain access to two similar datasets that include passenger information like name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc. One dataset is titled `train.csv` and the other is titled `test.csv`.\n\n`Train.csv` will contain the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 to be exact) and importantly, will reveal whether they survived or not, also known as the “ground truth”.\n\nThe `test.csv` dataset contains similar information but does not disclose the “ground truth” for each passenger. It’s your job to predict these outcomes.\n\nUsing the patterns you find in the `train.csv` data, predict whether the other 418 passengers on board (found in `test.csv`) survived.\n\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data\">“Data” tab</a> to explore the datasets even further. Once you feel you’ve created a competitive model, submit it to Kaggle to see where your model stands on our leaderboard against other Kagglers.\n\n## How to Submit your Prediction to Kaggle\nOnce you’re ready to make a submission and get on the leaderboard:\n\n1. Click on the “Submit Predictions” button\n<img width=\"699\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen1.png\">\n1. Upload a CSV file in the submission file format. You’re able to submit 10 submissions a day.\n<img width=\"699\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen2.png\">\n\n## Submission File Format:\nYou should submit a csv file with exactly 418 entries plus a header row. Your submission will show an error if you have extra columns (beyond `PassengerId` and `Survived`) or rows.\n\nThe file should have exactly 2 columns:\n- `PassengerId` (sorted in any order)\n- `Survived` (contains your binary predictions: 1 for survived, 0 for deceased)\n\n## Got it! I’m ready to get started. Where do I get help if I need it?\n- For Competition Help: <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\">Titanic Discussion Forum</a>\n\nKaggle doesn’t have a dedicated team to help troubleshoot your code so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. The forums are full of useful information on the data, metric, and different approaches. We encourage you to use the forums often. If you share your knowledge, you'll find that others will share a lot in turn!\n\n## A Last Word on Kaggle Notebooks\nAs we mentioned before, Kaggle Notebooks is our no-setup, customizable, Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs and a huge repository of community published data &amp; code.\n\nIn every competition, you’ll find many Notebooks shared with incredible insights. It’s an invaluable resource worth becoming familiar with.

Most beginners get lost in the field, because they fall into the black box approach, using libraries and algorithms they don't understand. This tutorial will give you a 1-2-year head start over your peers, by providing a framework that teaches you how-to think like a data scientist vs what to think/code.

In laymen terms this means, it either occurred or did not occur. For example, you won or did not win, you passed the test or did not pass the test, you were accepted or not accepted, and you get the point. A common business application is churn or customer retention. Another popular use case is, healthcare's mortality rate or survival analysis.

In a nutshell stacking uses as a first-level (base), the predictions of a few basic classifiers and then uses another model at the second-level to predict the output from the earlier first-level predictions.\n\nThe Titanic dataset is a prime candidate for introducing this concept as many newcomers to Kaggle start out here. Furthermore even though stacking has been responsible for many a team winning K\n\n=== CODE 1 ===\n# Load in our libraries\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport re\nimport sklearn\nimport xgboost as xgb\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline\n\nimport plotly.offline as py\npy.init_notebook_mode(connected=True)\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\nimport plotly.tools as tls\n\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\n\n# Going to use these 5 base models for the stacking\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import (RandomForestClassifier, AdaBoostClassifier, \n                              GradientBoostingClassifier, ExtraTreesClassifier)\nfrom sklearn.svm import SVC\nfrom \n\n=== MARKDOWN 2 ===\n# Feature Exploration, Engineering and Cleaning \n\nNow we will proceed much like how most kernels in general are structured, and that is to first explore the data on hand, identify possible feature engineering opportunities as well as numerically encode any categorical features.\n\n=== CODE 3 ===\n# Load in the train and test datasets\ntrain = pd.read_csv('../input/train.csv')\ntest = pd.read_csv('../input/test.csv')\n\n# Store our passenger ID for easy access\nPassengerId = test['PassengerId']\n\ntrain.head(3)\n\n=== MARKDOWN 4 ===\nWell it is no surprise that our task is to somehow extract the information out of the categorical variables \n\n**Feature Engineering**\n\nHere, credit must be extended to Sina's very comprehensive and well-thought out notebook for the feature engineering ideas so please check out his work \n\n[Titanic Best Working Classfier][1] : by Sina\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.kaggle.com/sinakhorami/titanic/titanic-best-working-classifier\n\n=== CODE 5 ===\nfull_data = [train, test]\n\n# Some features of my own that I have added in\n# Gives the length of the name\ntrain['Name_length'] = train['Name'].apply(len)\ntest['Name_length'] = test['Name'].apply(len)\n# Feature that tells whether a passenger had a cabin on the Titanic\ntrain['Has_Cabin'] = train[\"Cabin\"].apply(lambda x: 0 if type(x) == float else 1)\ntest['Has_Cabin'] = test[\"Cabin\"].apply(lambda x: 0 if type(x) == float else 1)\n\n# Feature engineering steps taken from Sina\n# Create new feature FamilySize as a combination of SibSp and Parch\nfor dataset in full_data:\n    dataset['FamilySize'] = data\n\n=== CODE 6 ===\n# Feature selection\ndrop_elements = ['PassengerId', 'Name', 'Ticket', 'Cabin', 'SibSp']\ntrain = train.drop(drop_elements, axis = 1)\ntrain = train.drop(['CategoricalAge', 'CategoricalFare'], axis = 1)\ntest  = test.drop(drop_elements, axis = 1)\n\n=== MARKDOWN 7 ===\nAll right so now having cleaned the features and extracted relevant information and dropped the categorical columns our features should now all be numeric, a format suitable to feed into our Machine Learning models.

This is good from a point of view of feeding these features into your learning model because this means that there isn't much redundant or superfluous data in our training set and we are happy that each feature carries with it some unique information. Here are two most correlated features are that of Family size and Parch (Parents and Children). I'll still leave both features in for the purposes of this exercise.\n\n**Pairplots**\n\n\n=== CODE 12 ===\ng = sns.pairplot(train[[u'Survived', u'Pclass', u'Sex', u'Age', u'Parch', u'Fare', u'Embarked',\n       u'FamilySize', u'Title']], hue='Survived', palette = 'seismic',size=1.2,diag_kind = 'kde',diag_kws=dict(shade=True),plot_kws=dict(s=10) )\ng.set(xticklabels=[])\n\n=== MARKDOWN 13 ===\n# Ensembling & Stacking models\n\nFinally after that brief whirlwind detour with regards to feature engineering and formatting, we finally arrive at the meat and gist of the this notebook.\n\nCreating a Stacking ensemble!\n\n=== MARKDOWN 14 ===\n### Helpers via Python Classes\n\nHere we invoke the use of Python's classes to help make it more convenient for us. For any newcomers to programming, one normally hears Classes being used in conjunction with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). In short, a class helps to extend some code/program for creating objects (variables for old-school peeps) as well as to implement functions and methods specific to that class.\n\nIn the section of code below, we essentially write a class *SklearnHelper* that allows one to extend the inbuilt methods (such as train, predict and fit) common to all the Sklearn c\n\n=== CODE 15 ===\n# Some useful parameters which will come in handy later on\nntrain = train.shape[0]\nntest = test.shape[0]\nSEED = 0 # for reproducibility\nNFOLDS = 5 # set folds for out-of-fold prediction\nkf = KFold(ntrain, n_folds= NFOLDS, random_state=SEED)\n\n# Class to extend the Sklearn classifier\nclass SklearnHelper(object):\n    def __init__(self, clf, seed=0, params=None):\n        params['random_state'] = seed\n        self.clf = clf(**params)\n\n    def train(self, x_train, y_train):\n        self.clf.fit(x_train, y_train)\n\n    def predict(self, x):\n        return self.clf.predict(x)\n    \n    def fit(self,x,y)\n\n=== MARKDOWN 16 ===\nBear with me for those who already know this but for people who have not created classes or objects in Python before, let me explain what the code given above does. In creating my base classifiers, I will only use the models already present in the Sklearn library and therefore only extend the class for that.\n\n**def init** : Python standard for invoking the default constructor for the class. This means that when you want to create an object (classifier), you have to give it the parameters of clf (what sklearn classifier you want), seed (random seed) and params (parameters for the classifiers).\n\n\n=== MARKDOWN 17 ===\n### Out-of-Fold Predictions\n\nNow as alluded to above in the introductory section, stacking uses predictions of base classifiers as input for training to a second-level model. However one cannot simply train the base models on the full training data, generate predictions on the full test set and then output these for the second-level training. This runs the risk of your base model predictions already having \"seen\" the test set and therefore overfitting when feeding these predictions.\n\n=== CODE 18 ===\ndef get_oof(clf, x_train, y_train, x_test):\n    oof_train = np.zeros((ntrain,))\n    oof_test = np.zeros((ntest,))\n    oof_test_skf = np.empty((NFOLDS, ntest))\n\n    for i, (train_index, test_index) in enumerate(kf):\n        x_tr = x_train[train_index]\n        y_tr = y_train[train_index]\n        x_te = x_train[test_index]\n\n        clf.train(x_tr, y_tr)\n\n        oof_train[test_index] = clf.predict(x_te)\n        oof_test_skf[i, :] = clf.predict(x_test)\n\n    oof_test[:] = oof_test_skf.mean(axis=0)\n    return oof_train.reshape(-1, 1), oof_test.reshape(-1, 1)\n\n=== MARKDOWN 19 ===\n# Generating our Base First-Level Models \n\nSo now let us prepare five learning models as our first level classification.

As per the code below, we are therefore having as our new columns the first-level predictions from our earlier classifiers and we train the next classifier on this.\n\n=== CODE 42 ===\nbase_predictions_train = pd.DataFrame( {'RandomForest': rf_oof_train.ravel(),\n     'ExtraTrees': et_oof_train.ravel(),\n     'AdaBoost': ada_oof_train.ravel(),\n      'GradientBoost': gb_oof_train.ravel()\n    })\nbase_predictions_train.head()\n\n=== MARKDOWN 43 ===\n**Correlation Heatmap of the Second Level Training set**\n\n=== CODE 44 ===\ndata = [\n    go.Heatmap(\n        z= base_predictions_train.astype(float).corr().values ,\n        x=base_predictions_train.columns.values,\n        y= base_predictions_train.columns.values,\n          colorscale='Viridis',\n            showscale=True,\n            reversescale = True\n    )\n]\npy.iplot(data, filename='labelled-heatmap')\n\n=== MARKDOWN 45 ===\nThere have been quite a few articles and Kaggle competition winner stories about the merits of having trained models that are more uncorrelated with one another producing better scores.\n\n=== CODE 46 ===\nx_train = np.concatenate(( et_oof_train, rf_oof_train, ada_oof_train, gb_oof_train, svc_oof_train), axis=1)\nx_test = np.concatenate(( et_oof_test, rf_oof_test, ada_oof_test, gb_oof_test, svc_oof_test), axis=1)\n\n=== MARKDOWN 47 ===\nHaving now concatenated and joined both the first-level train and test predictions as x_train and x_test, we can now fit a second-level learning model.\n\n=== MARKDOWN 48 ===\n### Second level learning model via XGBoost\n\nHere we choose the eXtremely famous library for boosted tree learning model, XGBoost. It was built to optimize large-scale boosted tree algorithms. For further information about the algorithm, check out the [official documentation][1].\n\n  [1]: https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n\nAnyways, we call an XGBClassifier and fit it to the first-level train and target data and use the learned model to predict the test data as follows:\n\n=== CODE 49 ===\ngbm = xgb.XGBClassifier(\n    #learning_rate = 0.02,\n n_estimators= 2000,\n max_depth= 4,\n min_child_weight= 2,\n #gamma=1,\n gamma=0.9,                        \n subsample=0.8,\n colsample_bytree=0.8,\n objective= 'binary:logistic',\n nthread= -1,\n scale_pos_weight=1).fit(x_train, y_train)\npredictions = gbm.predict(x_test)\n\n=== MARKDOWN 50 ===\nJust a quick run down of the XGBoost parameters used in the model:\n\n**max_depth** : How deep you want to grow your tree. Beware if set to too high a number might run the risk of overfitting.\n\n**gamma** : minimum loss reduction required to make a further partition on a leaf node of the tree. The larger, the more conservative the algorithm will be.\n\n**eta** : step size shrinkage used in each boosting step to prevent overfitting\n\n=== MARKDOWN 51 ===\n**Producing the Submission file**\n\nFinally having trained and fit all our first-level and second-level models, we can now output the predictions into the proper format for submission to the Titanic competition as follows:\n\n=== CODE 52 ===\n# Generate Submission File \nStackingSubmission = pd.DataFrame({ 'PassengerId': PassengerId,\n                            'Survived': predictions })\nStackingSubmission.to_csv(\"StackingSubmission.csv\", index=False)\n\n=== MARKDOWN 53 ===\n**Steps for Further Improvement**\n\nAs a closing remark it must be noted that the steps taken above just show a very simple way of producing an ensemble stacker. You hear of ensembles created at the highest level of Kaggle competitions which involves monstrous combinations of stacked classifiers as well as levels of stacking which go to more than 2 levels. \n\nSome additional steps that may be taken to improve one's score could be:\n\n 1. Implementing a good cross-validation strategy in training the models to find optimal parameter values\n 2. Introduce a greater variety of base models for learning.\n\n=== MARKDOWN 54 ===\n### Conclusion\n\nI have this notebook has been helpful somewhat in introducing a working script for stacking learning models.

Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.\\n\\nWhile there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.\\n\\nIn this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).\\n\\n> #### Recommended Tutorial\\n> We highly recommend [Alexis Cook’s Titanic Tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/titanic-tutorial) that walks you through making your very first submission step by step and [this starter notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/gusthema/titanic-competition-w-tensorflow-decision-forests) to get started.\\n\\n## How Kaggle’s Competitions Work\\n1. **Join the Competition**\\nRead about the challenge description, accept the Competition Rules and gain access to the competition dataset.\\n1.  **Get to Work**\\nDownload the data, build models on it locally or on Kaggle Notebooks (our no-setup, customizable Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs) and generate a prediction file.\\n1.  **Make a Submission**\\nUpload your prediction as a submission on Kaggle and receive an accuracy score.\\n1.  **Check the Leaderboard**\\nSee how your model ranks against other Kagglers on our leaderboard. \\n1.  **Improve Your Score**\\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a> to find lots of tutorials and insights from other competitors.\\n\\n> #### Kaggle Lingo Video\\n> You may run into unfamiliar lingo as you dig into the Kaggle discussion forums and public notebooks. Check out  Dr. Rachael Tatman’s [video on Kaggle Lingo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEJHyuWKd-s) to get up to speed!\\n\\n## What Data Will I Use in This Competition?\\nIn this competition, you’ll gain access to two similar datasets that include passenger information like name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc. One dataset is titled `train.csv` and the other is titled `test.csv`.\\n\\n`Train.csv` will contain the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 to be exact) and importantly, will reveal whether they survived or not, also known as the “ground truth”.\\n\\nThe `test.csv` dataset contains similar information but does not disclose the “ground truth” for each passenger. It’s your job to predict these outcomes.\\n\\nUsing the patterns you find in the `train.csv` data, predict whether the other 418 passengers on board (found in `test.csv`) survived.\\n\\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data\">“Data” tab</a> to explore the datasets even further. Once you feel you’ve created a competitive model, submit it to Kaggle to see where your model stands on our leaderboard against other Kagglers.\\n\\n## How to Submit your Prediction to Kaggle\\nOnce you’re ready to make a submission and get on the leaderboard:\\n\\n1. Click on the “Submit Predictions” button\\n<img width=\"699\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen1.png\">\\n1. Upload a CSV file in the submission file format. You’re able to submit 10 submissions a day.\\n<img width=\"699\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen2.png\">\\n\\n## Submission File Format:\\nYou should submit a csv file with exactly 418 entries plus a header row. Your submission will show an error if you have extra columns (beyond `PassengerId` and `Survived`) or rows.\\n\\nThe file should have exactly 2 columns:\\n- `PassengerId` (sorted in any order)\\n- `Survived` (contains your binary predictions: 1 for survived, 0 for deceased)\\n\\n## Got it! I’m ready to get started. Where do I get help if I need it?\\n- For Competition Help: <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\">Titanic Discussion Forum</a>\\n\\nKaggle doesn’t have a dedicated team to help troubleshoot your code so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. The forums are full of useful information on the data, metric, and different approaches. We encourage you to use the forums often. If you share your knowledge, you\\'ll find that others will share a lot in turn!\\n\\n## A Last Word on Kaggle Notebooks\\nAs we mentioned before, Kaggle Notebooks is our no-setup, customizable, Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs and a huge repository of community published data &amp; code.\\n\\nIn every competition, you’ll find many Notebooks shared with incredible insights. It’s an invaluable resource worth becoming familiar with.

They are a great place to begin if you are new to data science or just finished a MOOC and want to get involved in Kaggle.</p>\\n<p>Getting Started competitions are a non-competitive way to get familiar with Kaggle’s platform, learn basic machine learning concepts, and start meeting people in the community. They have no cash prize and are on a rolling timeline.</p>\\n<h2>How do I create and manage a team?</h2>\\n<p>When you accept the competition rules, a team will be created for you. You can invite others to your team, accept a merger with another team, and update basic information like team name by going to the More &gt; <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/team\" target=\"_blank\">Team</a> page.</p>\\n<p>We\\'ve heard from many Kagglers that teaming up is the best way to learn new skills AND have fun. If you don\\'t have a teammate already, consider asking if anyone wants to team up in the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a>.</p>\\n<h2>What are Notebooks?</h2>\\n<p>Kaggle Notebooks is a cloud computational environment that enables reproducible and collaborative analysis. Notebooks support scripts in Python and R, Jupyter Notebooks, and RMarkdown reports. You can visit the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/notebooks\" target=\"_blank\">Notebooks</a> tab to view all of the publicly shared code for the Titanic competition. For more on how to use Notebooks to learn data science, check out our <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview\" target=\"&quot;_blank\">Courses</a>!</p>\\n<h2>Why did my team disappear from the leaderboard?</h2>\\n<p>To keep with the spirit of getting-started competitions, we have implemented a two month rolling window on submissions. Once a submission is more than two months old, it will be invalidated and no longer count towards the leaderboard.</p>\\n<p>If your team has no submissions in the previous two months, the team will also drop from the leaderboard. This will keep the leaderboard at a manageable size, freshen it up, and prevent newcomers from getting lost in a sea of abandoned scores.</p>\\n<p><i>\"I worked so hard to get that score! Give it back!\"</i> Read more about our decision to implement a rolling leaderboard <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion/6240\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\\n<h2>How do I contact Support?</h2>\\n<p>Kaggle does not have a dedicated support team so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. (For this competition, you’ll want to use the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">Titanic discussion forum)</a>.</p>\\n<p>Support is only able to help with issues that are being experienced by all participants. Before contacting support, please check the discussion forum for information on your problem. If you can’t find it, you can post your problem in the forum so a fellow participant or a Kaggle team member can provide help. The forums are full of useful information on the data, metric, and different approaches. We encourage you to use the forums often. If you share your knowledge, you\\'ll find that others will share a lot in turn!</p>\\n<p>If your problem persists or it seems to be effective all participants then please <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/contact\" target=\"_blank\">contact us</a>.</p>'}, {'role': 'tool', 'content': 'Not a directory: /home/code/exploration/../research/writeups'}, {'role': 'tool', 'content': '/home/code/exploration/../research/kernels:\\n[DIR]  alexisbcook_exercise-arithmetic-and-variables/\\n[DIR]  alexisbcook_titanic-tutorial/\\n[DIR]  arthurtok_introduction-to-ensembling-stacking-in-python/\\n[DIR]  ldfreeman3_a-data-science-framework-to-achieve-99-accuracy/\\n[FILE] metadata.json (1.7KB)\\n[DIR]  startupsci_titanic-data-science-solutions/'}, {'role': 'tool', 'content': '/home/data:\\n[FILE] description.md (13.6KB)\\n[FILE] gender_submission.csv (3.2KB)\\n[FILE] test.csv (28.0KB)\\n[FILE] train.csv (59.8KB)'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': \"REASONING: Good, I can see this is the classic Titanic survival prediction problem - binary classification with accuracy as the metric.

In a nutshell stacking uses as a first-level (base), the predictions of a few basic classifiers and then uses another model at the second-level to predict the output from the earlier first-level predictions.\\n\\nThe Titanic dataset is a prime candidate for introducing this concept as many newcomers to Kaggle start out here.

This is good from a point of view of feeding these features into your learning model because this means that there isn\\'t much redundant or superfluous data in our training set and we are happy that each feature carries with it some unique information. Here are two most correlated features are that of Family size and Parch (Parents and Children).

For any newcomers to programming, one normally hears Classes being used in conjunction with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). In short, a class helps to extend some code/program for creating objects (variables for old-school peeps) as well as to implement functions and methods specific to that class.\\n\\nIn the section of code below, we essentially write a class *SklearnHelper* that allows one to extend the inbuilt methods (such as train, predict and fit) common to all the Sklearn c\\n\\n=== CODE 15 ===\\n# Some useful parameters which will come in handy later on\\nntrain = train.shape[0]\\nntest = test.shape[0]\\nSEED = 0 # for reproducibility\\nNFOLDS = 5 # set folds for out-of-fold prediction\\nkf = KFold(ntrain, n_folds= NFOLDS, random_state=SEED)\\n\\n# Class to extend the Sklearn classifier\\nclass SklearnHelper(object):\\n    def __init__(self, clf, seed=0, params=None):\\n        params[\\'random_state\\'] = seed\\n        self.clf = clf(**params)\\n\\n    def train(self, x_train, y_train):\\n        self.clf.fit(x_train, y_train)\\n\\n    def predict(self, x):\\n        return self.clf.predict(x)\\n    \\n    def fit(self,x,y)\\n\\n=== MARKDOWN 16 ===\\nBear with me for those who already know this but for people who have not created classes or objects in Python before, let me explain what the code given above does. In creating my base classifiers, I will only use the models already present in the Sklearn library and therefore only extend the class for that.\\n\\n**def init** : Python standard for invoking the default constructor for the class. This means that when you want to create an object (classifier), you have to give it the parameters of clf (what sklearn classifier you want), seed (random seed) and params (parameters for the classifiers).\\n\\n\\n=== MARKDOWN 17 ===\\n### Out-of-Fold Predictions\\n\\nNow as alluded to above in the introductory section, stacking uses predictions of base classifiers as input for training to a second-level model. However one cannot simply train the base models on the full training data, generate predictions on the full test set and then output these for the second-level training. This runs the risk of your base model predictions already having \"seen\" the test set and therefore overfitting when feeding these predictions.\\n\\n=== CODE 18 ===\\ndef get_oof(clf, x_train, y_train, x_test):\\n    oof_train = np.zeros((ntrain,))\\n    oof_test = np.zeros((ntest,))\\n    oof_test_skf = np.empty((NFOLDS, ntest))\\n\\n    for i, (train_index, test_index) in enumerate(kf):\\n        x_tr = x_train[train_index]\\n        y_tr = y_train[train_index]\\n        x_te = x_train[test_index]\\n\\n        clf.train(x_tr, y_tr)\\n\\n        oof_train[test_index] = clf.predict(x_te)\\n        oof_test_skf[i, :] = clf.predict(x_test)\\n\\n    oof_test[:] = oof_test_skf.mean(axis=0)\\n    return oof_train.reshape(-1, 1), oof_test.reshape(-1, 1)\\n\\n=== MARKDOWN 19 ===\\n# Generating our Base First-Level Models \\n\\nSo now let us prepare five learning models as our first level classification.

It was built to optimize large-scale boosted tree algorithms. For further information about the algorithm, check out the [official documentation][1].\\n\\n  [1]: https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\\n\\nAnyways, we call an XGBClassifier and fit it to the first-level train and target data and use the learned model to predict the test data as follows:\\n\\n=== CODE 49 ===\\ngbm = xgb.XGBClassifier(\\n    #learning_rate = 0.02,\\n n_estimators= 2000,\\n max_depth= 4,\\n min_child_weight= 2,\\n #gamma=1,\\n gamma=0.9,                        \\n subsample=0.8,\\n colsample_bytree=0.8,\\n objective= \\'binary:logistic\\',\\n nthread= -1,\\n scale_pos_weight=1).fit(x_train, y_train)\\npredictions = gbm.predict(x_test)\\n\\n=== MARKDOWN 50 ===\\nJust a quick run down of the XGBoost parameters used in the model:\\n\\n**max_depth** : How deep you want to grow your tree. Beware if set to too high a number might run the risk of overfitting.\\n\\n**gamma** : minimum loss reduction required to make a further partition on a leaf node of the tree. The larger, the more conservative the algorithm will be.\\n\\n**eta** : step size shrinkage used in each boosting step to prevent overfitting\\n\\n=== MARKDOWN 51 ===\\n**Producing the Submission file**\\n\\nFinally having trained and fit all our first-level and second-level models, we can now output the predictions into the proper format for submission to the Titanic competition as follows:\\n\\n=== CODE 52 ===\\n# Generate Submission File \\nStackingSubmission = pd.DataFrame({ \\'PassengerId\\': PassengerId,\\n                            \\'Survived\\': predictions })\\nStackingSubmission.to_csv(\"StackingSubmission.csv\", index=False)\\n\\n=== MARKDOWN 53 ===\\n**Steps for Further Improvement**\\n\\nAs a closing remark it must be noted that the steps taken above just show a very simple way of producing an ensemble stacker. You hear of ensembles created at the highest level of Kaggle competitions which involves monstrous combinations of stacked classifiers as well as levels of stacking which go to more than 2 levels. \\n\\nSome additional steps that may be taken to improve one\\'s score could be:\\n\\n 1. Implementing a good cross-validation strategy in training the models to find optimal parameter values\\n 2. Introduce a greater variety of base models for learning.\\n\\n=== MARKDOWN 54 ===\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nI have this notebook has been helpful somewhat in introducing a working script for stacking learning models. Again credit must be extended to Faron and Sina. \\n\\nFor other excellent material on stacking or ensembling in general, refer to the de-facto Must read article on the website MLWave: [Kaggle Ensembling Guide][1]. \\n\\nTill next time, Peace Out\\n\\n  [1]: http://mlwave.com/kaggle-ensembling-guide/\\n\\n=== CODE 55 ===\\n\\n\\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': \"REASONING: Excellent!

Once you’re ready to start competing, click on the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/account/login?returnUrl=%2Fc%2Ftitanic\" target=\"_blank\">\"Join Competition button</a> to create an account and gain access to the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data\" target=\"_blank\">competition data</a>. Then check out <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/titanic-tutorial\">Alexis Cook’s Titanic Tutorial</a> that walks you through step by step how to make your first submission!\n\n<iframe width=\"699\" height=\"368\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8yZMXCaFshs\" title=\"YouTube video | How to Get Started with Kaggle’s Titanic Competition | Kaggle\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n## The Challenge\nThe sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.\n\nOn April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.\n\nWhile there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.\n\nIn this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).\n\n> #### Recommended Tutorial\n> We highly recommend [Alexis Cook’s Titanic Tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/titanic-tutorial) that walks you through making your very first submission step by step and [this starter notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/gusthema/titanic-competition-w-tensorflow-decision-forests) to get started.\n\n## How Kaggle’s Competitions Work\n1. **Join the Competition**\nRead about the challenge description, accept the Competition Rules and gain access to the competition dataset.\n1.  **Get to Work**\nDownload the data, build models on it locally or on Kaggle Notebooks (our no-setup, customizable Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs) and generate a prediction file.\n1.  **Make a Submission**\nUpload your prediction as a submission on Kaggle and receive an accuracy score.\n1.  **Check the Leaderboard**\nSee how your model ranks against other Kagglers on our leaderboard. \n1.  **Improve Your Score**\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a> to find lots of tutorials and insights from other competitors.\n\n> #### Kaggle Lingo Video\n> You may run into unfamiliar lingo as you dig into the Kaggle discussion forums and public notebooks. Check out  Dr. Rachael Tatman’s [video on Kaggle Lingo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEJHyuWKd-s) to get up to speed!\n\n## What Data Will I Use in This Competition?\nIn this competition, you’ll gain access to two similar datasets that include passenger information like name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc. One dataset is titled `train.csv` and the other is titled `test.csv`.\n\n`Train.csv` will contain the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 to be exact) and importantly, will reveal whether they survived or not, also known as the “ground truth”.\n\nThe `test.csv` dataset contains similar information but does not disclose the “ground truth” for each passenger. It’s your job to predict these outcomes.\n\nUsing the patterns you find in the `train.csv` data, predict whether the other 418 passengers on board (found in `test.csv`) survived.\n\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data\">“Data” tab</a> to explore the datasets even further. Once you feel you’ve created a competitive model, submit it to Kaggle to see where your model stands on our leaderboard against other Kagglers.\n\n## How to Submit your Prediction to Kaggle\nOnce you’re ready to make a submission and get on the leaderboard:\n\n1. Click on the “Submit Predictions” button\n<img width=\"699\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen1.png\">\n1. Upload a CSV file in the submission file format. You’re able to submit 10 submissions a day.\n<img width=\"699\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen2.png\">\n\n## Submission File Format:\nYou should submit a csv file with exactly 418 entries plus a header row. Your submission will show an error if you have extra columns (beyond `PassengerId` and `Survived`) or rows.\n\nThe file should have exactly 2 columns:\n- `PassengerId` (sorted in any order)\n- `Survived` (contains your binary predictions: 1 for survived, 0 for deceased)\n\n## Got it! I’m ready to get started. Where do I get help if I need it?\n- For Competition Help: <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\">Titanic Discussion Forum</a>\n\nKaggle doesn’t have a dedicated team to help troubleshoot your code so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. The forums are full of useful information on the data, metric, and different approaches. We encourage you to use the forums often. If you share your knowledge, you'll find that others will share a lot in turn!\n\n## A Last Word on Kaggle Notebooks\nAs we mentioned before, Kaggle Notebooks is our no-setup, customizable, Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs and a huge repository of community published data &amp; code.\n\nIn every competition, you’ll find many Notebooks shared with incredible insights.

This is known as <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision#In_binary_classification\">accuracy</a>.</p>\n<h2>Submission File Format</h2>\n<p>You should submit a csv file with exactly 418 entries <b>plus</b> a header row. Your submission will show an error if you have extra columns (beyond PassengerId and Survived) or rows.<br><br>The file should have exactly 2 columns:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>PassengerId (sorted in any order)</li>\n<li>Survived (contains your binary predictions: 1 for survived, 0 for deceased)</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><b>PassengerId,Survived</b><br>892,0<br>893,1<br>894,0<br>Etc.</pre>\n<p>You can download an example submission file (gender_submission.csv) on the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data\">Data page</a>.</p>\n\n## data-description\n\n<h3>Overview</h3>\n<p>The data has been split into two groups:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>training set (train.csv)</li>\n<li>test set (test.csv)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b> The training set </b>should be used to build your machine learning models. For the training set, we provide the outcome (also known as the “ground truth”) for each passenger. Your model will be based on “features” like passengers’ gender and class. You can also use <a href=\"https://triangleinequality.wordpress.com/2013/09/08/basic-feature-engineering-with-the-titanic-data/\" target=\"_blank\"> feature engineering </a>to create new features.</p>\n<p><b>The test set </b>should be used to see how well your model performs on unseen data. For the test set, we do not provide the ground truth for each passenger. It is your job to predict these outcomes. For each passenger in the test set, use the model you trained to predict whether or not they survived the sinking of the Titanic.</p>\n<p>We also include <b>gender_submission.csv</b>, a set of predictions that assume all and only female passengers survive, as an example of what a submission file should look like.</p>\n<h3>Data Dictionary</h3>\n<table style=\"width: 100%;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr><th><b>Variable</b></th><th><b>Definition</b></th><th><b>Key</b></th></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>survival</td>\n<td>Survival</td>\n<td>0 = No, 1 = Yes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>pclass</td>\n<td>Ticket class</td>\n<td>1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>sex</td>\n<td>Sex</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Age</td>\n<td>Age in years</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>sibsp</td>\n<td># of siblings / spouses aboard the Titanic</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>parch</td>\n<td># of parents / children aboard the Titanic</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>ticket</td>\n<td>Ticket number</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>fare</td>\n<td>Passenger fare</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>cabin</td>\n<td>Cabin number</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>embarked</td>\n<td>Port of Embarkation</td>\n<td>C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>Variable Notes</h3>\n<p><b>pclass</b>: A proxy for socio-economic status (SES)<br /> 1st = Upper<br /> 2nd = Middle<br /> 3rd = Lower<br /><br /> <b>age</b>: Age is fractional if less than 1.

They are a great place to begin if you are new to data science or just finished a MOOC and want to get involved in Kaggle.</p>\n<p>Getting Started competitions are a non-competitive way to get familiar with Kaggle’s platform, learn basic machine learning concepts, and start meeting people in the community. They have no cash prize and are on a rolling timeline.</p>\n<h2>How do I create and manage a team?</h2>\n<p>When you accept the competition rules, a team will be created for you. You can invite others to your team, accept a merger with another team, and update basic information like team name by going to the More &gt; <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/team\" target=\"_blank\">Team</a> page.</p>\n<p>We've heard from many Kagglers that teaming up is the best way to learn new skills AND have fun. If you don't have a teammate already, consider asking if anyone wants to team up in the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a>.</p>\n<h2>What are Notebooks?</h2>\n<p>Kaggle Notebooks is a cloud computational environment that enables reproducible and collaborative analysis. Notebooks support scripts in Python and R, Jupyter Notebooks, and RMarkdown reports. You can visit the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/notebooks\" target=\"_blank\">Notebooks</a> tab to view all of the publicly shared code for the Titanic competition. For more on how to use Notebooks to learn data science, check out our <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview\" target=\"&quot;_blank\">Courses</a>!</p>\n<h2>Why did my team disappear from the leaderboard?</h2>\n<p>To keep with the spirit of getting-started competitions, we have implemented a two month rolling window on submissions. Once a submission is more than two months old, it will be invalidated and no longer count towards the leaderboard.</p>\n<p>If your team has no submissions in the previous two months, the team will also drop from the leaderboard. This will keep the leaderboard at a manageable size, freshen it up, and prevent newcomers from getting lost in a sea of abandoned scores.</p>\n<p><i>\"I worked so hard to get that score! Give it back!\"</i> Read more about our decision to implement a rolling leaderboard <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion/6240\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n<h2>How do I contact Support?</h2>\n<p>Kaggle does not have a dedicated support team so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. (For this competition, you’ll want to use the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">Titanic discussion forum)</a>.</p>\n<p>Support is only able to help with issues that are being experienced by all participants. Before contacting support, please check the discussion forum for information on your problem. If you can’t find it, you can post your problem in the forum so a fellow participant or a Kaggle team member can provide help. The forums are full of useful information on the data, metric, and different approaches. We encourage you to use the forums often. If you share your knowledge, you'll find that others will share a lot in turn!</p>\n<p>If your problem persists or it seems to be effective all participants then please <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/contact\" target=\"_blank\">contact us</a>.</p>\ntool: Not a directory: /home/code/exploration/../research/writeups\ntool: /home/code/exploration/../research/kernels:\n[DIR]  alexisbcook_exercise-arithmetic-and-variables/\n[DIR]  alexisbcook_titanic-tutorial/\n[DIR]  arthurtok_introduction-to-ensembling-stacking-in-python/\n[DIR]  ldfreeman3_a-data-science-framework-to-achieve-99-accuracy/\n[FILE] metadata.json (1.7KB)\n[DIR]  startupsci_titanic-data-science-solutions/\ntool: /home/data:\n[FILE] description.md (13.6KB)\n[FILE] gender_submission.csv (3.2KB)\n[FILE] test.csv (28.0KB)\n[FILE] train.csv (59.8KB)\ntool: Error: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/home/code/exploration/../research/kernels/ldfreeman3_a-data-science-framework-to-achieve-99-accuracy/ldfreeman3_a-data-science-framework-to-achieve-99-accuracy.py'\ntool: Error: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/home/code/exploration/../research/kernels/arthurtok_introduction-to-ensembling-stacking-in-python/arthurtok_introduction-to-ensembling-stacking-in-python.py'\ntool: /home/code/exploration/../research/kernels/ldfreeman3_a-data-science-framework-to-achieve-99-accuracy:\n[FILE] a-data-science-framework-to-achieve-99-accuracy.ipynb (107.1KB)\n[FILE] kernel-metadata.json (732.0B)\ntool: /home/code/exploration/../research/kernels/arthurtok_introduction-to-ensembling-stacking-in-python:\n[FILE] introduction-to-ensembling-stacking-in-python.ipynb (39.3KB)\n[FILE] kernel-metadata.json (687.0B)\ntool: /home/code/exploration/../research/kernels/startupsci_titanic-data-science-solutions:\n[FILE] kernel-metadata.json (661.0B)\n[FILE] titanic-data-science-solutions.ipynb (55.5KB)\ntool: === MARKDOWN 0 ===\n\n>Hello and Welcome to Kaggle, the online Data Science Community to learn, share, and compete. Most beginners get lost in the field, because they fall into the black box approach, using libraries and algorithms they don't understand. This tutorial will give you a 1-2-year head start over your peers, by providing a framework that teaches you how-to think like a data scientist vs what to think/code. Not only will you be able to submit your first competition, but you’ll be able to solve any problem\n\n=== MARKDOWN 1 ===\n<a id=\"ch1\"></a>\n# How a Data Scientist Beat the Odds\nIt's the classical problem, predict the outcome of a binary event. In laymen terms this means, it either occurred or did not occur. For example, you won or did not win, you passed the test or did not pass the test, you were accepted or not accepted, and you get the point. A common business application is churn or customer retention. Another popular use case is, healthcare's mortality rate or survival analysis. Binary events create an interest\n\n=== MARKDOWN 2 ===\n<a id=\"ch2\"></a>\n# A Data Science Framework\n1. **Define the Problem:** If data science, big data, machine learning, predictive analytics, business intelligence, or any other buzzword is the solution, then what is the problem?

On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the inter\n\n=== MARKDOWN 4 ===\n<a id=\"ch4\"></a>\n# Step 3: Prepare Data for Consumption\nSince step 2 was provided to us on a golden plater, so is step 3. Therefore, normal processes in data wrangling, such as data architecture, governance, and extraction are out of scope. Thus, only data cleaning is in scope.\n\n## 3.1 Import Libraries\nThe following code is written in Python 3.x. Libraries provide pre-written functionality to perform necessary tasks.

In a nutshell stacking uses as a first-level (base), the predictions of a few basic classifiers and then uses another model at the second-level to predict the output from the earlier first-level predictions.\n\nThe Titanic dataset is a prime candidate for introducing this concept as many newcomers to Kaggle start out here. Furthermore even though stacking has been responsible for many a team winning K\n\n=== CODE 1 ===\n# Load in our libraries\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport re\nimport sklearn\nimport xgboost as xgb\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline\n\nimport plotly.offline as py\npy.init_notebook_mode(connected=True)\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\nimport plotly.tools as tls\n\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\n\n# Going to use these 5 base models for the stacking\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import (RandomForestClassifier, AdaBoostClassifier, \n                              GradientBoostingClassifier, ExtraTreesClassifier)\nfrom sklearn.svm import SVC\nfrom \n\n=== MARKDOWN 2 ===\n# Feature Exploration, Engineering and Cleaning \n\nNow we will proceed much like how most kernels in general are structured, and that is to first explore the data on hand, identify possible feature engineering opportunities as well as numerically encode any categorical features.\n\n=== CODE 3 ===\n# Load in the train and test datasets\ntrain = pd.read_csv('../input/train.csv')\ntest = pd.read_csv('../input/test.csv')\n\n# Store our passenger ID for easy access\nPassengerId = test['PassengerId']\n\ntrain.head(3)\n\n=== MARKDOWN 4 ===\nWell it is no surprise that our task is to somehow extract the information out of the categorical variables \n\n**Feature Engineering**\n\nHere, credit must be extended to Sina's very comprehensive and well-thought out notebook for the feature engineering ideas so please check out his work \n\n[Titanic Best Working Classfier][1] : by Sina\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.kaggle.com/sinakhorami/titanic/titanic-best-working-classifier\n\n=== CODE 5 ===\nfull_data = [train, test]\n\n# Some features of my own that I have added in\n# Gives the length of the name\ntrain['Name_length'] = train['Name'].apply(len)\ntest['Name_length'] = test['Name'].apply(len)\n# Feature that tells whether a passenger had a cabin on the Titanic\ntrain['Has_Cabin'] = train[\"Cabin\"].apply(lambda x: 0 if type(x) == float else 1)\ntest['Has_Cabin'] = test[\"Cabin\"].apply(lambda x: 0 if type(x) == float else 1)\n\n# Feature engineering steps taken from Sina\n# Create new feature FamilySize as a combination of SibSp and Parch\nfor dataset in full_data:\n    dataset['FamilySize'] = data\n\n=== CODE 6 ===\n# Feature selection\ndrop_elements = ['PassengerId', 'Name', 'Ticket', 'Cabin', 'SibSp']\ntrain = train.drop(drop_elements, axis = 1)\ntrain = train.drop(['CategoricalAge', 'CategoricalFare'], axis = 1)\ntest  = test.drop(drop_elements, axis = 1)\n\n=== MARKDOWN 7 ===\nAll right so now having cleaned the features and extracted relevant information and dropped the categorical columns our features should now all be numeric, a format suitable to feed into our Machine Learning models.

This is good from a point of view of feeding these features into your learning model because this means that there isn't much redundant or superfluous data in our training set and we are happy that each feature carries with it some unique information. Here are two most correlated features are that of Family size and Parch (Parents and Children). I'll still leave both features in for the purposes of this exercise.\n\n**Pairplots**\n\n\n=== CODE 12 ===\ng = sns.pairplot(train[[u'Survived', u'Pclass', u'Sex', u'Age', u'Parch', u'Fare', u'Embarked',\n       u'FamilySize', u'Title']], hue='Survived', palette = 'seismic',size=1.2,diag_kind = 'kde',diag_kws=dict(shade=True),plot_kws=dict(s=10) )\ng.set(xticklabels=[])\n\n=== MARKDOWN 13 ===\n# Ensembling & Stacking models\n\nFinally after that brief whirlwind detour with regards to feature engineering and formatting, we finally arrive at the meat and gist of the this notebook.\n\nCreating a Stacking ensemble!\n\n=== MARKDOWN 14 ===\n### Helpers via Python Classes\n\nHere we invoke the use of Python's classes to help make it more convenient for us. For any newcomers to programming, one normally hears Classes being used in conjunction with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). In short, a class helps to extend some code/program for creating objects (variables for old-school peeps) as well as to implement functions and methods specific to that class.\n\nIn the section of code below, we essentially write a class *SklearnHelper* that allows one to extend the inbuilt methods (such as train, predict and fit) common to all the Sklearn c\n\n=== CODE 15 ===\n# Some useful parameters which will come in handy later on\nntrain = train.shape[0]\nntest = test.shape[0]\nSEED = 0 # for reproducibility\nNFOLDS = 5 # set folds for out-of-fold prediction\nkf = KFold(ntrain, n_folds= NFOLDS, random_state=SEED)\n\n# Class to extend the Sklearn classifier\nclass SklearnHelper(object):\n    def __init__(self, clf, seed=0, params=None):\n        params['random_state'] = seed\n        self.clf = clf(**params)\n\n    def train(self, x_train, y_train):\n        self.clf.fit(x_train, y_train)\n\n    def predict(self, x):\n        return self.clf.predict(x)\n    \n    def fit(self,x,y)\n\n=== MARKDOWN 16 ===\nBear with me for those who already know this but for people who have not created classes or objects in Python before, let me explain what the code given above does. In creating my base classifiers, I will only use the models already present in the Sklearn library and therefore only extend the class for that.\n\n**def init** : Python standard for invoking the default constructor for the class. This means that when you want to create an object (classifier), you have to give it the parameters of clf (what sklearn classifier you want), seed (random seed) and params (parameters for the classifiers).\n\n\n=== MARKDOWN 17 ===\n### Out-of-Fold Predictions\n\nNow as alluded to above in the introductory section, stacking uses predictions of base classifiers as input for training to a second-level model. However one cannot simply train the base models on the full training data, generate predictions on the full test set and then output these for the second-level training. This runs the risk of your base model predictions already having \"seen\" the test set and therefore overfitting when feeding these predictions.\n\n=== CODE 18 ===\ndef get_oof(clf, x_train, y_train, x_test):\n    oof_train = np.zeros((ntrain,))\n    oof_test = np.zeros((ntest,))\n    oof_test_skf = np.empty((NFOLDS, ntest))\n\n    for i, (train_index, test_index) in enumerate(kf):\n        x_tr = x_train[train_index]\n        y_tr = y_train[train_index]\n        x_te = x_train[test_index]\n\n        clf.train(x_tr, y_tr)\n\n        oof_train[test_index] = clf.predict(x_te)\n        oof_test_skf[i, :] = clf.predict(x_test)\n\n    oof_test[:] = oof_test_skf.mean(axis=0)\n    return oof_train.reshape(-1, 1), oof_test.reshape(-1, 1)\n\n=== MARKDOWN 19 ===\n# Generating our Base First-Level Models \n\nSo now let us prepare five learning models as our first level classification. These models can all be conveniently invoked via the Sklearn library and are listed as follows:\n\n 1. Random Forest classifier\n 2. Extra Trees classifier\n 3. AdaBoost classifer\n 4.

As per the code below, we are therefore having as our new columns the first-level predictions from our earlier classifiers and we train the next classifier on this.\n\n=== CODE 42 ===\nbase_predictions_train = pd.DataFrame( {'RandomForest': rf_oof_train.ravel(),\n     'ExtraTrees': et_oof_train.ravel(),\n     'AdaBoost': ada_oof_train.ravel(),\n      'GradientBoost': gb_oof_train.ravel()\n    })\nbase_predictions_train.head()\n\n=== MARKDOWN 43 ===\n**Correlation Heatmap of the Second Level Training set**\n\n=== CODE 44 ===\ndata = [\n    go.Heatmap(\n        z= base_predictions_train.astype(float).corr().values ,\n        x=base_predictions_train.columns.values,\n        y= base_predictions_train.columns.values,\n          colorscale='Viridis',\n            showscale=True,\n            reversescale = True\n    )\n]\npy.iplot(data, filename='labelled-heatmap')\n\n=== MARKDOWN 45 ===\nThere have been quite a few articles and Kaggle competition winner stories about the merits of having trained models that are more uncorrelated with one another producing better scores.\n\n=== CODE 46 ===\nx_train = np.concatenate(( et_oof_train, rf_oof_train, ada_oof_train, gb_oof_train, svc_oof_train), axis=1)\nx_test = np.concatenate(( et_oof_test, rf_oof_test, ada_oof_test, gb_oof_test, svc_oof_test), axis=1)\n\n=== MARKDOWN 47 ===\nHaving now concatenated and joined both the first-level train and test predictions as x_train and x_test, we can now fit a second-level learning model.\n\n=== MARKDOWN 48 ===\n### Second level learning model via XGBoost\n\nHere we choose the eXtremely famous library for boosted tree learning model, XGBoost. It was built to optimize large-scale boosted tree algorithms. For further information about the algorithm, check out the [official documentation][1].\n\n  [1]: https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n\nAnyways, we call an XGBClassifier and fit it to the first-level train and target data and use the learned model to predict the test data as follows:\n\n=== CODE 49 ===\ngbm = xgb.XGBClassifier(\n    #learning_rate = 0.02,\n n_estimators= 2000,\n max_depth= 4,\n min_child_weight= 2,\n #gamma=1,\n gamma=0.9,                        \n subsample=0.8,\n colsample_bytree=0.8,\n objective= 'binary:logistic',\n nthread= -1,\n scale_pos_weight=1).fit(x_train, y_train)\npredictions = gbm.predict(x_test)\n\n=== MARKDOWN 50 ===\nJust a quick run down of the XGBoost parameters used in the model:\n\n**max_depth** : How deep you want to grow your tree. Beware if set to too high a number might run the risk of overfitting.\n\n**gamma** : minimum loss reduction required to make a further partition on a leaf node of the tree. The larger, the more conservative the algorithm will be.\n\n**eta** : step size shrinkage used in each boosting step to prevent overfitting\n\n=== MARKDOWN 51 ===\n**Producing the Submission file**\n\nFinally having trained and fit all our first-level and second-level models, we can now output the predictions into the proper format for submission to the Titanic competition as follows:\n\n=== CODE 52 ===\n# Generate Submission File \nStackingSubmission = pd.DataFrame({ 'PassengerId': PassengerId,\n                            'Survived': predictions })\nStackingSubmission.to_csv(\"StackingSubmission.csv\", index=False)\n\n=== MARKDOWN 53 ===\n**Steps for Further Improvement**\n\nAs a closing remark it must be noted that the steps taken above just show a very simple way of producing an ensemble stacker. You hear of ensembles created at the highest level of Kaggle competitions which involves monstrous combinations of stacked classifiers as well as levels of stacking which go to more than 2 levels. \n\nSome additional steps that may be taken to improve one's score could be:\n\n 1. Implementing a good cross-validation strategy in training the models to find optimal parameter values\n 2. Introduce a greater variety of base models for learning.\n\n=== MARKDOWN 54 ===\n### Conclusion\n\nI have this notebook has been helpful somewhat in introducing a working script for stacking learning models. Again credit must be extended to Faron and Sina. \n\nFor other excellent material on stacking or ensembling in general, refer to the de-facto Must read article on the website MLWave: [Kaggle Ensembling Guide][1]. \n\nTill next time, Peace Out\n\n  [1]: http://mlwave.com/kaggle-ensembling-guide/\n\n=== CODE 55 ===\n\n\n\ntool: ✓ Recorded finding: Feature Engineering: FamilySize = SibSp + Parch + 1; IsAlone = 1 if FamilySize == 1; Title extracted...\n  Source: ../research/kernels/ldfreeman3_a-data-science-framework-to-achieve-99-accuracy\ntool: ✓ Recorded finding: Stacking Ensemble: Use 5 base models (RandomForest, ExtraTrees, AdaBoost, GradientBoosting, SVC) wit...\n  Source: ../research/kernels/arthurtok_introduction-to-ensembling-stacking-in-python\ntool: ✓ Recorded finding: Important features by importance: Title (especially 'Master' for male survival), Sex, Pclass, Age, F...\n  Source: ../research/kernels/arthurtok_introduction-to-ensembling-stacking-in-python\ntool: Created: /home/code/exploration/eda.ipynb\n\nStrong Note: OOM is unrecoverable.

Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.\\n\\nWhile there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.\\n\\nIn this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).\\n\\n> #### Recommended Tutorial\\n> We highly recommend [Alexis Cook’s Titanic Tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/titanic-tutorial) that walks you through making your very first submission step by step and [this starter notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/gusthema/titanic-competition-w-tensorflow-decision-forests) to get started.\\n\\n## How Kaggle’s Competitions Work\\n1. **Join the Competition**\\nRead about the challenge description, accept the Competition Rules and gain access to the competition dataset.\\n1.  **Get to Work**\\nDownload the data, build models on it locally or on Kaggle Notebooks (our no-setup, customizable Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs) and generate a prediction file.\\n1.  **Make a Submission**\\nUpload your prediction as a submission on Kaggle and receive an accuracy score.\\n1.  **Check the Leaderboard**\\nSee how your model ranks against other Kagglers on our leaderboard. \\n1.  **Improve Your Score**\\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a> to find lots of tutorials and insights from other competitors.\\n\\n> #### Kaggle Lingo Video\\n> You may run into unfamiliar lingo as you dig into the Kaggle discussion forums and public notebooks. Check out  Dr. Rachael Tatman’s [video on Kaggle Lingo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEJHyuWKd-s) to get up to speed!\\n\\n## What Data Will I Use in This Competition?\\nIn this competition, you’ll gain access to two similar datasets that include passenger information like name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc. One dataset is titled `train.csv` and the other is titled `test.csv`.\\n\\n`Train.csv` will contain the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 to be exact) and importantly, will reveal whether they survived or not, also known as the “ground truth”.\\n\\nThe `test.csv` dataset contains similar information but does not disclose the “ground truth” for each passenger. It’s your job to predict these outcomes.\\n\\nUsing the patterns you find in the `train.csv` data, predict whether the other 418 passengers on board (found in `test.csv`) survived.\\n\\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data\">“Data” tab</a> to explore the datasets even further. Once you feel you’ve created a competitive model, submit it to Kaggle to see where your model stands on our leaderboard against other Kagglers.\\n\\n## How to Submit your Prediction to Kaggle\\nOnce you’re ready to make a submission and get on the leaderboard:\\n\\n1. Click on the “Submit Predictions” button\\n<img width=\"699\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen1.png\">\\n1. Upload a CSV file in the submission file format. You’re able to submit 10 submissions a day.\\n<img width=\"699\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen2.png\">\\n\\n## Submission File Format:\\nYou should submit a csv file with exactly 418 entries plus a header row. Your submission will show an error if you have extra columns (beyond `PassengerId` and `Survived`) or rows.\\n\\nThe file should have exactly 2 columns:\\n- `PassengerId` (sorted in any order)\\n- `Survived` (contains your binary predictions: 1 for survived, 0 for deceased)\\n\\n## Got it! I’m ready to get started. Where do I get help if I need it?\\n- For Competition Help: <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\">Titanic Discussion Forum</a>\\n\\nKaggle doesn’t have a dedicated team to help troubleshoot your code so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. The forums are full of useful information on the data, metric, and different approaches. We encourage you to use the forums often. If you share your knowledge, you\\'ll find that others will share a lot in turn!\\n\\n## A Last Word on Kaggle Notebooks\\nAs we mentioned before, Kaggle Notebooks is our no-setup, customizable, Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs and a huge repository of community published data &amp; code.\\n\\nIn every competition, you’ll find many Notebooks shared with incredible insights. It’s an invaluable resource worth becoming familiar with.

They have no cash prize and are on a rolling timeline.</p>\\n<h2>How do I create and manage a team?</h2>\\n<p>When you accept the competition rules, a team will be created for you. You can invite others to your team, accept a merger with another team, and update basic information like team name by going to the More &gt; <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/team\" target=\"_blank\">Team</a> page.</p>\\n<p>We\\'ve heard from many Kagglers that teaming up is the best way to learn new skills AND have fun. If you don\\'t have a teammate already, consider asking if anyone wants to team up in the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a>.</p>\\n<h2>What are Notebooks?</h2>\\n<p>Kaggle Notebooks is a cloud computational environment that enables reproducible and collaborative analysis. Notebooks support scripts in Python and R, Jupyter Notebooks, and RMarkdown reports. You can visit the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/notebooks\" target=\"_blank\">Notebooks</a> tab to view all of the publicly shared code for the Titanic competition. For more on how to use Notebooks to learn data science, check out our <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview\" target=\"&quot;_blank\">Courses</a>!</p>\\n<h2>Why did my team disappear from the leaderboard?</h2>\\n<p>To keep with the spirit of getting-started competitions, we have implemented a two month rolling window on submissions. Once a submission is more than two months old, it will be invalidated and no longer count towards the leaderboard.</p>\\n<p>If your team has no submissions in the previous two months, the team will also drop from the leaderboard. This will keep the leaderboard at a manageable size, freshen it up, and prevent newcomers from getting lost in a sea of abandoned scores.</p>\\n<p><i>\"I worked so hard to get that score! Give it back!\"</i> Read more about our decision to implement a rolling leaderboard <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion/6240\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\\n<h2>How do I contact Support?</h2>\\n<p>Kaggle does not have a dedicated support team so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. (For this competition, you’ll want to use the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">Titanic discussion forum)</a>.</p>\\n<p>Support is only able to help with issues that are being experienced by all participants. Before contacting support, please check the discussion forum for information on your problem.

Most beginners get lost in the field, because they fall into the black box approach, using libraries and algorithms they don\\'t understand.

In laymen terms this means, it either occurred or did not occur. For example, you won or did not win, you passed the test or did not pass the test, you were accepted or not accepted, and you get the point.

In a nutshell stacking uses as a first-level (base), the predictions of a few basic classifiers and then uses another model at the second-level to predict the output from the earlier first-level predictions.\\n\\nThe Titanic dataset is a prime candidate for introducing this concept as many newcomers to Kaggle start out here.

This is good from a point of view of feeding these features into your learning model because this means that there isn\\'t much redundant or superfluous data in our training set and we are happy that each feature carries with it some unique information. Here are two most correlated features are that of Family size and Parch (Parents and Children).

For any newcomers to programming, one normally hears Classes being used in conjunction with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). In short, a class helps to extend some code/program for creating objects (variables for old-school peeps) as well as to implement functions and methods specific to that class.\\n\\nIn the section of code below, we essentially write a class *SklearnHelper* that allows one to extend the inbuilt methods (such as train, predict and fit) common to all the Sklearn c\\n\\n=== CODE 15 ===\\n# Some useful parameters which will come in handy later on\\nntrain = train.shape[0]\\nntest = test.shape[0]\\nSEED = 0 # for reproducibility\\nNFOLDS = 5 # set folds for out-of-fold prediction\\nkf = KFold(ntrain, n_folds= NFOLDS, random_state=SEED)\\n\\n# Class to extend the Sklearn classifier\\nclass SklearnHelper(object):\\n    def __init__(self, clf, seed=0, params=None):\\n        params[\\'random_state\\'] = seed\\n        self.clf = clf(**params)\\n\\n    def train(self, x_train, y_train):\\n        self.clf.fit(x_train, y_train)\\n\\n    def predict(self, x):\\n        return self.clf.predict(x)\\n    \\n    def fit(self,x,y)\\n\\n=== MARKDOWN 16 ===\\nBear with me for those who already know this but for people who have not created classes or objects in Python before, let me explain what the code given above does. In creating my base classifiers, I will only use the models already present in the Sklearn library and therefore only extend the class for that.\\n\\n**def init** : Python standard for invoking the default constructor for the class. This means that when you want to create an object (classifier), you have to give it the parameters of clf (what sklearn classifier you want), seed (random seed) and params (parameters for the classifiers).\\n\\n\\n=== MARKDOWN 17 ===\\n### Out-of-Fold Predictions\\n\\nNow as alluded to above in the introductory section, stacking uses predictions of base classifiers as input for training to a second-level model. However one cannot simply train the base models on the full training data, generate predictions on the full test set and then output these for the second-level training. This runs the risk of your base model predictions already having \"seen\" the test set and therefore overfitting when feeding these predictions.\\n\\n=== CODE 18 ===\\ndef get_oof(clf, x_train, y_train, x_test):\\n    oof_train = np.zeros((ntrain,))\\n    oof_test = np.zeros((ntest,))\\n    oof_test_skf = np.empty((NFOLDS, ntest))\\n\\n    for i, (train_index, test_index) in enumerate(kf):\\n        x_tr = x_train[train_index]\\n        y_tr = y_train[train_index]\\n        x_te = x_train[test_index]\\n\\n        clf.train(x_tr, y_tr)\\n\\n        oof_train[test_index] = clf.predict(x_te)\\n        oof_test_skf[i, :] = clf.predict(x_test)\\n\\n    oof_test[:] = oof_test_skf.mean(axis=0)\\n    return oof_train.reshape(-1, 1), oof_test.reshape(-1, 1)\\n\\n=== MARKDOWN 19 ===\\n# Generating our Base First-Level Models \\n\\nSo now let us prepare five learning models as our first level classification.

It was built to optimize large-scale boosted tree algorithms. For further information about the algorithm, check out the [official documentation][1].\\n\\n  [1]: https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\\n\\nAnyways, we call an XGBClassifier and fit it to the first-level train and target data and use the learned model to predict the test data as follows:\\n\\n=== CODE 49 ===\\ngbm = xgb.XGBClassifier(\\n    #learning_rate = 0.02,\\n n_estimators= 2000,\\n max_depth= 4,\\n min_child_weight= 2,\\n #gamma=1,\\n gamma=0.9,                        \\n subsample=0.8,\\n colsample_bytree=0.8,\\n objective= \\'binary:logistic\\',\\n nthread= -1,\\n scale_pos_weight=1).fit(x_train, y_train)\\npredictions = gbm.predict(x_test)\\n\\n=== MARKDOWN 50 ===\\nJust a quick run down of the XGBoost parameters used in the model:\\n\\n**max_depth** : How deep you want to grow your tree. Beware if set to too high a number might run the risk of overfitting.\\n\\n**gamma** : minimum loss reduction required to make a further partition on a leaf node of the tree. The larger, the more conservative the algorithm will be.\\n\\n**eta** : step size shrinkage used in each boosting step to prevent overfitting\\n\\n=== MARKDOWN 51 ===\\n**Producing the Submission file**\\n\\nFinally having trained and fit all our first-level and second-level models, we can now output the predictions into the proper format for submission to the Titanic competition as follows:\\n\\n=== CODE 52 ===\\n# Generate Submission File \\nStackingSubmission = pd.DataFrame({ \\'PassengerId\\': PassengerId,\\n                            \\'Survived\\': predictions })\\nStackingSubmission.to_csv(\"StackingSubmission.csv\", index=False)\\n\\n=== MARKDOWN 53 ===\\n**Steps for Further Improvement**\\n\\nAs a closing remark it must be noted that the steps taken above just show a very simple way of producing an ensemble stacker. You hear of ensembles created at the highest level of Kaggle competitions which involves monstrous combinations of stacked classifiers as well as levels of stacking which go to more than 2 levels. \\n\\nSome additional steps that may be taken to improve one\\'s score could be:\\n\\n 1. Implementing a good cross-validation strategy in training the models to find optimal parameter values\\n 2. Introduce a greater variety of base models for learning.\\n\\n=== MARKDOWN 54 ===\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nI have this notebook has been helpful somewhat in introducing a working script for stacking learning models. Again credit must be extended to Faron and Sina. \\n\\nFor other excellent material on stacking or ensembling in general, refer to the de-facto Must read article on the website MLWave: [Kaggle Ensembling Guide][1]. \\n\\nTill next time, Peace Out\\n\\n  [1]: http://mlwave.com/kaggle-ensembling-guide/\\n\\n=== CODE 55 ===\\n\\n\\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': \"REASONING: Excellent!

Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.\n\nWhile there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.\n\nIn this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).\n\n> #### Recommended Tutorial\n> We highly recommend [Alexis Cook’s Titanic Tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/titanic-tutorial) that walks you through making your very first submission step by step and [this starter notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/gusthema/titanic-competition-w-tensorflow-decision-forests) to get started.\n\n## How Kaggle’s Competitions Work\n1. **Join the Competition**\nRead about the challenge description, accept the Competition Rules and gain access to the competition dataset.\n1.  **Get to Work**\nDownload the data, build models on it locally or on Kaggle Notebooks (our no-setup, customizable Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs) and generate a prediction file.\n1.  **Make a Submission**\nUpload your prediction as a submission on Kaggle and receive an accuracy score.\n1.  **Check the Leaderboard**\nSee how your model ranks against other Kagglers on our leaderboard. \n1.  **Improve Your Score**\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a> to find lots of tutorials and insights from other competitors.\n\n> #### Kaggle Lingo Video\n> You may run into unfamiliar lingo as you dig into the Kaggle discussion forums and public notebooks. Check out  Dr. Rachael Tatman’s [video on Kaggle Lingo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEJHyuWKd-s) to get up to speed!\n\n## What Data Will I Use in This Competition?\nIn this competition, you’ll gain access to two similar datasets that include passenger information like name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc. One dataset is titled `train.csv` and the other is titled `test.csv`.\n\n`Train.csv` will contain the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 to be exact) and importantly, will reveal whether they survived or not, also known as the “ground truth”.\n\nThe `test.csv` dataset contains similar information but does not disclose the “ground truth” for each passenger. It’s your job to predict these outcomes.\n\nUsing the patterns you find in the `train.csv` data, predict whether the other 418 passengers on board (found in `test.csv`) survived.\n\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data\">“Data” tab</a> to explore the datasets even further. Once you feel you’ve created a competitive model, submit it to Kaggle to see where your model stands on our leaderboard against other Kagglers.\n\n## How to Submit your Prediction to Kaggle\nOnce you’re ready to make a submission and get on the leaderboard:\n\n1. Click on the “Submit Predictions” button\n<img width=\"699\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen1.png\">\n1. Upload a CSV file in the submission file format. You’re able to submit 10 submissions a day.\n<img width=\"699\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen2.png\">\n\n## Submission File Format:\nYou should submit a csv file with exactly 418 entries plus a header row. Your submission will show an error if you have extra columns (beyond `PassengerId` and `Survived`) or rows.\n\nThe file should have exactly 2 columns:\n- `PassengerId` (sorted in any order)\n- `Survived` (contains your binary predictions: 1 for survived, 0 for deceased)\n\n## Got it! I’m ready to get started. Where do I get help if I need it?\n- For Competition Help: <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\">Titanic Discussion Forum</a>\n\nKaggle doesn’t have a dedicated team to help troubleshoot your code so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. The forums are full of useful information on the data, metric, and different approaches. We encourage you to use the forums often. If you share your knowledge, you'll find that others will share a lot in turn!\n\n## A Last Word on Kaggle Notebooks\nAs we mentioned before, Kaggle Notebooks is our no-setup, customizable, Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs and a huge repository of community published data &amp; code.\n\nIn every competition, you’ll find many Notebooks shared with incredible insights. It’s an invaluable resource worth becoming familiar with.

Most beginners get lost in the field, because they fall into the black box approach, using libraries and algorithms they don't understand. This tutorial will give you a 1-2-year head start over your peers, by providing a framework that teaches you how-to think like a data scientist vs what to think/code.

In laymen terms this means, it either occurred or did not occur. For example, you won or did not win, you passed the test or did not pass the test, you were accepted or not accepted, and you get the point. A common business application is churn or customer retention. Another popular use case is, healthcare's mortality rate or survival analysis.

In a nutshell stacking uses as a first-level (base), the predictions of a few basic classifiers and then uses another model at the second-level to predict the output from the earlier first-level predictions.\n\nThe Titanic dataset is a prime candidate for introducing this concept as many newcomers to Kaggle start out here. Furthermore even though stacking has been responsible for many a team winning K\n\n=== CODE 1 ===\n# Load in our libraries\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport re\nimport sklearn\nimport xgboost as xgb\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline\n\nimport plotly.offline as py\npy.init_notebook_mode(connected=True)\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\nimport plotly.tools as tls\n\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\n\n# Going to use these 5 base models for the stacking\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import (RandomForestClassifier, AdaBoostClassifier, \n                              GradientBoostingClassifier, ExtraTreesClassifier)\nfrom sklearn.svm import SVC\nfrom \n\n=== MARKDOWN 2 ===\n# Feature Exploration, Engineering and Cleaning \n\nNow we will proceed much like how most kernels in general are structured, and that is to first explore the data on hand, identify possible feature engineering opportunities as well as numerically encode any categorical features.\n\n=== CODE 3 ===\n# Load in the train and test datasets\ntrain = pd.read_csv('../input/train.csv')\ntest = pd.read_csv('../input/test.csv')\n\n# Store our passenger ID for easy access\nPassengerId = test['PassengerId']\n\ntrain.head(3)\n\n=== MARKDOWN 4 ===\nWell it is no surprise that our task is to somehow extract the information out of the categorical variables \n\n**Feature Engineering**\n\nHere, credit must be extended to Sina's very comprehensive and well-thought out notebook for the feature engineering ideas so please check out his work \n\n[Titanic Best Working Classfier][1] : by Sina\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.kaggle.com/sinakhorami/titanic/titanic-best-working-classifier\n\n=== CODE 5 ===\nfull_data = [train, test]\n\n# Some features of my own that I have added in\n# Gives the length of the name\ntrain['Name_length'] = train['Name'].apply(len)\ntest['Name_length'] = test['Name'].apply(len)\n# Feature that tells whether a passenger had a cabin on the Titanic\ntrain['Has_Cabin'] = train[\"Cabin\"].apply(lambda x: 0 if type(x) == float else 1)\ntest['Has_Cabin'] = test[\"Cabin\"].apply(lambda x: 0 if type(x) == float else 1)\n\n# Feature engineering steps taken from Sina\n# Create new feature FamilySize as a combination of SibSp and Parch\nfor dataset in full_data:\n    dataset['FamilySize'] = data\n\n=== CODE 6 ===\n# Feature selection\ndrop_elements = ['PassengerId', 'Name', 'Ticket', 'Cabin', 'SibSp']\ntrain = train.drop(drop_elements, axis = 1)\ntrain = train.drop(['CategoricalAge', 'CategoricalFare'], axis = 1)\ntest  = test.drop(drop_elements, axis = 1)\n\n=== MARKDOWN 7 ===\nAll right so now having cleaned the features and extracted relevant information and dropped the categorical columns our features should now all be numeric, a format suitable to feed into our Machine Learning models.

This is good from a point of view of feeding these features into your learning model because this means that there isn't much redundant or superfluous data in our training set and we are happy that each feature carries with it some unique information. Here are two most correlated features are that of Family size and Parch (Parents and Children). I'll still leave both features in for the purposes of this exercise.\n\n**Pairplots**\n\n\n=== CODE 12 ===\ng = sns.pairplot(train[[u'Survived', u'Pclass', u'Sex', u'Age', u'Parch', u'Fare', u'Embarked',\n       u'FamilySize', u'Title']], hue='Survived', palette = 'seismic',size=1.2,diag_kind = 'kde',diag_kws=dict(shade=True),plot_kws=dict(s=10) )\ng.set(xticklabels=[])\n\n=== MARKDOWN 13 ===\n# Ensembling & Stacking models\n\nFinally after that brief whirlwind detour with regards to feature engineering and formatting, we finally arrive at the meat and gist of the this notebook.\n\nCreating a Stacking ensemble!\n\n=== MARKDOWN 14 ===\n### Helpers via Python Classes\n\nHere we invoke the use of Python's classes to help make it more convenient for us. For any newcomers to programming, one normally hears Classes being used in conjunction with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). In short, a class helps to extend some code/program for creating objects (variables for old-school peeps) as well as to implement functions and methods specific to that class.\n\nIn the section of code below, we essentially write a class *SklearnHelper* that allows one to extend the inbuilt methods (such as train, predict and fit) common to all the Sklearn c\n\n=== CODE 15 ===\n# Some useful parameters which will come in handy later on\nntrain = train.shape[0]\nntest = test.shape[0]\nSEED = 0 # for reproducibility\nNFOLDS = 5 # set folds for out-of-fold prediction\nkf = KFold(ntrain, n_folds= NFOLDS, random_state=SEED)\n\n# Class to extend the Sklearn classifier\nclass SklearnHelper(object):\n    def __init__(self, clf, seed=0, params=None):\n        params['random_state'] = seed\n        self.clf = clf(**params)\n\n    def train(self, x_train, y_train):\n        self.clf.fit(x_train, y_train)\n\n    def predict(self, x):\n        return self.clf.predict(x)\n    \n    def fit(self,x,y)\n\n=== MARKDOWN 16 ===\nBear with me for those who already know this but for people who have not created classes or objects in Python before, let me explain what the code given above does. In creating my base classifiers, I will only use the models already present in the Sklearn library and therefore only extend the class for that.\n\n**def init** : Python standard for invoking the default constructor for the class. This means that when you want to create an object (classifier), you have to give it the parameters of clf (what sklearn classifier you want), seed (random seed) and params (parameters for the classifiers).\n\n\n=== MARKDOWN 17 ===\n### Out-of-Fold Predictions\n\nNow as alluded to above in the introductory section, stacking uses predictions of base classifiers as input for training to a second-level model. However one cannot simply train the base models on the full training data, generate predictions on the full test set and then output these for the second-level training. This runs the risk of your base model predictions already having \"seen\" the test set and therefore overfitting when feeding these predictions.\n\n=== CODE 18 ===\ndef get_oof(clf, x_train, y_train, x_test):\n    oof_train = np.zeros((ntrain,))\n    oof_test = np.zeros((ntest,))\n    oof_test_skf = np.empty((NFOLDS, ntest))\n\n    for i, (train_index, test_index) in enumerate(kf):\n        x_tr = x_train[train_index]\n        y_tr = y_train[train_index]\n        x_te = x_train[test_index]\n\n        clf.train(x_tr, y_tr)\n\n        oof_train[test_index] = clf.predict(x_te)\n        oof_test_skf[i, :] = clf.predict(x_test)\n\n    oof_test[:] = oof_test_skf.mean(axis=0)\n    return oof_train.reshape(-1, 1), oof_test.reshape(-1, 1)\n\n=== MARKDOWN 19 ===\n# Generating our Base First-Level Models \n\nSo now let us prepare five learning models as our first level classification.

It was built to optimize large-scale boosted tree algorithms. For further information about the algorithm, check out the [official documentation][1].\n\n  [1]: https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n\nAnyways, we call an XGBClassifier and fit it to the first-level train and target data and use the learned model to predict the test data as follows:\n\n=== CODE 49 ===\ngbm = xgb.XGBClassifier(\n    #learning_rate = 0.02,\n n_estimators= 2000,\n max_depth= 4,\n min_child_weight= 2,\n #gamma=1,\n gamma=0.9,                        \n subsample=0.8,\n colsample_bytree=0.8,\n objective= 'binary:logistic',\n nthread= -1,\n scale_pos_weight=1).fit(x_train, y_train)\npredictions = gbm.predict(x_test)\n\n=== MARKDOWN 50 ===\nJust a quick run down of the XGBoost parameters used in the model:\n\n**max_depth** : How deep you want to grow your tree. Beware if set to too high a number might run the risk of overfitting.\n\n**gamma** : minimum loss reduction required to make a further partition on a leaf node of the tree. The larger, the more conservative the algorithm will be.\n\n**eta** : step size shrinkage used in each boosting step to prevent overfitting\n\n=== MARKDOWN 51 ===\n**Producing the Submission file**\n\nFinally having trained and fit all our first-level and second-level models, we can now output the predictions into the proper format for submission to the Titanic competition as follows:\n\n=== CODE 52 ===\n# Generate Submission File \nStackingSubmission = pd.DataFrame({ 'PassengerId': PassengerId,\n                            'Survived': predictions })\nStackingSubmission.to_csv(\"StackingSubmission.csv\", index=False)\n\n=== MARKDOWN 53 ===\n**Steps for Further Improvement**\n\nAs a closing remark it must be noted that the steps taken above just show a very simple way of producing an ensemble stacker. You hear of ensembles created at the highest level of Kaggle competitions which involves monstrous combinations of stacked classifiers as well as levels of stacking which go to more than 2 levels. \n\nSome additional steps that may be taken to improve one's score could be:\n\n 1. Implementing a good cross-validation strategy in training the models to find optimal parameter values\n 2. Introduce a greater variety of base models for learning.\n\n=== MARKDOWN 54 ===\n### Conclusion\n\nI have this notebook has been helpful somewhat in introducing a working script for stacking learning models. Again credit must be extended to Faron and Sina. \n\nFor other excellent material on stacking or ensembling in general, refer to the de-facto Must read article on the website MLWave: [Kaggle Ensembling Guide][1]. \n\nTill next time, Peace Out\n\n  [1]: http://mlwave.com/kaggle-ensembling-guide/\n\n=== CODE 55 ===\n\n\n\ntool: ✓ Recorded finding: Feature Engineering: FamilySize = SibSp + Parch + 1; IsAlone = 1 if FamilySize == 1; Title extracted...\n  Source: ../research/kernels/ldfreeman3_a-data-science-framework-to-achieve-99-accuracy\ntool: ✓ Recorded finding: Stacking Ensemble: Use 5 base models (RandomForest, ExtraTrees, AdaBoost, GradientBoosting, SVC) wit...\n  Source: ../research/kernels/arthurtok_introduction-to-ensembling-stacking-in-python\ntool: ✓ Recorded finding: Important features by importance: Title (especially 'Master' for male survival), Sex, Pclass, Age, F...\n  Source: ../research/kernels/arthurtok_introduction-to-ensembling-stacking-in-python\ntool: Created: /home/code/exploration/eda.ipynb\n\nStrong Note: OOM is unrecoverable.

Then check out <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/titanic-tutorial\">Alexis Cook’s Titanic Tutorial</a> that walks you through step by step how to make your first submission!\\n\\n<iframe width=\"699\" height=\"368\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8yZMXCaFshs\" title=\"YouTube video | How to Get Started with Kaggle’s Titanic Competition | Kaggle\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n\\n## The Challenge\\nThe sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.\\n\\nOn April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.\\n\\nWhile there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.\\n\\nIn this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).\\n\\n> #### Recommended Tutorial\\n> We highly recommend [Alexis Cook’s Titanic Tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/titanic-tutorial) that walks you through making your very first submission step by step and [this starter notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/gusthema/titanic-competition-w-tensorflow-decision-forests) to get started.\\n\\n## How Kaggle’s Competitions Work\\n1. **Join the Competition**\\nRead about the challenge description, accept the Competition Rules and gain access to the competition dataset.\\n1.  **Get to Work**\\nDownload the data, build models on it locally or on Kaggle Notebooks (our no-setup, customizable Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs) and generate a prediction file.\\n1.  **Make a Submission**\\nUpload your prediction as a submission on Kaggle and receive an accuracy score.\\n1.  **Check the Leaderboard**\\nSee how your model ranks against other Kagglers on our leaderboard. \\n1.  **Improve Your Score**\\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a> to find lots of tutorials and insights from other competitors.\\n\\n> #### Kaggle Lingo Video\\n> You may run into unfamiliar lingo as you dig into the Kaggle discussion forums and public notebooks. Check out  Dr. Rachael Tatman’s [video on Kaggle Lingo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEJHyuWKd-s) to get up to speed!\\n\\n## What Data Will I Use in This Competition?\\nIn this competition, you’ll gain access to two similar datasets that include passenger information like name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc. One dataset is titled `train.csv` and the other is titled `test.csv`.\\n\\n`Train.csv` will contain the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 to be exact) and importantly, will reveal whether they survived or not, also known as the “ground truth”.\\n\\nThe `test.csv` dataset contains similar information but does not disclose the “ground truth” for each passenger. It’s your job to predict these outcomes.\\n\\nUsing the patterns you find in the `train.csv` data, predict whether the other 418 passengers on board (found in `test.csv`) survived.\\n\\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data\">“Data” tab</a> to explore the datasets even further. Once you feel you’ve created a competitive model, submit it to Kaggle to see where your model stands on our leaderboard against other Kagglers.\\n\\n## How to Submit your Prediction to Kaggle\\nOnce you’re ready to make a submission and get on the leaderboard:\\n\\n1. Click on the “Submit Predictions” button\\n<img width=\"699\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen1.png\">\\n1. Upload a CSV file in the submission file format. You’re able to submit 10 submissions a day.\\n<img width=\"699\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen2.png\">\\n\\n## Submission File Format:\\nYou should submit a csv file with exactly 418 entries plus a header row. Your submission will show an error if you have extra columns (beyond `PassengerId` and `Survived`) or rows.\\n\\nThe file should have exactly 2 columns:\\n- `PassengerId` (sorted in any order)\\n- `Survived` (contains your binary predictions: 1 for survived, 0 for deceased)\\n\\n## Got it! I’m ready to get started. Where do I get help if I need it?\\n- For Competition Help: <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\">Titanic Discussion Forum</a>\\n\\nKaggle doesn’t have a dedicated team to help troubleshoot your code so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. The forums are full of useful information on the data, metric, and different approaches. We encourage you to use the forums often. If you share your knowledge, you\\'ll find that others will share a lot in turn!\\n\\n## A Last Word on Kaggle Notebooks\\nAs we mentioned before, Kaggle Notebooks is our no-setup, customizable, Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs and a huge repository of community published data &amp; code.\\n\\nIn every competition, you’ll find many Notebooks shared with incredible insights.

This is known as <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision#In_binary_classification\">accuracy</a>.</p>\\n<h2>Submission File Format</h2>\\n<p>You should submit a csv file with exactly 418 entries <b>plus</b> a header row. Your submission will show an error if you have extra columns (beyond PassengerId and Survived) or rows.<br><br>The file should have exactly 2 columns:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>PassengerId (sorted in any order)</li>\\n<li>Survived (contains your binary predictions: 1 for survived, 0 for deceased)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<pre><b>PassengerId,Survived</b><br>892,0<br>893,1<br>894,0<br>Etc.</pre>\\n<p>You can download an example submission file (gender_submission.csv) on the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data\">Data page</a>.</p>\\n\\n## data-description\\n\\n<h3>Overview</h3>\\n<p>The data has been split into two groups:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>training set (train.csv)</li>\\n<li>test set (test.csv)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><b> The training set </b>should be used to build your machine learning models. For the training set, we provide the outcome (also known as the “ground truth”) for each passenger. Your model will be based on “features” like passengers’ gender and class. You can also use <a href=\"https://triangleinequality.wordpress.com/2013/09/08/basic-feature-engineering-with-the-titanic-data/\" target=\"_blank\"> feature engineering </a>to create new features.</p>\\n<p><b>The test set </b>should be used to see how well your model performs on unseen data. For the test set, we do not provide the ground truth for each passenger. It is your job to predict these outcomes. For each passenger in the test set, use the model you trained to predict whether or not they survived the sinking of the Titanic.</p>\\n<p>We also include <b>gender_submission.csv</b>, a set of predictions that assume all and only female passengers survive, as an example of what a submission file should look like.</p>\\n<h3>Data Dictionary</h3>\\n<table style=\"width: 100%;\">\\n<tbody>\\n<tr><th><b>Variable</b></th><th><b>Definition</b></th><th><b>Key</b></th></tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>survival</td>\\n<td>Survival</td>\\n<td>0 = No, 1 = Yes</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>pclass</td>\\n<td>Ticket class</td>\\n<td>1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>sex</td>\\n<td>Sex</td>\\n<td></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Age</td>\\n<td>Age in years</td>\\n<td></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>sibsp</td>\\n<td># of siblings / spouses aboard the Titanic</td>\\n<td></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>parch</td>\\n<td># of parents / children aboard the Titanic</td>\\n<td></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>ticket</td>\\n<td>Ticket number</td>\\n<td></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>fare</td>\\n<td>Passenger fare</td>\\n<td></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>cabin</td>\\n<td>Cabin number</td>\\n<td></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>embarked</td>\\n<td>Port of Embarkation</td>\\n<td>C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton</td>\\n</tr>\\n</tbody>\\n</table>\\n<h3>Variable Notes</h3>\\n<p><b>pclass</b>: A proxy for socio-economic status (SES)<br /> 1st = Upper<br /> 2nd = Middle<br /> 3rd = Lower<br /><br /> <b>age</b>: Age is fractional if less than 1.

They are a great place to begin if you are new to data science or just finished a MOOC and want to get involved in Kaggle.</p>\\n<p>Getting Started competitions are a non-competitive way to get familiar with Kaggle’s platform, learn basic machine learning concepts, and start meeting people in the community. They have no cash prize and are on a rolling timeline.</p>\\n<h2>How do I create and manage a team?</h2>\\n<p>When you accept the competition rules, a team will be created for you. You can invite others to your team, accept a merger with another team, and update basic information like team name by going to the More &gt; <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/team\" target=\"_blank\">Team</a> page.</p>\\n<p>We\\'ve heard from many Kagglers that teaming up is the best way to learn new skills AND have fun. If you don\\'t have a teammate already, consider asking if anyone wants to team up in the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a>.</p>\\n<h2>What are Notebooks?</h2>\\n<p>Kaggle Notebooks is a cloud computational environment that enables reproducible and collaborative analysis. Notebooks support scripts in Python and R, Jupyter Notebooks, and RMarkdown reports. You can visit the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/notebooks\" target=\"_blank\">Notebooks</a> tab to view all of the publicly shared code for the Titanic competition. For more on how to use Notebooks to learn data science, check out our <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview\" target=\"&quot;_blank\">Courses</a>!</p>\\n<h2>Why did my team disappear from the leaderboard?</h2>\\n<p>To keep with the spirit of getting-started competitions, we have implemented a two month rolling window on submissions. Once a submission is more than two months old, it will be invalidated and no longer count towards the leaderboard.</p>\\n<p>If your team has no submissions in the previous two months, the team will also drop from the leaderboard. This will keep the leaderboard at a manageable size, freshen it up, and prevent newcomers from getting lost in a sea of abandoned scores.</p>\\n<p><i>\"I worked so hard to get that score! Give it back!\"</i> Read more about our decision to implement a rolling leaderboard <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion/6240\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\\n<h2>How do I contact Support?</h2>\\n<p>Kaggle does not have a dedicated support team so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. (For this competition, you’ll want to use the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">Titanic discussion forum)</a>.</p>\\n<p>Support is only able to help with issues that are being experienced by all participants. Before contacting support, please check the discussion forum for information on your problem. If you can’t find it, you can post your problem in the forum so a fellow participant or a Kaggle team member can provide help. The forums are full of useful information on the data, metric, and different approaches. We encourage you to use the forums often. If you share your knowledge, you\\'ll find that others will share a lot in turn!</p>\\n<p>If your problem persists or it seems to be effective all participants then please <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/contact\" target=\"_blank\">contact us</a>.</p>'}, {'role': 'tool', 'content': 'Not a directory: /home/code/exploration/../research/writeups'}, {'role': 'tool', 'content': '/home/code/exploration/../research/kernels:\\n[DIR]  alexisbcook_exercise-arithmetic-and-variables/\\n[DIR]  alexisbcook_titanic-tutorial/\\n[DIR]  arthurtok_introduction-to-ensembling-stacking-in-python/\\n[DIR]  ldfreeman3_a-data-science-framework-to-achieve-99-accuracy/\\n[FILE] metadata.json (1.7KB)\\n[DIR]  startupsci_titanic-data-science-solutions/'}, {'role': 'tool', 'content': '/home/data:\\n[FILE] description.md (13.6KB)\\n[FILE] gender_submission.csv (3.2KB)\\n[FILE] test.csv (28.0KB)\\n[FILE] train.csv (59.8KB)'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': \"REASONING: Good, I can see this is the classic Titanic survival prediction problem - binary classification with accuracy as the metric.

In laymen terms this means, it either occurred or did not occur. For example, you won or did not win, you passed the test or did not pass the test, you were accepted or not accepted, and you get the point.

In a nutshell stacking uses as a first-level (base), the predictions of a few basic classifiers and then uses another model at the second-level to predict the output from the earlier first-level predictions.\\n\\nThe Titanic dataset is a prime candidate for introducing this concept as many newcomers to Kaggle start out here.

This is good from a point of view of feeding these features into your learning model because this means that there isn\\'t much redundant or superfluous data in our training set and we are happy that each feature carries with it some unique information. Here are two most correlated features are that of Family size and Parch (Parents and Children). I\\'ll still leave both features in for the purposes of this exercise.\\n\\n**Pairplots**\\n\\n\\n=== CODE 12 ===\\ng = sns.pairplot(train[[u\\'Survived\\', u\\'Pclass\\', u\\'Sex\\', u\\'Age\\', u\\'Parch\\', u\\'Fare\\', u\\'Embarked\\',\\n       u\\'FamilySize\\', u\\'Title\\']], hue=\\'Survived\\', palette = \\'seismic\\',size=1.2,diag_kind = \\'kde\\',diag_kws=dict(shade=True),plot_kws=dict(s=10) )\\ng.set(xticklabels=[])\\n\\n=== MARKDOWN 13 ===\\n# Ensembling & Stacking models\\n\\nFinally after that brief whirlwind detour with regards to feature engineering and formatting, we finally arrive at the meat and gist of the this notebook.\\n\\nCreating a Stacking ensemble!\\n\\n=== MARKDOWN 14 ===\\n### Helpers via Python Classes\\n\\nHere we invoke the use of Python\\'s classes to help make it more convenient for us. For any newcomers to programming, one normally hears Classes being used in conjunction with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). In short, a class helps to extend some code/program for creating objects (variables for old-school peeps) as well as to implement functions and methods specific to that class.\\n\\nIn the section of code below, we essentially write a class *SklearnHelper* that allows one to extend the inbuilt methods (such as train, predict and fit) common to all the Sklearn c\\n\\n=== CODE 15 ===\\n# Some useful parameters which will come in handy later on\\nntrain = train.shape[0]\\nntest = test.shape[0]\\nSEED = 0 # for reproducibility\\nNFOLDS = 5 # set folds for out-of-fold prediction\\nkf = KFold(ntrain, n_folds= NFOLDS, random_state=SEED)\\n\\n# Class to extend the Sklearn classifier\\nclass SklearnHelper(object):\\n    def __init__(self, clf, seed=0, params=None):\\n        params[\\'random_state\\'] = seed\\n        self.clf = clf(**params)\\n\\n    def train(self, x_train, y_train):\\n        self.clf.fit(x_train, y_train)\\n\\n    def predict(self, x):\\n        return self.clf.predict(x)\\n    \\n    def fit(self,x,y)\\n\\n=== MARKDOWN 16 ===\\nBear with me for those who already know this but for people who have not created classes or objects in Python before, let me explain what the code given above does. In creating my base classifiers, I will only use the models already present in the Sklearn library and therefore only extend the class for that.\\n\\n**def init** : Python standard for invoking the default constructor for the class. This means that when you want to create an object (classifier), you have to give it the parameters of clf (what sklearn classifier you want), seed (random seed) and params (parameters for the classifiers).\\n\\n\\n=== MARKDOWN 17 ===\\n### Out-of-Fold Predictions\\n\\nNow as alluded to above in the introductory section, stacking uses predictions of base classifiers as input for training to a second-level model. However one cannot simply train the base models on the full training data, generate predictions on the full test set and then output these for the second-level training. This runs the risk of your base model predictions already having \"seen\" the test set and therefore overfitting when feeding these predictions.\\n\\n=== CODE 18 ===\\ndef get_oof(clf, x_train, y_train, x_test):\\n    oof_train = np.zeros((ntrain,))\\n    oof_test = np.zeros((ntest,))\\n    oof_test_skf = np.empty((NFOLDS, ntest))\\n\\n    for i, (train_index, test_index) in enumerate(kf):\\n        x_tr = x_train[train_index]\\n        y_tr = y_train[train_index]\\n        x_te = x_train[test_index]\\n\\n        clf.train(x_tr, y_tr)\\n\\n        oof_train[test_index] = clf.predict(x_te)\\n        oof_test_skf[i, :] = clf.predict(x_test)\\n\\n    oof_test[:] = oof_test_skf.mean(axis=0)\\n    return oof_train.reshape(-1, 1), oof_test.reshape(-1, 1)\\n\\n=== MARKDOWN 19 ===\\n# Generating our Base First-Level Models \\n\\nSo now let us prepare five learning models as our first level classification.

It was built to optimize large-scale boosted tree algorithms. For further information about the algorithm, check out the [official documentation][1].\\n\\n  [1]: https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\\n\\nAnyways, we call an XGBClassifier and fit it to the first-level train and target data and use the learned model to predict the test data as follows:\\n\\n=== CODE 49 ===\\ngbm = xgb.XGBClassifier(\\n    #learning_rate = 0.02,\\n n_estimators= 2000,\\n max_depth= 4,\\n min_child_weight= 2,\\n #gamma=1,\\n gamma=0.9,                        \\n subsample=0.8,\\n colsample_bytree=0.8,\\n objective= \\'binary:logistic\\',\\n nthread= -1,\\n scale_pos_weight=1).fit(x_train, y_train)\\npredictions = gbm.predict(x_test)\\n\\n=== MARKDOWN 50 ===\\nJust a quick run down of the XGBoost parameters used in the model:\\n\\n**max_depth** : How deep you want to grow your tree. Beware if set to too high a number might run the risk of overfitting.\\n\\n**gamma** : minimum loss reduction required to make a further partition on a leaf node of the tree. The larger, the more conservative the algorithm will be.\\n\\n**eta** : step size shrinkage used in each boosting step to prevent overfitting\\n\\n=== MARKDOWN 51 ===\\n**Producing the Submission file**\\n\\nFinally having trained and fit all our first-level and second-level models, we can now output the predictions into the proper format for submission to the Titanic competition as follows:\\n\\n=== CODE 52 ===\\n# Generate Submission File \\nStackingSubmission = pd.DataFrame({ \\'PassengerId\\': PassengerId,\\n                            \\'Survived\\': predictions })\\nStackingSubmission.to_csv(\"StackingSubmission.csv\", index=False)\\n\\n=== MARKDOWN 53 ===\\n**Steps for Further Improvement**\\n\\nAs a closing remark it must be noted that the steps taken above just show a very simple way of producing an ensemble stacker. You hear of ensembles created at the highest level of Kaggle competitions which involves monstrous combinations of stacked classifiers as well as levels of stacking which go to more than 2 levels. \\n\\nSome additional steps that may be taken to improve one\\'s score could be:\\n\\n 1. Implementing a good cross-validation strategy in training the models to find optimal parameter values\\n 2. Introduce a greater variety of base models for learning.\\n\\n=== MARKDOWN 54 ===\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nI have this notebook has been helpful somewhat in introducing a working script for stacking learning models. Again credit must be extended to Faron and Sina. \\n\\nFor other excellent material on stacking or ensembling in general, refer to the de-facto Must read article on the website MLWave: [Kaggle Ensembling Guide][1]. \\n\\nTill next time, Peace Out\\n\\n  [1]: http://mlwave.com/kaggle-ensembling-guide/\\n\\n=== CODE 55 ===\\n\\n\\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': \"REASONING: Excellent!

Then check out <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/titanic-tutorial\">Alexis Cook’s Titanic Tutorial</a> that walks you through step by step how to make your first submission!\n\n<iframe width=\"699\" height=\"368\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8yZMXCaFshs\" title=\"YouTube video | How to Get Started with Kaggle’s Titanic Competition | Kaggle\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n## The Challenge\nThe sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.\n\nOn April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.\n\nWhile there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.\n\nIn this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).\n\n> #### Recommended Tutorial\n> We highly recommend [Alexis Cook’s Titanic Tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/titanic-tutorial) that walks you through making your very first submission step by step and [this starter notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/gusthema/titanic-competition-w-tensorflow-decision-forests) to get started.\n\n## How Kaggle’s Competitions Work\n1. **Join the Competition**\nRead about the challenge description, accept the Competition Rules and gain access to the competition dataset.\n1.  **Get to Work**\nDownload the data, build models on it locally or on Kaggle Notebooks (our no-setup, customizable Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs) and generate a prediction file.\n1.  **Make a Submission**\nUpload your prediction as a submission on Kaggle and receive an accuracy score.\n1.  **Check the Leaderboard**\nSee how your model ranks against other Kagglers on our leaderboard. \n1.  **Improve Your Score**\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a> to find lots of tutorials and insights from other competitors.\n\n> #### Kaggle Lingo Video\n> You may run into unfamiliar lingo as you dig into the Kaggle discussion forums and public notebooks. Check out  Dr. Rachael Tatman’s [video on Kaggle Lingo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEJHyuWKd-s) to get up to speed!\n\n## What Data Will I Use in This Competition?\nIn this competition, you’ll gain access to two similar datasets that include passenger information like name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc. One dataset is titled `train.csv` and the other is titled `test.csv`.\n\n`Train.csv` will contain the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 to be exact) and importantly, will reveal whether they survived or not, also known as the “ground truth”.\n\nThe `test.csv` dataset contains similar information but does not disclose the “ground truth” for each passenger. It’s your job to predict these outcomes.\n\nUsing the patterns you find in the `train.csv` data, predict whether the other 418 passengers on board (found in `test.csv`) survived.\n\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data\">“Data” tab</a> to explore the datasets even further. Once you feel you’ve created a competitive model, submit it to Kaggle to see where your model stands on our leaderboard against other Kagglers.\n\n## How to Submit your Prediction to Kaggle\nOnce you’re ready to make a submission and get on the leaderboard:\n\n1. Click on the “Submit Predictions” button\n<img width=\"699\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen1.png\">\n1. Upload a CSV file in the submission file format. You’re able to submit 10 submissions a day.\n<img width=\"699\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen2.png\">\n\n## Submission File Format:\nYou should submit a csv file with exactly 418 entries plus a header row. Your submission will show an error if you have extra columns (beyond `PassengerId` and `Survived`) or rows.\n\nThe file should have exactly 2 columns:\n- `PassengerId` (sorted in any order)\n- `Survived` (contains your binary predictions: 1 for survived, 0 for deceased)\n\n## Got it! I’m ready to get started. Where do I get help if I need it?\n- For Competition Help: <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\">Titanic Discussion Forum</a>\n\nKaggle doesn’t have a dedicated team to help troubleshoot your code so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. The forums are full of useful information on the data, metric, and different approaches. We encourage you to use the forums often. If you share your knowledge, you'll find that others will share a lot in turn!\n\n## A Last Word on Kaggle Notebooks\nAs we mentioned before, Kaggle Notebooks is our no-setup, customizable, Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs and a huge repository of community published data &amp; code.\n\nIn every competition, you’ll find many Notebooks shared with incredible insights. It’s an invaluable resource worth becoming familiar with. Check out this competition’s Notebooks <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/notebooks\">here</a>.\n\n## 🏃‍♀Ready to Compete? <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/account/login?returnUrl=%2Fc%2Ftitanic\">Join the Competition Here!</a>\n\n## Evaluation\n\n<h2>Goal</h2>\n<p>It is your job to predict if a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic or not. <br>For each  in the test set, you must predict a 0 or 1 value for the  variable.</p>\n<h2>Metric</h2>\n<p>Your score is the percentage of passengers you correctly predict.

In laymen terms this means, it either occurred or did not occur. For example, you won or did not win, you passed the test or did not pass the test, you were accepted or not accepted, and you get the point. A common business application is churn or customer retention. Another popular use case is, healthcare's mortality rate or survival analysis.

In a nutshell stacking uses as a first-level (base), the predictions of a few basic classifiers and then uses another model at the second-level to predict the output from the earlier first-level predictions.\n\nThe Titanic dataset is a prime candidate for introducing this concept as many newcomers to Kaggle start out here. Furthermore even though stacking has been responsible for many a team winning K\n\n=== CODE 1 ===\n# Load in our libraries\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport re\nimport sklearn\nimport xgboost as xgb\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline\n\nimport plotly.offline as py\npy.init_notebook_mode(connected=True)\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\nimport plotly.tools as tls\n\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\n\n# Going to use these 5 base models for the stacking\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import (RandomForestClassifier, AdaBoostClassifier, \n                              GradientBoostingClassifier, ExtraTreesClassifier)\nfrom sklearn.svm import SVC\nfrom \n\n=== MARKDOWN 2 ===\n# Feature Exploration, Engineering and Cleaning \n\nNow we will proceed much like how most kernels in general are structured, and that is to first explore the data on hand, identify possible feature engineering opportunities as well as numerically encode any categorical features.\n\n=== CODE 3 ===\n# Load in the train and test datasets\ntrain = pd.read_csv('../input/train.csv')\ntest = pd.read_csv('../input/test.csv')\n\n# Store our passenger ID for easy access\nPassengerId = test['PassengerId']\n\ntrain.head(3)\n\n=== MARKDOWN 4 ===\nWell it is no surprise that our task is to somehow extract the information out of the categorical variables \n\n**Feature Engineering**\n\nHere, credit must be extended to Sina's very comprehensive and well-thought out notebook for the feature engineering ideas so please check out his work \n\n[Titanic Best Working Classfier][1] : by Sina\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.kaggle.com/sinakhorami/titanic/titanic-best-working-classifier\n\n=== CODE 5 ===\nfull_data = [train, test]\n\n# Some features of my own that I have added in\n# Gives the length of the name\ntrain['Name_length'] = train['Name'].apply(len)\ntest['Name_length'] = test['Name'].apply(len)\n# Feature that tells whether a passenger had a cabin on the Titanic\ntrain['Has_Cabin'] = train[\"Cabin\"].apply(lambda x: 0 if type(x) == float else 1)\ntest['Has_Cabin'] = test[\"Cabin\"].apply(lambda x: 0 if type(x) == float else 1)\n\n# Feature engineering steps taken from Sina\n# Create new feature FamilySize as a combination of SibSp and Parch\nfor dataset in full_data:\n    dataset['FamilySize'] = data\n\n=== CODE 6 ===\n# Feature selection\ndrop_elements = ['PassengerId', 'Name', 'Ticket', 'Cabin', 'SibSp']\ntrain = train.drop(drop_elements, axis = 1)\ntrain = train.drop(['CategoricalAge', 'CategoricalFare'], axis = 1)\ntest  = test.drop(drop_elements, axis = 1)\n\n=== MARKDOWN 7 ===\nAll right so now having cleaned the features and extracted relevant information and dropped the categorical columns our features should now all be numeric, a format suitable to feed into our Machine Learning models.

This is good from a point of view of feeding these features into your learning model because this means that there isn't much redundant or superfluous data in our training set and we are happy that each feature carries with it some unique information. Here are two most correlated features are that of Family size and Parch (Parents and Children). I'll still leave both features in for the purposes of this exercise.\n\n**Pairplots**\n\n\n=== CODE 12 ===\ng = sns.pairplot(train[[u'Survived', u'Pclass', u'Sex', u'Age', u'Parch', u'Fare', u'Embarked',\n       u'FamilySize', u'Title']], hue='Survived', palette = 'seismic',size=1.2,diag_kind = 'kde',diag_kws=dict(shade=True),plot_kws=dict(s=10) )\ng.set(xticklabels=[])\n\n=== MARKDOWN 13 ===\n# Ensembling & Stacking models\n\nFinally after that brief whirlwind detour with regards to feature engineering and formatting, we finally arrive at the meat and gist of the this notebook.\n\nCreating a Stacking ensemble!\n\n=== MARKDOWN 14 ===\n### Helpers via Python Classes\n\nHere we invoke the use of Python's classes to help make it more convenient for us. For any newcomers to programming, one normally hears Classes being used in conjunction with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). In short, a class helps to extend some code/program for creating objects (variables for old-school peeps) as well as to implement functions and methods specific to that class.\n\nIn the section of code below, we essentially write a class *SklearnHelper* that allows one to extend the inbuilt methods (such as train, predict and fit) common to all the Sklearn c\n\n=== CODE 15 ===\n# Some useful parameters which will come in handy later on\nntrain = train.shape[0]\nntest = test.shape[0]\nSEED = 0 # for reproducibility\nNFOLDS = 5 # set folds for out-of-fold prediction\nkf = KFold(ntrain, n_folds= NFOLDS, random_state=SEED)\n\n# Class to extend the Sklearn classifier\nclass SklearnHelper(object):\n    def __init__(self, clf, seed=0, params=None):\n        params['random_state'] = seed\n        self.clf = clf(**params)\n\n    def train(self, x_train, y_train):\n        self.clf.fit(x_train, y_train)\n\n    def predict(self, x):\n        return self.clf.predict(x)\n    \n    def fit(self,x,y)\n\n=== MARKDOWN 16 ===\nBear with me for those who already know this but for people who have not created classes or objects in Python before, let me explain what the code given above does. In creating my base classifiers, I will only use the models already present in the Sklearn library and therefore only extend the class for that.\n\n**def init** : Python standard for invoking the default constructor for the class. This means that when you want to create an object (classifier), you have to give it the parameters of clf (what sklearn classifier you want), seed (random seed) and params (parameters for the classifiers).\n\n\n=== MARKDOWN 17 ===\n### Out-of-Fold Predictions\n\nNow as alluded to above in the introductory section, stacking uses predictions of base classifiers as input for training to a second-level model. However one cannot simply train the base models on the full training data, generate predictions on the full test set and then output these for the second-level training. This runs the risk of your base model predictions already having \"seen\" the test set and therefore overfitting when feeding these predictions.\n\n=== CODE 18 ===\ndef get_oof(clf, x_train, y_train, x_test):\n    oof_train = np.zeros((ntrain,))\n    oof_test = np.zeros((ntest,))\n    oof_test_skf = np.empty((NFOLDS, ntest))\n\n    for i, (train_index, test_index) in enumerate(kf):\n        x_tr = x_train[train_index]\n        y_tr = y_train[train_index]\n        x_te = x_train[test_index]\n\n        clf.train(x_tr, y_tr)\n\n        oof_train[test_index] = clf.predict(x_te)\n        oof_test_skf[i, :] = clf.predict(x_test)\n\n    oof_test[:] = oof_test_skf.mean(axis=0)\n    return oof_train.reshape(-1, 1), oof_test.reshape(-1, 1)\n\n=== MARKDOWN 19 ===\n# Generating our Base First-Level Models \n\nSo now let us prepare five learning models as our first level classification.

It was built to optimize large-scale boosted tree algorithms. For further information about the algorithm, check out the [official documentation][1].\n\n  [1]: https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n\nAnyways, we call an XGBClassifier and fit it to the first-level train and target data and use the learned model to predict the test data as follows:\n\n=== CODE 49 ===\ngbm = xgb.XGBClassifier(\n    #learning_rate = 0.02,\n n_estimators= 2000,\n max_depth= 4,\n min_child_weight= 2,\n #gamma=1,\n gamma=0.9,                        \n subsample=0.8,\n colsample_bytree=0.8,\n objective= 'binary:logistic',\n nthread= -1,\n scale_pos_weight=1).fit(x_train, y_train)\npredictions = gbm.predict(x_test)\n\n=== MARKDOWN 50 ===\nJust a quick run down of the XGBoost parameters used in the model:\n\n**max_depth** : How deep you want to grow your tree. Beware if set to too high a number might run the risk of overfitting.\n\n**gamma** : minimum loss reduction required to make a further partition on a leaf node of the tree. The larger, the more conservative the algorithm will be.\n\n**eta** : step size shrinkage used in each boosting step to prevent overfitting\n\n=== MARKDOWN 51 ===\n**Producing the Submission file**\n\nFinally having trained and fit all our first-level and second-level models, we can now output the predictions into the proper format for submission to the Titanic competition as follows:\n\n=== CODE 52 ===\n# Generate Submission File \nStackingSubmission = pd.DataFrame({ 'PassengerId': PassengerId,\n                            'Survived': predictions })\nStackingSubmission.to_csv(\"StackingSubmission.csv\", index=False)\n\n=== MARKDOWN 53 ===\n**Steps for Further Improvement**\n\nAs a closing remark it must be noted that the steps taken above just show a very simple way of producing an ensemble stacker. You hear of ensembles created at the highest level of Kaggle competitions which involves monstrous combinations of stacked classifiers as well as levels of stacking which go to more than 2 levels. \n\nSome additional steps that may be taken to improve one's score could be:\n\n 1. Implementing a good cross-validation strategy in training the models to find optimal parameter values\n 2. Introduce a greater variety of base models for learning.\n\n=== MARKDOWN 54 ===\n### Conclusion\n\nI have this notebook has been helpful somewhat in introducing a working script for stacking learning models. Again credit must be extended to Faron and Sina. \n\nFor other excellent material on stacking or ensembling in general, refer to the de-facto Must read article on the website MLWave: [Kaggle Ensembling Guide][1]. \n\nTill next time, Peace Out\n\n  [1]: http://mlwave.com/kaggle-ensembling-guide/\n\n=== CODE 55 ===\n\n\n\ntool: ✓ Recorded finding: Feature Engineering: FamilySize = SibSp + Parch + 1; IsAlone = 1 if FamilySize == 1; Title extracted...\n  Source: ../research/kernels/ldfreeman3_a-data-science-framework-to-achieve-99-accuracy\ntool: ✓ Recorded finding: Stacking Ensemble: Use 5 base models (RandomForest, ExtraTrees, AdaBoost, GradientBoosting, SVC) wit...\n  Source: ../research/kernels/arthurtok_introduction-to-ensembling-stacking-in-python\ntool: ✓ Recorded finding: Important features by importance: Title (especially 'Master' for male survival), Sex, Pclass, Age, F...\n  Source: ../research/kernels/arthurtok_introduction-to-ensembling-stacking-in-python\ntool: Created: /home/code/exploration/eda.ipynb\n\nStrong Note: OOM is unrecoverable.

Then check out <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/titanic-tutorial\">Alexis Cook’s Titanic Tutorial</a> that walks you through step by step how to make your first submission!\\n\\n<iframe width=\"699\" height=\"368\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8yZMXCaFshs\" title=\"YouTube video | How to Get Started with Kaggle’s Titanic Competition | Kaggle\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n\\n## The Challenge\\nThe sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.\\n\\nOn April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.\\n\\nWhile there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.\\n\\nIn this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).\\n\\n> #### Recommended Tutorial\\n> We highly recommend [Alexis Cook’s Titanic Tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/titanic-tutorial) that walks you through making your very first submission step by step and [this starter notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/gusthema/titanic-competition-w-tensorflow-decision-forests) to get started.\\n\\n## How Kaggle’s Competitions Work\\n1. **Join the Competition**\\nRead about the challenge description, accept the Competition Rules and gain access to the competition dataset.\\n1.  **Get to Work**\\nDownload the data, build models on it locally or on Kaggle Notebooks (our no-setup, customizable Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs) and generate a prediction file.\\n1.  **Make a Submission**\\nUpload your prediction as a submission on Kaggle and receive an accuracy score.\\n1.  **Check the Leaderboard**\\nSee how your model ranks against other Kagglers on our leaderboard. \\n1.  **Improve Your Score**\\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a> to find lots of tutorials and insights from other competitors.\\n\\n> #### Kaggle Lingo Video\\n> You may run into unfamiliar lingo as you dig into the Kaggle discussion forums and public notebooks. Check out  Dr. Rachael Tatman’s [video on Kaggle Lingo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEJHyuWKd-s) to get up to speed!\\n\\n## What Data Will I Use in This Competition?\\nIn this competition, you’ll gain access to two similar datasets that include passenger information like name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc. One dataset is titled `train.csv` and the other is titled `test.csv`.\\n\\n`Train.csv` will contain the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 to be exact) and importantly, will reveal whether they survived or not, also known as the “ground truth”.\\n\\nThe `test.csv` dataset contains similar information but does not disclose the “ground truth” for each passenger. It’s your job to predict these outcomes.\\n\\nUsing the patterns you find in the `train.csv` data, predict whether the other 418 passengers on board (found in `test.csv`) survived.\\n\\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data\">“Data” tab</a> to explore the datasets even further. Once you feel you’ve created a competitive model, submit it to Kaggle to see where your model stands on our leaderboard against other Kagglers.\\n\\n## How to Submit your Prediction to Kaggle\\nOnce you’re ready to make a submission and get on the leaderboard:\\n\\n1. Click on the “Submit Predictions” button\\n<img width=\"699\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen1.png\">\\n1. Upload a CSV file in the submission file format. You’re able to submit 10 submissions a day.\\n<img width=\"699\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen2.png\">\\n\\n## Submission File Format:\\nYou should submit a csv file with exactly 418 entries plus a header row. Your submission will show an error if you have extra columns (beyond `PassengerId` and `Survived`) or rows.\\n\\nThe file should have exactly 2 columns:\\n- `PassengerId` (sorted in any order)\\n- `Survived` (contains your binary predictions: 1 for survived, 0 for deceased)\\n\\n## Got it! I’m ready to get started. Where do I get help if I need it?\\n- For Competition Help: <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\">Titanic Discussion Forum</a>\\n\\nKaggle doesn’t have a dedicated team to help troubleshoot your code so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. The forums are full of useful information on the data, metric, and different approaches. We encourage you to use the forums often. If you share your knowledge, you\\'ll find that others will share a lot in turn!\\n\\n## A Last Word on Kaggle Notebooks\\nAs we mentioned before, Kaggle Notebooks is our no-setup, customizable, Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs and a huge repository of community published data &amp; code.\\n\\nIn every competition, you’ll find many Notebooks shared with incredible insights. It’s an invaluable resource worth becoming familiar with. Check out this competition’s Notebooks <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/notebooks\">here</a>.\\n\\n## 🏃\\u200d♀Ready to Compete? <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/account/login?returnUrl=%2Fc%2Ftitanic\">Join the Competition Here!</a>\\n\\n## Evaluation\\n\\n<h2>Goal</h2>\\n<p>It is your job to predict if a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic or not. <br>For each  in the test set, you must predict a 0 or 1 value for the  variable.</p>\\n<h2>Metric</h2>\\n<p>Your score is the percentage of passengers you correctly predict. This is known as <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision#In_binary_classification\">accuracy</a>.</p>\\n<h2>Submission File Format</h2>\\n<p>You should submit a csv file with exactly 418 entries <b>plus</b> a header row. Your submission will show an error if you have extra columns (beyond PassengerId and Survived) or rows.<br><br>The file should have exactly 2 columns:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>PassengerId (sorted in any order)</li>\\n<li>Survived (contains your binary predictions: 1 for survived, 0 for deceased)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<pre><b>PassengerId,Survived</b><br>892,0<br>893,1<br>894,0<br>Etc.</pre>\\n<p>You can download an example submission file (gender_submission.csv) on the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data\">Data page</a>.</p>\\n\\n## data-description\\n\\n<h3>Overview</h3>\\n<p>The data has been split into two groups:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>training set (train.csv)</li>\\n<li>test set (test.csv)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><b> The training set </b>should be used to build your machine learning models. For the training set, we provide the outcome (also known as the “ground truth”) for each passenger. Your model will be based on “features” like passengers’ gender and class. You can also use <a href=\"https://triangleinequality.wordpress.com/2013/09/08/basic-feature-engineering-with-the-titanic-data/\" target=\"_blank\"> feature engineering </a>to create new features.</p>\\n<p><b>The test set </b>should be used to see how well your model performs on unseen data. For the test set, we do not provide the ground truth for each passenger. It is your job to predict these outcomes. For each passenger in the test set, use the model you trained to predict whether or not they survived the sinking of the Titanic.</p>\\n<p>We also include <b>gender_submission.csv</b>, a set of predictions that assume all and only female passengers survive, as an example of what a submission file should look like.</p>\\n<h3>Data Dictionary</h3>\\n<table style=\"width: 100%;\">\\n<tbody>\\n<tr><th><b>Variable</b></th><th><b>Definition</b></th><th><b>Key</b></th></tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>survival</td>\\n<td>Survival</td>\\n<td>0 = No, 1 = Yes</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>pclass</td>\\n<td>Ticket class</td>\\n<td>1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>sex</td>\\n<td>Sex</td>\\n<td></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Age</td>\\n<td>Age in years</td>\\n<td></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>sibsp</td>\\n<td># of siblings / spouses aboard the Titanic</td>\\n<td></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>parch</td>\\n<td># of parents / children aboard the Titanic</td>\\n<td></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>ticket</td>\\n<td>Ticket number</td>\\n<td></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>fare</td>\\n<td>Passenger fare</td>\\n<td></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>cabin</td>\\n<td>Cabin number</td>\\n<td></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>embarked</td>\\n<td>Port of Embarkation</td>\\n<td>C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton</td>\\n</tr>\\n</tbody>\\n</table>\\n<h3>Variable Notes</h3>\\n<p><b>pclass</b>: A proxy for socio-economic status (SES)<br /> 1st = Upper<br /> 2nd = Middle<br /> 3rd = Lower<br /><br /> <b>age</b>: Age is fractional if less than 1.

They are a great place to begin if you are new to data science or just finished a MOOC and want to get involved in Kaggle.</p>\\n<p>Getting Started competitions are a non-competitive way to get familiar with Kaggle’s platform, learn basic machine learning concepts, and start meeting people in the community. They have no cash prize and are on a rolling timeline.</p>\\n<h2>How do I create and manage a team?</h2>\\n<p>When you accept the competition rules, a team will be created for you. You can invite others to your team, accept a merger with another team, and update basic information like team name by going to the More &gt; <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/team\" target=\"_blank\">Team</a> page.</p>\\n<p>We\\'ve heard from many Kagglers that teaming up is the best way to learn new skills AND have fun. If you don\\'t have a teammate already, consider asking if anyone wants to team up in the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a>.</p>\\n<h2>What are Notebooks?</h2>\\n<p>Kaggle Notebooks is a cloud computational environment that enables reproducible and collaborative analysis. Notebooks support scripts in Python and R, Jupyter Notebooks, and RMarkdown reports. You can visit the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/notebooks\" target=\"_blank\">Notebooks</a> tab to view all of the publicly shared code for the Titanic competition. For more on how to use Notebooks to learn data science, check out our <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview\" target=\"&quot;_blank\">Courses</a>!</p>\\n<h2>Why did my team disappear from the leaderboard?</h2>\\n<p>To keep with the spirit of getting-started competitions, we have implemented a two month rolling window on submissions. Once a submission is more than two months old, it will be invalidated and no longer count towards the leaderboard.</p>\\n<p>If your team has no submissions in the previous two months, the team will also drop from the leaderboard. This will keep the leaderboard at a manageable size, freshen it up, and prevent newcomers from getting lost in a sea of abandoned scores.</p>\\n<p><i>\"I worked so hard to get that score! Give it back!\"</i> Read more about our decision to implement a rolling leaderboard <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion/6240\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\\n<h2>How do I contact Support?</h2>\\n<p>Kaggle does not have a dedicated support team so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. (For this competition, you’ll want to use the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">Titanic discussion forum)</a>.</p>\\n<p>Support is only able to help with issues that are being experienced by all participants. Before contacting support, please check the discussion forum for information on your problem. If you can’t find it, you can post your problem in the forum so a fellow participant or a Kaggle team member can provide help. The forums are full of useful information on the data, metric, and different approaches. We encourage you to use the forums often. If you share your knowledge, you\\'ll find that others will share a lot in turn!</p>\\n<p>If your problem persists or it seems to be effective all participants then please <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/contact\" target=\"_blank\">contact us</a>.</p>'}, {'role': 'tool', 'content': 'Not a directory: /home/code/exploration/../research/writeups'}, {'role': 'tool', 'content': '/home/code/exploration/../research/kernels:\\n[DIR]  alexisbcook_exercise-arithmetic-and-variables/\\n[DIR]  alexisbcook_titanic-tutorial/\\n[DIR]  arthurtok_introduction-to-ensembling-stacking-in-python/\\n[DIR]  ldfreeman3_a-data-science-framework-to-achieve-99-accuracy/\\n[FILE] metadata.json (1.7KB)\\n[DIR]  startupsci_titanic-data-science-solutions/'}, {'role': 'tool', 'content': '/home/data:\\n[FILE] description.md (13.6KB)\\n[FILE] gender_submission.csv (3.2KB)\\n[FILE] test.csv (28.0KB)\\n[FILE] train.csv (59.8KB)'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': \"REASONING: Good, I can see this is the classic Titanic survival prediction problem - binary classification with accuracy as the metric.

In laymen terms this means, it either occurred or did not occur. For example, you won or did not win, you passed the test or did not pass the test, you were accepted or not accepted, and you get the point. A common business application is churn or customer retention. Another popular use case is, healthcare\\'s mortality rate or survival analysis.

This is good from a point of view of feeding these features into your learning model because this means that there isn\\'t much redundant or superfluous data in our training set and we are happy that each feature carries with it some unique information. Here are two most correlated features are that of Family size and Parch (Parents and Children).

For any newcomers to programming, one normally hears Classes being used in conjunction with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). In short, a class helps to extend some code/program for creating objects (variables for old-school peeps) as well as to implement functions and methods specific to that class.\\n\\nIn the section of code below, we essentially write a class *SklearnHelper* that allows one to extend the inbuilt methods (such as train, predict and fit) common to all the Sklearn c\\n\\n=== CODE 15 ===\\n# Some useful parameters which will come in handy later on\\nntrain = train.shape[0]\\nntest = test.shape[0]\\nSEED = 0 # for reproducibility\\nNFOLDS = 5 # set folds for out-of-fold prediction\\nkf = KFold(ntrain, n_folds= NFOLDS, random_state=SEED)\\n\\n# Class to extend the Sklearn classifier\\nclass SklearnHelper(object):\\n    def __init__(self, clf, seed=0, params=None):\\n        params[\\'random_state\\'] = seed\\n        self.clf = clf(**params)\\n\\n    def train(self, x_train, y_train):\\n        self.clf.fit(x_train, y_train)\\n\\n    def predict(self, x):\\n        return self.clf.predict(x)\\n    \\n    def fit(self,x,y)\\n\\n=== MARKDOWN 16 ===\\nBear with me for those who already know this but for people who have not created classes or objects in Python before, let me explain what the code given above does. In creating my base classifiers, I will only use the models already present in the Sklearn library and therefore only extend the class for that.\\n\\n**def init** : Python standard for invoking the default constructor for the class. This means that when you want to create an object (classifier), you have to give it the parameters of clf (what sklearn classifier you want), seed (random seed) and params (parameters for the classifiers).\\n\\n\\n=== MARKDOWN 17 ===\\n### Out-of-Fold Predictions\\n\\nNow as alluded to above in the introductory section, stacking uses predictions of base classifiers as input for training to a second-level model. However one cannot simply train the base models on the full training data, generate predictions on the full test set and then output these for the second-level training. This runs the risk of your base model predictions already having \"seen\" the test set and therefore overfitting when feeding these predictions.\\n\\n=== CODE 18 ===\\ndef get_oof(clf, x_train, y_train, x_test):\\n    oof_train = np.zeros((ntrain,))\\n    oof_test = np.zeros((ntest,))\\n    oof_test_skf = np.empty((NFOLDS, ntest))\\n\\n    for i, (train_index, test_index) in enumerate(kf):\\n        x_tr = x_train[train_index]\\n        y_tr = y_train[train_index]\\n        x_te = x_train[test_index]\\n\\n        clf.train(x_tr, y_tr)\\n\\n        oof_train[test_index] = clf.predict(x_te)\\n        oof_test_skf[i, :] = clf.predict(x_test)\\n\\n    oof_test[:] = oof_test_skf.mean(axis=0)\\n    return oof_train.reshape(-1, 1), oof_test.reshape(-1, 1)\\n\\n=== MARKDOWN 19 ===\\n# Generating our Base First-Level Models \\n\\nSo now let us prepare five learning models as our first level classification.

As per the code below, we are therefore having as our new columns the first-level predictions from our earlier classifiers and we train the next classifier on this.\\n\\n=== CODE 42 ===\\nbase_predictions_train = pd.DataFrame( {\\'RandomForest\\': rf_oof_train.ravel(),\\n     \\'ExtraTrees\\': et_oof_train.ravel(),\\n     \\'AdaBoost\\': ada_oof_train.ravel(),\\n      \\'GradientBoost\\': gb_oof_train.ravel()\\n    })\\nbase_predictions_train.head()\\n\\n=== MARKDOWN 43 ===\\n**Correlation Heatmap of the Second Level Training set**\\n\\n=== CODE 44 ===\\ndata = [\\n    go.Heatmap(\\n        z= base_predictions_train.astype(float).corr().values ,\\n        x=base_predictions_train.columns.values,\\n        y= base_predictions_train.columns.values,\\n          colorscale=\\'Viridis\\',\\n            showscale=True,\\n            reversescale = True\\n    )\\n]\\npy.iplot(data, filename=\\'labelled-heatmap\\')\\n\\n=== MARKDOWN 45 ===\\nThere have been quite a few articles and Kaggle competition winner stories about the merits of having trained models that are more uncorrelated with one another producing better scores.\\n\\n=== CODE 46 ===\\nx_train = np.concatenate(( et_oof_train, rf_oof_train, ada_oof_train, gb_oof_train, svc_oof_train), axis=1)\\nx_test = np.concatenate(( et_oof_test, rf_oof_test, ada_oof_test, gb_oof_test, svc_oof_test), axis=1)\\n\\n=== MARKDOWN 47 ===\\nHaving now concatenated and joined both the first-level train and test predictions as x_train and x_test, we can now fit a second-level learning model.\\n\\n=== MARKDOWN 48 ===\\n### Second level learning model via XGBoost\\n\\nHere we choose the eXtremely famous library for boosted tree learning model, XGBoost. It was built to optimize large-scale boosted tree algorithms. For further information about the algorithm, check out the [official documentation][1].\\n\\n  [1]: https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\\n\\nAnyways, we call an XGBClassifier and fit it to the first-level train and target data and use the learned model to predict the test data as follows:\\n\\n=== CODE 49 ===\\ngbm = xgb.XGBClassifier(\\n    #learning_rate = 0.02,\\n n_estimators= 2000,\\n max_depth= 4,\\n min_child_weight= 2,\\n #gamma=1,\\n gamma=0.9,                        \\n subsample=0.8,\\n colsample_bytree=0.8,\\n objective= \\'binary:logistic\\',\\n nthread= -1,\\n scale_pos_weight=1).fit(x_train, y_train)\\npredictions = gbm.predict(x_test)\\n\\n=== MARKDOWN 50 ===\\nJust a quick run down of the XGBoost parameters used in the model:\\n\\n**max_depth** : How deep you want to grow your tree. Beware if set to too high a number might run the risk of overfitting.\\n\\n**gamma** : minimum loss reduction required to make a further partition on a leaf node of the tree. The larger, the more conservative the algorithm will be.\\n\\n**eta** : step size shrinkage used in each boosting step to prevent overfitting\\n\\n=== MARKDOWN 51 ===\\n**Producing the Submission file**\\n\\nFinally having trained and fit all our first-level and second-level models, we can now output the predictions into the proper format for submission to the Titanic competition as follows:\\n\\n=== CODE 52 ===\\n# Generate Submission File \\nStackingSubmission = pd.DataFrame({ \\'PassengerId\\': PassengerId,\\n                            \\'Survived\\': predictions })\\nStackingSubmission.to_csv(\"StackingSubmission.csv\", index=False)\\n\\n=== MARKDOWN 53 ===\\n**Steps for Further Improvement**\\n\\nAs a closing remark it must be noted that the steps taken above just show a very simple way of producing an ensemble stacker. You hear of ensembles created at the highest level of Kaggle competitions which involves monstrous combinations of stacked classifiers as well as levels of stacking which go to more than 2 levels. \\n\\nSome additional steps that may be taken to improve one\\'s score could be:\\n\\n 1. Implementing a good cross-validation strategy in training the models to find optimal parameter values\\n 2. Introduce a greater variety of base models for learning.\\n\\n=== MARKDOWN 54 ===\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nI have this notebook has been helpful somewhat in introducing a working script for stacking learning models. Again credit must be extended to Faron and Sina. \\n\\nFor other excellent material on stacking or ensembling in general, refer to the de-facto Must read article on the website MLWave: [Kaggle Ensembling Guide][1]. \\n\\nTill next time, Peace Out\\n\\n  [1]: http://mlwave.com/kaggle-ensembling-guide/\\n\\n=== CODE 55 ===\\n\\n\\n'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': \"REASONING: Excellent!

However many will skip some of the explanation on how the solution is developed as these notebooks are developed by experts for experts. The objective of this notebook is to follow a step-by-step workflow, explaining each step and rationale for every decision we take during solution development.\\\\n\\\\n## Workflow stages\\\\n\\\\nThe competition solution workflow goes through seven stages described in the Data Science Solutions book.\\\\n\\\\n1. Question or problem definition.\\\\n2. Acquire training and testing data.\\\\n3. Wrangle, prepare, cleanse the data.\\\\n4. Analyze, identify patterns, and explore the data.\\\\n5. Model, predict and solve the problem.\\\\n6. Visualize, report, and present the problem solving steps and final solution.\\\\n7. Supply or submit the results.\\\\n\\\\nThe workflow indicates general sequence of how each stage may follow the other. However there are use cases with exceptions.\\\\n\\\\n- We may combine mulitple workflow stages. We may analyze by visualizing data.\\\\n- Perform a stage earlier than indicated. We may analyze data before and after wrangling.\\\\n- Perform a stage multiple times in our workflow. Visualize stage may be used multiple times.\\\\n- Drop a stage altogether. We may not need supply stage to productize or service enable our dataset for a competition.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Question and problem definition\\\\n\\\\nCompetition sites like Kaggle define the problem to solve or questions to ask while providing the datasets for training your data science model and testing the model results against a test dataset. The question or problem definition for Titanic Survival competition is [described here at Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).\\\\n\\\\n> Knowing from a training set of samples listing passengers who survived or did not survive the Titanic disaster, can our model determine based on a given test dataset not containing the survival information, if these passengers in the test dataset survived or not.\\\\n\\\\nWe may also want to develop some early understanding about the domain of our problem. This is described on the [Kaggle competition description page here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). Here are the highlights to note.\\\\n\\\\n- On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. Translated 32% survival rate.\\\\n- One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew.\\\\n- Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.\\\\n\\\\n## Workflow goals\\\\n\\\\nThe data science solutions workflow solves for seven major goals.\\\\n\\\\n**Classifying.** We may want to classify or categorize our samples. We may also want to understand the implications or correlation of different classes with our solution goal.\\\\n\\\\n**Correlating.** One can approach the problem based on available features within the training dataset. Which features within the dataset contribute significantly to our solution goal? Statistically speaking is there a [correlation](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Correlation) among a feature and solution goal? As the feature values change does the solution state change as well, and visa-versa? This can be tested both for numerical and categorical features in the given dataset. We may also want to determine correlation among features other than survival for subsequent goals and workflow stages. Correlating certain features may help in creating, completing, or correcting features.\\\\n\\\\n**Converting.** For modeling stage, one needs to prepare the data. Depending on the choice of model algorithm one may require all features to be converted to numerical equivalent values. So for instance converting text categorical values to numeric values.\\\\n\\\\n**Completing.** Data preparation may also require us to estimate any missing values within a feature. Model algorithms may work best when there are no missing values.\\\\n\\\\n**Correcting.** We may also analyze the given training dataset for errors or possibly innacurate values within features and try to corrent these values or exclude the samples containing the errors. One way to do this is to detect any outliers among our samples or features. We may also completely discard a feature if it is not contribting to the analysis or may significantly skew the results.\\\\n\\\\n**Creating.** Can we create new features based on an existing feature or a set of features, such that the new feature follows the correlation, conversion, completeness goals.\\\\n\\\\n**Charting.** How to select the right visualization plots and charts depending on nature of the data and the solution goals.\\\"},{\\\"metadata\\\":{\\\"_uuid\\\":\\\"960f8b1937dc4915ce1eb0f82614b1985c4321a4\\\",\\\"_cell_guid\\\":\\\"56a3be4e-76ef-20c6-25e8-da16147cf6d7\\\"},\\\"cell_type\\\":\\\"markdown\\\",\\\"source\\\":\\\"## Refactor Release 2017-Jan-29\\\\n\\\\nWe are significantly refactoring the notebook based on (a) comments received by readers, (b) issues in porting notebook from Jupyter kernel (2.7) to Kaggle kernel (3.5), and (c) review of few more best practice kernels.\\\\n\\\\n### User comments\\\\n\\\\n- Combine training and test data for certain operations like converting titles across dataset to numerical values.

Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.\n\nWhile there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.\n\nIn this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).\n\n> #### Recommended Tutorial\n> We highly recommend [Alexis Cook’s Titanic Tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/titanic-tutorial) that walks you through making your very first submission step by step and [this starter notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/gusthema/titanic-competition-w-tensorflow-decision-forests) to get started.\n\n## How Kaggle’s Competitions Work\n1. **Join the Competition**\nRead about the challenge description, accept the Competition Rules and gain access to the competition dataset.\n1.  **Get to Work**\nDownload the data, build models on it locally or on Kaggle Notebooks (our no-setup, customizable Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs) and generate a prediction file.\n1.  **Make a Submission**\nUpload your prediction as a submission on Kaggle and receive an accuracy score.\n1.  **Check the Leaderboard**\nSee how your model ranks against other Kagglers on our leaderboard. \n1.  **Improve Your Score**\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a> to find lots of tutorials and insights from other competitors.\n\n> #### Kaggle Lingo Video\n> You may run into unfamiliar lingo as you dig into the Kaggle discussion forums and public notebooks. Check out  Dr. Rachael Tatman’s [video on Kaggle Lingo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEJHyuWKd-s) to get up to speed!\n\n## What Data Will I Use in This Competition?\nIn this competition, you’ll gain access to two similar datasets that include passenger information like name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc. One dataset is titled `train.csv` and the other is titled `test.csv`.\n\n`Train.csv` will contain the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 to be exact) and importantly, will reveal whether they survived or not, also known as the “ground truth”.\n\nThe `test.csv` dataset contains similar information but does not disclose the “ground truth” for each passenger. It’s your job to predict these outcomes.\n\nUsing the patterns you find in the `train.csv` data, predict whether the other 418 passengers on board (found in `test.csv`) survived.\n\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data\">“Data” tab</a> to explore the datasets even further. Once you feel you’ve created a competitive model, submit it to Kaggle to see where your model stands on our leaderboard against other Kagglers.\n\n## How to Submit your Prediction to Kaggle\nOnce you’re ready to make a submission and get on the leaderboard:\n\n1. Click on the “Submit Predictions” button\n<img width=\"699\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen1.png\">\n1. Upload a CSV file in the submission file format. You’re able to submit 10 submissions a day.\n<img width=\"699\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen2.png\">\n\n## Submission File Format:\nYou should submit a csv file with exactly 418 entries plus a header row. Your submission will show an error if you have extra columns (beyond `PassengerId` and `Survived`) or rows.\n\nThe file should have exactly 2 columns:\n- `PassengerId` (sorted in any order)\n- `Survived` (contains your binary predictions: 1 for survived, 0 for deceased)\n\n## Got it! I’m ready to get started. Where do I get help if I need it?\n- For Competition Help: <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\">Titanic Discussion Forum</a>\n\nKaggle doesn’t have a dedicated team to help troubleshoot your code so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. The forums are full of useful information on the data, metric, and different approaches. We encourage you to use the forums often. If you share your knowledge, you'll find that others will share a lot in turn!\n\n## A Last Word on Kaggle Notebooks\nAs we mentioned before, Kaggle Notebooks is our no-setup, customizable, Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs and a huge repository of community published data &amp; code.\n\nIn every competition, you’ll find many Notebooks shared with incredible insights. It’s an invaluable resource worth becoming familiar with. Check out this competition’s Notebooks <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/notebooks\">here</a>.\n\n## 🏃‍♀Ready to Compete? <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/account/login?returnUrl=%2Fc%2Ftitanic\">Join the Competition Here!</a>\n\n## Evaluation\n\n<h2>Goal</h2>\n<p>It is your job to predict if a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic or not. <br>For each  in the test set, you must predict a 0 or 1 value for the  variable.</p>\n<h2>Metric</h2>\n<p>Your score is the percentage of passengers you correctly predict.

They are a great place to begin if you are new to data science or just finished a MOOC and want to get involved in Kaggle.</p>\n<p>Getting Started competitions are a non-competitive way to get familiar with Kaggle’s platform, learn basic machine learning concepts, and start meeting people in the community. They have no cash prize and are on a rolling timeline.</p>\n<h2>How do I create and manage a team?</h2>\n<p>When you accept the competition rules, a team will be created for you. You can invite others to your team, accept a merger with another team, and update basic information like team name by going to the More &gt; <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/team\" target=\"_blank\">Team</a> page.</p>\n<p>We've heard from many Kagglers that teaming up is the best way to learn new skills AND have fun. If you don't have a teammate already, consider asking if anyone wants to team up in the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a>.</p>\n<h2>What are Notebooks?</h2>\n<p>Kaggle Notebooks is a cloud computational environment that enables reproducible and collaborative analysis. Notebooks support scripts in Python and R, Jupyter Notebooks, and RMarkdown reports.

Most beginners get lost in the field, because they fall into the black box approach, using libraries and algorithms they don't understand. This tutorial will give you a 1-2-year head start over your peers, by providing a framework that teaches you how-to think like a data scientist vs what to think/code. Not only will you be able to submit your first competition, but you’ll be able to solve any problem\n\n=== MARKDOWN 1 ===\n<a id=\"ch1\"></a>\n# How a Data Scientist Beat the Odds\nIt's the classical problem, predict the outcome of a binary event. In laymen terms this means, it either occurred or did not occur. For example, you won or did not win, you passed the test or did not pass the test, you were accepted or not accepted, and you get the point. A common business application is churn or customer retention. Another popular use case is, healthcare's mortality rate or survival analysis.

In a nutshell stacking uses as a first-level (base), the predictions of a few basic classifiers and then uses another model at the second-level to predict the output from the earlier first-level predictions.\n\nThe Titanic dataset is a prime candidate for introducing this concept as many newcomers to Kaggle start out here. Furthermore even though stacking has been responsible for many a team winning K\n\n=== CODE 1 ===\n# Load in our libraries\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport re\nimport sklearn\nimport xgboost as xgb\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline\n\nimport plotly.offline as py\npy.init_notebook_mode(connected=True)\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\nimport plotly.tools as tls\n\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\n\n# Going to use these 5 base models for the stacking\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import (RandomForestClassifier, AdaBoostClassifier, \n                              GradientBoostingClassifier, ExtraTreesClassifier)\nfrom sklearn.svm import SVC\nfrom \n\n=== MARKDOWN 2 ===\n# Feature Exploration, Engineering and Cleaning \n\nNow we will proceed much like how most kernels in general are structured, and that is to first explore the data on hand, identify possible feature engineering opportunities as well as numerically encode any categorical features.\n\n=== CODE 3 ===\n# Load in the train and test datasets\ntrain = pd.read_csv('../input/train.csv')\ntest = pd.read_csv('../input/test.csv')\n\n# Store our passenger ID for easy access\nPassengerId = test['PassengerId']\n\ntrain.head(3)\n\n=== MARKDOWN 4 ===\nWell it is no surprise that our task is to somehow extract the information out of the categorical variables \n\n**Feature Engineering**\n\nHere, credit must be extended to Sina's very comprehensive and well-thought out notebook for the feature engineering ideas so please check out his work \n\n[Titanic Best Working Classfier][1] : by Sina\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.kaggle.com/sinakhorami/titanic/titanic-best-working-classifier\n\n=== CODE 5 ===\nfull_data = [train, test]\n\n# Some features of my own that I have added in\n# Gives the length of the name\ntrain['Name_length'] = train['Name'].apply(len)\ntest['Name_length'] = test['Name'].apply(len)\n# Feature that tells whether a passenger had a cabin on the Titanic\ntrain['Has_Cabin'] = train[\"Cabin\"].apply(lambda x: 0 if type(x) == float else 1)\ntest['Has_Cabin'] = test[\"Cabin\"].apply(lambda x: 0 if type(x) == float else 1)\n\n# Feature engineering steps taken from Sina\n# Create new feature FamilySize as a combination of SibSp and Parch\nfor dataset in full_data:\n    dataset['FamilySize'] = data\n\n=== CODE 6 ===\n# Feature selection\ndrop_elements = ['PassengerId', 'Name', 'Ticket', 'Cabin', 'SibSp']\ntrain = train.drop(drop_elements, axis = 1)\ntrain = train.drop(['CategoricalAge', 'CategoricalFare'], axis = 1)\ntest  = test.drop(drop_elements, axis = 1)\n\n=== MARKDOWN 7 ===\nAll right so now having cleaned the features and extracted relevant information and dropped the categorical columns our features should now all be numeric, a format suitable to feed into our Machine Learning models.

This is good from a point of view of feeding these features into your learning model because this means that there isn't much redundant or superfluous data in our training set and we are happy that each feature carries with it some unique information. Here are two most correlated features are that of Family size and Parch (Parents and Children). I'll still leave both features in for the purposes of this exercise.\n\n**Pairplots**\n\n\n=== CODE 12 ===\ng = sns.pairplot(train[[u'Survived', u'Pclass', u'Sex', u'Age', u'Parch', u'Fare', u'Embarked',\n       u'FamilySize', u'Title']], hue='Survived', palette = 'seismic',size=1.2,diag_kind = 'kde',diag_kws=dict(shade=True),plot_kws=dict(s=10) )\ng.set(xticklabels=[])\n\n=== MARKDOWN 13 ===\n# Ensembling & Stacking models\n\nFinally after that brief whirlwind detour with regards to feature engineering and formatting, we finally arrive at the meat and gist of the this notebook.\n\nCreating a Stacking ensemble!\n\n=== MARKDOWN 14 ===\n### Helpers via Python Classes\n\nHere we invoke the use of Python's classes to help make it more convenient for us. For any newcomers to programming, one normally hears Classes being used in conjunction with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). In short, a class helps to extend some code/program for creating objects (variables for old-school peeps) as well as to implement functions and methods specific to that class.\n\nIn the section of code below, we essentially write a class *SklearnHelper* that allows one to extend the inbuilt methods (such as train, predict and fit) common to all the Sklearn c\n\n=== CODE 15 ===\n# Some useful parameters which will come in handy later on\nntrain = train.shape[0]\nntest = test.shape[0]\nSEED = 0 # for reproducibility\nNFOLDS = 5 # set folds for out-of-fold prediction\nkf = KFold(ntrain, n_folds= NFOLDS, random_state=SEED)\n\n# Class to extend the Sklearn classifier\nclass SklearnHelper(object):\n    def __init__(self, clf, seed=0, params=None):\n        params['random_state'] = seed\n        self.clf = clf(**params)\n\n    def train(self, x_train, y_train):\n        self.clf.fit(x_train, y_train)\n\n    def predict(self, x):\n        return self.clf.predict(x)\n    \n    def fit(self,x,y)\n\n=== MARKDOWN 16 ===\nBear with me for those who already know this but for people who have not created classes or objects in Python before, let me explain what the code given above does. In creating my base classifiers, I will only use the models already present in the Sklearn library and therefore only extend the class for that.\n\n**def init** : Python standard for invoking the default constructor for the class. This means that when you want to create an object (classifier), you have to give it the parameters of clf (what sklearn classifier you want), seed (random seed) and params (parameters for the classifiers).\n\n\n=== MARKDOWN 17 ===\n### Out-of-Fold Predictions\n\nNow as alluded to above in the introductory section, stacking uses predictions of base classifiers as input for training to a second-level model. However one cannot simply train the base models on the full training data, generate predictions on the full test set and then output these for the second-level training. This runs the risk of your base model predictions already having \"seen\" the test set and therefore overfitting when feeding these predictions.\n\n=== CODE 18 ===\ndef get_oof(clf, x_train, y_train, x_test):\n    oof_train = np.zeros((ntrain,))\n    oof_test = np.zeros((ntest,))\n    oof_test_skf = np.empty((NFOLDS, ntest))\n\n    for i, (train_index, test_index) in enumerate(kf):\n        x_tr = x_train[train_index]\n        y_tr = y_train[train_index]\n        x_te = x_train[test_index]\n\n        clf.train(x_tr, y_tr)\n\n        oof_train[test_index] = clf.predict(x_te)\n        oof_test_skf[i, :] = clf.predict(x_test)\n\n    oof_test[:] = oof_test_skf.mean(axis=0)\n    return oof_train.reshape(-1, 1), oof_test.reshape(-1, 1)\n\n=== MARKDOWN 19 ===\n# Generating our Base First-Level Models \n\nSo now let us prepare five learning models as our first level classification. These models can all be conveniently invoked via the Sklearn library and are listed as follows:\n\n 1. Random Forest classifier\n 2. Extra Trees classifier\n 3. AdaBoost classifer\n 4.

It was built to optimize large-scale boosted tree algorithms. For further information about the algorithm, check out the [official documentation][1].\n\n  [1]: https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n\nAnyways, we call an XGBClassifier and fit it to the first-level train and target data and use the learned model to predict the test data as follows:\n\n=== CODE 49 ===\ngbm = xgb.XGBClassifier(\n    #learning_rate = 0.02,\n n_estimators= 2000,\n max_depth= 4,\n min_child_weight= 2,\n #gamma=1,\n gamma=0.9,                        \n subsample=0.8,\n colsample_bytree=0.8,\n objective= 'binary:logistic',\n nthread= -1,\n scale_pos_weight=1).fit(x_train, y_train)\npredictions = gbm.predict(x_test)\n\n=== MARKDOWN 50 ===\nJust a quick run down of the XGBoost parameters used in the model:\n\n**max_depth** : How deep you want to grow your tree. Beware if set to too high a number might run the risk of overfitting.\n\n**gamma** : minimum loss reduction required to make a further partition on a leaf node of the tree. The larger, the more conservative the algorithm will be.\n\n**eta** : step size shrinkage used in each boosting step to prevent overfitting\n\n=== MARKDOWN 51 ===\n**Producing the Submission file**\n\nFinally having trained and fit all our first-level and second-level models, we can now output the predictions into the proper format for submission to the Titanic competition as follows:\n\n=== CODE 52 ===\n# Generate Submission File \nStackingSubmission = pd.DataFrame({ 'PassengerId': PassengerId,\n                            'Survived': predictions })\nStackingSubmission.to_csv(\"StackingSubmission.csv\", index=False)\n\n=== MARKDOWN 53 ===\n**Steps for Further Improvement**\n\nAs a closing remark it must be noted that the steps taken above just show a very simple way of producing an ensemble stacker. You hear of ensembles created at the highest level of Kaggle competitions which involves monstrous combinations of stacked classifiers as well as levels of stacking which go to more than 2 levels. \n\nSome additional steps that may be taken to improve one's score could be:\n\n 1. Implementing a good cross-validation strategy in training the models to find optimal parameter values\n 2. Introduce a greater variety of base models for learning.\n\n=== MARKDOWN 54 ===\n### Conclusion\n\nI have this notebook has been helpful somewhat in introducing a working script for stacking learning models. Again credit must be extended to Faron and Sina. \n\nFor other excellent material on stacking or ensembling in general, refer to the de-facto Must read article on the website MLWave: [Kaggle Ensembling Guide][1]. \n\nTill next time, Peace Out\n\n  [1]: http://mlwave.com/kaggle-ensembling-guide/\n\n=== CODE 55 ===\n\n\n\ntool: ✓ Recorded finding: Feature Engineering: FamilySize = SibSp + Parch + 1; IsAlone = 1 if FamilySize == 1; Title extracted...\n  Source: ../research/kernels/ldfreeman3_a-data-science-framework-to-achieve-99-accuracy\ntool: ✓ Recorded finding: Stacking Ensemble: Use 5 base models (RandomForest, ExtraTrees, AdaBoost, GradientBoosting, SVC) wit...\n  Source: ../research/kernels/arthurtok_introduction-to-ensembling-stacking-in-python\ntool: ✓ Recorded finding: Important features by importance: Title (especially 'Master' for male survival), Sex, Pclass, Age, F...\n  Source: ../research/kernels/arthurtok_introduction-to-ensembling-stacking-in-python\ntool: Created: /home/code/exploration/eda.ipynb\n\nStrong Note: OOM is unrecoverable.

However many will skip some of the explanation on how the solution is developed as these notebooks are developed by experts for experts. The objective of this notebook is to follow a step-by-step workflow, explaining each step and rationale for every decision we take during solution development.\\n\\n## Workflow stages\\n\\nThe competition solution workflow goes through seven stages described in the Data Science Solutions book.\\n\\n1. Question or problem definition.\\n2. Acquire training and testing data.\\n3. Wrangle, prepare, cleanse the data.\\n4. Analyze, identify patterns, and explore the data.\\n5. Model, predict and solve the problem.\\n6. Visualize, report, and present the problem solving steps and final solution.\\n7. Supply or submit the results.\\n\\nThe workflow indicates general sequence of how each stage may follow the other. However there are use cases with exceptions.\\n\\n- We may combine mulitple workflow stages. We may analyze by visualizing data.\\n- Perform a stage earlier than indicated. We may analyze data before and after wrangling.\\n- Perform a stage multiple times in our workflow. Visualize stage may be used multiple times.\\n- Drop a stage altogether. We may not need supply stage to productize or service enable our dataset for a competition.\\n\\n\\n## Question and problem definition\\n\\nCompetition sites like Kaggle define the problem to solve or questions to ask while providing the datasets for training your data science model and testing the model results against a test dataset. The question or problem definition for Titanic Survival competition is [described here at Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).\\n\\n> Knowing from a training set of samples listing passengers who survived or did not survive the Titanic disaster, can our model determine based on a given test dataset not containing the survival information, if these passengers in the test dataset survived or not.\\n\\nWe may also want to develop some early understanding about the domain of our problem. This is described on the [Kaggle competition description page here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). Here are the highlights to note.\\n\\n- On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. Translated 32% survival rate.\\n- One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew.\\n- Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.\\n\\n## Workflow goals\\n\\nThe data science solutions workflow solves for seven major goals.\\n\\n**Classifying.** We may want to classify or categorize our samples. We may also want to understand the implications or correlation of different classes with our solution goal.\\n\\n**Correlating.** One can approach the problem based on available features within the training dataset. Which features within the dataset contribute significantly to our solution goal? Statistically speaking is there a [correlation](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Correlation) among a feature and solution goal? As the feature values change does the solution state change as well, and visa-versa? This can be tested both for numerical and categorical features in the given dataset. We may also want to determine correlation among features other than survival for subsequent goals and workflow stages. Correlating certain features may help in creating, completing, or correcting features.\\n\\n**Converting.** For modeling stage, one needs to prepare the data. Depending on the choice of model algorithm one may require all features to be converted to numerical equivalent values. So for instance converting text categorical values to numeric values.\\n\\n**Completing.** Data preparation may also require us to estimate any missing values within a feature. Model algorithms may work best when there are no missing values.\\n\\n**Correcting.** We may also analyze the given training dataset for errors or possibly innacurate values within features and try to corrent these values or exclude the samples containing the errors. One way to do this is to detect any outliers among our samples or features. We may also completely discard a feature if it is not contribting to the analysis or may significantly skew the results.\\n\\n**Creating.** Can we create new features based on an existing feature or a set of features, such that the new feature follows the correlation, conversion, completeness goals.\\n\\n**Charting.** How to select the right visualization plots and charts depending on nature of the data and the solution goals.\"},{\"metadata\":{\"_uuid\":\"960f8b1937dc4915ce1eb0f82614b1985c4321a4\",\"_cell_guid\":\"56a3be4e-76ef-20c6-25e8-da16147cf6d7\"},\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"source\":\"## Refactor Release 2017-Jan-29\\n\\nWe are significantly refactoring the notebook based on (a) comments received by readers, (b) issues in porting notebook from Jupyter kernel (2.7) to Kaggle kernel (3.5), and (c) review of few more best practice kernels.\\n\\n### User comments\\n\\n- Combine training and test data for certain operations like converting titles across dataset to numerical values.

Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.\\n\\nWhile there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.\\n\\nIn this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).\\n\\n> #### Recommended Tutorial\\n> We highly recommend [Alexis Cook’s Titanic Tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/titanic-tutorial) that walks you through making your very first submission step by step and [this starter notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/gusthema/titanic-competition-w-tensorflow-decision-forests) to get started.\\n\\n## How Kaggle’s Competitions Work\\n1. **Join the Competition**\\nRead about the challenge description, accept the Competition Rules and gain access to the competition dataset.\\n1.  **Get to Work**\\nDownload the data, build models on it locally or on Kaggle Notebooks (our no-setup, customizable Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs) and generate a prediction file.\\n1.  **Make a Submission**\\nUpload your prediction as a submission on Kaggle and receive an accuracy score.\\n1.  **Check the Leaderboard**\\nSee how your model ranks against other Kagglers on our leaderboard. \\n1.  **Improve Your Score**\\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a> to find lots of tutorials and insights from other competitors.\\n\\n> #### Kaggle Lingo Video\\n> You may run into unfamiliar lingo as you dig into the Kaggle discussion forums and public notebooks. Check out  Dr. Rachael Tatman’s [video on Kaggle Lingo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEJHyuWKd-s) to get up to speed!\\n\\n## What Data Will I Use in This Competition?\\nIn this competition, you’ll gain access to two similar datasets that include passenger information like name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc. One dataset is titled `train.csv` and the other is titled `test.csv`.\\n\\n`Train.csv` will contain the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 to be exact) and importantly, will reveal whether they survived or not, also known as the “ground truth”.\\n\\nThe `test.csv` dataset contains similar information but does not disclose the “ground truth” for each passenger. It’s your job to predict these outcomes.\\n\\nUsing the patterns you find in the `train.csv` data, predict whether the other 418 passengers on board (found in `test.csv`) survived.\\n\\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data\">“Data” tab</a> to explore the datasets even further. Once you feel you’ve created a competitive model, submit it to Kaggle to see where your model stands on our leaderboard against other Kagglers.\\n\\n## How to Submit your Prediction to Kaggle\\nOnce you’re ready to make a submission and get on the leaderboard:\\n\\n1. Click on the “Submit Predictions” button\\n<img width=\"699\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen1.png\">\\n1. Upload a CSV file in the submission file format. You’re able to submit 10 submissions a day.\\n<img width=\"699\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen2.png\">\\n\\n## Submission File Format:\\nYou should submit a csv file with exactly 418 entries plus a header row. Your submission will show an error if you have extra columns (beyond `PassengerId` and `Survived`) or rows.\\n\\nThe file should have exactly 2 columns:\\n- `PassengerId` (sorted in any order)\\n- `Survived` (contains your binary predictions: 1 for survived, 0 for deceased)\\n\\n## Got it! I’m ready to get started. Where do I get help if I need it?\\n- For Competition Help: <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\">Titanic Discussion Forum</a>\\n\\nKaggle doesn’t have a dedicated team to help troubleshoot your code so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. The forums are full of useful information on the data, metric, and different approaches. We encourage you to use the forums often. If you share your knowledge, you\\'ll find that others will share a lot in turn!\\n\\n## A Last Word on Kaggle Notebooks\\nAs we mentioned before, Kaggle Notebooks is our no-setup, customizable, Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs and a huge repository of community published data &amp; code.\\n\\nIn every competition, you’ll find many Notebooks shared with incredible insights. It’s an invaluable resource worth becoming familiar with.

They are a great place to begin if you are new to data science or just finished a MOOC and want to get involved in Kaggle.</p>\\n<p>Getting Started competitions are a non-competitive way to get familiar with Kaggle’s platform, learn basic machine learning concepts, and start meeting people in the community. They have no cash prize and are on a rolling timeline.</p>\\n<h2>How do I create and manage a team?</h2>\\n<p>When you accept the competition rules, a team will be created for you. You can invite others to your team, accept a merger with another team, and update basic information like team name by going to the More &gt; <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/team\" target=\"_blank\">Team</a> page.</p>\\n<p>We\\'ve heard from many Kagglers that teaming up is the best way to learn new skills AND have fun. If you don\\'t have a teammate already, consider asking if anyone wants to team up in the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a>.</p>\\n<h2>What are Notebooks?</h2>\\n<p>Kaggle Notebooks is a cloud computational environment that enables reproducible and collaborative analysis. Notebooks support scripts in Python and R, Jupyter Notebooks, and RMarkdown reports. You can visit the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/notebooks\" target=\"_blank\">Notebooks</a> tab to view all of the publicly shared code for the Titanic competition. For more on how to use Notebooks to learn data science, check out our <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview\" target=\"&quot;_blank\">Courses</a>!</p>\\n<h2>Why did my team disappear from the leaderboard?</h2>\\n<p>To keep with the spirit of getting-started competitions, we have implemented a two month rolling window on submissions. Once a submission is more than two months old, it will be invalidated and no longer count towards the leaderboard.</p>\\n<p>If your team has no submissions in the previous two months, the team will also drop from the leaderboard. This will keep the leaderboard at a manageable size, freshen it up, and prevent newcomers from getting lost in a sea of abandoned scores.</p>\\n<p><i>\"I worked so hard to get that score! Give it back!\"</i> Read more about our decision to implement a rolling leaderboard <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion/6240\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\\n<h2>How do I contact Support?</h2>\\n<p>Kaggle does not have a dedicated support team so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. (For this competition, you’ll want to use the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">Titanic discussion forum)</a>.</p>\\n<p>Support is only able to help with issues that are being experienced by all participants. Before contacting support, please check the discussion forum for information on your problem. If you can’t find it, you can post your problem in the forum so a fellow participant or a Kaggle team member can provide help. The forums are full of useful information on the data, metric, and different approaches. We encourage you to use the forums often. If you share your knowledge, you\\'ll find that others will share a lot in turn!</p>\\n<p>If your problem persists or it seems to be effective all participants then please <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/contact\" target=\"_blank\">contact us</a>.</p>'}, {'role': 'tool', 'content': 'Not a directory: /home/code/exploration/../research/writeups'}, {'role': 'tool', 'content': '/home/code/exploration/../research/kernels:\\n[DIR]  alexisbcook_exercise-arithmetic-and-variables/\\n[DIR]  alexisbcook_titanic-tutorial/\\n[DIR]  arthurtok_introduction-to-ensembling-stacking-in-python/\\n[DIR]  ldfreeman3_a-data-science-framework-to-achieve-99-accuracy/\\n[FILE] metadata.json (1.7KB)\\n[DIR]  startupsci_titanic-data-science-solutions/'}, {'role': 'tool', 'content': '/home/data:\\n[FILE] description.md (13.6KB)\\n[FILE] gender_submission.csv (3.2KB)\\n[FILE] test.csv (28.0KB)\\n[FILE] train.csv (59.8KB)'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': \"REASONING: Good, I can see this is the classic Titanic survival prediction problem - binary classification with accuracy as the metric.

In a nutshell stacking uses as a first-level (base), the predictions of a few basic classifiers and then uses another model at the second-level to predict the output from the earlier first-level predictions.\\n\\nThe Titanic dataset is a prime candidate for introducing this concept as many newcomers to Kaggle start out here.

This is good from a point of view of feeding these features into your learning model because this means that there isn\\'t much redundant or superfluous data in our training set and we are happy that each feature carries with it some unique information. Here are two most correlated features are that of Family size and Parch (Parents and Children).

For any newcomers to programming, one normally hears Classes being used in conjunction with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). In short, a class helps to extend some code/program for creating objects (variables for old-school peeps) as well as to implement functions and methods specific to that class.\\n\\nIn the section of code below, we essentially write a class *SklearnHelper* that allows one to extend the inbuilt methods (such as train, predict and fit) common to all the Sklearn c\\n\\n=== CODE 15 ===\\n# Some useful parameters which will come in handy later on\\nntrain = train.shape[0]\\nntest = test.shape[0]\\nSEED = 0 # for reproducibility\\nNFOLDS = 5 # set folds for out-of-fold prediction\\nkf = KFold(ntrain, n_folds= NFOLDS, random_state=SEED)\\n\\n# Class to extend the Sklearn classifier\\nclass SklearnHelper(object):\\n    def __init__(self, clf, seed=0, params=None):\\n        params[\\'random_state\\'] = seed\\n        self.clf = clf(**params)\\n\\n    def train(self, x_train, y_train):\\n        self.clf.fit(x_train, y_train)\\n\\n    def predict(self, x):\\n        return self.clf.predict(x)\\n    \\n    def fit(self,x,y)\\n\\n=== MARKDOWN 16 ===\\nBear with me for those who already know this but for people who have not created classes or objects in Python before, let me explain what the code given above does. In creating my base classifiers, I will only use the models already present in the Sklearn library and therefore only extend the class for that.\\n\\n**def init** : Python standard for invoking the default constructor for the class. This means that when you want to create an object (classifier), you have to give it the parameters of clf (what sklearn classifier you want), seed (random seed) and params (parameters for the classifiers).\\n\\n\\n=== MARKDOWN 17 ===\\n### Out-of-Fold Predictions\\n\\nNow as alluded to above in the introductory section, stacking uses predictions of base classifiers as input for training to a second-level model. However one cannot simply train the base models on the full training data, generate predictions on the full test set and then output these for the second-level training. This runs the risk of your base model predictions already having \"seen\" the test set and therefore overfitting when feeding these predictions.\\n\\n=== CODE 18 ===\\ndef get_oof(clf, x_train, y_train, x_test):\\n    oof_train = np.zeros((ntrain,))\\n    oof_test = np.zeros((ntest,))\\n    oof_test_skf = np.empty((NFOLDS, ntest))\\n\\n    for i, (train_index, test_index) in enumerate(kf):\\n        x_tr = x_train[train_index]\\n        y_tr = y_train[train_index]\\n        x_te = x_train[test_index]\\n\\n        clf.train(x_tr, y_tr)\\n\\n        oof_train[test_index] = clf.predict(x_te)\\n        oof_test_skf[i, :] = clf.predict(x_test)\\n\\n    oof_test[:] = oof_test_skf.mean(axis=0)\\n    return oof_train.reshape(-1, 1), oof_test.reshape(-1, 1)\\n\\n=== MARKDOWN 19 ===\\n# Generating our Base First-Level Models \\n\\nSo now let us prepare five learning models as our first level classification.

It was built to optimize large-scale boosted tree algorithms. For further information about the algorithm, check out the [official documentation][1].\\n\\n  [1]: https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\\n\\nAnyways, we call an XGBClassifier and fit it to the first-level train and target data and use the learned model to predict the test data as follows:\\n\\n=== CODE 49 ===\\ngbm = xgb.XGBClassifier(\\n    #learning_rate = 0.02,\\n n_estimators= 2000,\\n max_depth= 4,\\n min_child_weight= 2,\\n #gamma=1,\\n gamma=0.9,                        \\n subsample=0.8,\\n colsample_bytree=0.8,\\n objective= \\'binary:logistic\\',\\n nthread= -1,\\n scale_pos_weight=1).fit(x_train, y_train)\\npredictions = gbm.predict(x_test)\\n\\n=== MARKDOWN 50 ===\\nJust a quick run down of the XGBoost parameters used in the model:\\n\\n**max_depth** : How deep you want to grow your tree. Beware if set to too high a number might run the risk of overfitting.\\n\\n**gamma** : minimum loss reduction required to make a further partition on a leaf node of the tree. The larger, the more conservative the algorithm will be.\\n\\n**eta** : step size shrinkage used in each boosting step to prevent overfitting\\n\\n=== MARKDOWN 51 ===\\n**Producing the Submission file**\\n\\nFinally having trained and fit all our first-level and second-level models, we can now output the predictions into the proper format for submission to the Titanic competition as follows:\\n\\n=== CODE 52 ===\\n# Generate Submission File \\nStackingSubmission = pd.DataFrame({ \\'PassengerId\\': PassengerId,\\n                            \\'Survived\\': predictions })\\nStackingSubmission.to_csv(\"StackingSubmission.csv\", index=False)\\n\\n=== MARKDOWN 53 ===\\n**Steps for Further Improvement**\\n\\nAs a closing remark it must be noted that the steps taken above just show a very simple way of producing an ensemble stacker. You hear of ensembles created at the highest level of Kaggle competitions which involves monstrous combinations of stacked classifiers as well as levels of stacking which go to more than 2 levels. \\n\\nSome additional steps that may be taken to improve one\\'s score could be:\\n\\n 1. Implementing a good cross-validation strategy in training the models to find optimal parameter values\\n 2. Introduce a greater variety of base models for learning.\\n\\n=== MARKDOWN 54 ===\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nI have this notebook has been helpful somewhat in introducing a working script for stacking learning models.

However many will skip some of the explanation on how the solution is developed as these notebooks are developed by experts for experts. The objective of this notebook is to follow a step-by-step workflow, explaining each step and rationale for every decision we take during solution development.\\\\n\\\\n## Workflow stages\\\\n\\\\nThe competition solution workflow goes through seven stages described in the Data Science Solutions book.\\\\n\\\\n1. Question or problem definition.\\\\n2. Acquire training and testing data.\\\\n3. Wrangle, prepare, cleanse the data.\\\\n4. Analyze, identify patterns, and explore the data.\\\\n5. Model, predict and solve the problem.\\\\n6. Visualize, report, and present the problem solving steps and final solution.\\\\n7. Supply or submit the results.\\\\n\\\\nThe workflow indicates general sequence of how each stage may follow the other. However there are use cases with exceptions.\\\\n\\\\n- We may combine mulitple workflow stages. We may analyze by visualizing data.\\\\n- Perform a stage earlier than indicated. We may analyze data before and after wrangling.\\\\n- Perform a stage multiple times in our workflow. Visualize stage may be used multiple times.\\\\n- Drop a stage altogether. We may not need supply stage to productize or service enable our dataset for a competition.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Question and problem definition\\\\n\\\\nCompetition sites like Kaggle define the problem to solve or questions to ask while providing the datasets for training your data science model and testing the model results against a test dataset. The question or problem definition for Titanic Survival competition is [described here at Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).\\\\n\\\\n> Knowing from a training set of samples listing passengers who survived or did not survive the Titanic disaster, can our model determine based on a given test dataset not containing the survival information, if these passengers in the test dataset survived or not.\\\\n\\\\nWe may also want to develop some early understanding about the domain of our problem. This is described on the [Kaggle competition description page here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). Here are the highlights to note.\\\\n\\\\n- On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. Translated 32% survival rate.\\\\n- One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew.\\\\n- Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.\\\\n\\\\n## Workflow goals\\\\n\\\\nThe data science solutions workflow solves for seven major goals.\\\\n\\\\n**Classifying.** We may want to classify or categorize our samples. We may also want to understand the implications or correlation of different classes with our solution goal.\\\\n\\\\n**Correlating.** One can approach the problem based on available features within the training dataset. Which features within the dataset contribute significantly to our solution goal? Statistically speaking is there a [correlation](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Correlation) among a feature and solution goal? As the feature values change does the solution state change as well, and visa-versa? This can be tested both for numerical and categorical features in the given dataset. We may also want to determine correlation among features other than survival for subsequent goals and workflow stages. Correlating certain features may help in creating, completing, or correcting features.\\\\n\\\\n**Converting.** For modeling stage, one needs to prepare the data. Depending on the choice of model algorithm one may require all features to be converted to numerical equivalent values. So for instance converting text categorical values to numeric values.\\\\n\\\\n**Completing.** Data preparation may also require us to estimate any missing values within a feature. Model algorithms may work best when there are no missing values.\\\\n\\\\n**Correcting.** We may also analyze the given training dataset for errors or possibly innacurate values within features and try to corrent these values or exclude the samples containing the errors. One way to do this is to detect any outliers among our samples or features. We may also completely discard a feature if it is not contribting to the analysis or may significantly skew the results.\\\\n\\\\n**Creating.** Can we create new features based on an existing feature or a set of features, such that the new feature follows the correlation, conversion, completeness goals.\\\\n\\\\n**Charting.** How to select the right visualization plots and charts depending on nature of the data and the solution goals.\"},{\"metadata\":{\"_uuid\":\"960f8b1937dc4915ce1eb0f82614b1985c4321a4\",\"_cell_guid\":\"56a3be4e-76ef-20c6-25e8-da16147cf6d7\"},\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"source\":\"## Refactor Release 2017-Jan-29\\\\n\\\\nWe are significantly refactoring the notebook based on (a) comments received by readers, (b) issues in porting notebook from Jupyter kernel (2.7) to Kaggle kernel (3.5), and (c) review of few more best practice kernels.\\\\n\\\\n### User comments\\\\n\\\\n- Combine training and test data for certain operations like converting titles across dataset to numerical values.

Combine train and test for consistent encoding\\n2. Extract Title from Name\\n3. Create FamilySize, IsAlone, Has_Cabin\\n4. Fill missing values\\n5. Bin Age and Fare\\n6. Encode categorical variables (LabelEncoder or OneHotEncoder)\\n7. Drop unused columns (Name, Ticket, Cabin, PassengerId)\\n\\n### Stacking Implementation\\n```\\n# Pseudo-code structure:\\n# 1. Define base models with parameters\\n# 2. Generate OOF predictions for each base model\\n# 3. Stack OOF predictions as new features\\n# 4. Train meta-learner on stacked features\\n# 5. Generate final predictions\\n```\\n\\n## Tips for Achieving High Accuracy\\n1. **Feature engineering is key** - Title extraction alone can boost accuracy significantly\\n2. **Ensemble diverse models** - Stacking typically adds 1-3% over single models\\n3. **Tune hyperparameters carefully** - Use cross-validation\\n4. **Don't overfit** - Small dataset is prone to overfitting\\n5. **Try multiple random seeds** - Results can vary with initialization\\n\"}}",

Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.\n\nWhile there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.\n\nIn this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).\n\n> #### Recommended Tutorial\n> We highly recommend [Alexis Cook’s Titanic Tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/titanic-tutorial) that walks you through making your very first submission step by step and [this starter notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/gusthema/titanic-competition-w-tensorflow-decision-forests) to get started.\n\n## How Kaggle’s Competitions Work\n1. **Join the Competition**\nRead about the challenge description, accept the Competition Rules and gain access to the competition dataset.\n1.  **Get to Work**\nDownload the data, build models on it locally or on Kaggle Notebooks (our no-setup, customizable Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs) and generate a prediction file.\n1.  **Make a Submission**\nUpload your prediction as a submission on Kaggle and receive an accuracy score.\n1.  **Check the Leaderboard**\nSee how your model ranks against other Kagglers on our leaderboard. \n1.  **Improve Your Score**\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a> to find lots of tutorials and insights from other competitors.\n\n> #### Kaggle Lingo Video\n> You may run into unfamiliar lingo as you dig into the Kaggle discussion forums and public notebooks. Check out  Dr. Rachael Tatman’s [video on Kaggle Lingo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEJHyuWKd-s) to get up to speed!\n\n## What Data Will I Use in This Competition?\nIn this competition, you’ll gain access to two similar datasets that include passenger information like name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc. One dataset is titled `train.csv` and the other is titled `test.csv`.\n\n`Train.csv` will contain the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 to be exact) and importantly, will reveal whether they survived or not, also known as the “ground truth”.\n\nThe `test.csv` dataset contains similar information but does not disclose the “ground truth” for each passenger. It’s your job to predict these outcomes.\n\nUsing the patterns you find in the `train.csv` data, predict whether the other 418 passengers on board (found in `test.csv`) survived.\n\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data\">“Data” tab</a> to explore the datasets even further. Once you feel you’ve created a competitive model, submit it to Kaggle to see where your model stands on our leaderboard against other Kagglers.\n\n## How to Submit your Prediction to Kaggle\nOnce you’re ready to make a submission and get on the leaderboard:\n\n1. Click on the “Submit Predictions” button\n<img width=\"699\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen1.png\">\n1. Upload a CSV file in the submission file format. You’re able to submit 10 submissions a day.\n<img width=\"699\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen2.png\">\n\n## Submission File Format:\nYou should submit a csv file with exactly 418 entries plus a header row. Your submission will show an error if you have extra columns (beyond `PassengerId` and `Survived`) or rows.\n\nThe file should have exactly 2 columns:\n- `PassengerId` (sorted in any order)\n- `Survived` (contains your binary predictions: 1 for survived, 0 for deceased)\n\n## Got it! I’m ready to get started. Where do I get help if I need it?\n- For Competition Help: <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\">Titanic Discussion Forum</a>\n\nKaggle doesn’t have a dedicated team to help troubleshoot your code so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. The forums are full of useful information on the data, metric, and different approaches. We encourage you to use the forums often. If you share your knowledge, you'll find that others will share a lot in turn!\n\n## A Last Word on Kaggle Notebooks\nAs we mentioned before, Kaggle Notebooks is our no-setup, customizable, Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs and a huge repository of community published data &amp; code.\n\nIn every competition, you’ll find many Notebooks shared with incredible insights. It’s an invaluable resource worth becoming familiar with. Check out this competition’s Notebooks <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/notebooks\">here</a>.\n\n## 🏃‍♀Ready to Compete? <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/account/login?returnUrl=%2Fc%2Ftitanic\">Join the Competition Here!</a>\n\n## Evaluation\n\n<h2>Goal</h2>\n<p>It is your job to predict if a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic or not. <br>For each  in the test set, you must predict a 0 or 1 value for the  variable.</p>\n<h2>Metric</h2>\n<p>Your score is the percentage of passengers you correctly predict.

They are a great place to begin if you are new to data science or just finished a MOOC and want to get involved in Kaggle.</p>\n<p>Getting Started competitions are a non-competitive way to get familiar with Kaggle’s platform, learn basic machine learning concepts, and start meeting people in the community. They have no cash prize and are on a rolling timeline.</p>\n<h2>How do I create and manage a team?</h2>\n<p>When you accept the competition rules, a team will be created for you. You can invite others to your team, accept a merger with another team, and update basic information like team name by going to the More &gt; <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/team\" target=\"_blank\">Team</a> page.</p>\n<p>We've heard from many Kagglers that teaming up is the best way to learn new skills AND have fun. If you don't have a teammate already, consider asking if anyone wants to team up in the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a>.</p>\n<h2>What are Notebooks?</h2>\n<p>Kaggle Notebooks is a cloud computational environment that enables reproducible and collaborative analysis. Notebooks support scripts in Python and R, Jupyter Notebooks, and RMarkdown reports.

Most beginners get lost in the field, because they fall into the black box approach, using libraries and algorithms they don't understand. This tutorial will give you a 1-2-year head start over your peers, by providing a framework that teaches you how-to think like a data scientist vs what to think/code. Not only will you be able to submit your first competition, but you’ll be able to solve any problem\n\n=== MARKDOWN 1 ===\n<a id=\"ch1\"></a>\n# How a Data Scientist Beat the Odds\nIt's the classical problem, predict the outcome of a binary event. In laymen terms this means, it either occurred or did not occur. For example, you won or did not win, you passed the test or did not pass the test, you were accepted or not accepted, and you get the point. A common business application is churn or customer retention. Another popular use case is, healthcare's mortality rate or survival analysis.

In a nutshell stacking uses as a first-level (base), the predictions of a few basic classifiers and then uses another model at the second-level to predict the output from the earlier first-level predictions.\n\nThe Titanic dataset is a prime candidate for introducing this concept as many newcomers to Kaggle start out here. Furthermore even though stacking has been responsible for many a team winning K\n\n=== CODE 1 ===\n# Load in our libraries\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport re\nimport sklearn\nimport xgboost as xgb\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline\n\nimport plotly.offline as py\npy.init_notebook_mode(connected=True)\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\nimport plotly.tools as tls\n\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\n\n# Going to use these 5 base models for the stacking\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import (RandomForestClassifier, AdaBoostClassifier, \n                              GradientBoostingClassifier, ExtraTreesClassifier)\nfrom sklearn.svm import SVC\nfrom \n\n=== MARKDOWN 2 ===\n# Feature Exploration, Engineering and Cleaning \n\nNow we will proceed much like how most kernels in general are structured, and that is to first explore the data on hand, identify possible feature engineering opportunities as well as numerically encode any categorical features.\n\n=== CODE 3 ===\n# Load in the train and test datasets\ntrain = pd.read_csv('../input/train.csv')\ntest = pd.read_csv('../input/test.csv')\n\n# Store our passenger ID for easy access\nPassengerId = test['PassengerId']\n\ntrain.head(3)\n\n=== MARKDOWN 4 ===\nWell it is no surprise that our task is to somehow extract the information out of the categorical variables \n\n**Feature Engineering**\n\nHere, credit must be extended to Sina's very comprehensive and well-thought out notebook for the feature engineering ideas so please check out his work \n\n[Titanic Best Working Classfier][1] : by Sina\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.kaggle.com/sinakhorami/titanic/titanic-best-working-classifier\n\n=== CODE 5 ===\nfull_data = [train, test]\n\n# Some features of my own that I have added in\n# Gives the length of the name\ntrain['Name_length'] = train['Name'].apply(len)\ntest['Name_length'] = test['Name'].apply(len)\n# Feature that tells whether a passenger had a cabin on the Titanic\ntrain['Has_Cabin'] = train[\"Cabin\"].apply(lambda x: 0 if type(x) == float else 1)\ntest['Has_Cabin'] = test[\"Cabin\"].apply(lambda x: 0 if type(x) == float else 1)\n\n# Feature engineering steps taken from Sina\n# Create new feature FamilySize as a combination of SibSp and Parch\nfor dataset in full_data:\n    dataset['FamilySize'] = data\n\n=== CODE 6 ===\n# Feature selection\ndrop_elements = ['PassengerId', 'Name', 'Ticket', 'Cabin', 'SibSp']\ntrain = train.drop(drop_elements, axis = 1)\ntrain = train.drop(['CategoricalAge', 'CategoricalFare'], axis = 1)\ntest  = test.drop(drop_elements, axis = 1)\n\n=== MARKDOWN 7 ===\nAll right so now having cleaned the features and extracted relevant information and dropped the categorical columns our features should now all be numeric, a format suitable to feed into our Machine Learning models.

This is good from a point of view of feeding these features into your learning model because this means that there isn't much redundant or superfluous data in our training set and we are happy that each feature carries with it some unique information. Here are two most correlated features are that of Family size and Parch (Parents and Children). I'll still leave both features in for the purposes of this exercise.\n\n**Pairplots**\n\n\n=== CODE 12 ===\ng = sns.pairplot(train[[u'Survived', u'Pclass', u'Sex', u'Age', u'Parch', u'Fare', u'Embarked',\n       u'FamilySize', u'Title']], hue='Survived', palette = 'seismic',size=1.2,diag_kind = 'kde',diag_kws=dict(shade=True),plot_kws=dict(s=10) )\ng.set(xticklabels=[])\n\n=== MARKDOWN 13 ===\n# Ensembling & Stacking models\n\nFinally after that brief whirlwind detour with regards to feature engineering and formatting, we finally arrive at the meat and gist of the this notebook.\n\nCreating a Stacking ensemble!\n\n=== MARKDOWN 14 ===\n### Helpers via Python Classes\n\nHere we invoke the use of Python's classes to help make it more convenient for us. For any newcomers to programming, one normally hears Classes being used in conjunction with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). In short, a class helps to extend some code/program for creating objects (variables for old-school peeps) as well as to implement functions and methods specific to that class.\n\nIn the section of code below, we essentially write a class *SklearnHelper* that allows one to extend the inbuilt methods (such as train, predict and fit) common to all the Sklearn c\n\n=== CODE 15 ===\n# Some useful parameters which will come in handy later on\nntrain = train.shape[0]\nntest = test.shape[0]\nSEED = 0 # for reproducibility\nNFOLDS = 5 # set folds for out-of-fold prediction\nkf = KFold(ntrain, n_folds= NFOLDS, random_state=SEED)\n\n# Class to extend the Sklearn classifier\nclass SklearnHelper(object):\n    def __init__(self, clf, seed=0, params=None):\n        params['random_state'] = seed\n        self.clf = clf(**params)\n\n    def train(self, x_train, y_train):\n        self.clf.fit(x_train, y_train)\n\n    def predict(self, x):\n        return self.clf.predict(x)\n    \n    def fit(self,x,y)\n\n=== MARKDOWN 16 ===\nBear with me for those who already know this but for people who have not created classes or objects in Python before, let me explain what the code given above does. In creating my base classifiers, I will only use the models already present in the Sklearn library and therefore only extend the class for that.\n\n**def init** : Python standard for invoking the default constructor for the class. This means that when you want to create an object (classifier), you have to give it the parameters of clf (what sklearn classifier you want), seed (random seed) and params (parameters for the classifiers).\n\n\n=== MARKDOWN 17 ===\n### Out-of-Fold Predictions\n\nNow as alluded to above in the introductory section, stacking uses predictions of base classifiers as input for training to a second-level model. However one cannot simply train the base models on the full training data, generate predictions on the full test set and then output these for the second-level training. This runs the risk of your base model predictions already having \"seen\" the test set and therefore overfitting when feeding these predictions.\n\n=== CODE 18 ===\ndef get_oof(clf, x_train, y_train, x_test):\n    oof_train = np.zeros((ntrain,))\n    oof_test = np.zeros((ntest,))\n    oof_test_skf = np.empty((NFOLDS, ntest))\n\n    for i, (train_index, test_index) in enumerate(kf):\n        x_tr = x_train[train_index]\n        y_tr = y_train[train_index]\n        x_te = x_train[test_index]\n\n        clf.train(x_tr, y_tr)\n\n        oof_train[test_index] = clf.predict(x_te)\n        oof_test_skf[i, :] = clf.predict(x_test)\n\n    oof_test[:] = oof_test_skf.mean(axis=0)\n    return oof_train.reshape(-1, 1), oof_test.reshape(-1, 1)\n\n=== MARKDOWN 19 ===\n# Generating our Base First-Level Models \n\nSo now let us prepare five learning models as our first level classification. These models can all be conveniently invoked via the Sklearn library and are listed as follows:\n\n 1. Random Forest classifier\n 2. Extra Trees classifier\n 3. AdaBoost classifer\n 4.

It was built to optimize large-scale boosted tree algorithms. For further information about the algorithm, check out the [official documentation][1].\n\n  [1]: https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n\nAnyways, we call an XGBClassifier and fit it to the first-level train and target data and use the learned model to predict the test data as follows:\n\n=== CODE 49 ===\ngbm = xgb.XGBClassifier(\n    #learning_rate = 0.02,\n n_estimators= 2000,\n max_depth= 4,\n min_child_weight= 2,\n #gamma=1,\n gamma=0.9,                        \n subsample=0.8,\n colsample_bytree=0.8,\n objective= 'binary:logistic',\n nthread= -1,\n scale_pos_weight=1).fit(x_train, y_train)\npredictions = gbm.predict(x_test)\n\n=== MARKDOWN 50 ===\nJust a quick run down of the XGBoost parameters used in the model:\n\n**max_depth** : How deep you want to grow your tree. Beware if set to too high a number might run the risk of overfitting.\n\n**gamma** : minimum loss reduction required to make a further partition on a leaf node of the tree. The larger, the more conservative the algorithm will be.\n\n**eta** : step size shrinkage used in each boosting step to prevent overfitting\n\n=== MARKDOWN 51 ===\n**Producing the Submission file**\n\nFinally having trained and fit all our first-level and second-level models, we can now output the predictions into the proper format for submission to the Titanic competition as follows:\n\n=== CODE 52 ===\n# Generate Submission File \nStackingSubmission = pd.DataFrame({ 'PassengerId': PassengerId,\n                            'Survived': predictions })\nStackingSubmission.to_csv(\"StackingSubmission.csv\", index=False)\n\n=== MARKDOWN 53 ===\n**Steps for Further Improvement**\n\nAs a closing remark it must be noted that the steps taken above just show a very simple way of producing an ensemble stacker. You hear of ensembles created at the highest level of Kaggle competitions which involves monstrous combinations of stacked classifiers as well as levels of stacking which go to more than 2 levels. \n\nSome additional steps that may be taken to improve one's score could be:\n\n 1. Implementing a good cross-validation strategy in training the models to find optimal parameter values\n 2. Introduce a greater variety of base models for learning.\n\n=== MARKDOWN 54 ===\n### Conclusion\n\nI have this notebook has been helpful somewhat in introducing a working script for stacking learning models. Again credit must be extended to Faron and Sina. \n\nFor other excellent material on stacking or ensembling in general, refer to the de-facto Must read article on the website MLWave: [Kaggle Ensembling Guide][1]. \n\nTill next time, Peace Out\n\n  [1]: http://mlwave.com/kaggle-ensembling-guide/\n\n=== CODE 55 ===\n\n\n\ntool: ✓ Recorded finding: Feature Engineering: FamilySize = SibSp + Parch + 1; IsAlone = 1 if FamilySize == 1; Title extracted...\n  Source: ../research/kernels/ldfreeman3_a-data-science-framework-to-achieve-99-accuracy\ntool: ✓ Recorded finding: Stacking Ensemble: Use 5 base models (RandomForest, ExtraTrees, AdaBoost, GradientBoosting, SVC) wit...\n  Source: ../research/kernels/arthurtok_introduction-to-ensembling-stacking-in-python\ntool: ✓ Recorded finding: Important features by importance: Title (especially 'Master' for male survival), Sex, Pclass, Age, F...\n  Source: ../research/kernels/arthurtok_introduction-to-ensembling-stacking-in-python\ntool: Created: /home/code/exploration/eda.ipynb\n\nStrong Note: OOM is unrecoverable.

However many will skip some of the explanation on how the solution is developed as these notebooks are developed by experts for experts. The objective of this notebook is to follow a step-by-step workflow, explaining each step and rationale for every decision we take during solution development.\\n\\n## Workflow stages\\n\\nThe competition solution workflow goes through seven stages described in the Data Science Solutions book.\\n\\n1. Question or problem definition.\\n2. Acquire training and testing data.\\n3. Wrangle, prepare, cleanse the data.\\n4. Analyze, identify patterns, and explore the data.\\n5. Model, predict and solve the problem.\\n6. Visualize, report, and present the problem solving steps and final solution.\\n7. Supply or submit the results.\\n\\nThe workflow indicates general sequence of how each stage may follow the other. However there are use cases with exceptions.\\n\\n- We may combine mulitple workflow stages. We may analyze by visualizing data.\\n- Perform a stage earlier than indicated. We may analyze data before and after wrangling.\\n- Perform a stage multiple times in our workflow. Visualize stage may be used multiple times.\\n- Drop a stage altogether. We may not need supply stage to productize or service enable our dataset for a competition.\\n\\n\\n## Question and problem definition\\n\\nCompetition sites like Kaggle define the problem to solve or questions to ask while providing the datasets for training your data science model and testing the model results against a test dataset. The question or problem definition for Titanic Survival competition is [described here at Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).\\n\\n> Knowing from a training set of samples listing passengers who survived or did not survive the Titanic disaster, can our model determine based on a given test dataset not containing the survival information, if these passengers in the test dataset survived or not.\\n\\nWe may also want to develop some early understanding about the domain of our problem. This is described on the [Kaggle competition description page here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). Here are the highlights to note.\\n\\n- On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. Translated 32% survival rate.\\n- One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew.\\n- Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.\\n\\n## Workflow goals\\n\\nThe data science solutions workflow solves for seven major goals.\\n\\n**Classifying.** We may want to classify or categorize our samples. We may also want to understand the implications or correlation of different classes with our solution goal.\\n\\n**Correlating.** One can approach the problem based on available features within the training dataset. Which features within the dataset contribute significantly to our solution goal? Statistically speaking is there a [correlation](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Correlation) among a feature and solution goal? As the feature values change does the solution state change as well, and visa-versa? This can be tested both for numerical and categorical features in the given dataset. We may also want to determine correlation among features other than survival for subsequent goals and workflow stages. Correlating certain features may help in creating, completing, or correcting features.\\n\\n**Converting.** For modeling stage, one needs to prepare the data. Depending on the choice of model algorithm one may require all features to be converted to numerical equivalent values. So for instance converting text categorical values to numeric values.\\n\\n**Completing.** Data preparation may also require us to estimate any missing values within a feature. Model algorithms may work best when there are no missing values.\\n\\n**Correcting.** We may also analyze the given training dataset for errors or possibly innacurate values within features and try to corrent these values or exclude the samples containing the errors. One way to do this is to detect any outliers among our samples or features. We may also completely discard a feature if it is not contribting to the analysis or may significantly skew the results.\\n\\n**Creating.** Can we create new features based on an existing feature or a set of features, such that the new feature follows the correlation, conversion, completeness goals.\\n\\n**Charting.** How to select the right visualization plots and charts depending on nature of the data and the solution goals.\"},{\"metadata\":{\"_uuid\":\"960f8b1937dc4915ce1eb0f82614b1985c4321a4\",\"_cell_guid\":\"56a3be4e-76ef-20c6-25e8-da16147cf6d7\"},\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"source\":\"## Refactor Release 2017-Jan-29\\n\\nWe are significantly refactoring the notebook based on (a) comments received by readers, (b) issues in porting notebook from Jupyter kernel (2.7) to Kaggle kernel (3.5), and (c) review of few more best practice kernels.\\n\\n### User comments\\n\\n- Combine training and test data for certain operations like converting titles across dataset to numerical values.

Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.\\n\\nWhile there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.\\n\\nIn this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).\\n\\n> #### Recommended Tutorial\\n> We highly recommend [Alexis Cook’s Titanic Tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/titanic-tutorial) that walks you through making your very first submission step by step and [this starter notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/gusthema/titanic-competition-w-tensorflow-decision-forests) to get started.\\n\\n## How Kaggle’s Competitions Work\\n1. **Join the Competition**\\nRead about the challenge description, accept the Competition Rules and gain access to the competition dataset.\\n1.  **Get to Work**\\nDownload the data, build models on it locally or on Kaggle Notebooks (our no-setup, customizable Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs) and generate a prediction file.\\n1.  **Make a Submission**\\nUpload your prediction as a submission on Kaggle and receive an accuracy score.\\n1.  **Check the Leaderboard**\\nSee how your model ranks against other Kagglers on our leaderboard. \\n1.  **Improve Your Score**\\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a> to find lots of tutorials and insights from other competitors.\\n\\n> #### Kaggle Lingo Video\\n> You may run into unfamiliar lingo as you dig into the Kaggle discussion forums and public notebooks. Check out  Dr. Rachael Tatman’s [video on Kaggle Lingo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEJHyuWKd-s) to get up to speed!\\n\\n## What Data Will I Use in This Competition?\\nIn this competition, you’ll gain access to two similar datasets that include passenger information like name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc. One dataset is titled `train.csv` and the other is titled `test.csv`.\\n\\n`Train.csv` will contain the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 to be exact) and importantly, will reveal whether they survived or not, also known as the “ground truth”.\\n\\nThe `test.csv` dataset contains similar information but does not disclose the “ground truth” for each passenger. It’s your job to predict these outcomes.\\n\\nUsing the patterns you find in the `train.csv` data, predict whether the other 418 passengers on board (found in `test.csv`) survived.\\n\\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data\">“Data” tab</a> to explore the datasets even further. Once you feel you’ve created a competitive model, submit it to Kaggle to see where your model stands on our leaderboard against other Kagglers.\\n\\n## How to Submit your Prediction to Kaggle\\nOnce you’re ready to make a submission and get on the leaderboard:\\n\\n1. Click on the “Submit Predictions” button\\n<img width=\"699\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen1.png\">\\n1. Upload a CSV file in the submission file format. You’re able to submit 10 submissions a day.\\n<img width=\"699\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen2.png\">\\n\\n## Submission File Format:\\nYou should submit a csv file with exactly 418 entries plus a header row. Your submission will show an error if you have extra columns (beyond `PassengerId` and `Survived`) or rows.\\n\\nThe file should have exactly 2 columns:\\n- `PassengerId` (sorted in any order)\\n- `Survived` (contains your binary predictions: 1 for survived, 0 for deceased)\\n\\n## Got it! I’m ready to get started. Where do I get help if I need it?\\n- For Competition Help: <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\">Titanic Discussion Forum</a>\\n\\nKaggle doesn’t have a dedicated team to help troubleshoot your code so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. The forums are full of useful information on the data, metric, and different approaches. We encourage you to use the forums often. If you share your knowledge, you\\'ll find that others will share a lot in turn!\\n\\n## A Last Word on Kaggle Notebooks\\nAs we mentioned before, Kaggle Notebooks is our no-setup, customizable, Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs and a huge repository of community published data &amp; code.\\n\\nIn every competition, you’ll find many Notebooks shared with incredible insights. It’s an invaluable resource worth becoming familiar with.

They are a great place to begin if you are new to data science or just finished a MOOC and want to get involved in Kaggle.</p>\\n<p>Getting Started competitions are a non-competitive way to get familiar with Kaggle’s platform, learn basic machine learning concepts, and start meeting people in the community. They have no cash prize and are on a rolling timeline.</p>\\n<h2>How do I create and manage a team?</h2>\\n<p>When you accept the competition rules, a team will be created for you. You can invite others to your team, accept a merger with another team, and update basic information like team name by going to the More &gt; <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/team\" target=\"_blank\">Team</a> page.</p>\\n<p>We\\'ve heard from many Kagglers that teaming up is the best way to learn new skills AND have fun. If you don\\'t have a teammate already, consider asking if anyone wants to team up in the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a>.</p>\\n<h2>What are Notebooks?</h2>\\n<p>Kaggle Notebooks is a cloud computational environment that enables reproducible and collaborative analysis. Notebooks support scripts in Python and R, Jupyter Notebooks, and RMarkdown reports. You can visit the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/notebooks\" target=\"_blank\">Notebooks</a> tab to view all of the publicly shared code for the Titanic competition. For more on how to use Notebooks to learn data science, check out our <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview\" target=\"&quot;_blank\">Courses</a>!</p>\\n<h2>Why did my team disappear from the leaderboard?</h2>\\n<p>To keep with the spirit of getting-started competitions, we have implemented a two month rolling window on submissions. Once a submission is more than two months old, it will be invalidated and no longer count towards the leaderboard.</p>\\n<p>If your team has no submissions in the previous two months, the team will also drop from the leaderboard. This will keep the leaderboard at a manageable size, freshen it up, and prevent newcomers from getting lost in a sea of abandoned scores.</p>\\n<p><i>\"I worked so hard to get that score! Give it back!\"</i> Read more about our decision to implement a rolling leaderboard <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion/6240\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\\n<h2>How do I contact Support?</h2>\\n<p>Kaggle does not have a dedicated support team so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. (For this competition, you’ll want to use the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">Titanic discussion forum)</a>.</p>\\n<p>Support is only able to help with issues that are being experienced by all participants. Before contacting support, please check the discussion forum for information on your problem. If you can’t find it, you can post your problem in the forum so a fellow participant or a Kaggle team member can provide help. The forums are full of useful information on the data, metric, and different approaches. We encourage you to use the forums often. If you share your knowledge, you\\'ll find that others will share a lot in turn!</p>\\n<p>If your problem persists or it seems to be effective all participants then please <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/contact\" target=\"_blank\">contact us</a>.</p>'}, {'role': 'tool', 'content': 'Not a directory: /home/code/exploration/../research/writeups'}, {'role': 'tool', 'content': '/home/code/exploration/../research/kernels:\\n[DIR]  alexisbcook_exercise-arithmetic-and-variables/\\n[DIR]  alexisbcook_titanic-tutorial/\\n[DIR]  arthurtok_introduction-to-ensembling-stacking-in-python/\\n[DIR]  ldfreeman3_a-data-science-framework-to-achieve-99-accuracy/\\n[FILE] metadata.json (1.7KB)\\n[DIR]  startupsci_titanic-data-science-solutions/'}, {'role': 'tool', 'content': '/home/data:\\n[FILE] description.md (13.6KB)\\n[FILE] gender_submission.csv (3.2KB)\\n[FILE] test.csv (28.0KB)\\n[FILE] train.csv (59.8KB)'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': \"REASONING: Good, I can see this is the classic Titanic survival prediction problem - binary classification with accuracy as the metric.

In a nutshell stacking uses as a first-level (base), the predictions of a few basic classifiers and then uses another model at the second-level to predict the output from the earlier first-level predictions.\\n\\nThe Titanic dataset is a prime candidate for introducing this concept as many newcomers to Kaggle start out here.

This is good from a point of view of feeding these features into your learning model because this means that there isn\\'t much redundant or superfluous data in our training set and we are happy that each feature carries with it some unique information. Here are two most correlated features are that of Family size and Parch (Parents and Children).

For any newcomers to programming, one normally hears Classes being used in conjunction with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). In short, a class helps to extend some code/program for creating objects (variables for old-school peeps) as well as to implement functions and methods specific to that class.\\n\\nIn the section of code below, we essentially write a class *SklearnHelper* that allows one to extend the inbuilt methods (such as train, predict and fit) common to all the Sklearn c\\n\\n=== CODE 15 ===\\n# Some useful parameters which will come in handy later on\\nntrain = train.shape[0]\\nntest = test.shape[0]\\nSEED = 0 # for reproducibility\\nNFOLDS = 5 # set folds for out-of-fold prediction\\nkf = KFold(ntrain, n_folds= NFOLDS, random_state=SEED)\\n\\n# Class to extend the Sklearn classifier\\nclass SklearnHelper(object):\\n    def __init__(self, clf, seed=0, params=None):\\n        params[\\'random_state\\'] = seed\\n        self.clf = clf(**params)\\n\\n    def train(self, x_train, y_train):\\n        self.clf.fit(x_train, y_train)\\n\\n    def predict(self, x):\\n        return self.clf.predict(x)\\n    \\n    def fit(self,x,y)\\n\\n=== MARKDOWN 16 ===\\nBear with me for those who already know this but for people who have not created classes or objects in Python before, let me explain what the code given above does. In creating my base classifiers, I will only use the models already present in the Sklearn library and therefore only extend the class for that.\\n\\n**def init** : Python standard for invoking the default constructor for the class. This means that when you want to create an object (classifier), you have to give it the parameters of clf (what sklearn classifier you want), seed (random seed) and params (parameters for the classifiers).\\n\\n\\n=== MARKDOWN 17 ===\\n### Out-of-Fold Predictions\\n\\nNow as alluded to above in the introductory section, stacking uses predictions of base classifiers as input for training to a second-level model. However one cannot simply train the base models on the full training data, generate predictions on the full test set and then output these for the second-level training. This runs the risk of your base model predictions already having \"seen\" the test set and therefore overfitting when feeding these predictions.\\n\\n=== CODE 18 ===\\ndef get_oof(clf, x_train, y_train, x_test):\\n    oof_train = np.zeros((ntrain,))\\n    oof_test = np.zeros((ntest,))\\n    oof_test_skf = np.empty((NFOLDS, ntest))\\n\\n    for i, (train_index, test_index) in enumerate(kf):\\n        x_tr = x_train[train_index]\\n        y_tr = y_train[train_index]\\n        x_te = x_train[test_index]\\n\\n        clf.train(x_tr, y_tr)\\n\\n        oof_train[test_index] = clf.predict(x_te)\\n        oof_test_skf[i, :] = clf.predict(x_test)\\n\\n    oof_test[:] = oof_test_skf.mean(axis=0)\\n    return oof_train.reshape(-1, 1), oof_test.reshape(-1, 1)\\n\\n=== MARKDOWN 19 ===\\n# Generating our Base First-Level Models \\n\\nSo now let us prepare five learning models as our first level classification.

It was built to optimize large-scale boosted tree algorithms. For further information about the algorithm, check out the [official documentation][1].\\n\\n  [1]: https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\\n\\nAnyways, we call an XGBClassifier and fit it to the first-level train and target data and use the learned model to predict the test data as follows:\\n\\n=== CODE 49 ===\\ngbm = xgb.XGBClassifier(\\n    #learning_rate = 0.02,\\n n_estimators= 2000,\\n max_depth= 4,\\n min_child_weight= 2,\\n #gamma=1,\\n gamma=0.9,                        \\n subsample=0.8,\\n colsample_bytree=0.8,\\n objective= \\'binary:logistic\\',\\n nthread= -1,\\n scale_pos_weight=1).fit(x_train, y_train)\\npredictions = gbm.predict(x_test)\\n\\n=== MARKDOWN 50 ===\\nJust a quick run down of the XGBoost parameters used in the model:\\n\\n**max_depth** : How deep you want to grow your tree. Beware if set to too high a number might run the risk of overfitting.\\n\\n**gamma** : minimum loss reduction required to make a further partition on a leaf node of the tree. The larger, the more conservative the algorithm will be.\\n\\n**eta** : step size shrinkage used in each boosting step to prevent overfitting\\n\\n=== MARKDOWN 51 ===\\n**Producing the Submission file**\\n\\nFinally having trained and fit all our first-level and second-level models, we can now output the predictions into the proper format for submission to the Titanic competition as follows:\\n\\n=== CODE 52 ===\\n# Generate Submission File \\nStackingSubmission = pd.DataFrame({ \\'PassengerId\\': PassengerId,\\n                            \\'Survived\\': predictions })\\nStackingSubmission.to_csv(\"StackingSubmission.csv\", index=False)\\n\\n=== MARKDOWN 53 ===\\n**Steps for Further Improvement**\\n\\nAs a closing remark it must be noted that the steps taken above just show a very simple way of producing an ensemble stacker. You hear of ensembles created at the highest level of Kaggle competitions which involves monstrous combinations of stacked classifiers as well as levels of stacking which go to more than 2 levels. \\n\\nSome additional steps that may be taken to improve one\\'s score could be:\\n\\n 1. Implementing a good cross-validation strategy in training the models to find optimal parameter values\\n 2. Introduce a greater variety of base models for learning.\\n\\n=== MARKDOWN 54 ===\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nI have this notebook has been helpful somewhat in introducing a working script for stacking learning models.

However many will skip some of the explanation on how the solution is developed as these notebooks are developed by experts for experts. The objective of this notebook is to follow a step-by-step workflow, explaining each step and rationale for every decision we take during solution development.\\\\n\\\\n## Workflow stages\\\\n\\\\nThe competition solution workflow goes through seven stages described in the Data Science Solutions book.\\\\n\\\\n1. Question or problem definition.\\\\n2. Acquire training and testing data.\\\\n3. Wrangle, prepare, cleanse the data.\\\\n4. Analyze, identify patterns, and explore the data.\\\\n5. Model, predict and solve the problem.\\\\n6. Visualize, report, and present the problem solving steps and final solution.\\\\n7. Supply or submit the results.\\\\n\\\\nThe workflow indicates general sequence of how each stage may follow the other. However there are use cases with exceptions.\\\\n\\\\n- We may combine mulitple workflow stages. We may analyze by visualizing data.\\\\n- Perform a stage earlier than indicated. We may analyze data before and after wrangling.\\\\n- Perform a stage multiple times in our workflow. Visualize stage may be used multiple times.\\\\n- Drop a stage altogether. We may not need supply stage to productize or service enable our dataset for a competition.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Question and problem definition\\\\n\\\\nCompetition sites like Kaggle define the problem to solve or questions to ask while providing the datasets for training your data science model and testing the model results against a test dataset. The question or problem definition for Titanic Survival competition is [described here at Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).\\\\n\\\\n> Knowing from a training set of samples listing passengers who survived or did not survive the Titanic disaster, can our model determine based on a given test dataset not containing the survival information, if these passengers in the test dataset survived or not.\\\\n\\\\nWe may also want to develop some early understanding about the domain of our problem. This is described on the [Kaggle competition description page here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). Here are the highlights to note.\\\\n\\\\n- On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. Translated 32% survival rate.\\\\n- One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew.\\\\n- Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.\\\\n\\\\n## Workflow goals\\\\n\\\\nThe data science solutions workflow solves for seven major goals.\\\\n\\\\n**Classifying.** We may want to classify or categorize our samples. We may also want to understand the implications or correlation of different classes with our solution goal.\\\\n\\\\n**Correlating.** One can approach the problem based on available features within the training dataset. Which features within the dataset contribute significantly to our solution goal? Statistically speaking is there a [correlation](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Correlation) among a feature and solution goal? As the feature values change does the solution state change as well, and visa-versa? This can be tested both for numerical and categorical features in the given dataset. We may also want to determine correlation among features other than survival for subsequent goals and workflow stages. Correlating certain features may help in creating, completing, or correcting features.\\\\n\\\\n**Converting.** For modeling stage, one needs to prepare the data. Depending on the choice of model algorithm one may require all features to be converted to numerical equivalent values. So for instance converting text categorical values to numeric values.\\\\n\\\\n**Completing.** Data preparation may also require us to estimate any missing values within a feature. Model algorithms may work best when there are no missing values.\\\\n\\\\n**Correcting.** We may also analyze the given training dataset for errors or possibly innacurate values within features and try to corrent these values or exclude the samples containing the errors. One way to do this is to detect any outliers among our samples or features. We may also completely discard a feature if it is not contribting to the analysis or may significantly skew the results.\\\\n\\\\n**Creating.** Can we create new features based on an existing feature or a set of features, such that the new feature follows the correlation, conversion, completeness goals.\\\\n\\\\n**Charting.** How to select the right visualization plots and charts depending on nature of the data and the solution goals.\"},{\"metadata\":{\"_uuid\":\"960f8b1937dc4915ce1eb0f82614b1985c4321a4\",\"_cell_guid\":\"56a3be4e-76ef-20c6-25e8-da16147cf6d7\"},\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"source\":\"## Refactor Release 2017-Jan-29\\\\n\\\\nWe are significantly refactoring the notebook based on (a) comments received by readers, (b) issues in porting notebook from Jupyter kernel (2.7) to Kaggle kernel (3.5), and (c) review of few more best practice kernels.\\\\n\\\\n### User comments\\\\n\\\\n- Combine training and test data for certain operations like converting titles across dataset to numerical values.

Once you’re ready to start competing, click on the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/account/login?returnUrl=%2Fc%2Ftitanic\" target=\"_blank\">\"Join Competition button</a> to create an account and gain access to the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data\" target=\"_blank\">competition data</a>. Then check out <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/titanic-tutorial\">Alexis Cook’s Titanic Tutorial</a> that walks you through step by step how to make your first submission!\n\n<iframe width=\"699\" height=\"368\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8yZMXCaFshs\" title=\"YouTube video | How to Get Started with Kaggle’s Titanic Competition | Kaggle\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n## The Challenge\nThe sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.\n\nOn April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.\n\nWhile there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.\n\nIn this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).\n\n> #### Recommended Tutorial\n> We highly recommend [Alexis Cook’s Titanic Tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/titanic-tutorial) that walks you through making your very first submission step by step and [this starter notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/gusthema/titanic-competition-w-tensorflow-decision-forests) to get started.\n\n## How Kaggle’s Competitions Work\n1. **Join the Competition**\nRead about the challenge description, accept the Competition Rules and gain access to the competition dataset.\n1.  **Get to Work**\nDownload the data, build models on it locally or on Kaggle Notebooks (our no-setup, customizable Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs) and generate a prediction file.\n1.  **Make a Submission**\nUpload your prediction as a submission on Kaggle and receive an accuracy score.\n1.  **Check the Leaderboard**\nSee how your model ranks against other Kagglers on our leaderboard. \n1.  **Improve Your Score**\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a> to find lots of tutorials and insights from other competitors.\n\n> #### Kaggle Lingo Video\n> You may run into unfamiliar lingo as you dig into the Kaggle discussion forums and public notebooks. Check out  Dr. Rachael Tatman’s [video on Kaggle Lingo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEJHyuWKd-s) to get up to speed!\n\n## What Data Will I Use in This Competition?\nIn this competition, you’ll gain access to two similar datasets that include passenger information like name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc. One dataset is titled `train.csv` and the other is titled `test.csv`.\n\n`Train.csv` will contain the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 to be exact) and importantly, will reveal whether they survived or not, also known as the “ground truth”.\n\nThe `test.csv` dataset contains similar information but does not disclose the “ground truth” for each passenger. It’s your job to predict these outcomes.\n\nUsing the patterns you find in the `train.csv` data, predict whether the other 418 passengers on board (found in `test.csv`) survived.\n\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data\">“Data” tab</a> to explore the datasets even further. Once you feel you’ve created a competitive model, submit it to Kaggle to see where your model stands on our leaderboard against other Kagglers.\n\n## How to Submit your Prediction to Kaggle\nOnce you’re ready to make a submission and get on the leaderboard:\n\n1.

They are a great place to begin if you are new to data science or just finished a MOOC and want to get involved in Kaggle.</p>\n<p>Getting Started competitions are a non-competitive way to get familiar with Kaggle’s platform, learn basic machine learning concepts, and start meeting people in the community. They have no cash prize and are on a rolling timeline.</p>\n<h2>How do I create and manage a team?</h2>\n<p>When you accept the competition rules, a team will be created for you. You can invite others to your team, accept a merger with another team, and update basic information like team name by going to the More &gt; <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/team\" target=\"_blank\">Team</a> page.</p>\n<p>We've heard from many Kagglers that teaming up is the best way to learn new skills AND have fun. If you don't have a teammate already, consider asking if anyone wants to team up in the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a>.</p>\n<h2>What are Notebooks?</h2>\n<p>Kaggle Notebooks is a cloud computational environment that enables reproducible and collaborative analysis. Notebooks support scripts in Python and R, Jupyter Notebooks, and RMarkdown reports.

Most beginners get lost in the field, because they fall into the black box approach, using libraries and algorithms they don't understand. This tutorial will give you a 1-2-year head start over your peers, by providing a framework that teaches you how-to think like a data scientist vs what to think/code. Not only will you be able to submit your first competition, but you’ll be able to solve any problem\n\n=== MARKDOWN 1 ===\n<a id=\"ch1\"></a>\n# How a Data Scientist Beat the Odds\nIt's the classical problem, predict the outcome of a binary event. In laymen terms this means, it either occurred or did not occur. For example, you won or did not win, you passed the test or did not pass the test, you were accepted or not accepted, and you get the point. A common business application is churn or customer retention. Another popular use case is, healthcare's mortality rate or survival analysis. Binary events create an interest\n\n=== MARKDOWN 2 ===\n<a id=\"ch2\"></a>\n# A Data Science Framework\n1. **Define the Problem:** If data science, big data, machine learning, predictive analytics, business intelligence, or any other buzzword is the solution, then what is the problem?

On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the inter\n\n=== MARKDOWN 4 ===\n<a id=\"ch4\"></a>\n# Step 3: Prepare Data for Consumption\nSince step 2 was provided to us on a golden plater, so is step 3.

multi-disciplinary field between mathematics (i.e. statistics, linear algebra, etc.), computer science (i.e. programming languages, computer systems, etc.) and business management (i.e. communication, subject-matter knowledge, etc.).

For example, if we're only going to increase our accuracy by 1/10th of a percent, is it really worth 3-months of development.

In a nutshell stacking uses as a first-level (base), the predictions of a few basic classifiers and then uses another model at the second-level to predict the output from the earlier first-level predictions.\n\nThe Titanic dataset is a prime candidate for introducing this concept as many newcomers to Kaggle start out here. Furthermore even though stacking has been responsible for many a team winning K\n\n=== CODE 1 ===\n# Load in our libraries\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport re\nimport sklearn\nimport xgboost as xgb\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline\n\nimport plotly.offline as py\npy.init_notebook_mode(connected=True)\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\nimport plotly.tools as tls\n\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\n\n# Going to use these 5 base models for the stacking\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import (RandomForestClassifier, AdaBoostClassifier, \n                              GradientBoostingClassifier, ExtraTreesClassifier)\nfrom sklearn.svm import SVC\nfrom \n\n=== MARKDOWN 2 ===\n# Feature Exploration, Engineering and Cleaning \n\nNow we will proceed much like how most kernels in general are structured, and that is to first explore the data on hand, identify possible feature engineering opportunities as well as numerically encode any categorical features.\n\n=== CODE 3 ===\n# Load in the train and test datasets\ntrain = pd.read_csv('../input/train.csv')\ntest = pd.read_csv('../input/test.csv')\n\n# Store our passenger ID for easy access\nPassengerId = test['PassengerId']\n\ntrain.head(3)\n\n=== MARKDOWN 4 ===\nWell it is no surprise that our task is to somehow extract the information out of the categorical variables \n\n**Feature Engineering**\n\nHere, credit must be extended to Sina's very comprehensive and well-thought out notebook for the feature engineering ideas so please check out his work \n\n[Titanic Best Working Classfier][1] : by Sina\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.kaggle.com/sinakhorami/titanic/titanic-best-working-classifier\n\n=== CODE 5 ===\nfull_data = [train, test]\n\n# Some features of my own that I have added in\n# Gives the length of the name\ntrain['Name_length'] = train['Name'].apply(len)\ntest['Name_length'] = test['Name'].apply(len)\n# Feature that tells whether a passenger had a cabin on the Titanic\ntrain['Has_Cabin'] = train[\"Cabin\"].apply(lambda x: 0 if type(x) == float else 1)\ntest['Has_Cabin'] = test[\"Cabin\"].apply(lambda x: 0 if type(x) == float else 1)\n\n# Feature engineering steps taken from Sina\n# Create new feature FamilySize as a combination of SibSp and Parch\nfor dataset in full_data:\n    dataset['FamilySize'] = data\n\n=== CODE 6 ===\n# Feature selection\ndrop_elements = ['PassengerId', 'Name', 'Ticket', 'Cabin', 'SibSp']\ntrain = train.drop(drop_elements, axis = 1)\ntrain = train.drop(['CategoricalAge', 'CategoricalFare'], axis = 1)\ntest  = test.drop(drop_elements, axis = 1)\n\n=== MARKDOWN 7 ===\nAll right so now having cleaned the features and extracted relevant information and dropped the categorical columns our features should now all be numeric, a format suitable to feed into our Machine Learning models.

To do so, we will utilise the Seaborn plotting package which allows us to plot heatmaps very conveniently as follows\n\n=== CODE 10 ===\ncolormap = plt.cm.RdBu\nplt.figure(figsize=(14,12))\nplt.title('Pearson Correlation of Features', y=1.05, size=15)\nsns.heatmap(train.astype(float).corr(),linewidths=0.1,vmax=1.0, \n            square=True, cmap=colormap, linecolor='white', annot=True)\n\n=== MARKDOWN 11 ===\n**Takeaway from the Plots**\n\nOne thing that that the Pearson Correlation plot can tell us is that there are not too many features strongly correlated with one another. This is good from a point of view of feeding these features into your learning model because this means that there isn't much redundant or superfluous data in our training set and we are happy that each feature carries with it some unique information. Here are two most correlated features are that of Family size and Parch (Parents and Children). I'll still leave both features in for the purposes of this exercise.\n\n**Pairplots**\n\n\n=== CODE 12 ===\ng = sns.pairplot(train[[u'Survived', u'Pclass', u'Sex', u'Age', u'Parch', u'Fare', u'Embarked',\n       u'FamilySize', u'Title']], hue='Survived', palette = 'seismic',size=1.2,diag_kind = 'kde',diag_kws=dict(shade=True),plot_kws=dict(s=10) )\ng.set(xticklabels=[])\n\n=== MARKDOWN 13 ===\n# Ensembling & Stacking models\n\nFinally after that brief whirlwind detour with regards to feature engineering and formatting, we finally arrive at the meat and gist of the this notebook.\n\nCreating a Stacking ensemble!\n\n=== MARKDOWN 14 ===\n### Helpers via Python Classes\n\nHere we invoke the use of Python's classes to help make it more convenient for us. For any newcomers to programming, one normally hears Classes being used in conjunction with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). In short, a class helps to extend some code/program for creating objects (variables for old-school peeps) as well as to implement functions and methods specific to that class.\n\nIn the section of code below, we essentially write a class *SklearnHelper* that allows one to extend the inbuilt methods (such as train, predict and fit) common to all the Sklearn c\n\n=== CODE 15 ===\n# Some useful parameters which will come in handy later on\nntrain = train.shape[0]\nntest = test.shape[0]\nSEED = 0 # for reproducibility\nNFOLDS = 5 # set folds for out-of-fold prediction\nkf = KFold(ntrain, n_folds= NFOLDS, random_state=SEED)\n\n# Class to extend the Sklearn classifier\nclass SklearnHelper(object):\n    def __init__(self, clf, seed=0, params=None):\n        params['random_state'] = seed\n        self.clf = clf(**params)\n\n    def train(self, x_train, y_train):\n        self.clf.fit(x_train, y_train)\n\n    def predict(self, x):\n        return self.clf.predict(x)\n    \n    def fit(self,x,y)\n\n=== MARKDOWN 16 ===\nBear with me for those who already know this but for people who have not created classes or objects in Python before, let me explain what the code given above does. In creating my base classifiers, I will only use the models already present in the Sklearn library and therefore only extend the class for that.\n\n**def init** : Python standard for invoking the default constructor for the class. This means that when you want to create an object (classifier), you have to give it the parameters of clf (what sklearn classifier you want), seed (random seed) and params (parameters for the classifiers).\n\n\n=== MARKDOWN 17 ===\n### Out-of-Fold Predictions\n\nNow as alluded to above in the introductory section, stacking uses predictions of base classifiers as input for training to a second-level model. However one cannot simply train the base models on the full training data, generate predictions on the full test set and then output these for the second-level training. This runs the risk of your base model predictions already having \"seen\" the test set and therefore overfitting when feeding these predictions.\n\n=== CODE 18 ===\ndef get_oof(clf, x_train, y_train, x_test):\n    oof_train = np.zeros((ntrain,))\n    oof_test = np.zeros((ntest,))\n    oof_test_skf = np.empty((NFOLDS, ntest))\n\n    for i, (train_index, test_index) in enumerate(kf):\n        x_tr = x_train[train_index]\n        y_tr = y_train[train_index]\n        x_te = x_train[test_index]\n\n        clf.train(x_tr, y_tr)\n\n        oof_train[test_index] = clf.predict(x_te)\n        oof_test_skf[i, :] = clf.predict(x_test)\n\n    oof_test[:] = oof_test_skf.mean(axis=0)\n    return oof_train.reshape(-1, 1), oof_test.reshape(-1, 1)\n\n=== MARKDOWN 19 ===\n# Generating our Base First-Level Models \n\nSo now let us prepare five learning models as our first level classification. These models can all be conveniently invoked via the Sklearn library and are listed as follows:\n\n 1. Random Forest classifier\n 2. Extra Trees classifier\n 3. AdaBoost classifer\n 4.

It was built to optimize large-scale boosted tree algorithms. For further information about the algorithm, check out the [official documentation][1].\n\n  [1]: https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n\nAnyways, we call an XGBClassifier and fit it to the first-level train and target data and use the learned model to predict the test data as follows:\n\n=== CODE 49 ===\ngbm = xgb.XGBClassifier(\n    #learning_rate = 0.02,\n n_estimators= 2000,\n max_depth= 4,\n min_child_weight= 2,\n #gamma=1,\n gamma=0.9,                        \n subsample=0.8,\n colsample_bytree=0.8,\n objective= 'binary:logistic',\n nthread= -1,\n scale_pos_weight=1).fit(x_train, y_train)\npredictions = gbm.predict(x_test)\n\n=== MARKDOWN 50 ===\nJust a quick run down of the XGBoost parameters used in the model:\n\n**max_depth** : How deep you want to grow your tree. Beware if set to too high a number might run the risk of overfitting.\n\n**gamma** : minimum loss reduction required to make a further partition on a leaf node of the tree. The larger, the more conservative the algorithm will be.\n\n**eta** : step size shrinkage used in each boosting step to prevent overfitting\n\n=== MARKDOWN 51 ===\n**Producing the Submission file**\n\nFinally having trained and fit all our first-level and second-level models, we can now output the predictions into the proper format for submission to the Titanic competition as follows:\n\n=== CODE 52 ===\n# Generate Submission File \nStackingSubmission = pd.DataFrame({ 'PassengerId': PassengerId,\n                            'Survived': predictions })\nStackingSubmission.to_csv(\"StackingSubmission.csv\", index=False)\n\n=== MARKDOWN 53 ===\n**Steps for Further Improvement**\n\nAs a closing remark it must be noted that the steps taken above just show a very simple way of producing an ensemble stacker. You hear of ensembles created at the highest level of Kaggle competitions which involves monstrous combinations of stacked classifiers as well as levels of stacking which go to more than 2 levels. \n\nSome additional steps that may be taken to improve one's score could be:\n\n 1. Implementing a good cross-validation strategy in training the models to find optimal parameter values\n 2. Introduce a greater variety of base models for learning.\n\n=== MARKDOWN 54 ===\n### Conclusion\n\nI have this notebook has been helpful somewhat in introducing a working script for stacking learning models. Again credit must be extended to Faron and Sina. \n\nFor other excellent material on stacking or ensembling in general, refer to the de-facto Must read article on the website MLWave: [Kaggle Ensembling Guide][1]. \n\nTill next time, Peace Out\n\n  [1]: http://mlwave.com/kaggle-ensembling-guide/\n\n=== CODE 55 ===\n\n\n\ntool: ✓ Recorded finding: Feature Engineering: FamilySize = SibSp + Parch + 1; IsAlone = 1 if FamilySize == 1; Title extracted...\n  Source: ../research/kernels/ldfreeman3_a-data-science-framework-to-achieve-99-accuracy\ntool: ✓ Recorded finding: Stacking Ensemble: Use 5 base models (RandomForest, ExtraTrees, AdaBoost, GradientBoosting, SVC) wit...\n  Source: ../research/kernels/arthurtok_introduction-to-ensembling-stacking-in-python\ntool: ✓ Recorded finding: Important features by importance: Title (especially 'Master' for male survival), Sex, Pclass, Age, F...\n  Source: ../research/kernels/arthurtok_introduction-to-ensembling-stacking-in-python\ntool: Created: /home/code/exploration/eda.ipynb\n\nStrong Note: OOM is unrecoverable.

However many will skip some of the explanation on how the solution is developed as these notebooks are developed by experts for experts. The objective of this notebook is to follow a step-by-step workflow, explaining each step and rationale for every decision we take during solution development.\\n\\n## Workflow stages\\n\\nThe competition solution workflow goes through seven stages described in the Data Science Solutions book.\\n\\n1. Question or problem definition.\\n2. Acquire training and testing data.\\n3. Wrangle, prepare, cleanse the data.\\n4. Analyze, identify patterns, and explore the data.\\n5. Model, predict and solve the problem.\\n6. Visualize, report, and present the problem solving steps and final solution.\\n7. Supply or submit the results.\\n\\nThe workflow indicates general sequence of how each stage may follow the other. However there are use cases with exceptions.\\n\\n- We may combine mulitple workflow stages. We may analyze by visualizing data.\\n- Perform a stage earlier than indicated. We may analyze data before and after wrangling.\\n- Perform a stage multiple times in our workflow. Visualize stage may be used multiple times.\\n- Drop a stage altogether. We may not need supply stage to productize or service enable our dataset for a competition.\\n\\n\\n## Question and problem definition\\n\\nCompetition sites like Kaggle define the problem to solve or questions to ask while providing the datasets for training your data science model and testing the model results against a test dataset. The question or problem definition for Titanic Survival competition is [described here at Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).\\n\\n> Knowing from a training set of samples listing passengers who survived or did not survive the Titanic disaster, can our model determine based on a given test dataset not containing the survival information, if these passengers in the test dataset survived or not.\\n\\nWe may also want to develop some early understanding about the domain of our problem. This is described on the [Kaggle competition description page here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). Here are the highlights to note.\\n\\n- On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. Translated 32% survival rate.\\n- One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew.\\n- Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.\\n\\n## Workflow goals\\n\\nThe data science solutions workflow solves for seven major goals.\\n\\n**Classifying.** We may want to classify or categorize our samples. We may also want to understand the implications or correlation of different classes with our solution goal.\\n\\n**Correlating.** One can approach the problem based on available features within the training dataset. Which features within the dataset contribute significantly to our solution goal? Statistically speaking is there a [correlation](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Correlation) among a feature and solution goal? As the feature values change does the solution state change as well, and visa-versa? This can be tested both for numerical and categorical features in the given dataset. We may also want to determine correlation among features other than survival for subsequent goals and workflow stages. Correlating certain features may help in creating, completing, or correcting features.\\n\\n**Converting.** For modeling stage, one needs to prepare the data. Depending on the choice of model algorithm one may require all features to be converted to numerical equivalent values. So for instance converting text categorical values to numeric values.\\n\\n**Completing.** Data preparation may also require us to estimate any missing values within a feature. Model algorithms may work best when there are no missing values.\\n\\n**Correcting.** We may also analyze the given training dataset for errors or possibly innacurate values within features and try to corrent these values or exclude the samples containing the errors. One way to do this is to detect any outliers among our samples or features. We may also completely discard a feature if it is not contribting to the analysis or may significantly skew the results.\\n\\n**Creating.** Can we create new features based on an existing feature or a set of features, such that the new feature follows the correlation, conversion, completeness goals.\\n\\n**Charting.** How to select the right visualization plots and charts depending on nature of the data and the solution goals.\"},{\"metadata\":{\"_uuid\":\"960f8b1937dc4915ce1eb0f82614b1985c4321a4\",\"_cell_guid\":\"56a3be4e-76ef-20c6-25e8-da16147cf6d7\"},\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"source\":\"## Refactor Release 2017-Jan-29\\n\\nWe are significantly refactoring the notebook based on (a) comments received by readers, (b) issues in porting notebook from Jupyter kernel (2.7) to Kaggle kernel (3.5), and (c) review of few more best practice kernels.\\n\\n### User comments\\n\\n- Combine training and test data for certain operations like converting titles across dataset to numerical values.

Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.\\n\\nWhile there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.\\n\\nIn this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).\\n\\n> #### Recommended Tutorial\\n> We highly recommend [Alexis Cook’s Titanic Tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/titanic-tutorial) that walks you through making your very first submission step by step and [this starter notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/gusthema/titanic-competition-w-tensorflow-decision-forests) to get started.\\n\\n## How Kaggle’s Competitions Work\\n1. **Join the Competition**\\nRead about the challenge description, accept the Competition Rules and gain access to the competition dataset.\\n1.  **Get to Work**\\nDownload the data, build models on it locally or on Kaggle Notebooks (our no-setup, customizable Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs) and generate a prediction file.\\n1.  **Make a Submission**\\nUpload your prediction as a submission on Kaggle and receive an accuracy score.\\n1.  **Check the Leaderboard**\\nSee how your model ranks against other Kagglers on our leaderboard. \\n1.  **Improve Your Score**\\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a> to find lots of tutorials and insights from other competitors.\\n\\n> #### Kaggle Lingo Video\\n> You may run into unfamiliar lingo as you dig into the Kaggle discussion forums and public notebooks. Check out  Dr. Rachael Tatman’s [video on Kaggle Lingo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEJHyuWKd-s) to get up to speed!\\n\\n## What Data Will I Use in This Competition?\\nIn this competition, you’ll gain access to two similar datasets that include passenger information like name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc. One dataset is titled `train.csv` and the other is titled `test.csv`.\\n\\n`Train.csv` will contain the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 to be exact) and importantly, will reveal whether they survived or not, also known as the “ground truth”.\\n\\nThe `test.csv` dataset contains similar information but does not disclose the “ground truth” for each passenger. It’s your job to predict these outcomes.\\n\\nUsing the patterns you find in the `train.csv` data, predict whether the other 418 passengers on board (found in `test.csv`) survived.\\n\\nCheck out the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data\">“Data” tab</a> to explore the datasets even further. Once you feel you’ve created a competitive model, submit it to Kaggle to see where your model stands on our leaderboard against other Kagglers.\\n\\n## How to Submit your Prediction to Kaggle\\nOnce you’re ready to make a submission and get on the leaderboard:\\n\\n1. Click on the “Submit Predictions” button\\n<img width=\"699\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen1.png\">\\n1. Upload a CSV file in the submission file format. You’re able to submit 10 submissions a day.\\n<img width=\"699\" align=\"center\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/welcome/screen2.png\">\\n\\n## Submission File Format:\\nYou should submit a csv file with exactly 418 entries plus a header row. Your submission will show an error if you have extra columns (beyond `PassengerId` and `Survived`) or rows.\\n\\nThe file should have exactly 2 columns:\\n- `PassengerId` (sorted in any order)\\n- `Survived` (contains your binary predictions: 1 for survived, 0 for deceased)\\n\\n## Got it! I’m ready to get started. Where do I get help if I need it?\\n- For Competition Help: <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\">Titanic Discussion Forum</a>\\n\\nKaggle doesn’t have a dedicated team to help troubleshoot your code so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. The forums are full of useful information on the data, metric, and different approaches. We encourage you to use the forums often. If you share your knowledge, you\\'ll find that others will share a lot in turn!\\n\\n## A Last Word on Kaggle Notebooks\\nAs we mentioned before, Kaggle Notebooks is our no-setup, customizable, Jupyter Notebooks environment with free GPUs and a huge repository of community published data &amp; code.\\n\\nIn every competition, you’ll find many Notebooks shared with incredible insights. It’s an invaluable resource worth becoming familiar with.

They are a great place to begin if you are new to data science or just finished a MOOC and want to get involved in Kaggle.</p>\\n<p>Getting Started competitions are a non-competitive way to get familiar with Kaggle’s platform, learn basic machine learning concepts, and start meeting people in the community. They have no cash prize and are on a rolling timeline.</p>\\n<h2>How do I create and manage a team?</h2>\\n<p>When you accept the competition rules, a team will be created for you. You can invite others to your team, accept a merger with another team, and update basic information like team name by going to the More &gt; <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/team\" target=\"_blank\">Team</a> page.</p>\\n<p>We\\'ve heard from many Kagglers that teaming up is the best way to learn new skills AND have fun. If you don\\'t have a teammate already, consider asking if anyone wants to team up in the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">discussion forum</a>.</p>\\n<h2>What are Notebooks?</h2>\\n<p>Kaggle Notebooks is a cloud computational environment that enables reproducible and collaborative analysis. Notebooks support scripts in Python and R, Jupyter Notebooks, and RMarkdown reports. You can visit the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/notebooks\" target=\"_blank\">Notebooks</a> tab to view all of the publicly shared code for the Titanic competition. For more on how to use Notebooks to learn data science, check out our <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview\" target=\"&quot;_blank\">Courses</a>!</p>\\n<h2>Why did my team disappear from the leaderboard?</h2>\\n<p>To keep with the spirit of getting-started competitions, we have implemented a two month rolling window on submissions. Once a submission is more than two months old, it will be invalidated and no longer count towards the leaderboard.</p>\\n<p>If your team has no submissions in the previous two months, the team will also drop from the leaderboard. This will keep the leaderboard at a manageable size, freshen it up, and prevent newcomers from getting lost in a sea of abandoned scores.</p>\\n<p><i>\"I worked so hard to get that score! Give it back!\"</i> Read more about our decision to implement a rolling leaderboard <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion/6240\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\\n<h2>How do I contact Support?</h2>\\n<p>Kaggle does not have a dedicated support team so you’ll typically find that you receive a response more quickly by asking your question in the appropriate forum. (For this competition, you’ll want to use the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/discussion\" target=\"_blank\">Titanic discussion forum)</a>.</p>\\n<p>Support is only able to help with issues that are being experienced by all participants. Before contacting support, please check the discussion forum for information on your problem. If you can’t find it, you can post your problem in the forum so a fellow participant or a Kaggle team member can provide help. The forums are full of useful information on the data, metric, and different approaches. We encourage you to use the forums often. If you share your knowledge, you\\'ll find that others will share a lot in turn!</p>\\n<p>If your problem persists or it seems to be effective all participants then please <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/contact\" target=\"_blank\">contact us</a>.</p>'}, {'role': 'tool', 'content': 'Not a directory: /home/code/exploration/../research/writeups'}, {'role': 'tool', 'content': '/home/code/exploration/../research/kernels:\\n[DIR]  alexisbcook_exercise-arithmetic-and-variables/\\n[DIR]  alexisbcook_titanic-tutorial/\\n[DIR]  arthurtok_introduction-to-ensembling-stacking-in-python/\\n[DIR]  ldfreeman3_a-data-science-framework-to-achieve-99-accuracy/\\n[FILE] metadata.json (1.7KB)\\n[DIR]  startupsci_titanic-data-science-solutions/'}, {'role': 'tool', 'content': '/home/data:\\n[FILE] description.md (13.6KB)\\n[FILE] gender_submission.csv (3.2KB)\\n[FILE] test.csv (28.0KB)\\n[FILE] train.csv (59.8KB)'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': \"REASONING: Good, I can see this is the classic Titanic survival prediction problem - binary classification with accuracy as the metric.

In a nutshell stacking uses as a first-level (base), the predictions of a few basic classifiers and then uses another model at the second-level to predict the output from the earlier first-level predictions.\\n\\nThe Titanic dataset is a prime candidate for introducing this concept as many newcomers to Kaggle start out here.

This is good from a point of view of feeding these features into your learning model because this means that there isn\\'t much redundant or superfluous data in our training set and we are happy that each feature carries with it some unique information. Here are two most correlated features are that of Family size and Parch (Parents and Children).

For any newcomers to programming, one normally hears Classes being used in conjunction with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). In short, a class helps to extend some code/program for creating objects (variables for old-school peeps) as well as to implement functions and methods specific to that class.\\n\\nIn the section of code below, we essentially write a class *SklearnHelper* that allows one to extend the inbuilt methods (such as train, predict and fit) common to all the Sklearn c\\n\\n=== CODE 15 ===\\n# Some useful parameters which will come in handy later on\\nntrain = train.shape[0]\\nntest = test.shape[0]\\nSEED = 0 # for reproducibility\\nNFOLDS = 5 # set folds for out-of-fold prediction\\nkf = KFold(ntrain, n_folds= NFOLDS, random_state=SEED)\\n\\n# Class to extend the Sklearn classifier\\nclass SklearnHelper(object):\\n    def __init__(self, clf, seed=0, params=None):\\n        params[\\'random_state\\'] = seed\\n        self.clf = clf(**params)\\n\\n    def train(self, x_train, y_train):\\n        self.clf.fit(x_train, y_train)\\n\\n    def predict(self, x):\\n        return self.clf.predict(x)\\n    \\n    def fit(self,x,y)\\n\\n=== MARKDOWN 16 ===\\nBear with me for those who already know this but for people who have not created classes or objects in Python before, let me explain what the code given above does. In creating my base classifiers, I will only use the models already present in the Sklearn library and therefore only extend the class for that.\\n\\n**def init** : Python standard for invoking the default constructor for the class. This means that when you want to create an object (classifier), you have to give it the parameters of clf (what sklearn classifier you want), seed (random seed) and params (parameters for the classifiers).\\n\\n\\n=== MARKDOWN 17 ===\\n### Out-of-Fold Predictions\\n\\nNow as alluded to above in the introductory section, stacking uses predictions of base classifiers as input for training to a second-level model. However one cannot simply train the base models on the full training data, generate predictions on the full test set and then output these for the second-level training. This runs the risk of your base model predictions already having \"seen\" the test set and therefore overfitting when feeding these predictions.\\n\\n=== CODE 18 ===\\ndef get_oof(clf, x_train, y_train, x_test):\\n    oof_train = np.zeros((ntrain,))\\n    oof_test = np.zeros((ntest,))\\n    oof_test_skf = np.empty((NFOLDS, ntest))\\n\\n    for i, (train_index, test_index) in enumerate(kf):\\n        x_tr = x_train[train_index]\\n        y_tr = y_train[train_index]\\n        x_te = x_train[test_index]\\n\\n        clf.train(x_tr, y_tr)\\n\\n        oof_train[test_index] = clf.predict(x_te)\\n        oof_test_skf[i, :] = clf.predict(x_test)\\n\\n    oof_test[:] = oof_test_skf.mean(axis=0)\\n    return oof_train.reshape(-1, 1), oof_test.reshape(-1, 1)\\n\\n=== MARKDOWN 19 ===\\n# Generating our Base First-Level Models \\n\\nSo now let us prepare five learning models as our first level classification.

It was built to optimize large-scale boosted tree algorithms. For further information about the algorithm, check out the [official documentation][1].\\n\\n  [1]: https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\\n\\nAnyways, we call an XGBClassifier and fit it to the first-level train and target data and use the learned model to predict the test data as follows:\\n\\n=== CODE 49 ===\\ngbm = xgb.XGBClassifier(\\n    #learning_rate = 0.02,\\n n_estimators= 2000,\\n max_depth= 4,\\n min_child_weight= 2,\\n #gamma=1,\\n gamma=0.9,                        \\n subsample=0.8,\\n colsample_bytree=0.8,\\n objective= \\'binary:logistic\\',\\n nthread= -1,\\n scale_pos_weight=1).fit(x_train, y_train)\\npredictions = gbm.predict(x_test)\\n\\n=== MARKDOWN 50 ===\\nJust a quick run down of the XGBoost parameters used in the model:\\n\\n**max_depth** : How deep you want to grow your tree. Beware if set to too high a number might run the risk of overfitting.\\n\\n**gamma** : minimum loss reduction required to make a further partition on a leaf node of the tree. The larger, the more conservative the algorithm will be.\\n\\n**eta** : step size shrinkage used in each boosting step to prevent overfitting\\n\\n=== MARKDOWN 51 ===\\n**Producing the Submission file**\\n\\nFinally having trained and fit all our first-level and second-level models, we can now output the predictions into the proper format for submission to the Titanic competition as follows:\\n\\n=== CODE 52 ===\\n# Generate Submission File \\nStackingSubmission = pd.DataFrame({ \\'PassengerId\\': PassengerId,\\n                            \\'Survived\\': predictions })\\nStackingSubmission.to_csv(\"StackingSubmission.csv\", index=False)\\n\\n=== MARKDOWN 53 ===\\n**Steps for Further Improvement**\\n\\nAs a closing remark it must be noted that the steps taken above just show a very simple way of producing an ensemble stacker. You hear of ensembles created at the highest level of Kaggle competitions which involves monstrous combinations of stacked classifiers as well as levels of stacking which go to more than 2 levels. \\n\\nSome additional steps that may be taken to improve one\\'s score could be:\\n\\n 1. Implementing a good cross-validation strategy in training the models to find optimal parameter values\\n 2. Introduce a greater variety of base models for learning.\\n\\n=== MARKDOWN 54 ===\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nI have this notebook has been helpful somewhat in introducing a working script for stacking learning models.

However many will skip some of the explanation on how the solution is developed as these notebooks are developed by experts for experts. The objective of this notebook is to follow a step-by-step workflow, explaining each step and rationale for every decision we take during solution development.\\\\n\\\\n## Workflow stages\\\\n\\\\nThe competition solution workflow goes through seven stages described in the Data Science Solutions book.\\\\n\\\\n1. Question or problem definition.\\\\n2. Acquire training and testing data.\\\\n3. Wrangle, prepare, cleanse the data.\\\\n4. Analyze, identify patterns, and explore the data.\\\\n5. Model, predict and solve the problem.\\\\n6. Visualize, report, and present the problem solving steps and final solution.\\\\n7. Supply or submit the results.\\\\n\\\\nThe workflow indicates general sequence of how each stage may follow the other. However there are use cases with exceptions.\\\\n\\\\n- We may combine mulitple workflow stages. We may analyze by visualizing data.\\\\n- Perform a stage earlier than indicated. We may analyze data before and after wrangling.\\\\n- Perform a stage multiple times in our workflow. Visualize stage may be used multiple times.\\\\n- Drop a stage altogether. We may not need supply stage to productize or service enable our dataset for a competition.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n## Question and problem definition\\\\n\\\\nCompetition sites like Kaggle define the problem to solve or questions to ask while providing the datasets for training your data science model and testing the model results against a test dataset. The question or problem definition for Titanic Survival competition is [described here at Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).\\\\n\\\\n> Knowing from a training set of samples listing passengers who survived or did not survive the Titanic disaster, can our model determine based on a given test dataset not containing the survival information, if these passengers in the test dataset survived or not.\\\\n\\\\nWe may also want to develop some early understanding about the domain of our problem. This is described on the [Kaggle competition description page here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). Here are the highlights to note.\\\\n\\\\n- On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. Translated 32% survival rate.\\\\n- One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew.\\\\n- Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.\\\\n\\\\n## Workflow goals\\\\n\\\\nThe data science solutions workflow solves for seven major goals.\\\\n\\\\n**Classifying.** We may want to classify or categorize our samples. We may also want to understand the implications or correlation of different classes with our solution goal.\\\\n\\\\n**Correlating.** One can approach the problem based on available features within the training dataset. Which features within the dataset contribute significantly to our solution goal? Statistically speaking is there a [correlation](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Correlation) among a feature and solution goal? As the feature values change does the solution state change as well, and visa-versa? This can be tested both for numerical and categorical features in the given dataset. We may also want to determine correlation among features other than survival for subsequent goals and workflow stages. Correlating certain features may help in creating, completing, or correcting features.\\\\n\\\\n**Converting.** For modeling stage, one needs to prepare the data. Depending on the choice of model algorithm one may require all features to be converted to numerical equivalent values. So for instance converting text categorical values to numeric values.\\\\n\\\\n**Completing.** Data preparation may also require us to estimate any missing values within a feature. Model algorithms may work best when there are no missing values.\\\\n\\\\n**Correcting.** We may also analyze the given training dataset for errors or possibly innacurate values within features and try to corrent these values or exclude the samples containing the errors. One way to do this is to detect any outliers among our samples or features. We may also completely discard a feature if it is not contribting to the analysis or may significantly skew the results.\\\\n\\\\n**Creating.** Can we create new features based on an existing feature or a set of features, such that the new feature follows the correlation, conversion, completeness goals.\\\\n\\\\n**Charting.** How to select the right visualization plots and charts depending on nature of the data and the solution goals.\"},{\"metadata\":{\"_uuid\":\"960f8b1937dc4915ce1eb0f82614b1985c4321a4\",\"_cell_guid\":\"56a3be4e-76ef-20c6-25e8-da16147cf6d7\"},\"cell_type\":\"markdown\",\"source\":\"## Refactor Release 2017-Jan-29\\\\n\\\\nWe are significantly refactoring the notebook based on (a) comments received by readers, (b) issues in porting notebook from Jupyter kernel (2.7) to Kaggle kernel (3.5), and (c) review of few more best practice kernels.\\\\n\\\\n### User comments\\\\n\\\\n- Combine training and test data for certain operations like converting titles across dataset to numerical values.
