Over 1,500 passengers and crew perished that fateful night. Understanding the factors that contributed to survival can provide valuable insights into safety protocols and social dynamics during crises. In this project, we will leverage machine learning techniques to predict the survival chances of Titanic passengers based on various features, such as sex, age, and passenger class. Using the Random Forest classification algorithm, we aim to build a predictive model that will allow us to estimate the likelihood of survival for each individual aboard the Titanic.\n\nTable of Content\n\n- [Objective of the Project: Predicting Titanic Passenger Survival](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/www.geeksforgeeks.org#objective-of-the-project-predicting-titanic-passenger-survival)\n- [Step-by-Step Implementation: Predicting Titanic Survival](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/www.geeksforgeeks.org#stepbystep-implementation-predicting-titanic-survival)\n- [Prediction: Generating Survival Predictions on Test Data](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/www.geeksforgeeks.org#prediction-generating-survival-predictions-on-test-data)\n\n## Objective of the Project: Predicting Titanic Passenger Survival\n\nThe primary objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting the survival status of Titanic passengers based on available data. The dataset includes information such as demographic attributes (age, sex), socioeconomic status (fare, class), and other relevant features. By analyzing these features, we seek to identify patterns that could influence survival rates and subsequently use these insights to make predictions on unseen data.\n\nThere will be three main steps in this experiment:\n\n- Feature Engineering\n- Imputation\n- Training and Prediction\n\nFor this project, we will utilize the Titanic dataset. The dataset consists of the following files:\n\n1. [**train.csv**](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240903112658/train.csv): Contains information about the passengers and their survival status, which will be used for training our model. Serves as our primary data source for training and validation, providing both features and target labels.\n2. [**test**](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240903112657/test.csv) **.csv**: Includes details of passengers without survival labels, which we will use for making predictions. Allows us to assess the model's performance on unseen data, simulating a real-world scenario where predictions must be made for new passengers.\n3. [**gender\\_submission**](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240903112657/gender_submission.csv) **.csv**: A sample submission file that demonstrates the format required for submitting predictions.\n\n## Step-by-Step Implementation: Predicting Titanic Survival\n\n### 1\\. Importing Libraries and Initial setup\n\nPython`\nimport warnings\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nplt.style.use('fivethirtyeight')\n%matplotlib inline\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')`\n\nNow let's read the training and test data using the pandas data frame.\n\nPython`\ntrain = pd.read_csv('train.csv')\ntest = pd.read_csv('test.csv')\n# To know number of columns and rows\ntrain.shape\n# (891, 12)`\n\nTo know the information about each column like the data type, etc we use the df.info() function.\n\nPython`\ntrain.info()`\n\n**Output:**\n\n```\n<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>RangeIndex: 891 entries, 0 to 890Data columns (total 12 columns): #   Column       Non-Null Count  Dtype  ---  ------       --------------  -----   0   PassengerId  891 non-null    int64   1   Survived     891 non-null    int64   2   Pclass       891 non-null    int64   3   Name         891 non-null    object  4   Sex          891 non-null    object  5   Age          714 non-null    float64 6   SibSp        891 non-null    int64   7   Parch        891 non-null    int64   8   Ticket       891 non-null    object  9   Fare         891 non-null    float64 10  Cabin        204 non-null    object  11  Embarked     889 non-null    object dtypes: float64(2), int64(5), object(5)\n```\n\nNow let's see if there are any NULL values present in the dataset. This can be checked using the isnull() function. It yields the following output.\n\nPython`\ntrain.isnull().sum()`\n\n**Output:**\n\n```\nmemory usage: 83.7+ KBPassengerId      0Survived         0Pclass           0Name             0Sex              0Age            177SibSp            0Parch            0Ticket           0Fare             0Cabin          687Embarked         2dtype: int64\n```\n\n### 2\\. Data Visualization: Understanding Survival Trends and Passenger Demographics\n\nNow let us visualize the data using some pie charts and histograms to get a proper understanding of the data.\n\n- **Let us first visualize the number of survivors and death counts:**\n\nPython`\nf, ax = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(12, 4))\ntrain['Survived'].value_counts().plot.pie(\n\texplode=[0, 0.1], autopct='%1.1f%%', ax=ax[0], shadow=False)\nax[0].set_title('Survivors (1) and the dead (0)')\nax[0].set_ylabel('')\nsns.countplot(x='Survived', data=train, ax=ax[1])\nax[1].set_ylabel('Quantity')\nax[1].set_title('Survivors (1) and the dead (0)')\nplt.show()\n# This code is modified by Susobhan Akhuli`\n\nOutput:\n\nnumber of survivors and death counts\n\n- **Analyzing the Impact of Sex on Survival Rates**: Reflects the focus on exploring how the gender of passengers influenced their chances of survival.\n\nPython`\nf, ax = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(12, 4))\ntrain[['Sex', 'Survived']].groupby(['Sex']).mean().plot.bar(ax=ax[0])\nax[0].set_title('Survivors by sex')\nsns.countplot(x='Sex', hue='Survived', data=train, ax=ax[1])\nax[1].set_ylabel('Quantity')\nax[1].set_title('Survived (1) and deceased (0): men and women')\nplt.show()\n# This code is modified by Susobhan Akhuli`\n\n**Output:**\n\nTitanic Survival Prediction\n\n### 3\\. Feature Engineering: Optimizing Data for Model Training\n\nThis section focuses on refining the dataset by removing irrelevant features and transforming categorical data into numerical formats. Key tasks include:\n\n- **Dropping Redundant Features:** Removing columns like `Cabin` that offer limited predictive value.\n- **Creating New Features:** Introducing a new column to indicate wh...",

Your algorithm wins the competition if it's the most accurate on a particular data set. Kaggle is a fun way to practice your machine learning skills.\nIn this tutorial we'll learn learn how to:\n* Approach a Kaggle competition\n* Explore the competition data and learn about the competition topic\n* Prepare data for machine learning\n* Train a model\n* Measure the accuracy of your model\n* Prepare and make your first Kaggle submission\nThis tutorial presumes you have an understanding of Python and the pandas library. If you need to learn about these, we recommend our[pandas tutorial](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/pandas-python-tutorial/)blog post.\n## The Titanic competition\nKaggle has created a number of competitions designed for beginners. The most popular of these competitions, and the one we'll be looking at, is about predicting which passengers survived the[sinking of the Titanic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinking_of_the_RMS_Titanic).\nIn this[Titanic ML competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic), we have data about passengers onboard the Titanic, and we'll see if we can use that information to predict whether those people survived or not. Before we start looking at this specific competition, let's take a moment to understand how Kaggle competitions work.\nEach Kaggle competition has two key data files that you will work with - a**training**set and a**testing**set.\nThe training set contains data we can use to train our model. It has a number of feature columns which contain various descriptive data, as well as a column of the target values we are trying to predict: in this case,`Survival`.\nThe testing set contains all of the same feature columns, but is missing the target value column. Additionally, the testing set usually has fewer observations (rows) than the training set.\nThis is useful because we want as much data as we can to train our model on. Once we have trained our model on the training set, we will use that model to make predictions on the data from the testing set, and submit those predictions to Kaggle.\nIn this competition, the two files are named`test.csv`and`train.csv`. We'll start by using[`pandas.read\\_csv()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.read_csv.html)to read both files and then inspect their size.\n```\n`import pandas as pd\ntest = pd.read\\_csv(\"test.csv\")\ntrain = pd.read\\_csv(\"train.csv\")\nprint(\"Dimensions of train: {}\".format(train.shape))\nprint(\"Dimensions of test: {}\".format(test.shape))`\n```\n```\n`Dimensions of train: (891, 12)\nDimensions of test: (418, 11)`\n```\n## Exploring the data\nThe files we just opened are available on[the data page for the Titanic competition on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data). That page also has a**data dictionary**, which explains the various columns that make up the data set. Below are the descriptions contained in that data dictionary:\n* `PassengerID`\u2014 A column added by Kaggle to identify each row and make submissions easier\n* `Survived`\u2014 Whether the passenger survived or not and the value we are predicting*(0=No, 1=Yes)*\n* `Pclass`\u2014 The class of the ticket the passenger purchased*(1=1st, 2=2nd, 3=3rd)*\n* `Sex`\u2014 The passenger's sex\n* `Age`\u2014 The passenger's age in years\n* `SibSp`\u2014 The number of siblings or spouses the passenger had aboard the Titanic\n* `Parch`\u2014 The number of parents or children the passenger had aboard the Titanic\n* `Ticket`\u2014 The passenger's ticket number\n* `Fare`\u2014 The fare the passenger paid\n* `Cabin`\u2014 The passenger's cabin number\n* `Embarked`\u2014 The port where the passenger embarked*(C=Cherbourg, Q=Queenstown, S=Southampton)*\nThe data page on Kaggle has some additional notes about some of the columns. It's always worth exploring this in detail to get a full understanding of the data.\nLet's take a look at the first few rows of the`train`dataframe.\n```\n`train.head()`\n```\n||PassengerId|Survived|Pclass|Name|Sex|Age|SibSp|Parch|Ticket|Fare|Cabin|Embarked|\n0|1|0|3|Braund, Mr. Owen Harris|male|22.0|1|0|A/5 21171|7.2500|NaN|S|\n1|2|1|1|Cumings, Mrs. John Bradley (Florence Briggs Th...|female|38.0|1|0|PC 17599|71.2833|C85|C|\n2|3|1|3|Heikkinen, Miss. Laina|female|26.0|0|0|STON/O2. 3101282|7.9250|NaN|S|\n3|4|1|1|Futrelle, Mrs. Jacques Heath (Lily May Peel)|female|35.0|1|0|113803|53.1000|C123|S|\n4|5|0|3|Allen, Mr. William Henry|male|35.0|0|0|373450|8.0500|NaN|S|\nThe type of machine learning we will be doing is called**classification**, because when we make predictions we are classifying each passenger as 'survived' or not. More specifically, we are performing**binary classification**, which means that there are only two different states we are classifying.\nIn any machine learning exercise, thinking about the topic you are predicting is very important. We call this step acquiring domain knowledge, and it's one of the most important determinants for success in machine learning.\nIn this case, understanding the Titanic disaster and specifically what variables might affect the outcome of survival is important. Anyone who has watched the movie[Titanic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanic_(1997_film))would remember that women and children were given preference to lifeboats (as they were in real life). You would also remember the vast class disparity of the passengers.\nThis indicates that`Age`,`Sex`, and`PClass`may be good predictors of survival. We'll start by exploring`Sex`and`Pclass`by visualizing the data.\nBecause the`Survived`column contains`0`if the passenger did not survive and`1`if they did, we can segment our data by sex and calculate the mean of this column. We can use`DataFrame.pivot\\_table()`to easily do this:\n```\n`import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline\nsex\\_pivot = train.pivot\\_table(index=\"Sex\",values=\"Survived\")\nsex\\_pivot.plot.bar()\nplt.show()`\n```\nWe can immediately see that females survived in much higher proportions than males did. Let's do the same with the`Pclass`column.\n```\n`class\\_pivot = train.pivot\\_table(index=\"Pclass\",values=\"Survived\")\nclass\\_pivot.plot.bar()\nplt.show()`\n```\n## Exploring and converting the age column\nThe`Sex`and`PClass`columns are what we call**categorical**features. That means that the values represented a few separate options (for instance, whether the passenger was male or female).\nLet's take a look at the`Age`column using[`Series.describe()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.Series.describe.html).\n```\n`train[\"Age\"].describe()`\n```\n```\n`count 714.000000\nmean 29.699118\nstd 14.526497\nmin 0.420000\n25% 20.125000\n50% 28.000000\n75% 38.000000\nmax 80.000000\nName: Age, dtype: float64`\n```\nThe`Age`column contains numbers ranging from`0.42`to`80.0`(If you look at Kaggle's data page, it informs us that`Age`is fractional if the passenger is less than one). The other thing to note here is that there are 714 values in this column, fewer than the 814 rows we discovered that the`train`data set had earlier which indicates we have some missing values.\nAll of this means that the`Age`column needs to be treated slightly differently, as this is a continuous numerical column. One way to look at distribution of values in a continuous numerical set is to use histograms. We can create two histograms to compare visuall...",
