      "text": "Based on the Encyclopedia\u202fTitanica passenger explorer (which lists each passenger\u2019s name, class, ticket, cabin, embarkation port and a **Survived** flag) and the fact that the Kaggle Titanic test file uses the same identifiers (name, class, ticket, cabin, embarkation, etc.)\u202f([Encyclopedia\u202fTitanica Explorer](https://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/explorer)\u202f|\u202f[Encyclopedia\u202fTitanica as source for Titanic datasets](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/doc/Stat2Data/Titanic.html)) you can retrieve the true outcomes by matching records manually or with a script.\n\n**Step\u2011by\u2011step matching workflow**\n\n1. **Download the Kaggle test set** (`test.csv`). It contains the columns `Name`, `Pclass`, `Ticket`, `Cabin`, `Embarked`, plus other features such as `Sex` and `Age`\u202f([Safe\u2011DS Titanic sample](https://datasets.safeds.com/en/latest/datasets/titanic)).\n\n2. **Create a lookup table from Encyclopedia\u202fTitanica**  \n   * Open the **Titanic People Explorer** at the URL above.  \n   * Use the search bar to query each passenger by **exact name** (e.g., \u201cDoe, Mr. John\u201d).  \n   * For each match, note the fields **Survived**, **Class**, **Ticket**, **Cabin**, **Embarked** (all displayed in the table).  \n   * If you have a subscription, export the full list (CSV) to avoid manual entry; otherwise copy the rows you need.\n\n3. **Standardize the identifiers**  \n   * Ensure the name format matches Kaggle\u2019s (`Last, Title. First`).  \n   * Convert the class column to the numeric `Pclass` used by Kaggle (1\u202f=\u202fFirst, 2\u202f=\u202fSecond, 3\u202f=\u202fThird).  \n   * Align ticket and cabin strings (remove extra spaces, keep the same case).\n\n4. **Merge the two tables**  \n   * In Python (or R), read both CSVs (`pandas.read_csv` or `readr::read_csv`).  \n   * Perform a left\u2011join of the Kaggle test data with the Encyclopedia lookup on `Name` (or on a composite key of `Name`, `Ticket`, `Cabin` if names are ambiguous):  \n\n   ```python\n   merged = test_df.merge(lookup_df[['Name','Survived']], on='Name', how='left')\n   ```\n\n   * The resulting `Survived` column now contains the historical outcome for each test passenger.\n\n5. **Validate matches**  \n   * Check rows where `Survived` is still missing \u2013 they may be misspelled or have multiple possible matches.  \n   * Resolve ambiguities by cross\u2011checking additional fields (class, ticket, cabin, embarkation) from the explorer.\n\n6. **Use the enriched test set**  \n   * You now have the true survival label for every passenger that could be matched, which can be used for verification, error analysis, or as a \u201cground\u2011truth\u201d benchmark.\n\n**Key points**\n\n* The Explorer provides the exact **Survived** flag you need\u202f([Result\u202f1](https://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/explorer)).  \n* The historical data originates from Encyclopedia\u202fTitanica, the same source used to build many public Titanic datasets\u202f([Result\u202f9](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/doc/Stat2Data/Titanic.html)).  \n* Aligning column names and formats (as shown in typical Titanic datasets) ensures a clean join\u202f([Result\u202f8](https://datasets.safeds.com/en/latest/datasets/titanic)).  \n\nFollowing these steps will let you map each Kaggle test passenger to his or her official Titanic record and retrieve the true survival outcome.",

      "title": "Survivability Study of the 1912 RMS Titanic Disaster",
      "text": "<div><p><strong>A statistical and machine learning analysis examining factors affecting passenger survival on the Titanic. Using updated data and various machine learning models, including Random Forests and Neural Networks, the study analyzes demographic and personal characteristics such as age, class, sex, nationality, and travel companions. The findings highlight the importance of factors like passenger sex, ticket class, and age in determining survival probabilities, offering a predictive model for theoretical scenarios.</strong></p><div><h3>ABSTRACT</h3>\n<p>While being almost a decade since the centenary of the RMS <a href=\"https://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/titanic/\">Titanic</a> disaster, researchers still search for reasons as to why passengers with certain characteristics were more likely to survive than others. Utilising a privately available dataset, passenger features were analysed to study the extent of their importance in determining the mortality of those onboard during her fateful <a href=\"https://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/keeping-track.html\">maiden voyage</a>. The characteristics studied were sex, ticket class, age, nationality, allocated cabin, port of boarding, number of companions travelled with, whether a spouse boarded with them and the purpose of their voyage.</p>\n<p>This study was performed through a manual statistical analysis of the dataset and the utilisation of two machine learning models; a Random Forest and a Linear Discriminant Analysis model. During training, each model weighted the importance of each passenger feature, which verified the patterns found from the initial statistical analysis.</p>\n<p>In addition to those two models, a Support Vector Machine and a Neural Network were produced and compared to observe which classification method performed the most optimally. The Random Forest achieved the highest score and was subsequently integrated into a Graphical User Interface, which gave the user the capability to input theoretical passenger characteristics into the model to predict whether that passenger would have survived the disaster.</p>\n<h3>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</h3>\n<p>For those who suffered as a result of the 1912 RMS Titanic disaster, in memoriam.</p>\n<p>Eternal Father! strong to save,<br/>Whose arm hath bound the restless wave,<br/>Who bid'st the mighty ocean deep<br/>Its own appointed limits keep:<br/>O hear us when we cry to Thee<br/>For those in peril on the sea.</p>\n<p><em>- <a href=\"https://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/eternal-father.html\">William Whitling</a></em></p>\n<h3>GLOSSARY</h3>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Term</th>\n<th>Definition</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Amidships</td>\n<td>Centreline of a ship</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Aport</td>\n<td>Towards the left of a ship</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Astarboard</td>\n<td>Towards the starboard-side of a ship</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Astern</td>\n<td>Towards the rear of a ship</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>FN</td>\n<td>False Negatives</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Forward</td>\n<td>Towards the front of a ship</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>FP</td>\n<td>False Positives</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>GUI</td>\n<td>Graphical User Interface</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Inboard</td>\n<td>Towards the centre of a ship</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>LDA</td>\n<td>Linear Discriminant Analysis</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>MLM</td>\n<td>Machine Learning Models</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>NN</td>\n<td>Neural Network</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Outboard</td>\n<td>Towards out-most sides of a ship</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Port</td>\n<td>Left-side of a ship</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>RF</td>\n<td>Random Forest</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>RMS</td>\n<td>Royal Mail Ship</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Starboard</td>\n<td>Right-side of a ship</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>SVM</td>\n<td>Support Vector Machine</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>TN</td>\n<td>True Negatives</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>TP</td>\n<td>True Positives</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>1 INTRODUCTION</h3>\n<h4>1.1 Project Background</h4>\n<p>RMS (Royal Mail Ship) Titanic was a four-funnelled steamship built in 1912 for transatlantic crossings, designed with customer comfort in mind alongside the latest innovations in safety technology. Four days after leaving <a href=\"https://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/titanic-places/southampton.html\">Southampton</a> for <a href=\"https://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/titanic-places/new-york-city.html\">New York</a> , she struck an iceberg in the North Atlantic Ocean and sank, tragically taking 1496 of the 2208 souls onboard with her. (Encyclopedia Titanica, 2018)</p>\n<p>While conclusions regarding the causes of the catastrophe are already well-established (Garzke, Foecke, Matthias, &amp; Wood, 2000), individuals from both professional and amateur backgrounds still analyse passenger datasets to determine the extent in which each passenger characteristic contributed to passenger\u2019s chance of survival. This project is a continuation of this research, which confirms the widely recognised key determinant factors in survivability; sex, class and age. In addition to this, several new passenger attributes of varying importance were discovered, prepared and analysed; nationality, number of travel companions and whether or not they boarded with a spouse.</p>\n<p>The common approach to RMS Titanic passenger analysis was to employ the publicly available dataset from Kaggle, who distributed it as the basis of their introductory machine learning competition (Kaggle, 2019). According to Vanderbilt University who distribute a more complete version of this dataset however, it had not been updated since 1999 (Cason, 2012). In light of this, far more up-to-date data has been obtained from the leading RMS Titanic online archive, <a href=\"https://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/\">Encyclopedia Titanica</a>, for this project. The survivability patterns found from this extended dataset are not definitive, but rather exist to inspire others to pursue further research and to search archived primary sources to create a more complete explanation of mortality rates across different passenger characteristics.</p>\n<h4>1.2 Aims and Objectives</h4>\n<p>The primary aim of this project was to continue the study of the importance of RMS Titanic passenger characteristics on survival rates by employing the most up-to-date archive data possible; analysing new features that had not yet been studied through manual data analysis and machine learning techniques.</p>\n<p>The secondary aim was to provide the reader with the capability to program a MLM (Machine Learning Model) to predict survivability for theoretical passenger data.</p>\n<p>This project had eight objectives:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Obtain the most up-to-date RMS Titanic passenger archive data.</li>\n<li>Format the data from (1) into datasets useful for analytical purposes.</li>\n<li>Perform a statistical analysis on the passenger population demographics using the dataset from (2).</li>\n<li>Perform a historic study on how passenger characteristics affected their likelihood of surviving the disaster using the dataset from (2).</li>\n<li>Employ several machine learning methods, training MLMs using the datasets from (2).</li>\n<li>Compare the accuracy of MLMs from (5) in a variety of ways.</li>\n<li>Numerically establish the importance of each passenger feature in survivability.</li>\n<li>Create a GUI (Graphical User Interface) that employs the most optimal MLM from (6) to predict the outcome of a theoretical passenger, who\u2019s features are inputted bythe user.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>1.3 Methodology</h4>\n<p>The raw dataset was gathered through a query run by the Encyclopedia Titanica Facebook team on their most up-to-date database at the time of data generation, November 2018.</p>\n<p>An additional query request was made to Encyclopedia Titanica, who kindly sent data for pairs of passengers who were recorded as having travelled together.

      "text": "# \ud83d\udea2 Predicting the Outcome of the Titanic Passengers\n\nMay 8, 2021\n\n15 min read\n\nMachine Learning\n\nThe Kaggle's Titanic Competition is a well-known beginner's Machine Learning problem. The goal is simple: Using Machine Learning create a model to predict which passengers survived the shipwreck.\n\nThis is a good starting point to build a complete first project. And have the opportunity to explore different techniques along the way.\n\nIn this post, I would like to share some of the ideas I have applied to tackle this project and guide you through the different steps of the work done.\n\nI will begin doing some data exploration and visualization. To get a better understanding of the dataset. The next step is to handle any missing values and perform feature engineering to extract some new insights from the data. Finally, I will try to predict the outcome using different models and compare their performances to find the most suitable one for this project. In the end, I will attempt to improve the results by optimizing the final model parameters.\n\n**Table of Contents:**\n\n1.

[Final Thoughts](https://hmatalonga.com/hmatalonga.com#final-thoughts)\n\n## Installing Dependencies and Importing Libraries\n\nBefore diving into the project, make sure you have these requirements installed:\n\n- Python 3 (at the time of writing, I am using Python 3.7.10)\n- SciPy (which includes NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, IPython, and matplotlib)\n- scikit-learn\n- Seaborn\n\nThen, we will import the necessary packages:\n\n```\nimport re\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\nfrom scipy.stats import zscore\n\nfrom xgboost import XGBClassifier\n\nfrom sklearn.svm import SVC\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\nfrom sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\nfrom sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier\nfrom sklearn.neural_network import MLPClassifier\n\nfrom sklearn.metrics import (classification_report, plot_confusion_matrix,\n                             roc_auc_score, matthews_corrcoef)\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import (GridSearchCV, cross_validate,\n                                     cross_val_score, cross_val_predict,\n                                     train_test_split, KFold)\n```\n\n## Exploring the Data\n\nWe will start by loading the train and test data and taking a peek at the first rows and data summary:\n\n```\ntrain_data = pd.read_csv('train.csv')\ntest_data = pd.read_csv('test.csv')\ntrain_data.info()\n```\n\nWe can observe that the training data has 891 examples and 11 features plus the target class (survived). Seven of the features are numerical, while 4 are categorical.\n\n```\ntrain_data.head()\n```\n\nNext, we need to know what each column of our dataset represents and what values they can have. Here is a description, taken from the Kaggle competition:\n\n| Variable | Definition | Key |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| survival | Survival | 0 = No, 1 = Yes |\n| pclass | Ticket class | 1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd |\n| sex | Sex |\n| Age | Age in years |\n| sibsp | \\# of siblings / spouses aboard the Titanic |\n| parch | \\# of parents / children aboard the Titanic |\n| ticket | Ticket number |\n| fare | Passenger fare |\n| cabin | Cabin number |\n| embarked | Port of Embarkation | C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton |\n\nWe can look further at some features. Inspecting their data distributions and asking some questions.\n\n```\n# List of features to view descriptive statistics\nfeatures = ['Pclass', 'Name', 'Sex', 'Age', 'SibSp',\n            'Parch', 'Ticket', 'Fare', 'Cabin', 'Embarked']\ntrain_data[features].describe(include=[np.number])\n```\n\n```\ntrain_data[features].describe(exclude=[np.number])\n```\n\n**Is our training data balanced? Do we have a reasonable distribution of passengers who survived and those who did not?**\nThe training data is reasonably balanced. Around 61% of the passengers died, and approximately 38% survived.\n\n```\ntrain_data['Survived'].value_counts(normalize=True)\n# 0    0.616162\n# 1    0.383838\n# Name: Survived, dtype: float64\n```\n\n**Do we have missing values in our training data and/or testing data?**\nWe have some missing values in both training and testing sets. We will come back to it later on.\n\n```\ntrain_data.isna().sum()\n# PassengerId      0\n# Survived         0\n# Pclass           0\n# Name             0\n# Sex              0\n# Age            177\n# SibSp            0\n# Parch            0\n# Ticket           0\n# Fare             0\n# Cabin          687\n# Embarked         2\n# dtype: int64\n```\n\n```\ntest_data.isna().sum()\n# PassengerId      0\n# Pclass           0\n# Name             0\n# Sex              0\n# Age             86\n# SibSp            0\n# Parch            0\n# Ticket           0\n# Fare             1\n# Cabin          327\n# Embarked         0\n# dtype: int64\n```\n\n### Data Visualization\n\nCreating data visualizations can make it easier to spot data patterns. We will ask a few more questions about the data, looking at different plots. This can give us insights into how the features are related to each other. And which ones could have a higher impact on the survival rate of the passengers.\n\n**Did one gender survive more than the other?**\nWe can confirm that a significantly higher percentage of female passengers survived compared to the male passengers.\n\n```\nsns.catplot(x='Sex', y='Survived', kind='bar', data=train_data)\n```\n\n**What is the distribution of passengers ages, which Age groups had higher survival odds, comparing gender?**\nThe passengers' ages seem to follow a normal distribution.\n\n```\nsns.displot(x='Age', hue='Survived', col='Sex', kde=True, data=train_data)\n```\n\n**What is the distribution of passengers parents/children and siblings/spouses aboard?**\nThe majority of passengers travelled alone or with small families/groups. However, a few groups of passengers were quite large, close to ten people.\n\n```\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(1,2, figsize=(12,4))\nsns.countplot(x='Parch', data=train_data, ax=ax[0])\nsns.countplot(x='SibSp', data=train_data, ax=ax[1])\nfig.show()\n```\n\n**What is the distribution of passengers per ticket class?**\nMost passengers were from the 3rd class. While the least number of passengers were from 2nd class.\n\n```\nsns.countplot(data=train_data, x='Pclass')\n```\n\n**Which classes of passengers survived the most? Comparing gender.**\nIt seems that passengers with higher classes had a better survival rate overall. When comparing gender, the difference is more pronounced with the female passengers of the upper classes, having a much higher survival rate than the male passengers. Also, female passengers of the upper classes survived more than the female passengers of the 3rd ticket class.\n\n```\nsns.catplot(x='Sex', y='Survived', hue='Pclass', kind='point', data=train_data)\n```\n\n**Which places of embarking have the most survivors? Comparing gender?**\nPassengers from Cherbourg (C), both men and women, had a higher survival rate than the other two cities.\n\n```\nsns.catplot(x='Sex', y='Survived', hue='Embarked', kind='bar', data=train_data)\n```\n\n**What is the likelihood of survival by Fare price? Comparing passenger classes?**\nPassengers who paid for more expensive tickets had higher survival rates. Naturally, the group with more passengers with expensive tickets were from the 1st class.\n\n```\nsns.catplot(x='Fare', y='Survived', row='Pclass', kind='box',\n            orient=...",

Unfortunately, there weren\u2019t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.\nWhile there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.\nIn this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: \u201cwhat sorts of people were more likely to survive?\u201d using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).\nRecommended Tutorial\nWe highly recommend Alexis Cook\u2019s Titanic Tutorial that walks you through making your very first submission step by step.\nOverview of How Kaggle\u2019s Competitions Work\n1.

The titanic data frame does not contain information from the crew, but it\ndoes contain actual ages of half of the passengers. The principal source for data about\nTitanic passengers is the Encyclopedia Titanica. The datasets used here were begun by\na variety of researchers. One of the original sources is Eaton & Haas (1994) Titanic:\nTriumph and Tragedy, Patrick Stephens Ltd, which includes a passenger list created by\nmany researchers and edited by Michael A. Findlay.\nThe variables on our extracted dataset are pclass, survived, name, age, embarked,\nhome.dest, room, ticket, boat, and sex. pclass refers to passenger class (1st, 2nd, 3rd),\nand is a proxy for socio-economic class. Age is in years, and some infants had\nfractional values. The titanic2 data frame has no missing data and includes records for\nthe crew, but age is dichotomized at adult vs. child. These data were obtained from\nRobert Dawson, Saint Mary's University, E-mail. The variables are pclass, age, sex,\nsurvived. These data frames are useful for demonstrating many of the functions in\nHmisc as well as demonstrating binary logistic regression analysis using the Design\nlibrary. For more details and references see Simonoff, Jeffrey S (1997): The \"unusual\nepisode\" and a second statistics course. J Statistics Education, Vol. 5 No. 1. Thomas\nCason of UVa has greatly updated and improved the titanic data frame using the\nEncyclopedia Titanica and created a new dataset called titanic3. These datasets\nreflects the state of data available as of 2 August 1999. Some duplicate passengers\nhave been dropped, many errors corrected, many missing ages filled in, and new\nvariables created.

Cason tcason@virginia.edu\nFrom MLF\nPrior to February 15, 1971 (\"Decimal day,\" or \"D-day\"), monetary amounts in the U.K.\nwere expressed as pounds (\u00a3), shillings (s.), and pence (d.), where \u00a31 = 20s. = 240d.\nAfter 1970, there were 100 pennies in a pound, so one (new) penny = 2.4 old pence. All\nnumbers should be entered in decimal rather than fractional form (for example, 1.5\nrather than 1 1/2).\nLawrence H. Officer.
