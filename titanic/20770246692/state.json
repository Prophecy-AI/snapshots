First, treat the four columns with missing values (\u202fAge,\u202fFare,\u202fCabin,\u202fEmbarked\u202f) by either imputing sensible statistics or, as many practitioners find, turning the missingness itself into a signal \u2013 for example, assigning a separate \u201cMissing\u201d category for\u202fAge\u202fand\u202fCabin\u202for filling\u202fFare\u202fwith the median of the passenger\u2019s\u202fPclass\u202fand then scaling it ([towardsdatascience](https://towardsdatascience.com/titanic-feature-engineering-modeling-in-python-6749e6e87bf4)).  Next, convert raw variables into richer descriptors: bucket\u202fAge\u202finto bins (e.g., 0\u201112\u202f=\u202fchild, 13\u201118\u202f=\u202fteen, etc.), extract the passenger\u2019s title from\u202fName\u202f(\u201cMr\u201d, \u201cMrs\u201d, \u201cMiss\u201d, \u201cMaster\u201d, \u201cDr\u201d, etc.) and map rare titles to a common group, derive a\u202fFamilySize\u202f=\u202fSibSp\u202f+\u202fParch\u202f+\u202f1 and an\u202fIsAlone\u202fflag, and split the\u202fTicket\u202ffield to capture ticket prefixes that often indicate travel class or group bookings.
