# Titanic Survival Prediction - Techniques Guide

## Data Understanding
**Reference notebooks for data characteristics:**
- `exploration/eda.ipynb` - Contains EDA: feature distributions, missing values, target distribution
- Key insight: 891 train samples, 418 test samples, binary classification (38.4% survived)
- Critical survival factors: Sex (female 74% vs male 19%), Pclass (1st: 63%, 2nd: 47%, 3rd: 24%)

## Feature Engineering (Critical for High Scores)

### Title Extraction from Name (MOST IMPORTANT)
Extract titles using regex pattern ` ([A-Za-z]+)\.` from Name field:
- Common titles: Mr, Mrs, Miss, Master
- Group rare titles (Lady, Countess, Capt, Col, Don, Dr, Major, Rev, Sir, Jonkheer, Dona) into "Rare"
- Map Mlle/Ms -> Miss, Mme -> Mrs
- Title is highly predictive of survival (Master = young male, Miss = unmarried female)
- Encode as integers: Mr=1, Miss=2, Mrs=3, Master=4, Rare=5

### Family Features
- FamilySize = SibSp + Parch + 1
- IsAlone = 1 if FamilySize == 1, else 0
- Family size of 2-4 has higher survival rate than alone or large families
- Consider FamilySizeGroup: Alone (1), Small (2-4), Large (5+)

### Ticket-Based Features (Advanced)
- Ticket_Group_Size: Count passengers sharing same ticket number
- Passengers sharing tickets often traveled together (family/friends)
- Higher ticket group sizes (2-4) have better survival rates

### Family Name Features (Advanced)
- Extract family name (text before comma in Name)
- Family_Survival_Rate: Calculate survival rate per family name from training data
- Useful for identifying family groups

### Cabin Features
- Has_Cabin = 1 if Cabin is not null, else 0 (proxy for wealth/class)
- Cabin_Section: Extract first letter (deck A-G)
- Group rare decks together

### Age Handling
- ~20% missing values - impute using median Age per (Sex, Pclass, Title) group
- Alternative: random values within mean ± std
- Bin Age into categories:
  - Child: 0-12 (highest survival)
  - Teen: 13-19
  - Adult: 20-64
  - Senior: 65+
- Or use K-means clustering for optimal bins

### Fare Handling
- Fill missing with median (by Pclass if available)
- FarePerPerson = Fare / FamilySize (or Ticket_Group_Size)
- Bin into 4 quantile-based categories using pd.qcut
- Higher fare correlates with higher survival
- $0 fare passengers have very low survival - treat as separate category

### Additional Features
- Name_length = len(Name) - weakly predictive
- Age*Pclass interaction feature
- Sex_Pclass combined feature

## Missing Value Handling
- Age: Impute with median by (Sex, Pclass, Title) group
- Cabin: Create Has_Cabin binary feature, then drop Cabin
- Embarked: Fill with mode ('S' - Southampton)
- Fare: Fill with median by Pclass

## Feature Selection
**Features to DROP:**
- PassengerId (identifier only)
- Name (after extracting Title, Family Name)
- Ticket (after extracting Ticket_Group_Size)
- Cabin (after creating Has_Cabin, Cabin_Section)

**Final features typically used:**
- Pclass, Sex, Age (binned), Fare (binned), Embarked
- Title, FamilySize, IsAlone, Has_Cabin
- Advanced: Ticket_Group_Size, FarePerPerson, Cabin_Section

## Models

### Single Models (baseline ~77-80% accuracy)
1. **Random Forest** - Most popular, handles feature interactions well
   - n_estimators: 100-500
   - max_depth: 4-8 (prevent overfitting)
   - criterion: 'entropy' often better than 'gini'

2. **Gradient Boosting** - Strong performer
   - learning_rate: 0.01-0.25
   - n_estimators: 50-300
   - max_depth: 2-6

3. **XGBoost** - Often best single model
   - learning_rate: 0.01-0.1
   - max_depth: 4-6
   - n_estimators: 100-2000
   - min_child_weight: 2
   - subsample: 0.8
   - colsample_bytree: 0.8

4. **LightGBM** - Fast and effective
   - Similar parameters to XGBoost
   - Good for quick iteration

5. **CatBoost** - Handles categorical features natively
   - Good default performance

6. **SVM** - Good with proper feature scaling
   - Requires feature normalization
   - RBF kernel typically works well

7. **Logistic Regression** - Good baseline, interpretable
   - Useful for understanding feature importance via coefficients

### Ensemble Methods (for higher scores ~80-82%)

#### Voting Ensemble
- Combine 5+ diverse models (RF, ET, Ada, GB, SVC)
- Hard voting: majority vote
- Soft voting: average probabilities (requires predict_proba)
- Tune each base model individually first

#### Stacking (Best approach for this competition)
**Two-level stacking architecture:**

Level 1 (Base models with out-of-fold predictions):
- RandomForestClassifier
- ExtraTreesClassifier  
- AdaBoostClassifier
- GradientBoostingClassifier
- SVC (with probability=True)

Level 2 (Meta-learner):
- XGBoost or Logistic Regression
- Train on out-of-fold predictions from Level 1

**Key insight:** Use diverse, uncorrelated base models for better stacking results.

#### Blending
- Simple average of predictions from multiple models
- Weighted average based on CV performance

## Hyperparameter Tuning
- Use GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV
- Cross-validation: StratifiedKFold with k=5 or k=10
- Scoring metric: 'accuracy' (matches competition metric)
- Important: Tune on CV score, not train score

## Validation Strategy
- StratifiedKFold (k=5 or k=10) to maintain class balance
- Watch for overfitting: large gap between train and CV scores indicates overfit
- Small dataset (891 samples) - be careful not to overfit
- Consider multiple random seeds and average results

## Common Pitfalls
1. Overfitting to train set - use proper CV
2. Data leakage - ensure test set preprocessing uses only train statistics
3. Not combining train+test for consistent encoding of categorical features
4. Ignoring feature interactions (tree models handle this naturally)
5. Over-engineering features without validation

## Expected Scores
- Baseline (gender only): ~0.766
- Good feature engineering + single model: ~0.77-0.78
- Tuned ensemble/stacking: ~0.80-0.82
- Top scores require careful feature engineering + ensemble

## Implementation Tips
1. Combine train and test DataFrames for consistent feature engineering
2. Apply same transformations to both datasets
3. Use pipelines to prevent data leakage
4. Try multiple random seeds and average predictions
5. Focus on feature engineering over model complexity
6. The public leaderboard is 100% of test data - no hidden test set

## Recommended Approach for Best Results
1. Start with comprehensive feature engineering (Title, FamilySize, Age bins, Fare bins)
2. Train multiple diverse models with tuned hyperparameters
3. Use stacking with XGBoost as meta-learner
4. Validate with 5-fold stratified CV
5. Average predictions from multiple seeds
