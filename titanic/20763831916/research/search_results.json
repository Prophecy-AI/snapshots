The purpose of this repository is to document the process I went through to create a Titanic rescue prediction using Decision Tree, SVM, Logistic Regression, Random Forest and KNN.\n\n### Quick Start:\n\n[Check out](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/alicevillar/titanic-kaggle/blob/main/Titanic_DecisionTree.ipynb) a static version of the notebook with Jupyter NBViewer from the comfort of your web browser.\n\n### Dependencies:\n\n- [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)\n- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)\n- [SciKit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/)\n- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)\n- [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)\n\n### Approach\n\n- PART 1: Data Handling -> Importing Data with Pandas, cleaning data, data description.\n- PART 2: Data Analysis -> Supervised ML Techniques: Decision Tree, SVM, Logistic Regression, Random Forest and KNN\n- PART 3: Valuation of the Analysis -> Performance measurement + K-folds cross validation to evaluate results locally + Accuracy comparison graph\n\n### Kaggle Competition \\| Titanic Machine Learning from Disaster\n\nKaggle's challenge provides information about a subset of the Titanic population and asks a predictive model that tells whether or not a given passenger survived.\nWe are given basic explanatory variables, including passenger gender, age, passenger class, among others. More details about the competition can be found on Kaggle's [Competition Page](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic):\n\nThe sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships. One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class. In this contest, we ask you to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular, we ask you to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy. This Kaggle Getting Started Competition provides an ideal starting place for people who may not have a lot of experience in data science and machine learning.\"\n\n### Results\n\nIn this repository I documented the process to create a Titanic rescue prediction using Decision Tree, SVM, Logistic Regression, Random Forest and KNN. To all these modeles I did a Valuation Analisis (Performance Measurement and K-Fold). I have found the accuracy score with Random forest (0.8435754189944135) and Decision Tree (0.8212290502793296).Finally, I created a graph to compare the accuracy of the different models.\n\n[![print](https://github.com/alicevillar/titanic-kaggle/raw/main/accuracy_graph_titanic.png)](https://github.com/alicevillar/titanic-kaggle/blob/main/accuracy_graph_titanic.png)\n\n## About\n\nTitanic rescue prediction using Decision Tree, SVM, Logistic Regression, Random Forest and KNN.

      "text": "# A top 3% score in the Kaggle Titanic Challenge using Transformers\nIn this post we show how to make a top 3% submission on the Kaggle Titanic Challenge using Transformers\n![mugshot](https://www.nyckel.com/assets/images/team/blog-oscar.webp)Oscar Beijbom\nOct 2021\n![](https://www.nyckel.com/blog/images/2021/titanic-kaggle-hero.webp)\nThe tragic Titanic shipwreck, documented in countless books and movies, has made its way into the Machine Learning world via the Kaggle challenge: [Titanic - learning from disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). In this challenge the goal is to predict which passengers survive based on metadata like sex, name and ticket price.\nThe Titanic competition, with almost 16000 teams, is the [most popular on all of Kaggle](https://dataaspirant.com/most-popular-kaggle-competition-solutions/). The competition is perpetually open and is part of the \u201cgetting started\u201d suite. Kaggle archives any submission older than 2 months, but even so there are over 15000 submissions as of today. There is also a wild amount of discussions and how-tos. A few worth looking at are: [a score of 0.8 is great](https://www.kaggle.com/carlmcbrideellis/titanic-leaderboard-a-score-0-8-is-great) and the more comprehensive [how am I doing with my score](https://www.kaggle.com/pliptor/how-am-i-doing-with-my-score). The current top-score, as far as I can tell, is 85% by veteran Kaggle competitor [Chris Deotte](https://www.kaggle.com/cdeotte/titanic-wcg-xgboost-0-84688).\nIn this post we look at a new approach to solving the Titanic dataset \u2013 render each row as a string and use a [Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) to encode the strings into a feature vector. This eliminates tedious feature engineering required using a \u201cstandard\u201d scikit-learn / pandas workflow, and as we shall see, performs in the top 3% on the Kaggle leaderboard!\n## Data\nLet\u2019s take a quick look at the data before we dive in. The first three entries in the training data look like this.\n| Survived | Pclass | Name | Sex | Age | SibSp | Parch | Ticket | Fare | Cabin | Embarked |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 0 | 3 | Braund, Mr. Owen Harris | male | 22 | 1 | 0 | A/5 21171 | 7.25 | | S |\n| 1 | 1 | Cumings, Mrs. John Bradley | female | 38 | 1 | 0 | PC 17599 | 71.2833 | C85 | C |\n| 1 | 3 | Heikkinen, Miss. Laina | female | 26 | 0 | 0 | STON/O2. 3101282 | 7.925 | | S |\n\u201cSibSp\u201d refers to the number of siblings and spouses and \u201cParch\u201d the number of parents. Otherwise, the column names speak for themselves. For more details refer to the excellent Kaggle [data explorer](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data).\n## Transformers\nA Transformer is a type of neural network that dominates the modern Natural Language Processing field. They are even starting to challenge the convolutional neural network for image processing. If you are not familiar with them, I recommend [the illustrated transformer](https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/) by Jay Alammar.\nHere we use the excellent Huggingface library to load up a pre-trained Transformer and use it as a feature extractor. Once we have the feature vector we train a XGBoost classifier with standard settings and that is pretty much it. The core feature extraction code looks like this:\n```\nclass TransformerExtractor:\ndef __init__(self, model_name=\"distilbert-base-uncased\"):\nself.tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)\nself.model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(model_name)\ndef extract(self, texts: List[str]):\nfeats = np.zeros((len(texts), 768), np.float16)\nfor itt, text in enumerate(tqdm(texts)):\ntokenized_text = self.tokenizer(text, return_tensors=\"pt\")\nmodel_output = self.model(**tokenized_text)[0].detach().cpu().numpy()\nfeats[itt, :] = model_output.mean(axis=1).flatten()\nreturn feats\n```\nThe only design choice here is how to join the row entries into a string. In this submission I use the simplest option possible: concatenating the entries together. This achieves a score of `0.80143` on the public benchmark which currently ranks 454 out of 14855 (top 3%). Not bad considering the simplicity and flexibility of the approach! I tried adding the column headers also but it didn\u2019t boost the score any further.\nCode is available in a [Kaggle notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/oscarbeijbom/titanictransformers). That is pretty much it, happy coding!\nStart building custom ML models today\nRapidly develop and deploy custom ML models that are accurate, secure, and easy to integrate.

This study enhances Titanic survival prediction through advanced \nfeature engineering and ensemble model optimization. The Titanic dataset \npresents a classic binary classification problem requiring the prediction of \npassenger survival based on demographic and ticket information. Our \nmethodology employs systematic preprocessing where missing values are \nintelligently imputed, including eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) \npredictions for age values. Novel features were extracted from passenger \nnames, cabin information, and family relationships to improve predictive \npower. Feature importance was evaluated using Random Forest and XGBoost \nalgorithms, with SelectFromModel and Recursive Feature Elimination applied \nfor effective feature selection. Three classification algorithms\u2014logistic \nregression, random forest, and XGBoost\u2014were systematically optimized using \ngrid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization techniques. Based on \nthese optimized models, soft voting and stacking ensemble approaches were \nimplemented. Cross-validation results demonstrate that ensemble methods \nachieved superior accuracy (0.8361) compared to individual models: logistic \nregression (0.8339), random forest (0.8350), and XGBoost (0.8204). This \nresearch provides valuable optimization strategies for similar classification \ntasks, particularly highlighting how feature engineering combined with \nensemble methods can substantially enhance predictive performance while \nmaintaining computational efficiency. \nKeywords: Titanic Survival Prediction, Feature Engineering, Ensemble \nLearning, Hyperparameter Tuning. \n1 Introduction \nThe collision of the Titanic with an iceberg in 1912 was the cause of this catastrophe \nthat left 1,517 lives lost and is one of the most dangerous maritime accidents of the \ntwentieth century. Its historical significance and the multidimensional nature of \npassenger data (including social class, gender, age, family relationships, etc.) have \nestablished it as a classic binary classification benchmark dataset in machine learning. \n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2025\nY. Sun (ed.), Proceedings of the 2025 3rd International Conference on Image, Algorithms, and Artificial\nIntelligence (ICIAAI 2025), Advances in Computer Science Research 122,\nhttps://doi.org/10.2991/978-94-6463-823-3_19\n208 H. Li\nDespite extensive research on this problem, traditional methods exhibit \nsignificant limitations. Early studies predominantly focused on the direct application \nof basic features, achieving prediction accuracy generally below 80% [1]. For \ninstance, simple rules based on gender and passenger class could rapidly distinguish \nsurvival groups. However, these methods failed to fully explore nonlinear interactions \nbetween features and higher-order features. Moreover, approximately 20% of the age \nfield and 68% of the cabin number field (Cabin) are missing in the dataset. Traditional \napproaches often rely on mean imputation or directly delete missing values, leading to \ninformation loss and model bias [2]. \nAccording to previous research, traditional classification methods applied to the \nTitanic dataset achieved limited accuracy. These methods were constrained by their \ninability to capture complex feature interactions and their sensitivity to missing values \n[2]. Simultaneously, traditional methods predominantly depend on single models such \nas logistic regression and decision trees without conducting feature importance \nselection, resulting in lower prediction accuracy [3]. Recent studies have introduced \nensemble models but have not systematically compared their performance with single \nmodels, nor explored how different hyperparameter tuning methods influence \nprediction model performance in this dataset. \nTo address these challenges, this study employs advanced feature engineering \ntechniques to extract new features, utilizes the relationships between features and \neXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) for missing value imputation, applies feature \nselection techniques like random forests and XGBoost to identify key features for \nsurvival prediction, and performs hyperparameter tuning of logistic regression, \nrandom forests, and XGBoost models using grid search, random search, and Bayesian \noptimization. Based on these methods, soft voting and stacking ensemble models are \ntrained, and the performance of models under various parameter conditions is further \ncompared. \n2 Methods \n2.1 DataSet \nThis study is based on the Titanic dataset provided by the Kaggle platform [4]. The \ndataset consists of two CSV files: the training set and the test set. The training set \ncontains 891 samples, while the test set contains 418 samples. The data features \ninclude PassengerId, Name, Pclass, Sex, Age, SibSp, Parch, Ticket, Fare, Cabin, and \nEmbarked. Additionally, the training set includes an additional target variable, \n\"Survived\". Analysis reveals missing values in the Age, Cabin, and Embarked \ncolumns in the training set, and the Age, Cabin, and Fare columns in the test set, with \nAge and Cabin having a relatively high proportion of missing values [2]. \n2.2 Data Processing \nTo facilitate data processing, this study first combined the training set and the test set\nto form a complete dataset, called the \"merged set\". The missing values in the\nTitanic Survival Prediction Enhanced by Innovative Feature \u2026 209\nEmbarked and Fare columns, which had relatively few missing values, were filled \nfirst. By analyzing the sample features corresponding to the missing values in \nEmbarked, it was found that these samples all had a Pclass of 1, a Fare of 80.0, a \nCabin of B28, and a Sex of female. Considering the correlations between features, a \nstrong relationship among Pclass, Fare, and Embarked was assumed. Based on this \nassumption, box plots of Fare distribution under different combinations of Embarked \nand Pclass were created (Figure 1), and it was determined that when Fare is 80 and \nPclass is 1, Embarked is more likely to be 'C'. Therefore, the missing Embarked \nvalues were filled with 'C'. Similarly, for cases where Embarked = 'S' and Pclass = 3, \nthe median Fare was calculated and used to fill missing Fare values in the test set [2]. \nFig. 1. Fare Distribution by Embarked and Pclass (Photo/Picture credit: Original). \nNext, the Cabin column was processed. Due to the high number of missing values, the \nanalysis was based only on available information. Records with Cabin information \nwere filtered, and the distribution of cabin classes between survivors and \nnon-survivors was compared. Cabin values containing multiple cabins were split into \nlists, and the data was expanded row-wise to generate new features. Two new features \nwere extracted: Deck (the letter part, filled with \"U\" if none) and Cabin number (the \nnumeric part, converted to a numeric type). The Cabin number was further binned, \nand survival rates within different intervals were analyzed [5]. The analysis revealed \nthat passengers in cabin numbers ranging from 0-50 had a survival rate of \napproximately 45%, while those in ranges 51-100 showed a higher survival rate of \naround 60%. Passengers in cabin numbers above 100 had mixed survival rates, \nranging from 40% to 55%, depending on the specific range. Meanwhile, specific \nsurvival rates for each Deck were calculated, which showed notable variations: Deck \nB had the highest survival rate at approximately 74%, followed by Decks D and E at \naround 75% and 75%, respectively, while Deck U (unknown) had the lowest survival \nrate at about 30%. Finally, the expanded data was re-aggregated into the original \nmerged dataset (Fig. 1). \nThe Title (such as \"Mr\", \"Mrs\") was extracted from the Name column as a new\nfeature. Rare Titl...",

Given a dataset, we are required to predict which passengers were transported or not by an \u201canomaly\u201d using records recovered from the spaceship\u2019s damaged computer system. The \u201clore\u201d of the competition is not so important, what you need to know is to develop a machine learning algorithm capable of correctly predicting the outcome of the spaceship\u2019s passengers.\n\n## Import libraries\n\n```\nimport pandas as pdimport numpy as npimport matplotlib.pyplot as pltimport seaborn as snsfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split,GridSearchCV,cross_val_score,StratifiedKFoldimport xgboost as xgbimport category_encoders as cefrom sklearn.impute import SimpleImputerfrom sklearn.pipeline import Pipelinefrom sklearn.pipeline import make_pipelinefrom sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformerfrom sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, roc_auc_score, precision_score, recall_score,f1_score, confusion_matrixfrom category_encoders import TargetEncoderfrom sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer,KNNImputerfrom lightgbm import LGBMClassifier\n```\n\n## Let\u2019s Start\n\nAs you can see, after I loaded the dataset, I removed both the \u201cPassenger Id\u201d and \u201cName\u201d columns. They are not going to provide any useful or important information to the prediction. Someone\u2019s name or Id does not change the probability of being Transported.\n\n```\ndf = pd.read_csv(\"train.csv\")df.drop(columns=[\"PassengerId\",\"Name\"],inplace=True)\n```\n\nNow, we are going to discuss a fundamental step I came across after trying to improve my score a thousand times. This step relies on exploring the \u201cCabin\u201d column. Notice that the rows on the \u201cCabin\u201d column follow a specific pattern. Something like this: \u201cA/5/S\u201d, \u201cC/1/S\u201d, \u201cF/7/P\u201d. And I decided to investigate it. So, to make things simple I split the rows of the \u201cCabin\u201d into three columns based on both slashes (\u201d/\u201d) of the rows. For example, the \u201cA/5/S\u201d row would be transformed into three new columns: The first one is named \u201ccabin\\_code\u201d referring tothe character behind the first slash (A). The second one named \u201cid\\_cabin\u201d refers to the character behind the second slash (5). The third one named \u201ccabin\\_sector\u201d refers to the character after the second slash (S). And we end up with three new columns.\n\n```\n#Splittingdf[[\"cabin_code\",\"id_cabin\",\"cabin_sector\"]] = df[\"Cabin\"].str.split(\"/\", n=2, expand=True)df.head(4)\n```\n\nFirst of all, I noticed that \u201ccabin\\_code\u201d only has 8 different characters which means that the cabins are, somehow, divided into 8 sections.\n\nAlso, I asked myself if passengers from a specific section had a higher chance of being transported or if this statement was not true. With the plot below we can conclude that passengers from the B and C sections have a greater chance of surviving and passengers from the E section have a lower chance of surviving.\n\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\n\nI did the same thing with the \u201ccabin\\_sector\u201d column and also noticed that there was a difference between the sectors. Passengers from the P sector have a lower chance of being transported, while in the S sector, the opposite happens.\n\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\n\nThis means that this exploration of the original \u201cCabin\u201d column is worth it since new insights are being added to the model.\n\nNow, we can finally delete the \u201cCabin\u201d column. It will not provide any useful information for the model anymore. We have already extracted everything useful from it.\n\nI also removed the \u201ccabin\\_id\u201d and the column that I had created. As I said before, the Id will not interfere with the model\u2019s predictive ability.\n\nSo used: df.drop(columns=\\[\u201cCabin\u201d,\u201did\\_cabin\u201d\\], inplace=True) to drop both columns\n\nBefore splitting our data, the \u201cTransported\u201d column must be in a binary format. As you can see, I switched \u201cTrue\u201d for 1 and \u201cFalse\u201d for 0.\n\nBinary transformation: df\\[\u201cTransported\u201d\\] = df\\[\u201cTransported\u201d\\].map({True:1, False:0})\n\nI also removed every row that had missing values in the \u201ccabin\\_code\u201d column.\n\n```\n#BINARY TRANSFORMATIONdf[\"Transported\"] = df[\"Transported\"].map({True:1, False:0})#DROPPING COLUMNSdf.drop(columns=[\"Cabin\",\"id_cabin\"], inplace=True)#DROPPING NULLSdf.dropna(subset=[\"cabin_code\"], inplace=True)\n```\n\nNow, we can finally split the data and proceed to develop our model.\n\nAfter splitting in train and test, I separated the test data into two categories: numerical and categorical. Why is that? We are going to perform different operations depending on the type of the variable. Categorical data must be encoded since most models are not able to understand categorical values and it must be converted to numerical values. Also, we are going to apply different techniques to fill the null values in our dataset, but I will talk more about it later on.\n\n```\n#Define X and yX = df.iloc[:,0:12]y = df[\"Transported\"]\n```\n\n```\n#Splitting DataX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X,y,random_state=42,test_size=0.25)\n```\n\n```\n#Separate categorical and numerical featurescat_feat = np.array([coluna for coluna in X_train.columns if X_train[coluna].dtype.name == 'object'])num_feat = np.array([coluna for coluna in X_train.columns if coluna not in cat_feat])\n```\n\nWe can now create our pipeline. There are going to be two pipelines: one is going to handle the categorical data and the other one is going to handle numerical data. The missing values of the categorical data will be filled with the most frequent value (mode) and after the Target Encoder will be applied to transform categorical variables into numerical variables. The numerical data missing values will be filled with a strategy called **K-nearest neighbors,** which uses the Euclidean distance between the data points to find the best number to fill the missing values. If don\u2019t know how this Pipeline technique works, I recommend you check [my article about Pipelines.](https://medium.com/@fernandao.lacerda.dantas/boost-your-pipelines-with-columntransformer-b2c009db096f)\n\n```\n#Categorical and numerical pipelinescat_pipe = Pipeline([(\"imputer_cat\", SimpleImputer(strategy=\"most_frequent\")),(\"encoder\", ce.TargetEncoder()),                    ])num_pipe = Pipeline([(\"imputer_num\", KNNImputer(n_neighbors=3))])\n```\n\nAnd with column transformer, we can attach both transformations to one variable that I named \u201ctransformer\u201d. Observe that we also have to specify the type of data to which the pipeline will be applied t...",

As I'm writing this post, I am ranked among the top 4% of all Kagglers.\n\nThis post is the opportunity to share my solution with you.\n\nTo make this tutorial more \"academic\" so that anyone could benefit, I will first start with an exploratory data analysis (EDA) then I'll follow with feature engineering and finally present the predictive model I set up.\n\nThroughout this jupyter notebook, I will be using Python at each level of the pipeline.\nThe main libraries involved in this tutorial are:\n\n- **Pandas** for data manipulation and ingestion\n- **Matplotlib** and **seaborn** for data visualization\n- **Numpy** for multidimensional array computing\n- **sklearn** for machine learning and predictive modeling\n\n### Installation procedure\n\nA very easy way to install these packages is to download and install the [Conda](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/install/quick.html#os-x-miniconda-install) distribution that encapsulates them all. This distribution is available on all platforms (Windows, Linux and Mac OSX).\n\n### Nota Bene\n\nThis is my first attempt as a blogger and as a machine learning practitioner.\n\nIf you have a question about the code or the hypotheses I made, do not hesitate to post a comment in the comment section below.\nIf you also have a suggestion on how this notebook could be improved, please reach out to me.\nThis tutorial is available on my [github](https://github.com/ahmedbesbes/How-to-score-0.8134-in-Titanic-Kaggle-Challenge) account.\n\nHope you've got everything set on your computer. Let's get started.\n\n## I - Exploratory data analysis\n\nAs in different data projects, we'll first start diving into the data and build up our first intuitions.\n\nIn this section, we'll be doing four things.\n\n- Data extraction : we'll load the dataset and have a first look at it.\n- Cleaning : we'll fill in missing values.\n- Plotting : we'll create some interesting charts that'll (hopefully) spot correlations and hidden insights out of the data.\n- Assumptions : we'll formulate hypotheses from the charts.\n\nWe tweak the style of this notebook a little bit to have centered plots.\n\n```\nfrom IPython.core.display import HTML\nHTML(\"\"\"\n<style>\n.output_png {\n    display: table-cell;\n    text-align: center;\n    vertical-align: middle;\n}\n</style>\n\"\"\");\n```\n\nWe import the useful libraries.\n\n```\n%matplotlib inline\n\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore', category=DeprecationWarning)\n\nimport pandas as pd\npd.options.display.max_columns = 100\n\nfrom matplotlib import pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\n\nimport seaborn as sns\n\nimport pylab as plot\nparams = {\n    'axes.labelsize': \"large\",\n    'xtick.labelsize': 'x-large',\n    'legend.fontsize': 20,\n    'figure.dpi': 150,\n    'figure.figsize': [25, 7]\n}\nplot.rcParams.update(params)\n```\n\nTwo datasets are available: a training set and a test set.\nWe'll be using the training set to build our predictive model and the testing set to score it and generate an output file to submit on the Kaggle evaluation system.\n\nWe'll see how this procedure is done at the end of this post.\n\nNow let's start by loading the training set.\n\n```\ndata = pd.read_csv('./data/train.csv')\nprint(data.shape)\n#(891, 12)\n```\n\nWe have:\n\n- 891 rows\n- 12 columns\n\nPandas allows you to have a sneak peak at your data.\n\n```\ndata.head()\n```\n\n| PassengerId | Survived | Pclass | Name | Sex | Age | SibSp | Parch | Ticket | Fare | Cabin | Embarked |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 0 | 1 | 0 | 3 | Braund, Mr. Owen Harris | male | 22.0 | 1 | 0 | A/5 21171 | 7.2500 | NaN | S |\n| 1 | 2 | 1 | 1 | Cumings, Mrs. John Bradley (Florence Briggs Th... | female | 38.0 | 1 | 0 | PC 17599 | 71.2833 | C85 | C |\n| 2 | 3 | 1 | 3 | Heikkinen, Miss. Laina | female | 26.0 | 0 | 0 | STON/O2. 3101282 | 7.9250 | NaN | S |\n\nThe Survived column is the **target variable**. If Suvival = 1 the passenger survived, otherwise he's dead. The is the variable we're going to predict.\n\nThe other variables describe the passengers. They are the **features**.\n\n- PassengerId: and id given to each traveler on the boat\n- Pclass: the passenger class. It has three possible values: 1,2,3 (first, second and third class)\n- The Name of the passeger\n- The Sex\n- The Age\n- SibSp: number of siblings and spouses traveling with the passenger\n- Parch: number of parents and children traveling with the passenger\n- The ticket number\n- The ticket Fare\n- The cabin number\n- The embarkation. This describe three possible areas of the Titanic from which the people embark. Three possible values S,C,Q\n\nPandas allows you to a have a high-level simple statistical description of the numerical features.\nThis can be done using the describe method.\n\n```\ndata.describe()\n```\n\n| PassengerId | Survived | Pclass | Age | SibSp | Parch | Fare |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| count | 891.000000 | 891.000000 | 891.000000 | 714.000000 | 891.000000 | 891.000000 | 891.000000 |\n| mean | 446.000000 | 0.383838 | 2.308642 | 29.699118 | 0.523008 | 0.381594 | 32.204208 |\n| std | 257.353842 | 0.486592 | 0.836071 | 14.526497 | 1.102743 | 0.806057 | 49.693429 |\n| min | 1.000000 | 0.000000 | 1.000000 | 0.420000 | 0.000000 | 0.000000 | 0.000000 |\n| 25% | 223.500000 | 0.000000 | 2.000000 | 20.125000 | 0.000000 | 0.000000 | 7.910400 |\n| 50% | 446.000000 | 0.000000 | 3.000000 | 28.000000 | 0.000000 | 0.000000 | 14.454200 |\n| 75% | 668.500000 | 1.000000 | 3.000000 | 38.000000 | 1.000000 | 0.000000 | 31.000000 |\n| max | 891.000000 | 1.000000 | 3.000000 | 80.000000 | 8.000000 | 6.000000 | 512.329200 |\n\nThe count variable shows that 177 values are missing in the Age column.\n\nOne solution is to fill in the null values with the median age. We could also impute with the mean age but the median is more robust to outliers.\n\n```\ndata['Age'] = data['Age'].fillna(data['Age'].median())\n```\n\nLet's now make some charts.\n\nLet's visualize survival based on the gender.\n\n```\ndata['Died'] = 1 - data['Survived']\ndata.groupby('Sex').agg('sum')[['Survived', 'Died']].plot(kind='bar', figsize=(25, 7),\n                                                          stacked=True, colors=['g', 'r']);\n```\n\nIt looks like male passengers are more likely to succumb.\n\nLet's plot the same graph but with ratio instead.\n\n```\ndata.groupby('Sex').agg('mean')[['Survived', 'Died']].plot(kind='bar', figsize=(25, 7),\n                                                           stacked=True, colors=['g', 'r']);\n```\n\nThe Sex variable seems to be a discriminative feature. Women are more likely to survive.\n\nLet's now correlate the survival with the age variable.\n\n```\nfig = plt.figure(figsize=(25, 7))\nsns.violinplot(x='Sex', y='Age',\n               hue='Survived', data=data,\n               split=True,\n               palette={0: \"r\", 1: \"g\"}\n              );\n```\n\nAs we saw in the chart above and validate by the following:\n\n- Women survive more than men, as depicted by the larger female green histogram\n\nNow, we see that:\n\n- The age conditions the survival for male passengers:\n\n  - Younger male tend to survive\n  - A large number of passengers between 20 and 40 succumb\n- The age doesn't seem to have a direct impact on the female survival\n\nThese violin plots confirm that one old code of conduct that sailors and captains follow in case of threatening situations: **\"Women and children first !\"**.\n\nRight?\n\nLet's now focus on the Fare ticket of each passenger and see how it could impact the survival.\n\n```\nfigure = plt.figure(figsize=(25, 7))\nplt.hist([dat...",
