Simpler models work better.\n  - Abandon stacking approach entirely\n  - Focus on feature engineering to improve the Threshold-Tuned Ensemble\n  - The 15 differing predictions were mostly WRONG for stacking\n\n## Submission History Analysis (Critical Learning)\n| Exp | Model | CV | LB | Gap | Survivors | Key Insight |\n|-----|-------|-----|-----|-----|-----------|-------------|\n| exp_000 | XGBoost (13 features) | 0.8316 | 0.7584 | +7.32% | 157 (37.6%) | Too complex, overfits |\n| exp_001 | Simple RF (7 features) | 0.8238 | 0.7775 | +4.63% | 131 (31.3%) | Simpler = better |\n| exp_003 | Threshold-Tuned Ensemble | 0.8373 | 0.7847 | +5.26% | 130 (31.1%) | **BEST LB** |\n| exp_004 | Stacking (5 base + XGB) | 0.8373 | 0.7631 | +7.42% | 131 (31.3%) | Stacking overfits |\n\n**Pattern Confirmed**:\n1. Lower survival rate (~31%) outperforms training rate (38.4%)\n2. Simpler models have smaller CV-LB gap\n3. Stacking/complex ensembles overfit on small datasets\n4. CV score alone is NOT predictive of LB performance\n\n## Data Understanding\nReference notebooks:\n- `exploration/eda.ipynb` - Feature distributions, survival patterns\n- `exploration/evolver_loop5_lb_feedback.ipynb` - Stacking failure analysis\n\nKey patterns:\n- Sex is dominant: Female 74.2% survival vs Male 18.9%\n- Pclass matters: 1st class 63%, 3rd class 24%\n- Title is highly predictive: Mr 15.7%, Mrs 79.2%, Miss 69.8%, Master 57.5%\n- **Stacking wrongly predicted survival for 8 young 3rd class females (ages 18-36, mean fare $12.9) who likely died**\n- Test set has lower survival rate than training (distribution shift)\n\n## Recommended Approaches (Priority Order)\n\n### Priority 1: FEATURE ENGINEERING (Highest Impact)\n**Rationale**: Research shows 80%+ accuracy is achievable with proper feature engineering. Current model uses only 8 basic features. Adding FamilySize, IsAlone, Has_Cabin could improve predictions.\n\n**Features to Add**:\n1. **FamilySize** = SibSp + Parch + 1\n   - Medium families (2-4) have 55-72% survival vs solo (30%) or large (0-33%)\n2. **IsAlone** = 1 if FamilySize == 1, else 0\n   - Solo travelers have lower survival (30.4%)\n3. **Has_Cabin** = 1 if Cabin is not null, else 0\n   - With cabin: 66.7% survival vs without: 30%\n4. **TicketFreq** = Number of passengers sharing same ticket\n   - Groups traveling together may have different survival patterns\n5. **FareBin** = Quartile-based fare categories\n   - Higher fare correlates with higher survival\n\n**Action**:\n1. Add these features to the Threshold-Tuned Ensemble\n2. Use same threshold calibration (~31% survival rate)\n3. Compare CV and submit if CV improves\n\n### Priority 2: BLENDING BEST MODELS\n**Rationale**: Simple RF (LB 0.7775) and Threshold-Tuned (LB 0.7847) have different strengths. Blending might capture both.\n\n**Action**:\n1. Load predictions from exp_001 (Simple RF) and exp_003 (Threshold-Tuned)\n2. Create weighted average: 0.6 * Threshold-Tuned + 0.4 * Simple RF\n3. Apply threshold to achieve ~31% survival rate\n4. Compare to best LB\n\n### Priority 3: ANALYZE DISAGREEMENT PATTERNS\n**Rationale**: Understanding where models disagree can inform feature engineering.\n\n**Key Observations from Analysis**:\n- All 4 models agree on 370/418 passengers (88.5%)\n- 9 passengers have 2-2 split (most uncertain)\n- Focus on these uncertain passengers for feature engineering\n\n### Priority 4: TRY CATBOOST (If Feature Engineering Doesn't Help)\n**Rationale**: CatBoost handles categorical features natively and may generalize better than XGBoost.\n\n**Action**:\n1. Use same features as Threshold-Tuned Ensemble\n2. Let CatBoost handle categorical encoding\n3. Apply threshold calibration\n4. Compare CV-LB gap\n\n## What NOT to Try\n- **Stacking**: Proven to overfit on this dataset (LB dropped 2.16%)\n- **More complex models**: XGBoost with 13 features had worst LB (0.7584)\n- **Chasing CV score**: CV 0.8496 (stacking at threshold 0.5) gave LB 0.7631\n- **Neural networks**: Too complex for 891 samples\n- **Hyperparameter tuning**: Diminishing returns, focus on features first\n\n## Validation Notes\n- Use 5-fold Stratified CV with random_state=42 (consistent)\n- **Trust survival rate pattern**: ~31% survival rate (130-133 survivors) performs best on LB\n- Expected LB = CV - 0.05 (based on recent submissions)\n- **CV alone is NOT reliable**: Same CV (0.8373) gave LB 0.7847 vs 0.7631\n\n## Target Reality Check\n- **Impossible target**: 1.0 (100% accuracy)\n- **State-of-the-art**: 81-85% LB (top solutions)\n- **Current best LB**: 0.7847 (78.47%)\n- **Realistic goal**: 0.80-0.81 (80-81%)\n- **Gap to close**: 1.5-2.5% (6-10 passengers)\n\n## Experiment Plan for Loop 6\n1. **Add FamilySize, IsAlone, Has_Cabin features** to Threshold-Tuned Ensemble\n2. Apply threshold calibration for ~31% survival rate\n3. If CV improves AND survival rate is ~31%, submit\n4. If no improvement, try blending Simple RF + Threshold-Tuned\n\n## Submission Strategy\n- 4 submissions remaining\n- Best LB: 0.7847 (exp_003)\n- Only submit if:\n  1. CV improves over 0.8373 AND\n  2. Survival rate is ~31% (130-133 survivors) AND\n  3. Approach is fundamentally different (new features, not just hyperparameters)\n- Save 2 submissions for final ensemble tuning\n\n## Critical Success Factors\n1. **Feature engineering**: Add FamilySize, IsAlone, Has_Cabin\n2. **Keep it simple**: Avoid complex stacking/ensembles\n3. **Threshold calibration**: ~31% survival rate is key\n4. **Trust LB patterns**: Simpler models with lower survival rate work better\n5. **Don't chase CV**: CV 0.8373 can give LB 0.7847 or 0.7631 depending on model",
  "evaluator_feedback": "## What I Understood\n\nThe junior researcher pivoted from stacking (which failed on LB despite matching CV) to feature engineering. They added 5 new features to the threshold-tuned voting ensemble: FamilySize, IsAlone, Has_Cabin, TicketFreq, and FareBin. The hypothesis was that proven feature engineering would improve generalization better than complex model architectures. This is a sound strategic pivot based on the lesson that stacking (exp_004) achieved the same CV as the simpler approach (exp_003) but performed worse on LB (0.7631 vs 0.7847).\n\n## Technical Execution Assessment\n\n**Validation**: Sound methodology. 5-fold Stratified CV with random_state=42 for reproducibility. OOF predictions used correctly for threshold tuning. Fold scores verified: [0.8324, 0.8258, 0.8315, 0.8371, 0.8483] with mean 0.8350 (+/- 0.0075).\n\n**Leakage Risk**: MINOR CONCERN with TicketFreq feature.\n- TicketFreq is computed using combined train+test ticket counts\n- This means test data information leaks into the feature\n- 23% of training rows have different TicketFreq values when computed from train-only vs combined\n- Correlation with survival: 0.065 (combined) vs 0.038 (train-only)\n- **Impact assessment**: The leakage is subtle and the feature has weak correlation. It may slightly inflate CV but is unlikely to cause major issues. However, it's worth noting for future experiments.\n\n**Score Integrity**: Verified in notebook output and independently confirmed:\n- CV at threshold 0.5: 0.8350 \u2713\n- OOF accuracy at threshold 0.621: 0.8395 \u2713\n- Submission: 418 rows, 131 survivors (31.3%) \u2713\n\n**Code Quality**: Good implementation with proper preprocessing, threshold tuning, and clear experiment summary. Age imputation uses train-only medians (correct). Fare imputation uses train median (correct). FareBin uses fixed bins derived from training quartiles (correct).\n\nVerdict: **TRUSTWORTHY** - Minor TicketFreq leakage concern but unlikely to significantly affect results.\n\n## Strategic Assessment\n\n**Approach Fit**: EXCELLENT strategic pivot. The researcher correctly identified that:\n1. Stacking failed despite matching CV (0.8373 \u2192 LB 0.7631)\n2. Simpler models with proper calibration work better (exp_003 LB 0.7847)\n3. Feature engineering is a higher-leverage improvement than model complexity\n\nThe new features (FamilySize, IsAlone, Has_Cabin, FareBin) are all proven Titanic features from top solutions. This is exactly the right direction.\n\n**Effort Allocation**: Well-prioritized. The researcher is:\n- Building on the best-performing approach (threshold-tuned voting ensemble)\n- Adding features with known predictive power\n- Maintaining the ~31% survival rate calibration that worked on LB\n\n**Assumptions Being Made**:\n1. **Assumption**: CV improvement (0.8373 \u2192 0.8395) will translate to LB improvement\n   - **Risk**: Previous experiments showed CV is not reliable (same CV gave LB 0.7847 vs 0.7631)\n   - **Mitigation**: The approach is simpler than stacking, which should help generalization\n\n2. **Assumption**: ~31% survival rate is optimal for LB\n   - **Evidence**: Strong. Multiple experiments confirmed this pattern.\n   - **Status**: Validated\n\n**Blind Spots**:\n1. **TicketFreq leakage**: Should be computed from train-only data in future experiments\n2. **Feature interactions**: The new features may have interactions (e.g., FamilySize \u00d7 Pclass) that aren't being captured\n3. **Cabin deck extraction**: Has_Cabin is binary, but deck letter (A, B, C, etc.) could provide more signal\n\n**Trajectory**: PROMISING. The experiment shows:\n- CV improved from 0.8373 to 0.8395 (+0.22%)\n- Approach is simpler than stacking (which failed)\n- Only 9 predictions differ from best LB submission\n- The changes are interpretable (IsAlone, FamilySize affecting 3rd class passengers)\n\n## What's Working\n\n1. **Strategic pivot from complexity to features**: Correct lesson learned from stacking failure\n2. **Threshold calibration**: Maintaining ~31% survival rate that works on LB\n3. **Proven feature engineering**: Using features from top Titanic solutions\n4. **Systematic comparison**: Comparing 8-feature vs 13-feature models to isolate improvement\n5. **Interpretable changes**: The 9 differing predictions are explainable by the new features\n\n## Key Concerns\n\n1. **Observation**: TicketFreq is computed using combined train+test data\n   - **Why it matters**: This is a subtle form of data leakage that could inflate CV\n   - **Suggestion**: In future experiments, compute TicketFreq from train-only data. For test passengers with unseen tickets, use a default value (e.g., 1).\n\n2. **Observation**: CV improvement is small (+0.22%) and CV has been unreliable\n   - **Why it matters**: Same CV (0.8373) gave LB 0.7847 vs 0.7631 in previous experiments\n   - **Suggestion**: Submit to get LB feedback. The simpler approach should generalize better than stacking.\n\n3. **Observation**: Only 9 predictions differ from best LB submission (exp_003)\n   - **Why it matters**: The LB improvement will depend on whether these 9 changes are correct\n   - **Analysis**: \n     - exp_005 predicts survival for 5 passengers exp_003 predicted dead (4 female alone travelers)\n     - exp_005 predicts death for 4 passengers exp_003 predicted survived (3 female with families, 1 male child)\n   - **Insight**: The IsAlone feature is driving these changes. Alone 3rd class females are now predicted to survive, while 3rd class females with families are predicted to die. This aligns with historical patterns (alone travelers had more mobility during evacuation).\n\n4. **Observation**: Target score of 1.0 is impossible\n   - **Why it matters**: State-of-the-art for Titanic is 81-85% accuracy. Current best LB is 0.7847.\n   - **Suggestion**: Reframe success as incremental improvement. Getting to 0.80+ would be excellent.\n\n## Top Priority for Next Experiment\n\n**SUBMIT exp_005 (Feature Engineering) to validate whether the CV improvement translates to LB improvement.**\n\nThe experiment is well-executed and represents a sound strategic pivot. With 4 submissions remaining, this is worth testing. Expected outcomes:\n\n1. **If LB improves** (score > 0.7847):\n   - Feature engineering is the right direction\n   - Consider adding more features: Cabin deck, ticket prefix, family survival rate\n   - Fix TicketFreq leakage and re-test\n\n2. **If LB is similar** (score \u2248 0.7847):\n   - The 9 changed predictions roughly cancel out\n   - Try different feature combinations\n   - Consider feature selection to remove noise\n\n3. **If LB is worse** (score < 0.7847):\n   - The new features may be adding noise\n   - Revert to exp_003 as baseline\n   - Try adding features one at a time to isolate which help\n\n**Secondary recommendation**: After getting LB feedback, fix the TicketFreq leakage by computing it from train-only data. This is a minor issue but worth correcting for cleaner experiments.\n\n**Note on target**: The target of 1.0 (100% accuracy) is not achievable for Titanic. The current best LB of 0.7847 is competitive (top ~20% on the leaderboard). Focus on incremental improvements toward 0.80+.\n",

The stacking model achieved a CV accuracy of 0.8496 at threshold 0.5, and 0.8373 at the optimal threshold of 0.615 (which gives 131 survivors, 31.3% survival rate). This is higher than our previous best CV of 0.8373. The base models show good diversity with accuracies ranging from 0.7957 (SVC) to 0.8339 (RF).\n\nHowever, I notice something interesting - the meta-learner CV at threshold 0.5 is 0.8496, which is quite high. But the threshold analysis shows that many thresholds give the same number of survivors (133), suggesting the probabilities are quite concentrated.

          "text": "\ud83d\udd04 **EVALUATION COMPLETE - RESUMING**\n\n## Evaluator Feedback\n## What I Understood\n\nThe junior researcher implemented a stacking ensemble following my previous recommendation to try the approach from the reference kernel (arthurtok) that achieved 0.808 LB. The implementation uses 5 base models (RandomForest, ExtraTrees, AdaBoost, GradientBoosting, SVC) with out-of-fold predictions to avoid leakage, then an XGBoost meta-learner on the stacked predictions. They applied threshold tuning (0.615) to achieve ~31% survival rate, matching the pattern that worked well on previous submissions. This is a well-reasoned progression from the previous experiments.\n\n## Technical Execution Assessment\n\n**Validation**: Sound methodology. The implementation correctly:\n- Uses Stratified 5-fold CV with random_state=42 for reproducibility\n- Generates out-of-fold (OOF) predictions for base models to avoid leakage in stacking\n- Trains meta-learner on OOF predictions (proper stacking protocol)\n- Averages test predictions across all 5 folds for each base model\n- Fits StandardScaler on training fold only for SVC (correct handling)\n\n**Leakage Risk**: None detected. The stacking implementation is correct:\n- Base model OOF predictions are generated per-fold (no leakage)\n- Meta-learner is trained on OOF predictions, not on training predictions\n- Age imputation uses medians computed from training data only\n- The two-level CV is properly nested\n\n**Score Integrity**: Verified in notebook output:\n- Base model OOF accuracies: RF=0.8339, ET=0.8238, Ada=0.8204, GB=0.8159, SVC=0.7957\n- Meta-learner CV at threshold 0.5: 0.8496 (+/- 0.0136)\n- Meta-learner CV at threshold 0.615: 0.8373\n- Fold scores: 0.8603, 0.8371, 0.8427, 0.8371, 0.8708\n- Submission: 418 rows, 131 survivors (31.3%)\n\n**Code Quality**: Good implementation with:\n- Proper OOF prediction function with scaling option\n- Binary search for optimal threshold\n- Clear experiment summary\n- Files verified: submission.csv has 419 lines (418 data + header)\n\nVerdict: **TRUSTWORTHY** - Results can be relied upon for decision-making.\n\n## Strategic Assessment\n\n**Approach Fit**: Good. Stacking is a proven technique for Titanic (reference kernel achieved 0.808 LB). The implementation follows the established pattern. However, there's a concerning observation: the meta-learner CV at threshold 0.5 (0.8496) is higher than the threshold-tuned CV (0.8373), but the researcher chose to use threshold 0.615 to match the ~31% survival rate pattern. This is a reasonable choice based on previous LB feedback, but it means we're sacrificing OOF accuracy for survival rate calibration.\n\n**Effort Allocation**: Reasonable. The researcher is:\n- Building on proven approaches (reference kernel)\n- Applying lessons learned (survival rate calibration)\n- Using proper stacking methodology\n\nHowever, I'm concerned that the stacking model at threshold 0.615 produces the SAME CV score (0.8373) as the threshold-tuned voting ensemble. This suggests the stacking may not be adding value over the simpler approach.\n\n**Key Observations**:\n1. **Stacking CV at threshold 0.5 = 0.8496** - This is the highest CV we've seen\n2. **Stacking CV at threshold 0.615 = 0.8373** - Same as threshold-tuned ensemble\n3. **15 predictions differ** between stacking and threshold-tuned ensemble\n4. **Both have ~31% survival rate** (131 vs 130 survivors)\n\n**Assumptions Being Made**:\n1. **Assumption**: Survival rate calibration (~31%) is more important than CV accuracy\n   - **Evidence**: Previous experiments showed lower survival rate predictions performed better on LB\n   - **Risk**: We might be over-calibrating. The optimal threshold might be between 0.5 and 0.615\n\n2. **Assumption**: Stacking will improve LB over voting ensemble\n   - **Status**: Unvalidated. The CV scores are identical at the calibrated threshold.\n\n**Blind Spots**:\n1. **No submission yet**: This is the critical gap. We have 5 submissions remaining and haven't validated the stacking approach.\n2. **Threshold 0.5 not explored**: The stacking model at threshold 0.5 has CV 0.8496 with 133 survivors (31.8%). This is very close to the target survival rate but with higher CV. Worth considering.\n3. **Base model diversity**: All 5 base models are tree-based or ensemble methods. Adding a linear model (LogisticRegression) or neural network might improve diversity.\n\n**Trajectory**: The experiments are showing diminishing returns:\n- exp_000: CV 0.8316, LB 0.7584 (baseline)\n- exp_001: CV 0.8238, LB 0.7775 (+1.9% LB improvement)\n- exp_003: CV 0.8373, LB 0.7847 (+0.7% LB improvement)\n- exp_004: CV 0.8373, LB ??? (same CV as exp_003)\n\nThe CV-LB gap has narrowed from 7.3% to 5.3%, which is good. But we're now at a plateau where CV improvements aren't translating to LB improvements.\n\n## What's Working\n\n1. **Proper stacking implementation**: OOF predictions avoid leakage, meta-learner is correctly trained\n2. **Survival rate calibration**: Applying the lesson that ~31% survival rate works better on LB\n3. **Systematic experimentation**: Building on previous findings rather than random exploration\n4. **Reference kernel approach**: Following proven methodology from top solutions\n\n## Key Concerns\n\n1. **Observation**: Stacking CV at threshold 0.615 (0.8373) is identical to threshold-tuned voting ensemble\n   - **Why it matters**: If the CV scores are the same, stacking may not provide any advantage. The 15 different predictions could go either way on LB.\n   - **Suggestion**: Consider submitting the stacking model at threshold 0.5 (CV 0.8496, 133 survivors) as an alternative. This tests whether the higher CV or the exact survival rate matching is more predictive.\n\n2. **Observation**: No submission has been made for this experiment\n   - **Why it matters**: We have 5 submissions remaining and need LB feedback to validate the approach. The stacking model is ready but unsubmitted.\n   - **Suggestion**: Submit immediately. With 5 submissions left, we can afford to test this.\n\n3. **Observation**: The 15 different predictions between stacking and threshold-tuned ensemble are unanalyzed\n   - **Why it matters**: These 15 passengers will determine whether stacking outperforms the previous best. Understanding who they are could inform whether to expect improvement.\n   - **Suggestion**: Analyze the 15 differing passengers (IDs: 896, 910, 913, 924, 961, 1045, 1084, 1089, 1092, 1098, 1117, 1175, 1197, 1199, 1284). Are they borderline cases? What are their characteristics?\n\n4. **Observation**: Target score of 1.0 is impossible\n   - **Why it matters**: The target to beat is 1.0 (100% accuracy), which is not achievable. State-of-the-art for Titanic is 81-85% accuracy. Current best LB is 0.7847.\n   - **Suggestion**: Reframe success as incremental improvement. Getting to 0.80+ would be excellent. Focus on understanding the train/test distribution shift.\n\n## Top Priority for Next Experiment\n\n**SUBMIT THE STACKING MODEL to validate whether it improves over threshold-tuned ensemble.**\n\nThe experiment is complete and well-executed. The critical next step is LB feedback. Here's the action plan:\n\n1. **Submit candidate_004.csv** (stacking, threshold 0.615, 131 survivors, 31.3%)\n   - Expected LB: ~0.78-0.79 (similar to threshold-tuned ensemble)\n   - This tests: Does stacking improve over voting ensemble when both are calibrated to ~31% survival rate?\n\n2. **If LB improves** (score > 0.7847):\n   - Stacking adds value - continue refining the stacking approach\n   - Consider adding more diverse base models (LogisticRegression, neural network)\n   - Try different meta-learners (LightGBM, CatBoost)\n\n3. **If LB is similar or worse** (score \u2264 0.7847):\n   - Stacking doesn't add value over simpler ensemble at this calibration\n   - Consider: Submit stacking at threshold 0.5 (CV 0.8496, 133 survivors) to test if higher CV matters more than exact survival rate matching\n   - Alternative: Focus on feature engineering or different model architectures\n\n**Alternative submission to consider**: The stacking model at threshold 0.5 has the highest CV we've seen (0.8496) with 133 survivors (31.8%). This is still close to the target survival rate. If the current submission doesn't improve LB, try this variant next.\n\n**Important context**: We're at a plateau. The last two experiments have the same CV (0.8373). Breaking through may require:\n- Different feature engineering (ticket prefixes, family survival rates, cabin deck)\n- Different model architectures (neural networks, CatBoost)\n- Ensemble blending with different weights\n- Analyzing the specific passengers where models disagree\n\nThe current approach is sound but may be reaching its ceiling. After getting LB feedback on stacking, consider pivoting to feature engineering if no improvement is seen.\n\n\n## Updated Strategy\n# Titanic Survival Prediction - Loop 6 Strategy\n\n## Current Status\n- Best CV score: 0.8373 from exp_003 (Threshold-Tuned Ensemble)\n- Best LB score: 0.7847 from exp_003 (Threshold-Tuned Ensemble)\n- CV-LB gap: +5.26% (stable for best model)\n- Submissions used: 4/10 (4 remaining)\n\n## Response to Evaluator\n- Technical verdict was **TRUSTWORTHY** - stacking implementation was correct\n- Evaluator's top priority was: \"SUBMIT THE STACKING MODEL to validate whether it improves over threshold-tuned ensemble\"\n- **RESULT: STACKING FAILED** - LB dropped from 0.7847 to 0.7631 (-2.16%, 9 passengers worse)\n- Key insight: Same CV (0.8373) but stacking's CV-LB gap increased from 5.26% to 7.42%\n- **My synthesis**: Stacking overfits on this small dataset. Simpler models work better.\n  - Abandon stacking approach entirely\n  - Focus on feature engineering to improve the Threshold-Tuned Ensemble\n  - The 15 differing predictions were mostly WRONG for stacking\n\n## Submission History Analysis (Critical Learning)\n| Exp | Model | CV | LB | Gap | Survivors | Key Insight |\n|-----|-------|-----|-----|-----|-----------|-------------|\n| exp_000 | XGBoost (13 features) | 0.8316 | 0.7584 | +7.32% | 157 (37.6%) | Too complex, overfits |\n| exp_001 | Simple RF (7 features) | 0.8238 | 0.7775 | +4.63% | 131 (31.3%) | Simpler = better |\n| exp_003 | Threshold-Tuned Ensemble | 0.8373 | 0.7847 | +5.26% | 130 (31.1%) | **BEST LB** |\n| exp_004 | Stacking (5 base + XGB) | 0.8373 | 0.7631 | +7.42% | 131 (31.3%) | Stacking overfits |\n\n**Pattern Confirmed**:\n1. Lower survival rate (~31%) outperforms training rate (38.4%)\n2. Simpler models have smaller CV-LB gap\n3. Stacking/complex ensembles overfit on small datasets\n4. CV score alone is NOT predictive of LB performance\n\n## Data Understanding\nReference notebooks:\n- `exploration/eda.ipynb` - Feature distributions, survival patterns\n- `exploration/evolver_loop5_lb_feedback.ipynb` - Stacking failure analysis\n\nKey patterns:\n- Sex is dominant: Female 74.2% survival vs Male 18.9%\n- Pclass matters: 1st class 63%, 3rd class 24%\n- Title is highly predictive: Mr 15.7%, Mrs 79.2%, Miss 69.8%, Master 57.5%\n- **Stacking wrongly predicted survival for 8 young 3rd class females (ages 18-36, mean fare $12.9) who likely died**\n- Test set has lower survival rate than training (distribution shift)\n\n## Recommended Approaches (Priority Order)\n\n### Priority 1: FEATURE ENGINEERING (Highest Impact)\n**Rationale**: Research shows 80%+ accuracy is achievable with proper feature engineering. Current model uses only 8 basic features. Adding FamilySize, IsAlone, Has_Cabin could improve predictions.\n\n**Features to Add**:\n1. **FamilySize** = SibSp + Parch + 1\n   - Medium families (2-4) have 55-72% survival vs solo (30%) or large (0-33%)\n2. **IsAlone** = 1 if FamilySize == 1, else 0\n   - Solo travelers have lower survival (30.4%)\n3. **Has_Cabin** = 1 if Cabin is not null, else 0\n   - With cabin: 66.7% survival vs without: 30%\n4. **TicketFreq** = Number of passengers sharing same ticket\n   - Groups traveling together may have different survival patterns\n5. **FareBin** = Quartile-based fare categories\n   - Higher fare correlates with higher survival\n\n**Action**:\n1. Add these features to the Threshold-Tuned Ensemble\n2. Use same threshold calibration (~31% survival rate)\n3. Compare CV and submit if CV improves\n\n### Priority 2: BLENDING BEST MODELS\n**Rationale**: Simple RF (LB 0.7775) and Threshold-Tuned (LB 0.7847) have different strengths. Blending might capture both.\n\n**Action**:\n1. Load predictions from exp_001 (Simple RF) and exp_003 (Threshold-Tuned)\n2. Create weighted average: 0.6 * Threshold-Tuned + 0.4 * Simple RF\n3. Apply threshold to achieve ~31% survival rate\n4. Compare to best LB\n\n### Priority 3: ANALYZE DISAGREEMENT PATTERNS\n**Rationale**: Understanding where models disagree can inform feature engineering.\n\n**Key Observations from Analysis**:\n- All 4 models agree on 370/418 passengers (88.5%)\n- 9 passengers have 2-2 split (most uncertain)\n- Focus on these uncertain passengers for feature engineering\n\n### Priority 4: TRY CATBOOST (If Feature Engineering Doesn't Help)\n**Rationale**: CatBoost handles categorical features natively and may generalize better than XGBoost.\n\n**Action**:\n1. Use same features as Threshold-Tuned Ensemble\n2. Let CatBoost handle categorical encoding\n3. Apply threshold calibration\n4. Compare CV-LB gap\n\n## What NOT to Try\n- **Stacking**: Proven to overfit on this dataset (LB dropped 2.16%)\n- **More complex models**: XGBoost with 13 features had worst LB (0.7584)\n- **Chasing CV score**: CV 0.8496 (stacking at threshold 0.5) gave LB 0.7631\n- **Neural networks**: Too complex for 891 samples\n- **Hyperparameter tuning**: Diminishing returns, focus on features first\n\n## Validation Notes\n- Use 5-fold Stratified CV with random_state=42 (consistent)\n- **Trust survival rate pattern**: ~31% survival rate (130-133 survivors) performs best on LB\n- Expected LB = CV - 0.05 (based on recent submissions)\n- **CV alone is NOT reliable**: Same CV (0.8373) gave LB 0.7847 vs 0.7631\n\n## Target Reality Check\n- **Impossible target**: 1.0 (100% accuracy)\n- **State-of-the-art**: 81-85% LB (top solutions)\n- **Current best LB**: 0.7847 (78.47%)\n- **Realistic goal**: 0.80-0.81 (80-81%)\n- **Gap to close**: 1.5-2.5% (6-10 passengers)\n\n## Experiment Plan for Loop 6\n1. **Add FamilySize, IsAlone, Has_Cabin features** to Threshold-Tuned Ensemble\n2. Apply threshold calibration for ~31% survival rate\n3. If CV improves AND survival rate is ~31%, submit\n4. If no improvement, try blending Simple RF + Threshold-Tuned\n\n## Submission Strategy\n- 4 submissions remaining\n- Best LB: 0.7847 (exp_003)\n- Only submit if:\n  1. CV improves over 0.8373 AND\n  2. Survival rate is ~31% (130-133 survivors) AND\n  3. Approach is fundamentally different (new features, not just hyperparameters)\n- Save 2 submissions for final ensemble tuning\n\n## Critical Success Factors\n1. **Feature engineering**: Add FamilySize, IsAlone, Has_Cabin\n2. **Keep it simple**: Avoid complex stacking/ensembles\n3. **Threshold calibration**: ~31% survival rate is key\n4. **Trust LB patterns**: Simpler models with lower survival rate work better\n5. **Don't chase CV**: CV 0.8373 can give LB 0.7847 or 0.7631 depending on model\n\nContinue experimenting based on the updated guidance above."

The new features (FamilySize, IsAlone, Has_Cabin, TicketFreq, FareBin) are adding value. The survival rate is 31.3% (131 survivors), which matches the pattern that worked well on LB.\n\nKey observations:\n- FamilySize survival: Medium families (2-4) have 55-72% survival vs solo (30%) or large (0-33%)\n- Has_Cabin: With cabin 66.7% survival vs without 30% - strong predictor\n- FareBin: Clear gradient from 19.7% (lowest fare) to 58.1% (highest fare)\n\nLet me close the notebook and log this experiment."

fill missing with 'U' (unknown)\n- Deck B, D, E have higher survival rates (~74-75%)\n- Deck U (unknown) has lowest survival rate (~30%)\n\n### Name Length\n- Name_length = len(Name) - can be weakly predictive\n\n### Age and Fare Binning\n- Bin Age into categories: 0-16, 16-32, 32-48, 48-64, 64+\n- Bin Fare into quartiles or categories: 0-7.91, 7.91-14.45, 14.45-31, 31+\n- Binning helps tree models and reduces noise\n\n### Ticket Features (Advanced)\n- Extract ticket prefix (letters before numbers)\n- Ticket frequency (how many passengers share same ticket)\n\n## Missing Value Handling\n\n### Age (20% missing) - Critical\n**Option 1:** Fill with median grouped by Pclass, Sex, and Title\n**Option 2:** Use random values within (mean - std, mean + std)\n**Option 3 (Best):** Use XGBoost/RandomForest to predict Age from other features\n\n### Cabin (77% missing)\n- Create Has_Cabin binary feature\n- Extract Deck letter, fill missing with 'U'\n- Don't try to impute cabin numbers - too much missing\n\n### Embarked (2 missing in train)\n- Fill with mode ('S' - Southampton)\n- Or analyze: if Pclass=1 and Fare=80, likely 'C' (Cherbourg)\n\n### Fare (1 missing in test)\n- Fill with median grouped by Pclass and Embarked\n\n## Feature Selection\n**Drop these columns after feature engineering:**\n- PassengerId (identifier only)\n- Name (after extracting Title and Name_length)\n- Ticket (after extracting features)\n- Cabin (after creating Has_Cabin and Deck)\n\n**Keep/create these features:**\n- Sex_Code (0=female, 1=male)\n- Pclass\n- Embarked_Code\n- Title_Code\n- FamilySize\n- IsAlone\n- AgeBin_Code or Age (continuous)\n- FareBin_Code or Fare (continuous)\n- Has_Cabin\n- Deck_Code\n- Name_length (optional)\n\n## Models\n\n### Recommended Models (in order of typical performance)\n1. **XGBoost** - Usually best single model, handles missing values\n2. **LightGBM** - Fast, good performance\n3. **Random Forest** - Robust, handles feature interactions well\n4. **Gradient Boosting** - Strong performer\n5. **Extra Trees** - Similar to RF, more randomness\n6. **Logistic Regression** - Good baseline, interpretable\n7. **SVM with RBF kernel** - Can work well with proper scaling\n\n### Ensemble Approaches (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED - Key to Top Scores)\n\n**Voting Classifier:**\n- Combine 5-10 diverse models\n- Hard voting (majority) or soft voting (probability averaging)\n- Include: RF, ExtraTrees, GradientBoosting, AdaBoost, LogisticRegression, SVC, XGBoost\n- Soft voting often performs better\n\n**Stacking (Best approach for this competition):**\n- Level 1: Use 5 base models (RF, ExtraTrees, AdaBoost, GradientBoosting, SVC)\n- Generate out-of-fold predictions using 5-fold CV to avoid data leakage\n- Level 2: Train XGBoost or LogisticRegression on the stacked predictions\n- This approach achieved 0.808 LB score (top 9%)\n\n**Blending:**\n- Average predictions from multiple models\n- Weight models by their CV performance\n\n## Hyperparameter Tuning\n\n### XGBoost (Primary Model)\n```\nn_estimators: 100-500\nmax_depth: 3-6\nlearning_rate: 0.01-0.1\nsubsample: 0.8\ncolsample_bytree: 0.8\nreg_alpha: 0-1\nreg_lambda: 0-1\nscale_pos_weight: 1 or class_weight\n```\n\n### Random Forest / Extra Trees\n```\nn_estimators: 100-500\nmax_depth: 4-10\nmin_samples_leaf: 2-5\nmax_features: 'sqrt' or 0.3-0.5\n```\n\n### Gradient Boosting\n```\nn_estimators: 100-500\nmax_depth: 3-6\nlearning_rate: 0.01-0.1\nmin_samples_leaf: 2-5\nsubsample: 0.8\n```\n\n### SVC\n```\nkernel: 'rbf' or 'linear'\nC: 0.1-10\ngamma: 'scale' or 'auto'\nprobability: True (for soft voting)\n```\n\n### Tuning Methods\n- GridSearchCV for exhaustive search\n- RandomizedSearchCV for faster exploration\n- Bayesian optimization (Optuna) for efficient tuning\n\n## Validation Strategy\n- Use Stratified K-Fold CV (k=5 or k=10) to maintain class distribution\n- ShuffleSplit with 60/30 train/test split (leaving 10% out) also works\n- Cross-validation score is more reliable than single train/test split\n- **Important:** CV score ~83-84% typically translates to ~80-81% LB score\n\n## Key Insights from Top Kernels\n1. **Sex is the most important feature** (females 74% survival vs males 19%)\n2. **Pclass strongly correlates with survival** (1st class 63%, 3rd class 24%)\n3. **Title extraction captures both sex and social status** - very powerful feature\n4. **Family size has non-linear relationship** with survival (medium families best)\n5. **Feature engineering is MORE important than model selection** for this dataset\n6. **Ensemble methods consistently outperform single models**\n7. **Hyperparameter tuning with grid search** provides incremental improvements\n\n## Advanced Techniques\n\n### Transformer-based Approach (Experimental)\n- Render each row as a string (concatenate all features)\n- Use pre-trained DistilBERT to extract 768-dim feature vector\n- Train XGBoost on transformer features\n- Achieved 80.1% (top 3%) with minimal feature engineering\n\n### Feature Interactions\n- Create interaction features: Sex * Pclass, Age * Pclass\n- Polynomial features for continuous variables\n\n### Target Encoding (Use with Caution)\n- Encode categorical features with target mean\n- Use K-fold target encoding to avoid leakage\n\n## Submission Tips\n- Always check submission format: PassengerId, Survived (0 or 1)\n- Ensure predictions are integers (0 or 1), not floats\n- Verify 418 rows in submission\n- Try multiple random seeds and average predictions\n- Submit best CV model, not necessarily best single-fold model\n\n## Expected Performance\n- Baseline (gender only): ~76-77%\n- Good feature engineering: ~79-80%\n- Tuned single model: ~80-82%\n- Ensemble methods: ~81-85%\n- State-of-the-art: ~84-85%\n",

Target of 1.0 is impossible (agree - state-of-the-art is 81-85%)\n  2. Single model approach (agree - ensembles are more robust)\n  3. CV-LB gap (now confirmed at 7.3% - this is the critical issue)\n- **My synthesis**: The 7.3% CV-LB gap is the #1 problem. Before trying ensembles, we need to fix the overfitting issue. A complex ensemble of overfitting models will still overfit.\n\n## Critical Issue: Severe Overfitting\nThe LB score of 0.7584 is:\n- Below the gender-only baseline (~76-77%)\n- Below even the worst CV fold (0.7921)\n- 7.3% lower than CV score\n\n**Root causes identified:**\n1. Too many features (13) - some may be noise\n2. XGBoost may be memorizing training patterns\n3. Age imputation on combined train+test (minor leakage)\n4. Distribution shift: Embarked C is 24.4% in test vs 18.9% in train\n\n## Data Understanding\nReference notebooks:\n- `exploration/eda.ipynb` - Feature distributions, survival patterns\n- `exploration/evolver_loop1_lb_feedback.ipynb` - CV-LB gap analysis\n- `research/kernels/alexisbcook_titanic-tutorial/` - Simple baseline with 4 features\n\nKey patterns (from EDA):\n- Sex is dominant: Female 74.2% survival vs Male 18.9%\n- Pclass matters: 1st class 63%, 3rd class 24%\n- Title captures both sex and status\n- FamilySize has non-linear relationship (medium families best)\n\n## Recommended Approaches (Priority Order)\n\n### Priority 1: Simpler Model with Fewer Features\n**Rationale**: The official Titanic tutorial uses just 4 features (Pclass, Sex, SibSp, Parch) with Random Forest and achieves reasonable LB scores. Our 13-feature XGBoost is overfitting.\n\n**Action**:\n- Use only core features: Sex, Pclass, SibSp, Parch, Fare, Embarked\n- Try Random Forest with max_depth=5, n_estimators=100\n- Compare CV and expected LB performance\n\n### Priority 2: Voting Ensemble with Simple Models\n**Rationale**: Ensembles of diverse simple models are more robust than a single complex model.\n\n**Action**:\n- Combine: LogisticRegression, RandomForest, GradientBoosting, SVC\n- Use soft voting (probability averaging)\n- Keep features simple (6-8 features max)\n\n### Priority 3: Regularization and Hyperparameter Tuning\n**Rationale**: If using XGBoost, increase regularization to prevent overfitting.\n\n**Action**:\n- Reduce max_depth to 3\n- Increase reg_alpha and reg_lambda (L1/L2 regularization)\n- Reduce n_estimators\n- Use early stopping\n\n### Priority 4: Feature Engineering Refinement\n**Rationale**: Some features may be adding noise rather than signal.\n\n**Action**:\n- Keep: Sex, Pclass, Title, FamilySize\n- Test: Has_Cabin, Deck (may be noisy due to 77% missing)\n- Remove: Name_length (weak signal)\n- Impute Age on train only, not combined data\n\n## What NOT to Try\n- More complex models (will overfit more)\n- More features without validation\n- Hyperparameter tuning before fixing overfitting\n- Stacking (premature - need robust base models first)\n\n## Validation Notes\n- Use 5-fold Stratified CV (current approach is sound)\n- **Trust CV trend, but calibrate for LB gap**\n- Expected LB = CV - 0.07 (based on current gap)\n- A model with CV 0.80 might achieve LB 0.73-0.77\n\n## Target Recalibration\n- **Impossible target**: 1.0 (100% accuracy)\n- **State-of-the-art**: 81-85% LB\n- **Realistic goal**: 78-80% LB (would be a significant improvement)\n- **Immediate goal**: Beat 76% LB (gender baseline)\n\n## Experiment Plan for Loop 2\n1. **exp_001**: Simple Random Forest with 4-6 features (match official tutorial)\n2. **exp_002**: Voting ensemble with simple models\n3. **exp_003**: Regularized XGBoost with fewer features\n\nFocus on reducing the CV-LB gap before optimizing CV score.",

Ensemble methods unexplored - **AGREE, next priority**\n\n## CRITICAL: Target is Impossible\n**The target of 1.0 (100% accuracy) is fundamentally impossible for Titanic.**\n- State-of-the-art: 81-85% accuracy\n- Top 0.6% achieved 81.1% with voting ensemble\n- Current best LB: 0.7775 (77.75%)\n- Gap to realistic goal (0.80): 2.3%\n\n**Realistic goals:**\n- \u2705 Beat 0.7584 (previous LB): ACHIEVED\n- Reach 0.78-0.80: Next target\n- Reach 0.81-0.82: Excellent (top 10%)\n\n## What We Learned from LB Feedback\n1. **Simpler models generalize better** - 7 features beat 13 features on LB\n2. **Lower survival rate predictions worked** - 31.3% beat 37.6%\n3. **CV is not reliable** - Lower CV (0.8238) achieved higher LB (0.7775)\n4. **Feature engineering can hurt** - Too many features led to overfitting\n\n## Data Understanding\nReference notebooks:\n- `exploration/eda.ipynb` - Feature distributions, survival patterns\n- `exploration/evolver_loop2_lb_feedback.ipynb` - LB feedback analysis\n\nKey patterns to exploit:\n- Sex is dominant: Female 74.2% survival vs Male 18.9%\n- Pclass matters: 1st class 63%, 3rd class 24%\n- Title captures both sex AND social status (Mr vs Master, Mrs vs Miss)\n- Distribution shift: Embarked C is 24.4% in test vs 18.9% in train\n\n## Recommended Approaches (Priority Order)\n\n### Priority 1: Voting Ensemble with Simple Features + Title\n**Rationale**: \n- Ensembles are proven to work (0.808 LB in kernels)\n- Diversity reduces variance and overfitting\n- Title adds valuable signal without adding noise\n\n**Action**:\n- Use 8 features: Pclass, Sex_Code, Age, SibSp, Parch, Fare, Embarked_Code, Title_Code\n- Combine diverse models: RandomForest, LogisticRegression, GradientBoosting, SVC\n- Use soft voting (probability averaging)\n- Keep models simple (max_depth=5, regularization)\n- Expected CV: ~0.82, Expected LB: ~0.78-0.80\n\n### Priority 2: Multiple Seeds Ensemble\n**Rationale**: TF-DF kernel shows ensembling 100 models with different seeds improves robustness\n\n**Action**:\n- Train same model architecture with different random seeds\n- Average predictions\n- Reduces variance from random initialization\n\n### Priority 3: Stacking Ensemble\n**Rationale**: More sophisticated than voting, achieved 0.808 LB in kernels.\n\n**Action**:\n- Level 1: RF, ExtraTrees, AdaBoost, GradientBoosting, SVC\n- Generate out-of-fold predictions (5-fold CV)\n- Level 2: LogisticRegression on stacked features (simpler meta-learner)\n- Try after voting ensemble works\n\n## What NOT to Try\n- \u274c More than 10 features (proven to overfit)\n- \u274c Complex single models (XGBoost with 13 features failed)\n- \u274c Chasing CV score (CV 0.8316 gave LB 0.7584, CV 0.8238 gave LB 0.7775)\n- \u274c High survival rate predictions (31.3% worked better than 37.6%)\n\n## Validation Notes\n- Use 5-fold Stratified CV (current approach is sound)\n- **Expected CV-LB gap: 4-5%** (based on exp_001)\n- A model with CV 0.82 might achieve LB 0.77-0.78\n- Submit when CV improves OR when trying fundamentally different approach\n\n## Experiment Plan for Loop 3\n\n### exp_002: Voting Ensemble with Title\n**Goal**: Combine diversity of multiple models with simple feature set\n\n**Features (8 total)**:\n- Pclass, Sex_Code, Age, SibSp, Parch, Fare, Embarked_Code, Title_Code\n\n**Models**:\n- RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, max_depth=5)\n- LogisticRegression(C=1.0)\n- GradientBoostingClassifier(n_estimators=100, max_depth=3)\n- SVC(kernel='rbf', probability=True, C=1.0)\n\n**Ensemble**: VotingClassifier with soft voting\n\n**Expected**: CV ~0.82, LB ~0.78-0.80\n\n### exp_003 (if exp_002 works): Stacking Ensemble\n**Goal**: Use out-of-fold predictions as meta-features\n\n**Base models**: Same as exp_002 + ExtraTrees, AdaBoost\n**Meta-learner**: LogisticRegression (simple to avoid overfitting)\n\n## Key Success Factors\n1. **Keep features simple** - 8 features maximum\n2. **Use ensemble diversity** - Different model types\n3. **Regularize heavily** - max_depth=5, min_samples_leaf=5\n4. **Trust LB over CV** - CV is not reliable for this problem\n5. **Don't over-predict survival** - 31-35% survival rate seems optimal",

The evaluator correctly identified the critical pattern:\n  - XGBoost (37.6% survival) \u2192 LB 0.7584\n  - Simple RF (31.3% survival) \u2192 LB 0.7775\n  - Ensemble (37.6% survival) \u2192 Expected LB ~0.76-0.77 (same as XGBoost)\n- Key concerns raised:\n  1. Survival rate (37.6%) matches XGBoost exactly - **CONFIRMED in my analysis**\n  2. Ensemble wasn't submitted - **AGREE, we need LB feedback**\n  3. Ensemble CV (0.8328) < GradientBoosting alone (0.8384) - **Valid concern**\n  4. LogisticRegression (0.8103) dragging down ensemble - **Valid concern**\n- **My synthesis**: The survival rate hypothesis is compelling. The 30 passengers where Simple RF differs from Ensemble are mostly 3rd class females (20F, 10M, 27 from Pclass 3). Ensemble predicts 28 of these as survivors while Simple RF predicts only 2. This suggests the test set has fewer 3rd class female survivors than training data.\n\n## Critical Insight: Survival Rate Calibration\n**The pattern is clear:**\n- Training survival rate: 38.4%\n- XGBoost predicted: 37.6% \u2192 LB 0.7584 (close to train rate)\n- Simple RF predicted: 31.3% \u2192 LB 0.7775 (lower than train rate)\n- Ensemble predicted: 37.6% \u2192 Expected LB ~0.76-0.77\n\n**Hypothesis**: The test set has a LOWER survival rate than training. Models that predict fewer survivors perform better on LB.\n\n## Data Understanding\nReference notebooks:\n- `exploration/eda.ipynb` - Feature distributions, survival patterns\n- `exploration/evolver_loop2_lb_feedback.ipynb` - CV-LB gap analysis\n- `exploration/evolver_loop3_analysis.ipynb` - Survival rate hypothesis analysis\n- `research/kernels/arthurtok_introduction-to-ensembling-stacking-in-python/` - Stacking approach (0.808 LB)\n\nKey patterns:\n- Sex is dominant: Female 74.2% survival vs Male 18.9%\n- Pclass matters: 1st class 63%, 3rd class 24%\n- The 30 different predictions between Simple RF and Ensemble are mostly 3rd class passengers\n- Simple RF is more conservative on 3rd class female survival predictions\n\n## Recommended Approaches (Priority Order)\n\n### Priority 1: Threshold Tuning on Ensemble\n**Rationale**: Test the survival rate hypothesis directly. If we can reduce the ensemble's survival rate from 37.6% to ~31% by adjusting the threshold from 0.5 to ~0.55-0.60, we should see LB improvement.\n\n**Action**:\n1. Load the ensemble's probability predictions (from exp_002)\n2. Test thresholds: 0.52, 0.55, 0.58, 0.60\n3. Find threshold that gives ~31% survival rate (~130 survivors)\n4. Create submission with adjusted threshold\n5. Submit to validate hypothesis\n\n**Expected outcome**: If hypothesis correct, LB should improve to ~0.77-0.78\n\n### Priority 2: Stacking with Out-of-Fold Predictions\n**Rationale**: The stacking kernel achieved 0.808 LB (top 9%). This is a proven approach.\n\n**Action**:\n1. Use 5 base models: RF, ExtraTrees, AdaBoost, GradientBoosting, SVC\n2. Generate out-of-fold predictions using 5-fold CV (CRITICAL: avoid leakage)\n3. Stack predictions as features for XGBoost meta-learner\n4. Use simple feature set (7-8 features) for base models\n5. Tune XGBoost meta-learner: n_estimators=2000, max_depth=4, gamma=0.9\n\n**Expected outcome**: CV ~0.83-0.84, LB ~0.78-0.81\n\n### Priority 3: Weighted Voting Ensemble\n**Rationale**: Current ensemble uses equal weights. GradientBoosting (0.8384) is much better than LogisticRegression (0.8103).\n\n**Action**:\n1. Remove LogisticRegression (weakest model)\n2. Use weighted voting: GB=2, RF=1, SVC=1\n3. Or use CV scores as weights: GB=0.8384, RF=0.8305, SVC=0.8350\n4. Keep 8 features (with Title)\n\n### Priority 4: Conservative Feature Engineering\n**Rationale**: The Simple RF's success suggests simpler is better. But we might be missing signal.\n\n**Action**:\n1. Keep core features: Sex, Pclass, Age, SibSp, Parch, Fare, Embarked\n2. Add Title (captures sex + social status)\n3. Consider FamilySize = SibSp + Parch + 1\n4. Avoid: Has_Cabin, Deck, Name_length (may add noise)\n\n## What NOT to Try\n- More complex models (will overfit more)\n- More features without validation (13 features led to overfitting)\n- Hyperparameter tuning before fixing calibration issue\n- Chasing CV score (CV 0.8328 doesn't guarantee good LB)\n\n## Validation Notes\n- Use 5-fold Stratified CV (current approach is sound)\n- **Trust survival rate pattern over CV score**\n- Expected LB = CV - 0.04 to 0.05 (based on Simple RF gap)\n- Monitor survival rate: aim for ~31% (130 survivors)\n\n## Target Reality Check\n- **Impossible target**: 1.0 (100% accuracy)\n- **State-of-the-art**: 81-85% LB\n- **Current best LB**: 0.7775 (77.75%)\n- **Realistic goal**: 0.80-0.81 (80-81%)\n- **Immediate goal**: Beat 0.7775 with threshold tuning or stacking\n\n## Experiment Plan for Loop 3\n1. **exp_003**: Threshold-adjusted ensemble (target ~31% survival rate)\n2. **exp_004**: Stacking with 5 base models + XGBoost meta-learner\n3. **exp_005**: Weighted voting ensemble (remove LR, weight by CV)\n\n## Submission Strategy\n- Submit exp_003 (threshold-adjusted) to test survival rate hypothesis\n- If hypothesis confirmed, focus on calibration\n- If hypothesis wrong, focus on stacking for higher ceiling\n- Save 3-4 submissions for final ensemble tuning",

Target of 1.0 is impossible - **Acknowledged, focusing on realistic 0.80+ goal**\n- **My synthesis**: The survival rate hypothesis is CONFIRMED. Lower survival rate (~31%) performs better on LB.

This is a proven approach that could push us to 0.80+.\n\n**Action**:\n1. Use 5 base models: RF, ExtraTrees, AdaBoost, GradientBoostingClassifier, SVC\n2. Generate out-of-fold predictions using 5-fold Stratified CV (CRITICAL: avoid leakage)\n3. Stack predictions as features for XGBoost meta-learner\n4. Use 8 features (with Title) for base models\n5. XGBoost meta-learner: n_estimators=2000, max_depth=4, gamma=0.9, subsample=0.8\n6. **IMPORTANT**: Apply threshold tuning to final predictions to achieve ~31% survival rate\n\n**Implementation details from kernel**:\n```python\n# Base model parameters\nrf_params = {'n_estimators': 500, 'max_depth': 6, 'min_samples_leaf': 2}\net_params = {'n_estimators': 500, 'max_depth': 8, 'min_samples_leaf': 2}\nada_params = {'n_estimators': 500, 'learning_rate': 0.75}\ngb_params = {'n_estimators': 500, 'max_depth': 5, 'min_samples_leaf': 2}\nsvc_params = {'kernel': 'linear', 'C': 0.025}\n\n# OOF prediction function\ndef get_oof(clf, x_train, y_train, x_test, kfold):\n    oof_train = np.zeros((len(x_train),))\n    oof_test = np.zeros((len(x_test),))\n    oof_test_skf = np.empty((kfold.n_splits, len(x_test)))\n    \n    for i, (train_idx, val_idx) in enumerate(kfold.split(x_train, y_train)):\n        clf.fit(x_train[train_idx], y_train[train_idx])\n        oof_train[val_idx] = clf.predict(x_train[val_idx])\n        oof_test_skf[i, :] = clf.predict(x_test)\n    \n    oof_test[:] = oof_test_skf.mean(axis=0)\n    return oof_train.reshape(-1, 1), oof_test.reshape(-1, 1)\n\n# Stack OOF predictions\nx_train_stack = np.concatenate((et_oof_train, rf_oof_train, ada_oof_train, gb_oof_train, svc_oof_train), axis=1)\nx_test_stack = np.concatenate((et_oof_test, rf_oof_test, ada_oof_test, gb_oof_test, svc_oof_test), axis=1)\n\n# XGBoost meta-learner\ngbm = xgb.XGBClassifier(n_estimators=2000, max_depth=4, gamma=0.9, subsample=0.8, colsample_bytree=0.8)\n```\n\n**Expected outcome**: CV ~0.83-0.84, LB ~0.78-0.81\n\n### Priority 2: Threshold 0.55 Test (Best OOF Accuracy)\n**Rationale**: Evaluator noted threshold 0.55 gives best OOF accuracy (0.8418) with 144 survivors (34.4%). This is a middle ground worth testing.\n\n**Action**:\n1. Use same ensemble from exp_003\n2. Apply threshold 0.55 instead of 0.608\n3. This gives 144 survivors (34.4% survival rate) vs 130 (31.1%)\n4. Submit to test whether OOF accuracy or survival rate matching is more predictive\n\n**Expected outcome**: LB could be better or worse than 0.7847 - this tests the hypothesis\n\n### Priority 3: Blending RF + Threshold-Tuned Ensemble\n**Rationale**: Simple RF and Threshold-Tuned Ensemble agree on 96.4% of predictions but differ on 15. Blending might capture the best of both.\n\n**Action**:\n1. Load predictions from exp_001 (Simple RF) and exp_003 (Threshold-Tuned)\n2. Average probabilities: (RF_prob + Thresh_prob) / 2\n3. Apply threshold to achieve ~31% survival rate\n4. Submit to test if blending helps\n\n### Priority 4: Feature Engineering + Stacking\n**Rationale**: Add FamilySize and Has_Cabin features to base models for stacking.\n\n**Action**:\n1. Add FamilySize = SibSp + Parch + 1\n2. Add IsAlone = 1 if FamilySize == 1\n3. Add Has_Cabin = 1 if Cabin is not null\n4. Use these features in stacking approach\n\n## What NOT to Try\n- More complex models without stacking (will overfit)\n- Hyperparameter tuning without calibration (survival rate matters more)\n- Chasing CV score alone (CV 0.8373 \u2192 LB 0.7847, gap is real)\n- Features that increase CV-LB gap (Deck, Name_length)\n\n## Validation Notes\n- Use 5-fold Stratified CV with random_state=42 (consistent)\n- **Trust survival rate pattern**: ~31% survival rate performs best on LB\n- Expected LB = CV - 0.05 (based on recent submissions)\n- Monitor survival rate: aim for ~31% (130 survivors)\n\n## Target Reality Check\n- **Impossible target**: 1.0 (100% accuracy)\n- **State-of-the-art**: 81-85% LB\n- **Current best LB**: 0.7847 (78.47%)\n- **Realistic goal**: 0.80-0.81 (80-81%)\n- **Gap to close**: 1.5-2.5% (6-10 passengers)\n\n## Experiment Plan for Loop 4\n1. **exp_004**: Stacking with 5 base models + XGBoost meta-learner + threshold tuning\n2. **exp_005**: Threshold 0.55 on current ensemble (test OOF accuracy hypothesis)\n3. **exp_006**: Blending RF + Threshold-Tuned Ensemble\n\n## Submission Strategy\n- 5 submissions remaining\n- Submit stacking model (exp_004) - highest potential\n- If stacking works (LB > 0.7847), iterate on stacking variations\n- If stacking fails, try blending approaches\n- Save 2 submissions for final ensemble tuning\n\n## Critical Success Factors\n1. **Stacking done correctly**: OOF predictions must avoid leakage\n2. **Threshold calibration**: Apply to final predictions to achieve ~31% survival rate\n3. **Model diversity**: Use different model types (tree-based, linear, SVM)\n4. **Feature consistency**: Use same preprocessing across all base models",

Current model uses only 8 basic features. Adding FamilySize, IsAlone, Has_Cabin could improve predictions.\n\n**Features to Add**:\n1. **FamilySize** = SibSp + Parch + 1\n   - Medium families (2-4) have 55-72% survival vs solo (30%) or large (0-33%)\n2. **IsAlone** = 1 if FamilySize == 1, else 0\n   - Solo travelers have lower survival (30.4%)\n3. **Has_Cabin** = 1 if Cabin is not null, else 0\n   - With cabin: 66.7% survival vs without: 30%\n4. **TicketFreq** = Number of passengers sharing same ticket\n   - Groups traveling together may have different survival patterns\n5. **FareBin** = Quartile-based fare categories\n   - Higher fare correlates with higher survival\n\n**Action**:\n1. Add these features to the Threshold-Tuned Ensemble\n2. Use same threshold calibration (~31% survival rate)\n3. Compare CV and submit if CV improves\n\n### Priority 2: BLENDING BEST MODELS\n**Rationale**: Simple RF (LB 0.7775) and Threshold-Tuned (LB 0.7847) have different strengths. Blending might capture both.\n\n**Action**:\n1. Load predictions from exp_001 (Simple RF) and exp_003 (Threshold-Tuned)\n2. Create weighted average: 0.6 * Threshold-Tuned + 0.4 * Simple RF\n3. Apply threshold to achieve ~31% survival rate\n4. Compare to best LB\n\n### Priority 3: ANALYZE DISAGREEMENT PATTERNS\n**Rationale**: Understanding where models disagree can inform feature engineering.\n\n**Key Observations from Analysis**:\n- All 4 models agree on 370/418 passengers (88.5%)\n- 9 passengers have 2-2 split (most uncertain)\n- Focus on these uncertain passengers for feature engineering\n\n### Priority 4: TRY CATBOOST (If Feature Engineering Doesn't Help)\n**Rationale**: CatBoost handles categorical features natively and may generalize better than XGBoost.\n\n**Action**:\n1. Use same features as Threshold-Tuned Ensemble\n2. Let CatBoost handle categorical encoding\n3. Apply threshold calibration\n4. Compare CV-LB gap\n\n## What NOT to Try\n- **Stacking**: Proven to overfit on this dataset (LB dropped 2.16%)\n- **More complex models**: XGBoost with 13 features had worst LB (0.7584)\n- **Chasing CV score**: CV 0.8496 (stacking at threshold 0.5) gave LB 0.7631\n- **Neural networks**: Too complex for 891 samples\n- **Hyperparameter tuning**: Diminishing returns, focus on features first\n\n## Validation Notes\n- Use 5-fold Stratified CV with random_state=42 (consistent)\n- **Trust survival rate pattern**: ~31% survival rate (130-133 survivors) performs best on LB\n- Expected LB = CV - 0.05 (based on recent submissions)\n- **CV alone is NOT reliable**: Same CV (0.8373) gave LB 0.7847 vs 0.7631\n\n## Target Reality Check\n- **Impossible target**: 1.0 (100% accuracy)\n- **State-of-the-art**: 81-85% LB (top solutions)\n- **Current best LB**: 0.7847 (78.47%)\n- **Realistic goal**: 0.80-0.81 (80-81%)\n- **Gap to close**: 1.5-2.5% (6-10 passengers)\n\n## Experiment Plan for Loop 6\n1. **Add FamilySize, IsAlone, Has_Cabin features** to Threshold-Tuned Ensemble\n2. Apply threshold calibration for ~31% survival rate\n3. If CV improves AND survival rate is ~31%, submit\n4. If no improvement, try blending Simple RF + Threshold-Tuned\n\n## Submission Strategy\n- 4 submissions remaining\n- Best LB: 0.7847 (exp_003)\n- Only submit if:\n  1. CV improves over 0.8373 AND\n  2. Survival rate is ~31% (130-133 survivors) AND\n  3. Approach is fundamentally different (new features, not just hyperparameters)\n- Save 2 submissions for final ensemble tuning\n\n## Critical Success Factors\n1. **Feature engineering**: Add FamilySize, IsAlone, Has_Cabin\n2. **Keep it simple**: Avoid complex stacking/ensembles\n3. **Threshold calibration**: ~31% survival rate is key\n4. **Trust LB patterns**: Simpler models with lower survival rate work better\n5. **Don't chase CV**: CV 0.8373 can give LB 0.7847 or 0.7631 depending on model",

      "feedback": "## What I Understood\n\nThe junior researcher implemented a baseline XGBoost model for the Titanic survival prediction problem. Their approach included comprehensive feature engineering (Title extraction, FamilySize, Has_Cabin, Deck), Age imputation using median by Title/Pclass/Sex groups, and 5-fold stratified cross-validation. The goal was to establish a solid baseline before exploring more advanced techniques. They achieved 83.16% CV accuracy with reasonable fold variance (\u00b12.4%).\n\n## Technical Execution Assessment\n\n**Validation**: Sound methodology. Stratified 5-fold CV is appropriate for this binary classification problem with slight class imbalance (38.4% survived). The fold variance of \u00b12.4% is reasonable and doesn't suggest leakage or instability.\n\n**Leakage Risk**: Minor concern - Age imputation and label encoding are done on combined train+test data. While this is common practice in Titanic kernels and the impact is minimal (only affects imputation medians, not target-related features), it's technically a form of information leakage. For this competition, it's acceptable, but worth noting.\n\n**Score Integrity**: Verified. The notebook output shows:\n- Fold scores: 0.8659, 0.8427, 0.7921, 0.8258, 0.8315\n- Overall CV: 0.8316 (matches session state)\n- Submission file: 418 rows, correct format, reasonable survival distribution (157/418 = 37.6% survived, close to training distribution)\n\n**Code Quality**: Good. Proper random seeds set (42), clean implementation, no silent failures. Feature importance analysis included. The code does what it claims.\n\nVerdict: **TRUSTWORTHY** - Results can be relied upon for decision-making.\n\n## Strategic Assessment\n\n**Approach Fit**: The approach is well-suited for Titanic. Feature engineering (Title, FamilySize, Deck) aligns with known high-value features from EDA and top kernels. XGBoost is a strong choice for tabular data. The feature importance confirms Sex_Code (0.44) and Pclass (0.12) are dominant, matching domain knowledge.\n\n**Effort Allocation**: Appropriate for a first experiment. Establishing a solid baseline with proper validation before trying advanced techniques is the right approach. The researcher has identified the key features and built a foundation to iterate from.\n\n**Assumptions**: \n- The target of 1.0 (100% accuracy) is **unrealistic and needs to be addressed**. Based on web research and kernel analysis, state-of-the-art for Titanic is 81-85% accuracy. The current 83.16% CV is actually quite competitive.\n- The assumption that XGBoost alone will be sufficient may need revisiting - top solutions typically use ensembles.\n\n**Blind Spots**:\n1. **No submission made yet** - 8 submissions remain. The CV score (83.16%) typically translates to ~80-81% on the leaderboard. A submission would provide ground truth on model performance.\n2. **Ensemble methods not explored** - The strategy notes mention stacking achieved 0.808 LB (top 9%). This is a clear next step.\n3. **Hyperparameter tuning** - Current params are reasonable defaults but not optimized.\n4. **Additional features** - Ticket prefix, fare binning, age binning not yet implemented.\n\n**Trajectory**: This is a solid start. The baseline is competitive, validation is sound, and there's clear room for improvement through ensembles and feature refinement.\n\n## What's Working\n\n1. **Feature engineering fundamentals** - Title extraction, FamilySize, Has_Cabin are all high-value features that top kernels use\n2. **Validation methodology** - Stratified K-fold with proper OOF predictions is the right approach\n3. **Code organization** - Clean, reproducible, well-documented\n4. **Feature importance analysis** - Confirms the model is learning sensible patterns (Sex > Pclass > Title)\n\n## Key Concerns\n\n1. **Observation**: The target score of 1.0 (100% accuracy) is impossible to achieve\n   - **Why it matters**: This could lead to wasted effort chasing an unattainable goal. The researcher might think they're failing when they're actually doing well.\n   - **Suggestion**: Recalibrate expectations. 83-85% CV / 80-82% LB would be excellent. Focus on incremental improvements, not perfection.\n\n2. **Observation**: No Kaggle submission has been made yet\n   - **Why it matters**: CV score and LB score can differ significantly. Without a submission, we don't know the true model performance.\n   - **Suggestion**: Submit the current baseline to establish a LB benchmark. This costs 1 of 8 remaining submissions but provides crucial feedback.\n\n3. **Observation**: Single model approach when ensembles are known to perform better\n   - **Why it matters**: The strategy notes indicate stacking achieved 0.808 LB (top 9%). Ensemble methods consistently outperform single models on Titanic.\n   - **Suggestion**: Next experiment should implement a voting classifier or stacking ensemble with diverse base models (RF, ExtraTrees, GradientBoosting, SVC, LogisticRegression).\n\n## Top Priority for Next Experiment\n\n**Submit the current baseline to Kaggle, then implement an ensemble approach.**\n\nThe immediate action should be to submit the current prediction to get a real LB score. This establishes a benchmark and validates that CV performance translates to test performance.\n\nThen, the highest-leverage improvement is implementing an ensemble. Based on the research:\n- Voting classifier with 5-7 diverse models (soft voting)\n- Or stacking with out-of-fold predictions and a meta-learner\n\nThe current 83.16% CV is already competitive. An ensemble could push this to 84-85% CV, which should translate to ~81-82% LB - near state-of-the-art for this competition.\n\n**Important context**: The target of 1.0 is not achievable. The Titanic dataset has inherent noise (some survival outcomes were essentially random). Realistic targets are:\n- Good: 80% LB\n- Very good: 81-82% LB  \n- Excellent: 83-85% LB (top 1-5%)\n\nThe researcher should not be discouraged by not hitting 100% - they're on a good trajectory.\n",

      "feedback": "## What I Understood\n\nThe junior researcher observed a significant CV-LB gap in the first experiment (CV 0.8316 vs LB 0.7584 = 7.3% gap) and hypothesized that overfitting was the cause. To address this, they implemented a simpler model: Random Forest with only 7 core features (Pclass, Sex_Code, Age, SibSp, Parch, Fare, Embarked_Code) instead of the 13 engineered features from the baseline. They also fixed a potential leakage issue by computing Age imputation medians from training data only. The result was CV 0.8238 \u00b1 0.0148 - lower CV but with the expectation of a smaller CV-LB gap.\n\n## Technical Execution Assessment\n\n**Validation**: Sound methodology. Stratified 5-fold CV is appropriate. The fold variance (\u00b10.0148) is reasonable and actually lower than the baseline (\u00b10.024), suggesting more stable predictions. The fold scores [0.8492, 0.8146, 0.8090, 0.8146, 0.8315] show reasonable variance.\n\n**Leakage Risk**: Improved from baseline. The researcher correctly identified and fixed the Age imputation leakage - now computing medians from training data only (grouped by Sex and Pclass). This is good practice. Embarked and Fare imputation also use train-only statistics.\n\n**Score Integrity**: Verified. The notebook output shows:\n- 6-feature CV: 0.8114 \u00b1 0.0163\n- 7-feature CV: 0.8238 \u00b1 0.0148 (selected)\n- Submission file: 418 rows, correct format, survival rate 31.3%\n\n**Code Quality**: Good. Clean implementation, proper random seeds (42), no silent failures. The comparison between 6 and 7 features is a nice ablation study.\n\nVerdict: **TRUSTWORTHY** - Results can be relied upon for decision-making.\n\n## Strategic Assessment\n\n**Approach Fit**: The hypothesis (simpler model = smaller CV-LB gap) is reasonable but **not yet validated**. The experiment was not submitted to Kaggle, so we don't know if the simpler model actually reduces the gap. This is a critical missing piece of information.\n\n**Effort Allocation**: Mixed. The researcher is addressing a real problem (the 7.3% CV-LB gap is concerning), but:\n1. They haven't submitted this model to verify the hypothesis\n2. The approach of \"fewer features\" may be throwing away valuable signal\n3. The Title feature (which was very predictive in baseline) was removed entirely\n\n**Assumptions Being Made**:\n1. **Assumption**: The CV-LB gap is due to overfitting from too many features\n   - **Reality**: Could also be due to distribution shift between train/test, or the validation scheme not matching the test set structure\n2. **Assumption**: Simpler model = better generalization\n   - **Reality**: Not always true - sometimes more features with proper regularization works better\n\n**Blind Spots**:\n1. **No LB validation**: The experiment was not submitted. We have 7 submissions remaining. Without submitting, we can't verify if the simpler model actually reduces the gap.\n2. **Title feature dropped**: The Title feature was highly predictive (0.08 importance in baseline) and captures both sex and social status. Dropping it entirely may hurt performance.\n3. **Ensemble methods still unexplored**: The strategy notes indicate ensembles achieve 0.808 LB (top 9%), but no ensemble has been tried yet.\n4. **Distribution analysis incomplete**: The data_findings mention Embarked distribution differs between train and test (C: 24.4% test vs 18.9% train). This could explain part of the gap, but hasn't been addressed.\n\n**Trajectory**: The direction is reasonable (addressing overfitting), but the execution is incomplete. Without a submission, we're flying blind. The researcher needs to close the feedback loop.\n\n## What's Working\n\n1. **Leakage fix**: Computing Age imputation from train-only is correct and important\n2. **Ablation study**: Testing 6 vs 7 features shows methodical thinking\n3. **Conservative hyperparameters**: max_depth=5, min_samples_leaf=5 are appropriately regularized\n4. **Lower CV variance**: \u00b10.0148 vs \u00b10.024 suggests more stable predictions\n5. **Problem identification**: Recognizing the CV-LB gap as a problem worth addressing\n\n## Key Concerns\n\n1. **Observation**: The experiment was not submitted to Kaggle\n   - **Why it matters**: The entire hypothesis (simpler model = smaller CV-LB gap) remains unvalidated. We're making decisions based on CV scores alone, which we already know don't translate well to LB for this problem.\n   - **Suggestion**: Submit this model immediately. With 7 submissions remaining, we can afford to test this hypothesis. If the gap shrinks significantly, the approach is validated. If not, we need to reconsider.\n\n2. **Observation**: Title feature was completely removed\n   - **Why it matters**: Title captures both sex AND social status (Mr vs Master, Mrs vs Miss). In the baseline, it had 0.08 importance. The simpler model relies entirely on Sex_Code (0.48 importance), losing the nuance that Title provides.\n   - **Suggestion**: Consider a middle ground: keep Title but drop other engineered features (Has_Cabin, Deck, Name_length). This preserves the most valuable feature engineering while reducing complexity.\n\n3. **Observation**: The survival rate in submission (31.3%) is notably lower than training (38.4%)\n   - **Why it matters**: This could indicate the model is being overly conservative, or there's a genuine distribution shift. The baseline submission had 37.6% survival rate.\n   - **Suggestion**: Investigate why the simpler model predicts fewer survivors. Are there specific passenger groups being misclassified?\n\n4. **Observation**: Ensemble methods remain unexplored despite strong evidence they work\n   - **Why it matters**: The strategy notes cite stacking achieving 0.808 LB (top 9%). This is a proven approach for Titanic that hasn't been tried.\n   - **Suggestion**: After validating the current hypothesis with a submission, implement a voting ensemble or stacking approach.\n\n## Top Priority for Next Experiment\n\n**Submit the current simple RF model to Kaggle to validate the hypothesis, then make a decision based on the result.**\n\nThe entire premise of this experiment is that simpler models will have a smaller CV-LB gap. Without submitting, we're guessing. Here's the decision tree:\n\n- **If LB improves significantly (e.g., >0.77)**: The hypothesis is validated. Continue with simpler models, but consider adding back Title feature as a middle ground.\n- **If LB stays similar or worsens**: The problem isn't just overfitting from features. Consider:\n  - Distribution shift between train/test (Embarked differences noted)\n  - Ensemble methods to reduce variance\n  - Different validation strategy (e.g., repeated CV with different seeds)\n\n**Secondary priority**: If the simple model validates well, implement a voting ensemble with diverse base models (RF, LogisticRegression, SVC, GradientBoosting) using the same simple feature set. This combines the benefits of simplicity with ensemble robustness.\n\n**Important context reminder**: The target of 1.0 (100% accuracy) is impossible. State-of-the-art for Titanic is 81-85% accuracy. The current CV of 0.8238 is reasonable. Focus on closing the CV-LB gap rather than maximizing CV score.\n",

      "feedback": "## What I Understood\n\nThe junior researcher followed my previous feedback to implement an ensemble approach, adding back the Title feature (which I suggested preserving) and combining 4 diverse models (RF, LogisticRegression, GradientBoosting, SVC) with soft voting. The hypothesis was that ensemble diversity would improve generalization while keeping the model relatively simple (8 features vs 13 in baseline). The CV score of 0.8328 \u00b1 0.0105 shows lower variance than previous experiments, suggesting more stable predictions.\n\n## Technical Execution Assessment\n\n**Validation**: Sound methodology. Stratified 5-fold CV is appropriate. The fold variance (\u00b10.0105) is the lowest across all experiments, suggesting the ensemble is indeed more stable. Individual fold scores [0.8436, 0.8202, 0.8202, 0.8371, 0.8427] show reasonable consistency.\n\n**Leakage Risk**: None detected. The implementation correctly:\n- Fits StandardScaler on training fold only, transforms validation and test\n- Computes Age imputation medians from training data only (by Title and Pclass)\n- Uses consistent encoding mappings across train/test\n\n**Score Integrity**: Verified in notebook output:\n- CV accuracy: 0.8328 \u00b1 0.0105\n- Individual model CVs: RF=0.8305, LR=0.8103, GB=0.8384, SVC=0.8350\n- Submission: 418 rows, 157 survivors (37.6% survival rate)\n\n**Code Quality**: Good. Clean implementation, proper random seeds (42), proper scaling for LR/SVC, no silent failures. The individual model tracking is a nice addition for understanding ensemble behavior.\n\nVerdict: **TRUSTWORTHY** - Results can be relied upon for decision-making.\n\n## Strategic Assessment\n\n**Approach Fit**: The ensemble approach is well-motivated and follows proven Kaggle patterns. However, there's a critical concern: the survival rate (37.6%) matches the XGBoost baseline exactly (157 survivors), which got LB 0.7584. The Simple RF with 131 survivors (31.3%) got LB 0.7775. This pattern strongly suggests the test set has a lower survival rate than the training set.\n\n**Effort Allocation**: Mixed. The researcher correctly implemented an ensemble (which I suggested), but:\n1. **Critical miss**: The experiment was NOT submitted to Kaggle. We still have 6 submissions remaining.\n2. **Pattern ignored**: The data_findings clearly show that the Simple RF's lower survival rate correlated with better LB performance. This experiment predicts MORE survivors, not fewer.\n\n**Assumptions Being Made**:\n1. **Assumption**: Higher CV = better LB\n   - **Reality**: The evidence contradicts this. Simple RF (CV 0.8238) beat XGBoost (CV 0.8316) on LB by 2.5%.\n2. **Assumption**: Ensemble diversity improves generalization\n   - **Reality**: True in general, but the ensemble is predicting the same survival rate as the overfitting baseline.\n\n**Blind Spots**:\n1. **Survival rate calibration**: The most actionable insight from previous experiments is that lower survival rate predictions perform better on LB. This experiment ignores that signal.\n2. **Threshold tuning**: The model uses 0.5 threshold for binary predictions. Given the survival rate pattern, a higher threshold (e.g., 0.55-0.60) might improve LB.\n3. **No submission**: We can't validate any hypothesis without submitting.\n\n**Trajectory**: The ensemble implementation is technically sound, but strategically misaligned with the key insight from previous experiments. The researcher is optimizing CV score when the evidence suggests optimizing for survival rate calibration matters more.\n\n## What's Working\n\n1. **Ensemble implementation**: Clean, correct implementation with proper scaling and CV\n2. **Lower variance**: \u00b10.0105 is the most stable CV across all experiments\n3. **Title feature restored**: Good decision to keep this predictive feature\n4. **Model diversity**: Using 4 different model families (tree-based, linear, kernel) is appropriate\n5. **Individual model tracking**: Useful for understanding which models contribute most\n\n## Key Concerns\n\n1. **Observation**: The survival rate (37.6%) matches the XGBoost baseline exactly\n   - **Why it matters**: XGBoost got LB 0.7584. Simple RF with 31.3% survival rate got LB 0.7775. The pattern is clear: lower survival rate predictions perform better on LB. This ensemble is likely to perform similarly to the baseline.\n   - **Suggestion**: Try adjusting the prediction threshold from 0.5 to 0.55 or 0.60 to reduce predicted survivors. Alternatively, weight the ensemble toward the more conservative models.\n\n2. **Observation**: Experiment was NOT submitted to Kaggle\n   - **Why it matters**: We have 6 submissions remaining. Without submitting, we can't validate whether the ensemble improves LB. The entire feedback loop is broken.\n   - **Suggestion**: Submit this model immediately to get LB feedback. Then iterate based on results.\n\n3. **Observation**: The ensemble CV (0.8328) is slightly LOWER than GradientBoosting alone (0.8384)\n   - **Why it matters**: The ensemble isn't outperforming its best component. This suggests the models might be too correlated or the weighting isn't optimal.\n   - **Suggestion**: Consider weighted voting based on individual model CV scores, or try stacking instead of voting.\n\n4. **Observation**: LogisticRegression is the weakest model (0.8103) but has equal weight\n   - **Why it matters**: In soft voting, all models contribute equally. LR might be dragging down the ensemble.\n   - **Suggestion**: Either remove LR or use weighted voting with lower weight for LR.\n\n## Top Priority for Next Experiment\n\n**Submit this model AND a threshold-adjusted version to test the survival rate hypothesis.**\n\nHere's the concrete plan:\n1. **Submit current ensemble** (37.6% survival rate) - expect LB ~0.76-0.78\n2. **Create threshold-adjusted version**: Use threshold 0.55 or 0.60 instead of 0.5 to reduce predicted survivors to ~31-33%\n3. **Submit threshold-adjusted version** - if the survival rate hypothesis is correct, this should improve LB\n\nIf both submissions confirm the pattern (lower survival rate = better LB), then:\n- Focus on calibrating predictions rather than maximizing CV\n- Consider ensemble methods that naturally predict fewer survivors\n- Investigate why the test set appears to have lower survival rate than training\n\n**Alternative high-value experiment**: If you want to try something different, implement stacking (which the strategy notes say achieved 0.808 LB) with out-of-fold predictions as meta-features. This is a proven approach for Titanic.\n\n**Important reminder**: The target of 1.0 (100% accuracy) is impossible. State-of-the-art for Titanic is 81-85% accuracy. Current best LB is 0.7775. Focus on incremental improvements and understanding the CV-LB gap rather than chasing perfect scores.\n",

      "feedback": "## What I Understood\n\nThe junior researcher directly followed my previous feedback to implement threshold tuning on the voting ensemble. The hypothesis being tested is that the test set has a lower survival rate than the training set, based on evidence that Simple RF (31.3% survival rate) achieved LB 0.7775 while XGBoost (37.6% survival rate) got LB 0.7584. By adjusting the prediction threshold from 0.5 to 0.608, they reduced predicted survivors from 157 to 130 (31.1%), matching the Simple RF's survival rate. This is a well-reasoned experiment that tests a specific, data-driven hypothesis.\n\n## Technical Execution Assessment\n\n**Validation**: Sound methodology. The implementation correctly:\n- Uses Stratified 5-fold CV with random_state=42 for reproducibility\n- Generates out-of-fold (OOF) predictions to evaluate threshold impact on training data\n- Averages test predictions across all 5 folds (proper ensemble averaging)\n- Fits StandardScaler on training fold only, transforms validation and test separately\n\n**Leakage Risk**: None detected. The preprocessing pipeline correctly:\n- Computes age imputation medians from training data only (by Title and Pclass)\n- Applies consistent encoding mappings across train/test\n- No information from validation folds leaks into training\n\n**Score Integrity**: Verified in notebook output:\n- CV accuracy at threshold 0.5: 0.8328\n- CV accuracy at threshold 0.608: 0.8373 (IMPROVED by 0.45%)\n- Submission: 418 rows, 130 survivors (31.1% survival rate)\n- Files verified: submission.csv and candidate_003.csv both have 419 lines (418 data + header)\n\n**Code Quality**: Excellent. Clean implementation with:\n- Binary search to find optimal threshold (elegant approach)\n- Detailed analysis of changed passengers (24F, 3M; 26 from Pclass 3)\n- Probability distribution analysis of borderline cases\n- Clear experiment summary with comparisons to previous models\n\nVerdict: **TRUSTWORTHY** - Results can be relied upon for decision-making.\n\n## Strategic Assessment\n\n**Approach Fit**: Excellent. This experiment directly tests the key insight from previous experiments - that survival rate calibration matters more than CV score. The approach is well-motivated by empirical evidence (Simple RF outperformed XGBoost on LB despite lower CV).\n\n**Effort Allocation**: Good. The researcher is:\n- Testing a specific, actionable hypothesis rather than blindly tuning\n- Analyzing WHO is being reclassified (3rd class females) to understand the model's behavior\n- Building on previous work rather than starting from scratch\n\n**Key Insight Discovered**: The OOF accuracy IMPROVED from 0.8328 to 0.8373 when using threshold 0.608. This is counterintuitive but important - it suggests the model's probability calibration at 0.5 is suboptimal even for the training data. The model is slightly overconfident about survival for borderline cases.\n\n**Assumptions Being Validated**:\n1. **Assumption**: Test set has lower survival rate than training set\n   - **Evidence**: The 27 passengers changed from survived\u2192died are mostly 3rd class females (24F, 26 from Pclass 3, mean probability 0.56). This is consistent with the hypothesis that 3rd class females in the test set survived at lower rates than in training.\n   \n2. **Assumption**: Matching Simple RF's survival rate will yield similar LB performance\n   - **Status**: Needs validation via submission\n\n**Blind Spots**:\n1. **No submission yet**: This is the critical gap. The experiment generates a testable prediction but doesn't submit it. We have 6 submissions remaining.\n2. **Threshold 0.55 finding**: The notebook shows threshold 0.55 gives BEST OOF accuracy (0.8418) with 144 survivors (34.4%). This wasn't explored further - it might be a sweet spot between the two extremes.\n\n**Trajectory**: This is excellent progress. The researcher is:\n- Following the feedback loop correctly\n- Building understanding of the train/test distribution shift\n- Making data-driven decisions\n\n## What's Working\n\n1. **Hypothesis-driven experimentation**: Testing a specific, falsifiable hypothesis rather than random tuning\n2. **Detailed analysis**: Understanding WHO is being reclassified provides insight into the distribution shift\n3. **OOF validation**: Using out-of-fold predictions to evaluate threshold impact is the right approach\n4. **Matching target survival rate**: 130 survivors (31.1%) closely matches Simple RF's 131 (31.3%)\n5. **Unexpected finding**: OOF accuracy improved with higher threshold - this is valuable information about model calibration\n\n## Key Concerns\n\n1. **Observation**: Experiment was NOT submitted to Kaggle\n   - **Why it matters**: We have 6 submissions remaining and a clear hypothesis to test. The entire feedback loop is blocked until we get LB feedback.\n   - **Suggestion**: Submit immediately. Expected LB is ~0.77-0.78 if hypothesis is correct.\n\n2. **Observation**: Threshold 0.55 gives best OOF accuracy (0.8418) but wasn't selected\n   - **Why it matters**: The researcher chose threshold 0.608 to match Simple RF's survival rate, but threshold 0.55 (144 survivors, 34.4%) has the best OOF accuracy. This is a middle ground that might perform well on LB.\n   - **Suggestion**: Consider creating a second submission with threshold 0.55 to test whether OOF accuracy or survival rate matching is more predictive of LB performance.\n\n3. **Observation**: 15 predictions differ between Simple RF and threshold-tuned ensemble\n   - **Why it matters**: Despite similar survival rates (131 vs 130), the models disagree on 15 passengers. If Simple RF got those 15 right and the ensemble gets them wrong, LB could be worse.\n   - **Suggestion**: Analyze which passengers differ and whether the ensemble's probabilities for those cases are confident or borderline.\n\n4. **Observation**: Target score of 1.0 is impossible\n   - **Why it matters**: The target score to beat is 1.0 (100% accuracy), which is not achievable. State-of-the-art for Titanic is 81-85% accuracy. Current best LB is 0.7775.\n   - **Suggestion**: Focus on incremental improvements. Getting to 0.80+ would be excellent. The current approach is sound - just need to validate via submission.\n\n## Top Priority for Next Experiment\n\n**SUBMIT THIS MODEL IMMEDIATELY to validate the survival rate hypothesis.**\n\nThe experiment is complete and well-executed. The only missing piece is LB feedback. Here's the action plan:\n\n1. **Submit candidate_003.csv** (threshold 0.608, 130 survivors, 31.1% survival rate)\n   - Expected LB: ~0.77-0.78 if hypothesis correct\n   - This tests: Does matching Simple RF's survival rate yield similar LB performance?\n\n2. **If LB confirms hypothesis** (score ~0.77-0.78):\n   - The distribution shift is real - test set has fewer 3rd class female survivors\n   - Next step: Try stacking (proven to achieve 0.808 LB) with threshold calibration\n   - Consider ensemble of Simple RF + threshold-tuned voting classifier\n\n3. **If LB disappoints** (score < 0.77):\n   - The 15 different predictions from Simple RF might be hurting performance\n   - Analyze those specific passengers\n   - Consider blending Simple RF with threshold-tuned ensemble\n\n**Alternative submission to consider**: Create a submission with threshold 0.55 (best OOF accuracy 0.8418, 144 survivors). This tests whether OOF accuracy or survival rate matching is more predictive of LB performance. With 6 submissions remaining, we can afford to test both hypotheses.\n\n**Important context**: The target of 1.0 is not achievable. Current best LB is 0.7775. A score of 0.78+ would be competitive. Focus on understanding the train/test distribution shift and calibrating predictions accordingly.\n",

      "feedback": "## What I Understood\n\nThe junior researcher implemented a stacking ensemble following my previous recommendation to try the approach from the reference kernel (arthurtok) that achieved 0.808 LB. The implementation uses 5 base models (RandomForest, ExtraTrees, AdaBoost, GradientBoosting, SVC) with out-of-fold predictions to avoid leakage, then an XGBoost meta-learner on the stacked predictions. They applied threshold tuning (0.615) to achieve ~31% survival rate, matching the pattern that worked well on previous submissions. This is a well-reasoned progression from the previous experiments.\n\n## Technical Execution Assessment\n\n**Validation**: Sound methodology. The implementation correctly:\n- Uses Stratified 5-fold CV with random_state=42 for reproducibility\n- Generates out-of-fold (OOF) predictions for base models to avoid leakage in stacking\n- Trains meta-learner on OOF predictions (proper stacking protocol)\n- Averages test predictions across all 5 folds for each base model\n- Fits StandardScaler on training fold only for SVC (correct handling)\n\n**Leakage Risk**: None detected. The stacking implementation is correct:\n- Base model OOF predictions are generated per-fold (no leakage)\n- Meta-learner is trained on OOF predictions, not on training predictions\n- Age imputation uses medians computed from training data only\n- The two-level CV is properly nested\n\n**Score Integrity**: Verified in notebook output:\n- Base model OOF accuracies: RF=0.8339, ET=0.8238, Ada=0.8204, GB=0.8159, SVC=0.7957\n- Meta-learner CV at threshold 0.5: 0.8496 (+/- 0.0136)\n- Meta-learner CV at threshold 0.615: 0.8373\n- Fold scores: 0.8603, 0.8371, 0.8427, 0.8371, 0.8708\n- Submission: 418 rows, 131 survivors (31.3%)\n\n**Code Quality**: Good implementation with:\n- Proper OOF prediction function with scaling option\n- Binary search for optimal threshold\n- Clear experiment summary\n- Files verified: submission.csv has 419 lines (418 data + header)\n\nVerdict: **TRUSTWORTHY** - Results can be relied upon for decision-making.\n\n## Strategic Assessment\n\n**Approach Fit**: Good. Stacking is a proven technique for Titanic (reference kernel achieved 0.808 LB). The implementation follows the established pattern. However, there's a concerning observation: the meta-learner CV at threshold 0.5 (0.8496) is higher than the threshold-tuned CV (0.8373), but the researcher chose to use threshold 0.615 to match the ~31% survival rate pattern. This is a reasonable choice based on previous LB feedback, but it means we're sacrificing OOF accuracy for survival rate calibration.\n\n**Effort Allocation**: Reasonable. The researcher is:\n- Building on proven approaches (reference kernel)\n- Applying lessons learned (survival rate calibration)\n- Using proper stacking methodology\n\nHowever, I'm concerned that the stacking model at threshold 0.615 produces the SAME CV score (0.8373) as the threshold-tuned voting ensemble. This suggests the stacking may not be adding value over the simpler approach.\n\n**Key Observations**:\n1. **Stacking CV at threshold 0.5 = 0.8496** - This is the highest CV we've seen\n2. **Stacking CV at threshold 0.615 = 0.8373** - Same as threshold-tuned ensemble\n3. **15 predictions differ** between stacking and threshold-tuned ensemble\n4. **Both have ~31% survival rate** (131 vs 130 survivors)\n\n**Assumptions Being Made**:\n1. **Assumption**: Survival rate calibration (~31%) is more important than CV accuracy\n   - **Evidence**: Previous experiments showed lower survival rate predictions performed better on LB\n   - **Risk**: We might be over-calibrating. The optimal threshold might be between 0.5 and 0.615\n\n2. **Assumption**: Stacking will improve LB over voting ensemble\n   - **Status**: Unvalidated. The CV scores are identical at the calibrated threshold.\n\n**Blind Spots**:\n1. **No submission yet**: This is the critical gap. We have 5 submissions remaining and haven't validated the stacking approach.\n2. **Threshold 0.5 not explored**: The stacking model at threshold 0.5 has CV 0.8496 with 133 survivors (31.8%). This is very close to the target survival rate but with higher CV. Worth considering.\n3. **Base model diversity**: All 5 base models are tree-based or ensemble methods. Adding a linear model (LogisticRegression) or neural network might improve diversity.\n\n**Trajectory**: The experiments are showing diminishing returns:\n- exp_000: CV 0.8316, LB 0.7584 (baseline)\n- exp_001: CV 0.8238, LB 0.7775 (+1.9% LB improvement)\n- exp_003: CV 0.8373, LB 0.7847 (+0.7% LB improvement)\n- exp_004: CV 0.8373, LB ??? (same CV as exp_003)\n\nThe CV-LB gap has narrowed from 7.3% to 5.3%, which is good. But we're now at a plateau where CV improvements aren't translating to LB improvements.\n\n## What's Working\n\n1. **Proper stacking implementation**: OOF predictions avoid leakage, meta-learner is correctly trained\n2. **Survival rate calibration**: Applying the lesson that ~31% survival rate works better on LB\n3. **Systematic experimentation**: Building on previous findings rather than random exploration\n4. **Reference kernel approach**: Following proven methodology from top solutions\n\n## Key Concerns\n\n1. **Observation**: Stacking CV at threshold 0.615 (0.8373) is identical to threshold-tuned voting ensemble\n   - **Why it matters**: If the CV scores are the same, stacking may not provide any advantage. The 15 different predictions could go either way on LB.\n   - **Suggestion**: Consider submitting the stacking model at threshold 0.5 (CV 0.8496, 133 survivors) as an alternative. This tests whether the higher CV or the exact survival rate matching is more predictive.\n\n2. **Observation**: No submission has been made for this experiment\n   - **Why it matters**: We have 5 submissions remaining and need LB feedback to validate the approach. The stacking model is ready but unsubmitted.\n   - **Suggestion**: Submit immediately. With 5 submissions left, we can afford to test this.\n\n3. **Observation**: The 15 different predictions between stacking and threshold-tuned ensemble are unanalyzed\n   - **Why it matters**: These 15 passengers will determine whether stacking outperforms the previous best. Understanding who they are could inform whether to expect improvement.\n   - **Suggestion**: Analyze the 15 differing passengers (IDs: 896, 910, 913, 924, 961, 1045, 1084, 1089, 1092, 1098, 1117, 1175, 1197, 1199, 1284). Are they borderline cases? What are their characteristics?\n\n4. **Observation**: Target score of 1.0 is impossible\n   - **Why it matters**: The target to beat is 1.0 (100% accuracy), which is not achievable. State-of-the-art for Titanic is 81-85% accuracy. Current best LB is 0.7847.\n   - **Suggestion**: Reframe success as incremental improvement. Getting to 0.80+ would be excellent. Focus on understanding the train/test distribution shift.\n\n## Top Priority for Next Experiment\n\n**SUBMIT THE STACKING MODEL to validate whether it improves over threshold-tuned ensemble.**\n\nThe experiment is complete and well-executed. The critical next step is LB feedback. Here's the action plan:\n\n1. **Submit candidate_004.csv** (stacking, threshold 0.615, 131 survivors, 31.3%)\n   - Expected LB: ~0.78-0.79 (similar to threshold-tuned ensemble)\n   - This tests: Does stacking improve over voting ensemble when both are calibrated to ~31% survival rate?\n\n2. **If LB improves** (score > 0.7847):\n   - Stacking adds value - continue refining the stacking approach\n   - Consider adding more diverse base models (LogisticRegression, neural network)\n   - Try different meta-learners (LightGBM, CatBoost)\n\n3. **If LB is similar or worse** (score \u2264 0.7847):\n   - Stacking doesn't add value over simpler ensemble at this calibration\n   - Consider: Submit stacking at threshold 0.5 (CV 0.8496, 133 survivors) to test if higher CV matters more than exact survival rate matching\n   - Alternative: Focus on feature engineering or different model architectures\n\n**Alternative submission to consider**: The stacking model at threshold 0.5 has the highest CV we've seen (0.8496) with 133 survivors (31.8%). This is still close to the target survival rate. If the current submission doesn't improve LB, try this variant next.\n\n**Important context**: We're at a plateau. The last two experiments have the same CV (0.8373). Breaking through may require:\n- Different feature engineering (ticket prefixes, family survival rates, cabin deck)\n- Different model architectures (neural networks, CatBoost)\n- Ensemble blending with different weights\n- Analyzing the specific passengers where models disagree\n\nThe current approach is sound but may be reaching its ceiling. After getting LB feedback on stacking, consider pivoting to feature engineering if no improvement is seen.\n",

      "feedback": "## What I Understood\n\nThe junior researcher pivoted from stacking (which failed on LB despite matching CV) to feature engineering. They added 5 new features to the threshold-tuned voting ensemble: FamilySize, IsAlone, Has_Cabin, TicketFreq, and FareBin. The hypothesis was that proven feature engineering would improve generalization better than complex model architectures. This is a sound strategic pivot based on the lesson that stacking (exp_004) achieved the same CV as the simpler approach (exp_003) but performed worse on LB (0.7631 vs 0.7847).\n\n## Technical Execution Assessment\n\n**Validation**: Sound methodology. 5-fold Stratified CV with random_state=42 for reproducibility. OOF predictions used correctly for threshold tuning. Fold scores verified: [0.8324, 0.8258, 0.8315, 0.8371, 0.8483] with mean 0.8350 (+/- 0.0075).\n\n**Leakage Risk**: MINOR CONCERN with TicketFreq feature.\n- TicketFreq is computed using combined train+test ticket counts\n- This means test data information leaks into the feature\n- 23% of training rows have different TicketFreq values when computed from train-only vs combined\n- Correlation with survival: 0.065 (combined) vs 0.038 (train-only)\n- **Impact assessment**: The leakage is subtle and the feature has weak correlation. It may slightly inflate CV but is unlikely to cause major issues. However, it's worth noting for future experiments.\n\n**Score Integrity**: Verified in notebook output and independently confirmed:\n- CV at threshold 0.5: 0.8350 \u2713\n- OOF accuracy at threshold 0.621: 0.8395 \u2713\n- Submission: 418 rows, 131 survivors (31.3%) \u2713\n\n**Code Quality**: Good implementation with proper preprocessing, threshold tuning, and clear experiment summary. Age imputation uses train-only medians (correct). Fare imputation uses train median (correct). FareBin uses fixed bins derived from training quartiles (correct).\n\nVerdict: **TRUSTWORTHY** - Minor TicketFreq leakage concern but unlikely to significantly affect results.\n\n## Strategic Assessment\n\n**Approach Fit**: EXCELLENT strategic pivot. The researcher correctly identified that:\n1. Stacking failed despite matching CV (0.8373 \u2192 LB 0.7631)\n2. Simpler models with proper calibration work better (exp_003 LB 0.7847)\n3. Feature engineering is a higher-leverage improvement than model complexity\n\nThe new features (FamilySize, IsAlone, Has_Cabin, FareBin) are all proven Titanic features from top solutions. This is exactly the right direction.\n\n**Effort Allocation**: Well-prioritized. The researcher is:\n- Building on the best-performing approach (threshold-tuned voting ensemble)\n- Adding features with known predictive power\n- Maintaining the ~31% survival rate calibration that worked on LB\n\n**Assumptions Being Made**:\n1. **Assumption**: CV improvement (0.8373 \u2192 0.8395) will translate to LB improvement\n   - **Risk**: Previous experiments showed CV is not reliable (same CV gave LB 0.7847 vs 0.7631)\n   - **Mitigation**: The approach is simpler than stacking, which should help generalization\n\n2. **Assumption**: ~31% survival rate is optimal for LB\n   - **Evidence**: Strong. Multiple experiments confirmed this pattern.\n   - **Status**: Validated\n\n**Blind Spots**:\n1. **TicketFreq leakage**: Should be computed from train-only data in future experiments\n2. **Feature interactions**: The new features may have interactions (e.g., FamilySize \u00d7 Pclass) that aren't being captured\n3. **Cabin deck extraction**: Has_Cabin is binary, but deck letter (A, B, C, etc.) could provide more signal\n\n**Trajectory**: PROMISING. The experiment shows:\n- CV improved from 0.8373 to 0.8395 (+0.22%)\n- Approach is simpler than stacking (which failed)\n- Only 9 predictions differ from best LB submission\n- The changes are interpretable (IsAlone, FamilySize affecting 3rd class passengers)\n\n## What's Working\n\n1. **Strategic pivot from complexity to features**: Correct lesson learned from stacking failure\n2. **Threshold calibration**: Maintaining ~31% survival rate that works on LB\n3. **Proven feature engineering**: Using features from top Titanic solutions\n4. **Systematic comparison**: Comparing 8-feature vs 13-feature models to isolate improvement\n5. **Interpretable changes**: The 9 differing predictions are explainable by the new features\n\n## Key Concerns\n\n1. **Observation**: TicketFreq is computed using combined train+test data\n   - **Why it matters**: This is a subtle form of data leakage that could inflate CV\n   - **Suggestion**: In future experiments, compute TicketFreq from train-only data. For test passengers with unseen tickets, use a default value (e.g., 1).\n\n2. **Observation**: CV improvement is small (+0.22%) and CV has been unreliable\n   - **Why it matters**: Same CV (0.8373) gave LB 0.7847 vs 0.7631 in previous experiments\n   - **Suggestion**: Submit to get LB feedback. The simpler approach should generalize better than stacking.\n\n3. **Observation**: Only 9 predictions differ from best LB submission (exp_003)\n   - **Why it matters**: The LB improvement will depend on whether these 9 changes are correct\n   - **Analysis**: \n     - exp_005 predicts survival for 5 passengers exp_003 predicted dead (4 female alone travelers)\n     - exp_005 predicts death for 4 passengers exp_003 predicted survived (3 female with families, 1 male child)\n   - **Insight**: The IsAlone feature is driving these changes. Alone 3rd class females are now predicted to survive, while 3rd class females with families are predicted to die. This aligns with historical patterns (alone travelers had more mobility during evacuation).\n\n4. **Observation**: Target score of 1.0 is impossible\n   - **Why it matters**: State-of-the-art for Titanic is 81-85% accuracy. Current best LB is 0.7847.\n   - **Suggestion**: Reframe success as incremental improvement. Getting to 0.80+ would be excellent.\n\n## Top Priority for Next Experiment\n\n**SUBMIT exp_005 (Feature Engineering) to validate whether the CV improvement translates to LB improvement.**\n\nThe experiment is well-executed and represents a sound strategic pivot. With 4 submissions remaining, this is worth testing. Expected outcomes:\n\n1. **If LB improves** (score > 0.7847):\n   - Feature engineering is the right direction\n   - Consider adding more features: Cabin deck, ticket prefix, family survival rate\n   - Fix TicketFreq leakage and re-test\n\n2. **If LB is similar** (score \u2248 0.7847):\n   - The 9 changed predictions roughly cancel out\n   - Try different feature combinations\n   - Consider feature selection to remove noise\n\n3. **If LB is worse** (score < 0.7847):\n   - The new features may be adding noise\n   - Revert to exp_003 as baseline\n   - Try adding features one at a time to isolate which help\n\n**Secondary recommendation**: After getting LB feedback, fix the TicketFreq leakage by computing it from train-only data. This is a minor issue but worth correcting for cleaner experiments.\n\n**Note on target**: The target of 1.0 (100% accuracy) is not achievable for Titanic. The current best LB of 0.7847 is competitive (top ~20% on the leaderboard). Focus on incremental improvements toward 0.80+.\n",
