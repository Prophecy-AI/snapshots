    "### Key Findings:\n",
    "1. **Stacking FAILED**: Same CV (0.8373) but LB dropped from 0.7847 to 0.7631 (-2.16%)\n",
    "2. **Simpler is better**: Threshold-Tuned Ensemble outperforms complex stacking\n",
    "3. **CV-LB gap increased**: From 5.26% to 7.42% with stacking (more overfitting)\n",
    "4. **Survival rate alone isn't enough**: Both had ~31% but different LB scores\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommended Next Steps:\n",
    "1. **Abandon stacking** - It doesn't help for this dataset\n",
    "2. **Focus on Threshold-Tuned Ensemble** - Current best at LB 0.7847\n",
    "3. **Try weighted blending** - Combine best models with LB-based weights\n",
    "4. **Feature engineering** - Add FamilySize, IsAlone, Has_Cabin\n",
    "5. **Analyze disagreement patterns** - Understand where models differ\n",

    "- 4 submissions remaining\n",
    "- Best LB: 0.7847 (exp_003)\n",
