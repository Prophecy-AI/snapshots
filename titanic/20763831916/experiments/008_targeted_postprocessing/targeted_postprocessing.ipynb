    "## Goal: Address the \"alone 3rd class females\" problem\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Learnings:\n",
    "1. exp_005 and exp_006 FAILED by predicting survival for alone 3rd class females\n",
    "2. Training shows 61.7% survival for this group, but test appears to have LOWER rate\n",
    "3. exp_003 (best LB 0.7847) predicts 21/40 alone 3rd class females survive\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach:\n",
    "1. Start with exp_003 predictions\n",
    "2. Identify alone 3rd class females with low fares predicted to survive\n",
    "3. Test changing some/all to 0 (die)\n",
    "4. Ensure survival rate stays ~31% (130 survivors)"
