## What I Understood

The junior researcher observed a significant CV-LB gap in the first experiment (CV 0.8316 vs LB 0.7584 = 7.3% gap) and hypothesized that overfitting was the cause. To address this, they implemented a simpler model: Random Forest with only 7 core features (Pclass, Sex_Code, Age, SibSp, Parch, Fare, Embarked_Code) instead of the 13 engineered features from the baseline. They also fixed a potential leakage issue by computing Age imputation medians from training data only. The result was CV 0.8238 ± 0.0148 - lower CV but with the expectation of a smaller CV-LB gap.

## Technical Execution Assessment

**Validation**: Sound methodology. Stratified 5-fold CV is appropriate. The fold variance (±0.0148) is reasonable and actually lower than the baseline (±0.024), suggesting more stable predictions. The fold scores [0.8492, 0.8146, 0.8090, 0.8146, 0.8315] show reasonable variance.

**Leakage Risk**: Improved from baseline. The researcher correctly identified and fixed the Age imputation leakage - now computing medians from training data only (grouped by Sex and Pclass). This is good practice. Embarked and Fare imputation also use train-only statistics.

**Score Integrity**: Verified. The notebook output shows:
- 6-feature CV: 0.8114 ± 0.0163
- 7-feature CV: 0.8238 ± 0.0148 (selected)
- Submission file: 418 rows, correct format, survival rate 31.3%

**Code Quality**: Good. Clean implementation, proper random seeds (42), no silent failures. The comparison between 6 and 7 features is a nice ablation study.

Verdict: **TRUSTWORTHY** - Results can be relied upon for decision-making.

## Strategic Assessment

**Approach Fit**: The hypothesis (simpler model = smaller CV-LB gap) is reasonable but **not yet validated**. The experiment was not submitted to Kaggle, so we don't know if the simpler model actually reduces the gap. This is a critical missing piece of information.

**Effort Allocation**: Mixed. The researcher is addressing a real problem (the 7.3% CV-LB gap is concerning), but:
1. They haven't submitted this model to verify the hypothesis
2. The approach of "fewer features" may be throwing away valuable signal
3. The Title feature (which was very predictive in baseline) was removed entirely

**Assumptions Being Made**:
1. **Assumption**: The CV-LB gap is due to overfitting from too many features
   - **Reality**: Could also be due to distribution shift between train/test, or the validation scheme not matching the test set structure
2. **Assumption**: Simpler model = better generalization
   - **Reality**: Not always true - sometimes more features with proper regularization works better

**Blind Spots**:
1. **No LB validation**: The experiment was not submitted. We have 7 submissions remaining. Without submitting, we can't verify if the simpler model actually reduces the gap.
2. **Title feature dropped**: The Title feature was highly predictive (0.08 importance in baseline) and captures both sex and social status. Dropping it entirely may hurt performance.
3. **Ensemble methods still unexplored**: The strategy notes indicate ensembles achieve 0.808 LB (top 9%), but no ensemble has been tried yet.
4. **Distribution analysis incomplete**: The data_findings mention Embarked distribution differs between train and test (C: 24.4% test vs 18.9% train). This could explain part of the gap, but hasn't been addressed.

**Trajectory**: The direction is reasonable (addressing overfitting), but the execution is incomplete. Without a submission, we're flying blind. The researcher needs to close the feedback loop.

## What's Working

1. **Leakage fix**: Computing Age imputation from train-only is correct and important
2. **Ablation study**: Testing 6 vs 7 features shows methodical thinking
3. **Conservative hyperparameters**: max_depth=5, min_samples_leaf=5 are appropriately regularized
4. **Lower CV variance**: ±0.0148 vs ±0.024 suggests more stable predictions
5. **Problem identification**: Recognizing the CV-LB gap as a problem worth addressing

## Key Concerns

1. **Observation**: The experiment was not submitted to Kaggle
   - **Why it matters**: The entire hypothesis (simpler model = smaller CV-LB gap) remains unvalidated. We're making decisions based on CV scores alone, which we already know don't translate well to LB for this problem.
   - **Suggestion**: Submit this model immediately. With 7 submissions remaining, we can afford to test this hypothesis. If the gap shrinks significantly, the approach is validated. If not, we need to reconsider.

2. **Observation**: Title feature was completely removed
   - **Why it matters**: Title captures both sex AND social status (Mr vs Master, Mrs vs Miss). In the baseline, it had 0.08 importance. The simpler model relies entirely on Sex_Code (0.48 importance), losing the nuance that Title provides.
   - **Suggestion**: Consider a middle ground: keep Title but drop other engineered features (Has_Cabin, Deck, Name_length). This preserves the most valuable feature engineering while reducing complexity.

3. **Observation**: The survival rate in submission (31.3%) is notably lower than training (38.4%)
   - **Why it matters**: This could indicate the model is being overly conservative, or there's a genuine distribution shift. The baseline submission had 37.6% survival rate.
   - **Suggestion**: Investigate why the simpler model predicts fewer survivors. Are there specific passenger groups being misclassified?

4. **Observation**: Ensemble methods remain unexplored despite strong evidence they work
   - **Why it matters**: The strategy notes cite stacking achieving 0.808 LB (top 9%). This is a proven approach for Titanic that hasn't been tried.
   - **Suggestion**: After validating the current hypothesis with a submission, implement a voting ensemble or stacking approach.

## Top Priority for Next Experiment

**Submit the current simple RF model to Kaggle to validate the hypothesis, then make a decision based on the result.**

The entire premise of this experiment is that simpler models will have a smaller CV-LB gap. Without submitting, we're guessing. Here's the decision tree:

- **If LB improves significantly (e.g., >0.77)**: The hypothesis is validated. Continue with simpler models, but consider adding back Title feature as a middle ground.
- **If LB stays similar or worsens**: The problem isn't just overfitting from features. Consider:
  - Distribution shift between train/test (Embarked differences noted)
  - Ensemble methods to reduce variance
  - Different validation strategy (e.g., repeated CV with different seeds)

**Secondary priority**: If the simple model validates well, implement a voting ensemble with diverse base models (RF, LogisticRegression, SVC, GradientBoosting) using the same simple feature set. This combines the benefits of simplicity with ensemble robustness.

**Important context reminder**: The target of 1.0 (100% accuracy) is impossible. State-of-the-art for Titanic is 81-85% accuracy. The current CV of 0.8238 is reasonable. Focus on closing the CV-LB gap rather than maximizing CV score.
