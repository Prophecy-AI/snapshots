## What I Understood

The junior researcher pivoted from stacking (which failed on LB despite matching CV) to feature engineering. They added 5 new features to the threshold-tuned voting ensemble: FamilySize, IsAlone, Has_Cabin, TicketFreq, and FareBin. The hypothesis was that proven feature engineering would improve generalization better than complex model architectures. This is a sound strategic pivot based on the lesson that stacking (exp_004) achieved the same CV as the simpler approach (exp_003) but performed worse on LB (0.7631 vs 0.7847).

## Technical Execution Assessment

**Validation**: Sound methodology. 5-fold Stratified CV with random_state=42 for reproducibility. OOF predictions used correctly for threshold tuning. Fold scores verified: [0.8324, 0.8258, 0.8315, 0.8371, 0.8483] with mean 0.8350 (+/- 0.0075).

**Leakage Risk**: MINOR CONCERN with TicketFreq feature.
- TicketFreq is computed using combined train+test ticket counts
- This means test data information leaks into the feature
- 23% of training rows have different TicketFreq values when computed from train-only vs combined
- Correlation with survival: 0.065 (combined) vs 0.038 (train-only)
- **Impact assessment**: The leakage is subtle and the feature has weak correlation. It may slightly inflate CV but is unlikely to cause major issues. However, it's worth noting for future experiments.

**Score Integrity**: Verified in notebook output and independently confirmed:
- CV at threshold 0.5: 0.8350 ✓
- OOF accuracy at threshold 0.621: 0.8395 ✓
- Submission: 418 rows, 131 survivors (31.3%) ✓

**Code Quality**: Good implementation with proper preprocessing, threshold tuning, and clear experiment summary. Age imputation uses train-only medians (correct). Fare imputation uses train median (correct). FareBin uses fixed bins derived from training quartiles (correct).

Verdict: **TRUSTWORTHY** - Minor TicketFreq leakage concern but unlikely to significantly affect results.

## Strategic Assessment

**Approach Fit**: EXCELLENT strategic pivot. The researcher correctly identified that:
1. Stacking failed despite matching CV (0.8373 → LB 0.7631)
2. Simpler models with proper calibration work better (exp_003 LB 0.7847)
3. Feature engineering is a higher-leverage improvement than model complexity

The new features (FamilySize, IsAlone, Has_Cabin, FareBin) are all proven Titanic features from top solutions. This is exactly the right direction.

**Effort Allocation**: Well-prioritized. The researcher is:
- Building on the best-performing approach (threshold-tuned voting ensemble)
- Adding features with known predictive power
- Maintaining the ~31% survival rate calibration that worked on LB

**Assumptions Being Made**:
1. **Assumption**: CV improvement (0.8373 → 0.8395) will translate to LB improvement
   - **Risk**: Previous experiments showed CV is not reliable (same CV gave LB 0.7847 vs 0.7631)
   - **Mitigation**: The approach is simpler than stacking, which should help generalization

2. **Assumption**: ~31% survival rate is optimal for LB
   - **Evidence**: Strong. Multiple experiments confirmed this pattern.
   - **Status**: Validated

**Blind Spots**:
1. **TicketFreq leakage**: Should be computed from train-only data in future experiments
2. **Feature interactions**: The new features may have interactions (e.g., FamilySize × Pclass) that aren't being captured
3. **Cabin deck extraction**: Has_Cabin is binary, but deck letter (A, B, C, etc.) could provide more signal

**Trajectory**: PROMISING. The experiment shows:
- CV improved from 0.8373 to 0.8395 (+0.22%)
- Approach is simpler than stacking (which failed)
- Only 9 predictions differ from best LB submission
- The changes are interpretable (IsAlone, FamilySize affecting 3rd class passengers)

## What's Working

1. **Strategic pivot from complexity to features**: Correct lesson learned from stacking failure
2. **Threshold calibration**: Maintaining ~31% survival rate that works on LB
3. **Proven feature engineering**: Using features from top Titanic solutions
4. **Systematic comparison**: Comparing 8-feature vs 13-feature models to isolate improvement
5. **Interpretable changes**: The 9 differing predictions are explainable by the new features

## Key Concerns

1. **Observation**: TicketFreq is computed using combined train+test data
   - **Why it matters**: This is a subtle form of data leakage that could inflate CV
   - **Suggestion**: In future experiments, compute TicketFreq from train-only data. For test passengers with unseen tickets, use a default value (e.g., 1).

2. **Observation**: CV improvement is small (+0.22%) and CV has been unreliable
   - **Why it matters**: Same CV (0.8373) gave LB 0.7847 vs 0.7631 in previous experiments
   - **Suggestion**: Submit to get LB feedback. The simpler approach should generalize better than stacking.

3. **Observation**: Only 9 predictions differ from best LB submission (exp_003)
   - **Why it matters**: The LB improvement will depend on whether these 9 changes are correct
   - **Analysis**: 
     - exp_005 predicts survival for 5 passengers exp_003 predicted dead (4 female alone travelers)
     - exp_005 predicts death for 4 passengers exp_003 predicted survived (3 female with families, 1 male child)
   - **Insight**: The IsAlone feature is driving these changes. Alone 3rd class females are now predicted to survive, while 3rd class females with families are predicted to die. This aligns with historical patterns (alone travelers had more mobility during evacuation).

4. **Observation**: Target score of 1.0 is impossible
   - **Why it matters**: State-of-the-art for Titanic is 81-85% accuracy. Current best LB is 0.7847.
   - **Suggestion**: Reframe success as incremental improvement. Getting to 0.80+ would be excellent.

## Top Priority for Next Experiment

**SUBMIT exp_005 (Feature Engineering) to validate whether the CV improvement translates to LB improvement.**

The experiment is well-executed and represents a sound strategic pivot. With 4 submissions remaining, this is worth testing. Expected outcomes:

1. **If LB improves** (score > 0.7847):
   - Feature engineering is the right direction
   - Consider adding more features: Cabin deck, ticket prefix, family survival rate
   - Fix TicketFreq leakage and re-test

2. **If LB is similar** (score ≈ 0.7847):
   - The 9 changed predictions roughly cancel out
   - Try different feature combinations
   - Consider feature selection to remove noise

3. **If LB is worse** (score < 0.7847):
   - The new features may be adding noise
   - Revert to exp_003 as baseline
   - Try adding features one at a time to isolate which help

**Secondary recommendation**: After getting LB feedback, fix the TicketFreq leakage by computing it from train-only data. This is a minor issue but worth correcting for cleaner experiments.

**Note on target**: The target of 1.0 (100% accuracy) is not achievable for Titanic. The current best LB of 0.7847 is competitive (top ~20% on the leaderboard). Focus on incremental improvements toward 0.80+.
