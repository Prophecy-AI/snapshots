  ],
  "overall_failure_reason": "Consensus: the agent followed a good high-level strategy (understanding the competition, exploring research assets, drafting EDA), but stalled on notebook execution due to incorrect cell indexing and repeated the same failing tool call without adapting. Additionally, it did not deliver the primary intended output (a comprehensive seed prompt / synthesized strategy), and may not have fully leveraged available research/kernels. There was mild disagreement on the overall score (0.7 vs 0.6); I resolved this by weighting the strong shared critique about repeated execution failure and missing primary deliverable, yielding an averaged/consensus score of ~0.63."
