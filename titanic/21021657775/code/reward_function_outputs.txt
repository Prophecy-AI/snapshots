      "reasoning": "All jurors agree the produced seed prompt is comprehensive and well-structured; however, one juror credibly notes minor missing top-solution details (ticket-grouping, more explicit family/name grouping), more concrete hyperparameter guidance, and that '100% accuracy' should be framed as aspirational/unrealistic for this competition."

  ],
  "overall_failure_reason": "There was disagreement: two jurors scored 1.0 with no issues, while one scored 0.85 and recommended RL triggering due to minor omissions and an unrealistic accuracy target. I resolve this by crediting the strong consensus on overall quality and tool use (no substantive methodological errors), while modestly discounting the score to reflect the well-supported minor gaps. Majority consensus does not support triggering RL; improvements are incremental rather than corrective."
