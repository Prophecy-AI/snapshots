I resolve this by crediting the strong consensus on overall quality and tool use (no substantive methodological errors), while modestly discounting the score to reflect the well-supported minor gaps. Majority consensus does not support triggering RL; improvements are incremental rather than corrective."

  "overall_failure_reason": "There is broad consensus (no material disagreement) around a solid ~0.8 performance: the agent implemented an effective baseline and followed the general strategy, but did not fully capitalize on higher-performing refinements. Key gaps include missing advanced feature engineering and stronger model families (e.g., boosting), incomplete/absent explicit experiment logging, and minor preprocessing methodology concerns (separate encoding fits; mild transductive imputation). These collectively justify TRIGGER=1 despite generally correct execution."
