## What I Understood

The junior researcher followed my previous recommendation to implement stacking after the voting ensemble showed promise (LB 0.7727). They built a proper stacking ensemble with 7 base models generating out-of-fold predictions, which were then fed to a meta-learner (tested both XGBoost and LogisticRegression). They also added two new features (Name_Length, Ticket_Frequency) based on EDA findings. The stacking approach underperformed the voting ensemble (CV 0.8293 vs 0.8372), and the researcher correctly diagnosed why: the OOF predictions are highly correlated, limiting the meta-learner's ability to learn useful combinations.

## Technical Execution Assessment

**Validation**: Sound methodology. 5-fold CV for OOF generation, 10-fold CV for meta-learner evaluation. The approach correctly avoids leakage by using out-of-fold predictions.

**Leakage Risk**: None detected. The implementation is careful:
- OOF predictions generated properly using 5-fold CV
- Ticket frequency map computed from training data only
- Age imputation medians from training data only
- Test predictions are averaged across folds (proper stacking protocol)

**Score Integrity**: Verified in notebook output:
- Stacking CV: 0.8293 (±0.0360)
- Meta XGBoost CV: 0.8260, Meta LR CV: 0.8293
- Individual base model scores reported and consistent

**Code Quality**: Clean implementation. The researcher correctly used `clone()` for meta-learner CV evaluation. Random states set consistently. One observation: the stacking uses 5-fold for OOF generation but 10-fold for meta-learner CV - this is fine but worth noting.

**Verdict: TRUSTWORTHY**

## Strategic Assessment

**Approach Fit**: The stacking approach was a reasonable next step based on reference kernels achieving 0.808 LB. However, the implementation reveals a fundamental limitation: when base models are highly correlated (all trained on the same features), their OOF predictions are also correlated, limiting the meta-learner's ability to learn useful combinations.

**Effort Allocation**: The researcher spent effort on the right things:
- Implemented stacking correctly
- Added Name_Length and Ticket_Frequency features (both have documented signal)
- Tested multiple meta-learners (XGBoost vs LR)
- Correctly diagnosed why stacking underperformed

**Assumptions**: The approach assumed stacking would outperform voting because reference kernels achieved 0.808 LB. However, those kernels may have used:
1. Different base model architectures (more diverse)
2. Original features + OOF predictions combined
3. Different hyperparameter tuning

**Blind Spots**:
1. **Stacking variant not tried**: The meta-learner only sees 7 OOF predictions. A common improvement is to concatenate original features with OOF predictions (16 + 7 = 23 features).
2. **Base model diversity**: All 7 models are trained on the same 16 features. More diversity could come from training different models on different feature subsets.
3. **The voting ensemble is still the best model** - but it hasn't been submitted since exp_001. We have only 1 submission remaining today.

**Trajectory**: This experiment was valuable for learning, even though it didn't improve scores. The researcher correctly identified why stacking underperformed and documented the insights. This is good scientific practice.

## What's Working

1. **Correct stacking implementation**: OOF predictions generated properly, no leakage.
2. **Good diagnostic analysis**: The researcher correctly identified that OOF predictions are highly correlated, limiting meta-learner effectiveness.
3. **Feature additions**: Name_Length (0.33 correlation) and Ticket_Frequency (strong non-linear signal) are well-motivated.
4. **Honest assessment**: The researcher didn't force a positive spin - they acknowledged stacking underperformed and explained why.
5. **Prediction distribution tracking**: Same as voting ensemble (255/163), showing consistency.

## Key Concerns

1. **Observation**: Stacking underperformed voting ensemble by 0.0079 CV points.
   **Why it matters**: This suggests the current stacking approach is losing information compared to simple averaging. The meta-learner only sees 7 highly correlated features.
   **Suggestion**: Try "stacking with passthrough" - concatenate original features with OOF predictions. This gives the meta-learner access to both the base model predictions AND the original signal.

2. **Observation**: Higher variance in stacking (0.0360 vs 0.0239 for voting).
   **Why it matters**: Higher variance typically correlates with worse generalization. The voting ensemble's lower variance was a key factor in its LB improvement.
   **Suggestion**: If pursuing stacking, use more regularization in the meta-learner (lower C for LR, higher gamma for XGBoost).

3. **Observation**: Only 1 submission remaining today.
   **Why it matters**: We can't validate the stacking approach on LB. The voting ensemble (exp_001) is still our best LB score (0.7727).
   **Suggestion**: Don't submit the stacking model. Save the submission for a more promising candidate.

4. **Observation**: The target of 1.0 (100% accuracy) remains unrealistic.
   **Why it matters**: Top Kaggle solutions achieve 0.80-0.82. The current best LB is 0.7727. Pursuing 100% will lead to overfitting.
   **Suggestion**: Recalibrate to a realistic target of 0.80 LB. Based on the CV-LB calibration (LB = 2.55*CV - 1.37), this requires CV ~0.85.

## Top Priority for Next Experiment

**DO NOT SUBMIT THE STACKING MODEL. IMPROVE THE VOTING ENSEMBLE INSTEAD.**

The stacking experiment was valuable for learning but didn't improve results. The voting ensemble (CV 0.8372, LB 0.7727) remains our best model.

**Recommended next steps:**

1. **Enhance the voting ensemble with the new features** (Name_Length, Ticket_Frequency):
   - These features weren't in the voting ensemble (exp_001)
   - Both have documented signal (Name_Length: 0.33 correlation, Ticket_Frequency: strong non-linear pattern)
   - Add them to the voting ensemble and re-evaluate CV

2. **If trying stacking again, use "passthrough" approach**:
   - Concatenate original 16 features with 7 OOF predictions = 23 features
   - This gives the meta-learner access to both base model predictions AND original signal
   - May recover the information lost in pure stacking

3. **Consider simpler approaches that might generalize better**:
   - The CV-LB gap is still ~0.065 (CV 0.8372 vs LB 0.7727)
   - Try more aggressive regularization
   - Try feature selection to remove noisy features (e.g., Deck has 77% unknown)

4. **Save the remaining submission** for a model that shows clear CV improvement over 0.8372.

The key insight from this experiment: stacking with highly correlated base models doesn't add value over simple voting. Either increase base model diversity or use passthrough features.
