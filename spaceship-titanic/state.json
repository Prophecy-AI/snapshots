The most reliable starting point is a gradient\u2011boosted\u2011tree (GBT) framework\u2014LightGBM, CatBoost or XGBoost\u2014because GBTs natively handle missing values, categorical encodings and non\u2011linear interactions, and they have been shown to dominate Kaggle leaderboards across dozens of competitions\u202f([developer.nvidia.com](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/the-kaggle-grandmasters-playbook-7-battle-tested-modeling-techniques-for-tabular-data))\u202f([medium.com](https://medium.com/@marawaneslam145/mastering-gradient-boosting-the-algorithm-that-dominates-kaggle-1d6c96db02af)).
