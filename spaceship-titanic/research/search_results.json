      "title": "ANSWER",
      "text": "Passenger transport demand models that incorporate **spending** (e.g., ticket fare, ancillary purchases) and **demographic** information (age, income, occupation) benefit most from a blend of classic preprocessing, engineered interaction/temporal features, and model\u2011driven feature generation.  \n\nFirst, raw categorical demographics should be **one\u2011hot encoded** or, for high\u2011cardinality fields, transformed into **learned embeddings** so that tree\u2011based or deep models can treat them as numeric inputs. Continuous spending variables are best **scaled** (standard\u2011 or min\u2011max) and any missing values **imputed** (mean/median or model\u2011based) to avoid bias ([ProjectPro](https://www.projectpro.io/article/8-feature-engineering-techniques-for-machine-learning/423)). Next, create **interaction features** that capture how spending varies across demographic groups (e.g.,\u202f`spending\u202f\u00d7\u202fage_group`, `spending\u202f\u00d7\u202fincome_bracket`) and **temporal aggregates** such as daily/weekly totals, peak\u2011hour ratios, or lagged spending to reflect seasonality. Spatial\u2011temporal descriptors (origin\u2011destination clusters, travel\u2011time windows) further enrich the signal, as demonstrated in a hybrid spatial\u2011temporal neural network that extracts discriminative patterns from smart\u2011card data ([PolyU](https://research.polyu.edu.hk/en/publications/passenger-demographic-attributes-prediction-for-human-centered-pu)).  \n\nBeyond manual engineering, **model\u2011based feature generation** can uncover hidden structures. Decision\u2011tree\u2011based models (e.g., LightGBM) provide **feature importance scores** that guide selection, and SHAP (Shapley) values give a granular view of each variable\u2019s contribution to predictions, helping to prune irrelevant spending or demographic attributes ([ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1077291X25000098)). Advanced pipelines combine LightGBM with recurrent units (GRU) and SARIMA to automatically synthesize lagged, seasonal, and cross\u2011feature representations, markedly improving traffic\u2011flow forecasts ([Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-92547-y)). Finally, deep\u2011learning architectures such as the **modular CNN** with an automatic feature\u2011extraction block and a dedicated feature\u2011importance block have shown state\u2011of\u2011the\u2011art performance on city\u2011wide bus\u2011passenger flow data, effectively learning high\u2011level composites of spending and demographic inputs ([IEEE Xplore](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9141203)).  \n\nIn practice, a robust workflow would: (1) clean and encode demographics, scale spending, and impute gaps; (2) engineer interaction, temporal, and spatial\u2011temporal features; (3) run a tree\u2011based model to rank variables and apply SHAP for interpretability; (4) optionally augment the feature set with automatically generated embeddings from LightGBM\u2011GRU or modular CNN blocks; and (5) reduce dimensionality with PCA or auto\u2011encoder compression when feature count becomes large. This combination leverages both domain knowledge and data\u2011driven discovery to achieve the best predictive accuracy for passenger transport demand.",

      "text": "Deep Neural Network (DNN) has been applied in a wide range of fields due to its exceptional predictive power. In this paper, we explore how to use DNN to solve the large-scale bus passenger flow prediction problem. Currently, most existing methods designed for the passenger flow prediction problem are based on a single view, which is insufficient to capture the dynamics in passenger flow fluctuation. Thus, we analyze the passenger flow from scopes on both macroscopic and microscopic levels, in order to take full advantage of the information from a variety of views. To better understand the role of different views, decision-tree-based models are used in modeling and predicting passenger flow. The defects and key features of decision-tree-based models are then analyzed. The results of the analysis can assist the architecture design of the deep learning network. Inspired by the feature engineering of decision-tree-based models, a modular convolutional neural network is designed, which contains automatic feature extraction block, feature importance block, fully-connected block, and data fusion block. The proposed model is evaluated on the city-wide public transport datasets in Nanjing, China, involving 1,091 bus lines in total. The experiment results demonstrate the outstanding performance of the proposed method in real situations.",

Our approach leverages General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) data, ridership and vessel information, and hourly weather data, combined with SHAP [explainable artificial intelligence](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/explainable-artificial-intelligence) analysis to assess key delay determinants.

Moreover, SHAP analysis reveals that operational and temporal features \u2013 such as stop sequence, trip start time, headway, and vehicle label \u2013 are the dominant drivers of delays, with weather-related factors exerting only a modest influence.\n\n- [Previous article in issue](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1077291X25000116)\n- [Next article in issue](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1077291X2500013X)\n\n## Keywords\n\nFerry transit\n\nMachine learning\n\nDelay prediction\n\nOpen data\n\n## 1\\. Introduction\n\nPublic transportation plays an increasingly important role in modern transportation systems and has emerged as one of the most crucial [modes of transportation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/physics-and-astronomy/mode-of-transportation) due to its positive environmental and cost impacts. The importance of public transport relies on providing reliable service and predicting delays so that passengers are informed beforehand.\n\nPublic [transport modes](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/transport-mode) can be divided into buses, rail (including [metros](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/metro) and trams), ferries, and beyond (e.g., cable cars, demand-responsive transit with cars). While most research on delay and [travel time](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/economics-econometrics-and-finance/travel-time) predictions for transit focuses on buses and rail services (as evidenced by the fact that all papers included in the survey by [Ge et al. (2021)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/www.sciencedirect.com#b10) are about these modes), it is important to note that ferry transit is also a significant mode of transportation. For instance, the Sydney ferry network in Australia carries over 15 million passenger journeys annually, [1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/www.sciencedirect.com#fn1) the New York (NYC) ferry system saw a total of 6.8 million riders in 2023, [2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/www.sciencedirect.com#fn2) and the Hamburg HADAG ferry system in [Germany](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/germany) serves approximately ten million passengers annually. [3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/www.sciencedirect.com#fn3)\n\nIn the ideal case, when focusing on scheduled services, the intended arrival and departure times provided by agencies should match the actual times. Nevertheless, delays often occur due to several external and unfor...",

In supervised learning, features are the algorithm's input variables to make predictions. For example, in a spam filter, the features include the sender's email address, the subject line, the message content, and so on. By analyzing these features, the machine learning algorithm can determine whether the email will likely be spam. In unsupervised learning, features are used to identify data patterns without predefined labels or categories. For instance, features might be used in a[clustering](https://www.projectpro.io/article/clustering-projects-in-machine-learning/636)algorithm to group similar data points based on their shared characteristics.\n### **Types of Features in Machine Learning**\nFeatures in machine learning can roughly be termed as the building blocks of any machine learning model and the input variables that a machine learning algorithm uses to make predictions or decisions. Here are the different types of features in machine learning-\n* **Numerical Features-**These features are continuous values that can be measured on a scale. Examples of numerical features include age, height, weight, and income. Numerical features can be used in machine learning algorithms directly.\n* **Categorical Features-**These features are discrete values that can be grouped into categories. Examples of categorical features include gender, color, and zip code. Categorical features in machine learning typically need to be converted to numerical features before they can be used in machine learning algorithms. You can easily do this using one-hot, label, and ordinal encoding.\n* **Time-series Features-**These features are measurements that are taken over time. Time-series features include stock prices, weather data, and sensor readings. You can use these features to train machine learning models that can predict future values or identify patterns in the data.\n* **Text Features-**These features are text strings that can represent words, phrases, or sentences. Examples of text features include product reviews, social media posts, and medical records. You can use text features to train machine learning models that can understand the meaning of text or classify text into different categories.\nThe type of feature that is most suitable for a particular machine-learning task will depend on the specific problem that is being solved. For example, if you are trying to predict the price of a house, you might use numerical features such as the size of the house, the number of bedrooms, and the house's location. If you classify a piece of text as spam or not, you might use text features such as the words used in the text and the order in which they are used.\n[![ProjectPro Free Projects on Big Data and Data Science]( \"ProjectPro Free Projects on Big Data and Data Science\")](https://www.projectpro.io/project/project-demo?utm_source=Blog423&amp;utm_medium=ProductValue)\n### **How To Select Features in Machine Learning?**\nSelecting the right features is crucial for ensuring the effectiveness of a machine-learning model. The choice of features can significantly impact the accuracy and efficiency of the model.\nOne way to select features is by using domain knowledge. For example, if you are building a spam filter, you know that certain words or phrases are more commonly used in spam emails than legitimate ones. You can use this knowledge to include those words or phrases as features in the model.\nAnother approach involves feature extraction and selection techniques such as correlation analysis, principal components analysis (PCA), or recursive feature elimination (RFE). These techniques help you identify the most relevant features of the model while ignoring irrelevant or redundant ones.\nHere are some tips on how to select the most appropriate features in machine learning-\n* You must understand the problem you are trying to solve. Try to answer the questions, &lsquo;what are the features that are most relevant to the problem?&rsquo;, &lsquo;what features are likely to be most predictive of the target variable?&rsquo;, etc.\n* You need to explore the data. You must look at the distribution of the features and see if there are any outliers or missing values. You may need to clean the data or remove features that are not informative.\n* You need to use feature selection techniques. Several[feature selection techniques](https://www.projectpro.io/article/feature-selection-methods-in-machine-learning/562), such as filter, wrapper, and embedded methods, are available. Each technique has strengths and we...",

However, due to the temporal nature of ride-hailing trajectory data, traditional imputation methods often struggle to adequately consider spatiotemporal characteristics, leading to limitations in both convergence speed and accuracy. To address this issue, this study employs a prediction-based approach to enhance imputation accuracy. Given the limited feature parameters in trajectory data, traditional prediction models often fail to comprehensively capture data characteristics. Therefore, this study proposes a feature generation model based on LightGBM-GRU, combined with a SARIMA-GRU prediction model, to more thoroughly capture and enrich the data characteristics. This approach effectively imputes missing data, thereby laying a solid foundation for subsequent research.\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n![](https://media.springernature.com/w215h120/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-022-06975-1/MediaObjects/41598_2022_6975_Fig1_HTML.png)\n### [Combination predicting model of traffic congestion index in weekdays based on LightGBM-GRU](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-06975-1?fromPaywallRec=false)\nArticleOpen access21 February 2022\n![](https://media.springernature.com/w215h120/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-024-60337-7/MediaObjects/41598_2024_60337_Fig1_HTML.png)\n### [Spatial\u2013temporal combination and multi-head flow-attention network for traffic flow prediction](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-60337-7?fromPaywallRec=false)\nArticleOpen access26 April 2024\n![](https://media.springernature.com/w215h120/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-024-64483-w/MediaObjects/41598_2024_64483_Fig1_HTML.png)\n### [Traffic planning in modern large cities Paris and Istanbul](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-64483-w?fromPaywallRec=false)\nArticleOpen access15 June 2024\n## Introduction\nTrajectory data loss, frequently caused by environmental factors such as adverse weather, tunnel obstructions, or sensor failures, introduces temporal gaps that critically compromise data integrity. Such incompleteness undermines downstream spatiotemporal analytics, leading to biased conclusions or rendering advanced modeling impractical. Missingness mechanisms are categorized into three types:Missing Completely at Random(MCAR), where missingness is independent of observed and unobserved variables;Missing at Random(MAR), where it correlates with observed variables; and Missing Not at Random(MNAR), where dependencies on unobserved factors exist. Temporal autocorrelation in missingness patterns may further manifest as isolated or cascading gaps.\nConventional approaches to address missing data include deletion (discarding incomplete entries) and imputation (estimating missing values). While deletion risks information loss and temporal discontinuity\u2014particularly detrimental to time-series analysis\u2014imputation preserves dataset utility by reconstructing coherent sequences. Effective management of missing data is therefore essential for robust spatiotemporal analytics.\nImputation methods span statistical techniques (e.g., mean/median substitution, Lagrange interpolation[1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-92547-y#ref-CR1)) to model-driven approaches. While basic methods offer computational efficiency, they lack contextual awareness and precision in complex scenarios[2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-92547-y#ref-CR2). Algorithmic strategies include regression-based imputation (prone to covariate bias[3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-92547-y#ref-CR3)), expectation\u2013maximization (EM[4](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-92547-y#ref-CR4), scalable but memory-intensive), and k-nearest neighbors (KNN[5](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-92547-y#ref-CR5), reliant on similarity metrics with optimization challenges). Missing Value Completion (MVC[6](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-92547-y#ref-CR6)) achieves high accuracy at the expense of throughput, while multiple imputation (MI) trades computational overhead for robustness. Model-based predictions risk overfitting with limited training data.\nRide-hailing trajectories exhibit strong spatiotemporal dependencies that simplistic imputation fails to capture, while their low feature dimensionality restricts comprehensive pattern characterization. To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid feature-driven imputation framework combining LightGBM (gradient-boosted feature engineering), SARIMA (temporal decomposition), and GRU (nonlinear sequence modeling)\u2014the LG-SG model\u2014to enable high-fidelity data recovery for downstream analytical tasks.\n## Theoretical basis\nThe proposed LG-SG framework integrates two synergistic modules: (1) a LightGBM-GRU architecture for feature generation and (2) a SARIMA-GRU hybrid model for spatiotemporal prediction.\nIn the feature generation stage, LightGBM addresses sparse feature representation by learning hierarchical interactions from limited input data (e.g., temporal intervals, velocity), enhancing discriminative capacity through gradient-boosted tree ensembles. Its memory-efficient design accelerates large-scale training while generating enriched feature vectors. These outputs are further refined via GRU\u2019s gated recurrent layers, which capture nonlinear temporal dependencies to mitigate oversimplification in traditional tree-based methods.\nFor spatiotemporal prediction, SARIMA decomposes trajectory data into cyclical and trend components, while GRU models residual nonlinear patterns throu...",

Read\u2022 Posted\n11/25/2025byMonique Fuhrman, P.E.\n![](https://prod-iteris-website-2024-4222cd.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/blog-images/01KAVNYE3W1PHKNVN512RKGTD4.jpg)\nTrends and technological advancements in the world of transportation and traffic engineering are always evolving, but two priorities continue to steer the conversation: safety and efficiency. The goal remains the same\u2014moving people and goods in ways that are smarter, safer, and more sustainable.\nIn recent years, transportation engineers and planners have prioritized developing targeted safety measures for all road users, with a renewed focus on protecting pedestrians and bicyclists.[Vision Zero](https://visionzeronetwork.org/)has reshaped industry standards, pushing both public officials and transportation professionals to place safety at the forefront of every project. These goals are further influenced by the need for improved mobility.\nToday\u2019s transportation networks now accommodate a diverse mix of users, from electric scooters and autonomous vehicles to traditional cars, bikes, and pedestrians. As the landscape is changing, so are trends in the[transportation engineering](https://www.iteris.com/blog/comprehensive-guide-transportation-engineering)space. Technology and the internet are essential in how we manage our networks and are paving the way for the future of our transportation systems.\nLet\u2019s look at some of the emerging trends that are helping advance endeavors in safety and efficiency in this space:\n## Trend #1: Integration of Artificial Intelligence\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) is a powerful tool that is being harnessed to improve all our lives. While some AI has been utilized in existing technologies like adaptive signal control and congestion modeling, academics, engineers, and computer scientists have been experimenting with more ways that this technology can help society in the transportation space.\nIn the safety context, we see AI being used to detect unsafe driving behaviors (wrong way drivers, red-light runners, etc.), analyze crash data, and predict collision points in real time. Not only can this provide actionable insights in real time, but they also give engineers and planners valuable insights into problematic locations where physical interventions may be needed.\nWith safety solutions, we are also seeing AI being used as a tool to prioritize vulnerable users, such as pedestrians and bicyclists. Innovations in pedestrian and bicycle detection are expected to grow in effectiveness and popularity as cities continue to improve their networks with enhanced focus on safety. An example is Vantage Apex\u2014it uses AI-based object detection to classify pedestrians, cyclists, and vehicles in real time. With its latest AI and sensor fusion updates, agencies can now initiate safety or operational applications based on these intelligent outputs.\nAI is also being used for an efficiency application, with[AI-powered traffic management](https://www.iteris.com/oursolutions/traffic-analytics-software/clearguide)and optimization, predictive maintenance, and real-time incident detection. These traffic management strategies help to keep all modes moving and help to maximize safety by doing so efficiently. With the adoption of AI becoming more mainstream, we can expect to see even more innovation in this realm on the horizon, especially with AI-powered systems that prioritize safety and efficiency.\n## Trend #2: Connected Mobility Ecosystems \u2013The Internet and V2X\nApart from AI, our systems continue to get smarter, with even more infrastructure working in concert in a connected environment. The internet is now a key ingredient in transportation engineering, reshaping how cities manage mobility, logistics, and infrastructure.\nFor example, cloud-based signal priority and preemption enables the safer, faster transport of people as well as emergency services.\nIteris[VantagePriority\u2122](https://www.iteris.com/oursolutions/priority-preemption)is a scalable, cloud-based system that offers agencies a flexible, GPS-based approach to traffic signal priority and preemption. It enables seamless deployment across an entire network, allowing transit, freight, and emergency vehicles to move faster and more efficiently through intersections. By leveraging existing hardware and APIs, VantagePriority eliminates the need for roadside units (RSUs) at every intersection.\n## Trend #3: Growth of Autonomous Mobility\nMeanwhile, the continued development of semi- and fully autonomous vehicles, including driverless trucks and delivery drones, is revolutionizing logistics and urban mobility. These technologies promise safer roads, reduced congestion, and more efficient delivery systems.\nAutonomous trucks are already being tested for long-haul freight, while drones are being deployed for last-mile delivery in urban areas. The autonomous ecosystem allows for split-second decision-making, improved situational awareness, and enhanced safety, paving the way for smarter, more resilient transportation networks.\nA popular and notable example of successful autonomous vehicle implementation is the Waymo robotaxi deployment in San Francisco, CA. Waymo has secured[27% of the rideshare market](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/other/waymo-captures-27-of-san-francisco-rideshare-market/ar-AA1GeMqO)in San Francisco by providing proof of concept for autonomous ride hailing services.\nThe vehicles, equipped with a suite of advanced sensors, radar, lidar, and AI, are currently operating with no safety drivers, demonstrating the maturity of Waymo\u2019s system and the robustness of its supporting infrastructure. Their millions of logged miles have also yielded positive results in the significant reduction in crashes involving pedestrians, cyclists, and motorcyclists.\nThis milestone not only reflects Waymo\u2019s technological achievement but also signals a potential cultural shift in urban mobility, where\u202fstandardized, safe, and sustainable autonomous transport\u202fis becoming a preferred alternative to traditional ride-hailing services like Lyft or Uber.\n## Trend #4: Cloud-Based Platforms\nOne of the most common constraints transportation professionals face when working to improve mobility and safety is the limited physical space available, high implementation costs, and ongoing operations and maintenance demands.\nTo address some of these challenges, cloud-based platforms such as VantagePriority are providing an alternative method for agencies to deploy important traffic management solutions in even more places. These platforms leverage cloud-based infrastructure to provide scalable, flexible, and secure solutions that are able to better adapt to growing urban demand, as well as the evolution of technology, thereby putting these innovative technologies at engineers\u2019 fingertips without significant infrastructure investments.\nSimilarly, solutions like[VantageLink\u2122](https://www.iteris.com/oursolutions/vantagelink)exemplify how cloud connectivity can streamline operations and maintenance. Instead of dispatching field technicians for routine inspections or diagnostics, agencies can now access detailed cabinet insights, controller data, and environmental monitoring remotely, maximizing uptime and freeing resources for higher-priority safety initiatives.\nBy moving ITS functions\u2014such as traffic signal control, incident detection, and transit coordination\u2014to the cloud, agencies can reduce the need for costly infrastructure construction or on-premises hardware, and instead gain access to powerful analytics, remote management, and real-time ...",

Because of the complicated structure of the bus operation system, it\u2019s difficult to explain how passengers travel along different routes. Due to the huge number of passengers at the bus stop, bus delays, and irregularity, people are experiencing difficulties of using buses nowadays. It is important to determine the passenger flow in each station, and the transportation department may utilize this information to schedule buses for each region. In Our proposed system we are using an approach called the deep learning method with long short-term memory, recurrent neural network, and greedy layer-wise algorithm are used to predict the Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) passenger flow. In the dataset, some of the parameters are considered for prediction are bus id, bus type, source, destination, passenger count, slot number, and revenue These parameters are processed in a greedy layer-wise algorithm to make it has cluster data into regions after cluster data move to the long short-term memory model to remove redundant data in the obtained data and recurrent neural network it gives the prediction result based on the iteration factors of the data. These algorithms are more accurate in predicting bus passengers. This technique handles the problem of passenger flow forecasting in Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation Bus Rapid Transit (KSRTCBRT) transportation, and the framework provides resource planning and revenue estimation predictions for the KSRTCBRT.\n\n**Keywords:** Passenger prediction, Bus transportation system, Deep learning, Long short-term memory, Recurrent neural network\n\n## Introduction\n\nTransportation is one of the major parts of society. We all know we have three different categories of transportation systems. They are private, public, and intermediate systems. We all come across these transportation systems. The massive history behind the public transportation system, early days, people walk to different kinds of places, riding vehicles driven by animals, steam-powered trains, cable cars, motor coaches powered by internal combustion engines, these are different kinds of transportation where people are used in the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\nPublic transportation includes some features like passengers should get the ticket while traveling, source, destination, monthly pass and route numbers these all feature followed by all the transportation system. The traffic issue has become an increasing concern in our world. Passenger flow prediction plays an important role in the intelligent transportation system \\[ [22](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#CR22), [27](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#CR27)\\]. This task aims to predict the number of passengers getting on the bus and certain bus stops during the given period. Stop during a given period generally can be applied for reducing time-consuming and traveling and providing better transportation control on bus resources it can be classified as long-term passenger floe and short-term passenger flow prediction \\[ [29](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#CR29)\\]. A crucial idea in public transportation management and the agile city is the accurate forecast of bus passenger flow in the transportation system \\[ [13](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#CR13)\\]. Passenger counting used to be done using Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) technology \\[ [15](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#CR15), [28](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#CR28)\\]. Surveillance picture capture techniques are also employed \\[ [34](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#CR34)\\]. There are several challenges in forecasting bus passenger arrival times and dispatch times, as well as when the bus is overloaded, all of which contribute to a problem in predicting passengers \\[ [5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#CR5)\\]. In the transportation system, deep learning is an emerging technology \\[ [8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#CR8)\\]. Deep learning is a class of machine learning that is influenced by the human brain\u2019s structure \\[ [35](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi...",

Feature Engineering places a huge role in improving the predictive power of machine learning models.In this article we will understand some feature engineering concepts on the NYC Taxi Fare Prediction Dataset.\n\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\n\nBut Before that we have to understand what actually Feature Engineering is all about.\n\nFeature Engineering can be divided into two terms \u201c **_Feature_** _\u201d+\u201d_ **_Engineering_** _\u201d_\n\nFeature means the necessary attributes or columns that are present in the dataset and Engineering means to create new features out of existing features inorder to improve the predictive power of the machine learning models.So as this article is focused on feature engineering so I will skip the Data Exploration or Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) part and jump directly on the Feature Engineering Part.The complete code link is given at the end of the article\n\nNow it\u2019s time to see how our dataset looks like\n\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\n\nNYC Train Dataset\n\nSo the dataset consists of **_8 columns(features)_** of geographic and datetime and **_40,000 rows._**\n\nThe dataset is splitted into **_80:20 ratio_**.80% of the data is kept for training and 20% for the test set.Due to less data the dataset is only divided into train and test and cross validation is performed inorder to evaluate the model\n\nSo what will be do is to create a function which will extract the necessary features from the datetime column like day,month,year and time.\n\n```\ndef extract_features(dataframe):       dataframe['pickup_datetime']=pd.to_datetime(dataframe['pickup_datetime'])    day=dataframe['pickup_datetime'].dt.day        month=dataframe['pickup_datetime'].dt.month    year=dataframe['pickup_datetime'].dt.year    time=dataframe['pickup_datetime'].dt.time        # Creating Features    dataframe['day']=day    dataframe['month']=month    dataframe['year']=year    dataframe['time']=time        return dataframetrain_df=extract_features(train_df)test_df=extract_features(test_df)\n```\n\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\n\nNow we will create another function which will compute distance based on the geographical features like **_pickup latitude,pickup longitude,drop off latitude and drop off longitude_**\n\n```\ndef compute_distance(dataframe):        for index,rows in dataframe.iterrows():        try:            pickup_latitude=rows['pickup_latitude']            pickup_longitude=rows['pickup_longitude']            dropoff_latitude=rows['dropoff_latitude']            dropoff_longitude=rows['dropoff_longitude']            pickup_coords=(pickup_latitude,pickup_longitude)            dropoff_coords=(dropoff_latitude,dropoff_longitude)            distance=geopy.distance.geodesic(pickup_coords,dropoff_coords).km            dataframe.loc[index,'distance(KM)']=distance        except Exception as e:                        continue                return dataframetrain_df=compute_distance(train_df)test_df=compute_distance(test_df)\n```\n\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\n\nNow what we will do is to create a function which will separate the time into **_hours,minutes and seconds_**\n\n```\ndef separate_time(dataframe):        dataframe['time']=dataframe['time'].astype(str)    for index,rows in dataframe.iterrows():                time=rows['time'].split(\":\")        dataframe.loc[index,'hour']=time[0]        dataframe.loc[index,'minutes']=time[1]        dataframe.loc[index,'seconds']=time[2]            return dataframetrain_df=separate_time(train_df)test_df=separate_time(test_df)\n```\n\nAfter seperating the time into hours,minutes and seconds what we will do is to convert the time(hours) feature into the **_part of the day_** like early morning,morning,evening,night.\n\n```\ndef get_part_day(x):    if (x > 4) and (x <= 8):        return 'Early Morning'    elif (x > 8) and (x <= 12 ):        return 'Morning'    elif (x > 12) and (x <= 16):        return'Noon'    elif (x > 16) and (x <= 20) :        return 'Eve'    elif (x > 20) and (x <= 24):        return'Night'    elif (x <= 4):        return'Late Night'train_df['session']=train_df['hour'].apply(lambda x:get_part_day(x))test_df['session']=test_df['hour'].apply(lambda x:get_part_day(x))\n```\n\nNow we will create a function which will convert the passenger count from 1 to 6 into only two categories(Single Passenger and Multi Passenger)\n\n```\ndef get_passenger(x):    if x==1:        return \"Single Passenger\"    elif x>1:        return \"Multi Passenger\"    else:        return \"No Passenger\"train_df['Passenger(Class)']=train_df['passenger_count'].apply(lambda x:get_passenger(x))test_df['Passenger(Class)']=test_df['passenger_count'].apply(lambda x:get_passenger(x))\n```\n\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\n\nSo that\u2019s all for now and if you find this article useful then give it a clap and until then\n\n**_Happy Learning !!!!!!_**\n\n> **Complete Code Link** [https://github.com/rishabh706/NYC-Taxi-Fare-Prediction](https://github.com/rishabh706/NYC-Taxi-Fare-Prediction)\n\n[Feature Engineering](https://medium.com/tag/feature-engineering?source=post_page-----4fe44dc1556e---------------------------------------)\n\n[Machine Learning](https://medium.com/tag/machine-learning?source=post_page-----4fe44dc1556e---------------------------------------)\n\n[Data Science](https://medium.com/tag/data-science?source=post_page-----4fe44dc1556e---------------------------------------)\n\n[**Written by Rishabh R Rahatgaonkar**](https://rishabhrahatgaonkar.medium.com/?source=post_page---post_author_info--4fe44dc1556e---------------------------------------)\n\n[11 followers](https://rishabhrahatgaonkar.medium.com/followers?source=post_page---post_author_info--4fe44dc1556e---------------------------------------)\n\n\u00b7 [5 following](https://rishabhrahatgaonkar.medium.com/following?source=post_page---post_author_info--4fe44dc1556e---------------------------------------)\n\nMachine Learning \\| Data Science\n\n## No responses yet\n\n[Help](https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us?source=post_page-----4fe44dc1556e---------------------------------------)\n\n[Status](https://status.medium.com/?source=post_page-----4fe44dc1556e---------------------------------------)\n\n[About](https://medium.com/about?autoplay=1&source=post_page-----4fe44dc1556e---------------------------------------)\n\n[Careers](https://medium.com/jobs-at-medium/work-at-medium-959d1a85284e?source=post_page-----4fe44dc1556e---------------------------------------)\n\n[P...",
