## Current Status
- Best CV score: 0.81951 from exp_003 (CatBoost Optuna-tuned)
- Best LB score: 0.8045 from exp_003
- Latest exp_006: CV 0.81709, pred rate 50.9% (closest to training 50.4%)
- CV-LB gap: ~1.5% (increasing trend: 1.2% → 1.5% → 1.9%)
- Target: 0.9642 (IMPOSSIBLE - top LB is ~0.8066, our best is competitive)

## Response to Evaluator
- Technical verdict: TRUSTWORTHY. Execution is sound.
- Evaluator's top priority: SUBMIT exp_006 to test calibration hypothesis. I AGREE.
  - Rationale: We have 7 submissions remaining, the calibration improvement is significant (50.9% vs 51.7%), and we have evidence that prediction rate matters (exp_004 failure).
  - Even if exp_006 doesn't beat exp_003, we learn whether calibration > CV.
- Key concerns raised: CV (0.81709) is lower than exp_003 (0.81951) by 0.24%.
  - Addressing: The calibration improvement might compensate. This is worth testing.

## Data Understanding
- Reference notebooks: 
  - `exploration/eda.ipynb` for initial EDA
  - `exploration/evolver_loop5_analysis.ipynb` for feature importance and regularization analysis
  - `exploration/evolver_loop7_analysis.ipynb` for calibration vs CV analysis
- Key patterns:
  - CryoSleep is the strongest predictor (81.8% transported when True)
  - Spending patterns strongly predict transport (no spending = likely transported)
  - Deck and CabinNum are important features
  - Prediction rate matters for LB: closer to training (50.4%) = better LB

## Recommended Approaches (Priority Order)

### 1. SUBMIT exp_006 for LB Feedback (IMMEDIATE)
- Test the calibration hypothesis
- Prediction rate 50.9% is closest to training (50.4%)
- Will inform whether to prioritize calibration or CV going forward

### 2. Feature Selection + CatBoost (NEXT EXPERIMENT)
- 22 features have importance < 1.0 (see loop 5 analysis)
- Bottom features: ShoppingMall_spent (0.02), VIP_enc (0.03), IsSenior (0.04), IsChild (0.05)
- Remove low-importance features and retrain CatBoost
- Expected benefit: Reduced overfitting, potentially smaller CV-LB gap
- Use best CatBoost params: depth=8, lr=0.051, iterations=755, l2_leaf_reg=3.52

### 3. Regularized CatBoost (IF feature selection doesn't help)
- depth=6 (vs 8), l2_leaf_reg=5.0 (vs 3.52)
- subsample=0.8 for randomness
- Directly addresses overfitting
- May reduce CV but improve LB

### 4. Ensemble Optimization (AFTER LB feedback)
- If exp_006 beats exp_003: Try different weights (0.7/0.15/0.15)
- If exp_006 doesn't beat exp_003: Focus on improving single model CV

### 5. Neural Network for Diversity (LATER)
- TabNet or simple MLP
- Could add diversity for final ensemble
- Lower priority - GBDTs dominate this problem

## What NOT to Try
- **Threshold tuning**: Already proven to hurt LB (exp_004 failure)
- **Native categorical handling**: Didn't outperform label encoding (exp_004)
- **Simple averaging ensemble**: Already tried, weighted is better
- **Stacking with LR meta-learner**: CV lower than CatBoost alone (exp_005)

## Validation Notes
- Use 5-fold StratifiedKFold with random_state=42 for consistency
- CV-LB gap is ~1.5% and increasing - be conservative about CV improvements
- Prediction rate should be close to training (50.4%) - avoid threshold tuning
- LB improvement rate is only ~60% of CV improvement

## Key Insight
The calibration hypothesis is worth testing: exp_006 has lower CV but better calibration than exp_003. If calibration matters more than CV, this changes our optimization strategy. With 7 submissions remaining, this is a good use of quota.

## After LB Feedback
- If exp_006 LB > 0.8045: Calibration > CV. Focus on ensemble approaches with good calibration.
- If exp_006 LB < 0.8045: CV > Calibration. Focus on feature selection + regularization to improve CV.
