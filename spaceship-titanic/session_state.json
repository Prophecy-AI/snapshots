      "strategy": "# Seed Prompt: Binary Classification for Passenger Transport Prediction\n\n## Data Understanding\n**Reference notebooks for data characteristics:**\n- `exploration/eda.ipynb` - Contains full EDA: feature distributions, missing values, target distribution, key correlations\n- Key findings: Target is balanced (~50/50), CryoSleep is strongest predictor (81.8% transported when True), spending features highly skewed\n\n## Feature Engineering (Critical for High Scores)\n\n### 1. PassengerId Extraction\n- Extract Group ID (first 4 digits before underscore) - passengers in same group often have similar outcomes\n- Extract passenger number within group\n- Create GroupSize feature (count passengers per group)\n- Create Solo indicator (GroupSize == 1)\n\n### 2. Cabin Feature Parsing\n- Split Cabin into Deck/Num/Side (format: deck/num/side)\n- Deck is categorical (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, T) - Deck B (73.4%) and C (68.0%) have highest transported rates\n- Side is binary (P=Port, S=Starboard) - Starboard has higher transported rate (55.5% vs 45.1%)\n- Cabin number can be used for proximity features\n\n### 3. Spending Features\n- Create TotalExpenditure = RoomService + FoodCourt + ShoppingMall + Spa + VRDeck\n- Create binary indicators for each spending category (spent > 0)\n- Log transform spending features (log1p) due to high skewness\n- CryoSleep passengers should have 0 spending (use for imputation)\n- Create spending ratios (e.g., RoomService/TotalExpenditure)\n- Spending patterns: Non-spenders have ~65% transported rate vs ~35% for spenders\n\n### 4. Age Features\n- Create age bins/groups (0-12, 13-17, 18-25, 26-40, 41-60, 60+)\n- Young passengers (0-18) more likely transported\n- Create IsChild, IsTeen, IsAdult indicators\n\n### 5. Name Features\n- Extract surname for family grouping\n- TF-IDF on names with PCA dimensionality reduction (advanced)\n- Family size from surname count\n\n### 6. Interaction Features (Important for Tree Models)\n- CryoSleep \u00d7 HomePlanet interactions\n- Deck \u00d7 Side interactions\n- TotalSpent \u00d7 VIP interactions\n- Age \u00d7 CryoSleep interactions\n- Pairwise products and ratios of numerical features\n- Spending \u00d7 demographic group interactions (e.g., spending \u00d7 age_group)\n\n## Missing Value Imputation\n\n### Strategy (Important!)\n1. Use group information to impute missing values (passengers in same group often share characteristics)\n2. CryoSleep passengers: Set all spending to 0 (they're confined to cabins)\n3. For categorical: Use mode within group, then overall mode\n4. For numerical: Use median within group, then overall median\n5. Consider KNN imputation for more sophisticated approach\n6. Build models to predict missing values (advanced)\n\n### Missing Value Rates (from EDA)\n- CryoSleep: 2.5% missing\n- Cabin: 2.3% missing\n- VIP: 2.3% missing\n- HomePlanet: 2.3% missing\n- Destination: 2.1% missing\n- Age: 2.0% missing\n- Spending features: 2.0-2.4% missing each\n\n## Models\n\n### Primary Models (Ensemble These)\n1. **XGBoost** - Best single model performer\n   - Recommended params: max_depth=5, learning_rate=0.06-0.08, n_estimators=700-900\n   - Use regularization: lambda=3.0, alpha=4.5\n   - colsample_bytree=0.9, subsample=0.95\n\n2. **LightGBM** - Fast and effective\n   - Recommended params: num_leaves=330, learning_rate=0.087, n_estimators=739\n   - feature_fraction=0.66, bagging_fraction=0.87\n   - lambda_l1=6.18, lambda_l2=0.01\n\n3. **CatBoost** - Handles categoricals natively\n   - Good for this dataset with multiple categorical features\n   - Use cat_features parameter for categorical columns\n   - Often best for datasets with many categorical features\n\n### Ensemble Strategy\n- Use soft voting (average probabilities) across models\n- Optuna-optimized weights for model blending\n- 10-fold StratifiedKFold cross-validation\n- Multiple random seeds for robustness (3-5 seeds)\n- Consider stacking with logistic regression as meta-learner\n\n## Validation Strategy\n\n### Cross-Validation\n- Use StratifiedKFold with 5-10 folds\n- Maintain target distribution in each fold\n- Track both accuracy and log loss\n- Use multiple seeds and average results\n\n### Threshold Tuning\n- Default threshold is 0.5, but can be optimized\n- Match predicted distribution to training distribution (~50.4% transported)\n- Use precision-recall curve to find optimal cutoff\n\n## Hyperparameter Optimization\n\n### Optuna Framework (Recommended)\n- Use Optuna with HyperbandPruner for efficient search\n- Run 100-1000 trials for thorough search\n- Key parameters to tune:\n  - XGBoost: max_depth, learning_rate, n_estimators, lambda, alpha, colsample_bytree, subsample\n  - LightGBM: num_leaves, learning_rate, feature_fraction, bagging_fraction, min_child_samples\n  - CatBoost: depth, learning_rate, iterations, l2_leaf_reg\n\n### Early Stopping\n- Use early_stopping_rounds=200 to prevent overfitting\n- Monitor validation loss during training\n\n## Post-Processing\n\n### Ensemble Combination\n- Average predictions from multiple models\n- Consider OR/AND gates between different model predictions for edge cases\n- Mode voting across folds for final prediction\n\n### Threshold Calibration\n- Calibrate threshold to match expected target distribution\n- Test different thresholds around 0.5 (0.48-0.52 range)\n\n## Advanced Techniques\n\n### AutoGluon (Alternative Approach)\n- AutoGluon automates model selection and ensembling\n- Can achieve competitive results with minimal manual tuning\n- Trains multiple models in parallel and combines with weighted averaging\n\n### Target Encoding\n- Use target encoding for categorical features with cross-validation to prevent leakage\n- CatBoost encoding is a safe alternative\n\n### Feature Selection\n- Use permutation importance to identify key features\n- Remove low-importance features to reduce noise\n- Mutual information for feature selection\n- SHAP values for feature importance analysis\n\n### Pseudo-Labeling (Advanced)\n- Use confident predictions on test set as additional training data\n- Only use predictions with high confidence (>0.9 or <0.1)\n\n## Key Insights from Top Solutions and EDA\n\n### From EDA (exploration/eda.ipynb)\n1. **CryoSleep is the strongest predictor** - 81.8% transported when True vs 33.0% when False\n2. **VIP status matters** - VIP passengers have lower transported rate (38.2% vs 50.4%)\n3. **HomePlanet effects** - Europa has highest transported rate (65.8%), Earth lowest (42.3%)\n4. **Destination effects** - 55 Cancri e has highest transported rate (60.3%)\n5. **Deck B and C** have highest transported rates (73.4% and 68.0%)\n6. **Starboard side (S)** has higher transported rate (55.5%) than Port (45.1%)\n7. **Spending patterns** - Non-spenders have ~65% transported rate vs ~35% for spenders\n8. **Age distribution** - Mean age ~29, range 0-79, slight bimodal distribution\n\n### From Top Solutions\n1. **Feature engineering is crucial** - extracting group, cabin, and spending features significantly improves scores\n2. **Group-based imputation** - passengers in same group share characteristics\n3. **Ensemble of gradient boosting models** - XGBoost + LightGBM + CatBoost combination works best\n4. **Optuna hyperparameter tuning** - systematic search improves over default parameters\n5. **Multiple seeds and folds** - reduces variance in predictions\n6. **Spending features are highly skewed** - log transform or binary indicators help\n\n## Implementation Priority\n\n1. **First**: Basic feature engineering (Group, Cabin split, TotalExpenditure)\n2. **Second**: Proper missing value imputation using group information\n3. **Third**: Train XGBoost/LightGBM/CatBoost with good hyperparameters\n4. **Fourth**: Ensemble models with optimized weights\n5. **Fifth**: Advanced features (interactions, TF-IDF on names)\n6. **Sixth**: Hyperparameter optimization with Optuna\n\n## Expected Performance\n- Single model CV accuracy: ~80-81%\n- Ensemble CV accuracy: ~81-82%\n- Target to beat: 0.9642 (very high - requires careful feature engineering and ensembling)\n\n## Notes\n- The target score of 0.9642 is exceptionally high for this problem\n- Focus on robust feature engineering and proper validation\n- Ensemble multiple diverse models for best results\n- Use multiple random seeds to reduce variance\n",
