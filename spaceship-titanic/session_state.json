      "strategy": "# Seed Prompt: Binary Classification for Passenger Transport Prediction\n\n## Data Understanding\n**Reference notebooks for data characteristics:**\n- `exploration/eda.ipynb` - Contains full EDA: feature distributions, missing values, target distribution, key correlations\n- Key findings: Target is balanced (~50/50), CryoSleep is strongest predictor (81.8% transported when True), spending features highly skewed\n\n## Feature Engineering (Critical for High Scores)\n\n### 1. PassengerId Extraction\n- Extract Group ID (first 4 digits before underscore) - passengers in same group often have similar outcomes\n- Extract passenger number within group\n- Create GroupSize feature (count passengers per group)\n- Create Solo indicator (GroupSize == 1)\n\n### 2. Cabin Feature Parsing\n- Split Cabin into Deck/Num/Side (format: deck/num/side)\n- Deck is categorical (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, T) - Deck B (73.4%) and C (68.0%) have highest transported rates\n- Side is binary (P=Port, S=Starboard) - Starboard has higher transported rate (55.5% vs 45.1%)\n- Cabin number can be used for proximity features\n\n### 3. Spending Features\n- Create TotalExpenditure = RoomService + FoodCourt + ShoppingMall + Spa + VRDeck\n- Create binary indicators for each spending category (spent > 0)\n- Log transform spending features (log1p) due to high skewness\n- CryoSleep passengers should have 0 spending (use for imputation)\n- Create spending ratios (e.g., RoomService/TotalExpenditure)\n- Spending patterns: Non-spenders have ~65% transported rate vs ~35% for spenders\n\n### 4. Age Features\n- Create age bins/groups (0-12, 13-17, 18-25, 26-40, 41-60, 60+)\n- Young passengers (0-18) more likely transported\n- Create IsChild, IsTeen, IsAdult indicators\n\n### 5. Name Features\n- Extract surname for family grouping\n- TF-IDF on names with PCA dimensionality reduction (advanced)\n- Family size from surname count\n\n### 6. Interaction Features (Important for Tree Models)\n- CryoSleep \u00d7 HomePlanet interactions\n- Deck \u00d7 Side interactions\n- TotalSpent \u00d7 VIP interactions\n- Age \u00d7 CryoSleep interactions\n- Pairwise products and ratios of numerical features\n- Spending \u00d7 demographic group interactions (e.g., spending \u00d7 age_group)\n\n## Missing Value Imputation\n\n### Strategy (Important!)\n1. Use group information to impute missing values (passengers in same group often share characteristics)\n2. CryoSleep passengers: Set all spending to 0 (they're confined to cabins)\n3. For categorical: Use mode within group, then overall mode\n4. For numerical: Use median within group, then overall median\n5. Consider KNN imputation for more sophisticated approach\n6. Build models to predict missing values (advanced)\n\n### Missing Value Rates (from EDA)\n- CryoSleep: 2.5% missing\n- Cabin: 2.3% missing\n- VIP: 2.3% missing\n- HomePlanet: 2.3% missing\n- Destination: 2.1% missing\n- Age: 2.0% missing\n- Spending features: 2.0-2.4% missing each\n\n## Models\n\n### Primary Models (Ensemble These)\n1. **XGBoost** - Best single model performer\n   - Recommended params: max_depth=5, learning_rate=0.06-0.08, n_estimators=700-900\n   - Use regularization: lambda=3.0, alpha=4.5\n   - colsample_bytree=0.9, subsample=0.95\n\n2. **LightGBM** - Fast and effective\n   - Recommended params: num_leaves=330, learning_rate=0.087, n_estimators=739\n   - feature_fraction=0.66, bagging_fraction=0.87\n   - lambda_l1=6.18, lambda_l2=0.01\n\n3. **CatBoost** - Handles categoricals natively\n   - Good for this dataset with multiple categorical features\n   - Use cat_features parameter for categorical columns\n   - Often best for datasets with many categorical features\n\n### Ensemble Strategy\n- Use soft voting (average probabilities) across models\n- Optuna-optimized weights for model blending\n- 10-fold StratifiedKFold cross-validation\n- Multiple random seeds for robustness (3-5 seeds)\n- Consider stacking with logistic regression as meta-learner\n\n## Validation Strategy\n\n### Cross-Validation\n- Use StratifiedKFold with 5-10 folds\n- Maintain target distribution in each fold\n- Track both accuracy and log loss\n- Use multiple seeds and average results\n\n### Threshold Tuning\n- Default threshold is 0.5, but can be optimized\n- Match predicted distribution to training distribution (~50.4% transported)\n- Use precision-recall curve to find optimal cutoff\n\n## Hyperparameter Optimization\n\n### Optuna Framework (Recommended)\n- Use Optuna with HyperbandPruner for efficient search\n- Run 100-1000 trials for thorough search\n- Key parameters to tune:\n  - XGBoost: max_depth, learning_rate, n_estimators, lambda, alpha, colsample_bytree, subsample\n  - LightGBM: num_leaves, learning_rate, feature_fraction, bagging_fraction, min_child_samples\n  - CatBoost: depth, learning_rate, iterations, l2_leaf_reg\n\n### Early Stopping\n- Use early_stopping_rounds=200 to prevent overfitting\n- Monitor validation loss during training\n\n## Post-Processing\n\n### Ensemble Combination\n- Average predictions from multiple models\n- Consider OR/AND gates between different model predictions for edge cases\n- Mode voting across folds for final prediction\n\n### Threshold Calibration\n- Calibrate threshold to match expected target distribution\n- Test different thresholds around 0.5 (0.48-0.52 range)\n\n## Advanced Techniques\n\n### AutoGluon (Alternative Approach)\n- AutoGluon automates model selection and ensembling\n- Can achieve competitive results with minimal manual tuning\n- Trains multiple models in parallel and combines with weighted averaging\n\n### Target Encoding\n- Use target encoding for categorical features with cross-validation to prevent leakage\n- CatBoost encoding is a safe alternative\n\n### Feature Selection\n- Use permutation importance to identify key features\n- Remove low-importance features to reduce noise\n- Mutual information for feature selection\n- SHAP values for feature importance analysis\n\n### Pseudo-Labeling (Advanced)\n- Use confident predictions on test set as additional training data\n- Only use predictions with high confidence (>0.9 or <0.1)\n\n## Key Insights from Top Solutions and EDA\n\n### From EDA (exploration/eda.ipynb)\n1. **CryoSleep is the strongest predictor** - 81.8% transported when True vs 33.0% when False\n2. **VIP status matters** - VIP passengers have lower transported rate (38.2% vs 50.4%)\n3. **HomePlanet effects** - Europa has highest transported rate (65.8%), Earth lowest (42.3%)\n4. **Destination effects** - 55 Cancri e has highest transported rate (60.3%)\n5. **Deck B and C** have highest transported rates (73.4% and 68.0%)\n6. **Starboard side (S)** has higher transported rate (55.5%) than Port (45.1%)\n7. **Spending patterns** - Non-spenders have ~65% transported rate vs ~35% for spenders\n8. **Age distribution** - Mean age ~29, range 0-79, slight bimodal distribution\n\n### From Top Solutions\n1. **Feature engineering is crucial** - extracting group, cabin, and spending features significantly improves scores\n2. **Group-based imputation** - passengers in same group share characteristics\n3. **Ensemble of gradient boosting models** - XGBoost + LightGBM + CatBoost combination works best\n4. **Optuna hyperparameter tuning** - systematic search improves over default parameters\n5. **Multiple seeds and folds** - reduces variance in predictions\n6. **Spending features are highly skewed** - log transform or binary indicators help\n\n## Implementation Priority\n\n1. **First**: Basic feature engineering (Group, Cabin split, TotalExpenditure)\n2. **Second**: Proper missing value imputation using group information\n3. **Third**: Train XGBoost/LightGBM/CatBoost with good hyperparameters\n4. **Fourth**: Ensemble models with optimized weights\n5. **Fifth**: Advanced features (interactions, TF-IDF on names)\n6. **Sixth**: Hyperparameter optimization with Optuna\n\n## Expected Performance\n- Single model CV accuracy: ~80-81%\n- Ensemble CV accuracy: ~81-82%\n- Target to beat: 0.9642 (very high - requires careful feature engineering and ensembling)\n\n## Notes\n- The target score of 0.9642 is exceptionally high for this problem\n- Focus on robust feature engineering and proper validation\n- Ensemble multiple diverse models for best results\n- Use multiple random seeds to reduce variance\n",

    {
      "feedback": "## What I Understood\n\nThe junior researcher implemented a baseline XGBoost model with feature engineering for the Spaceship Titanic binary classification problem. Their goal was to establish a solid foundation following the seed prompt strategy: extracting features from PassengerId (Group, GroupSize, Solo), parsing Cabin (Deck, CabinNum, Side), creating spending features (TotalSpent, binary indicators, log transforms), and age-based features. They used 5-fold StratifiedKFold CV and achieved 0.80674 accuracy (+/- 0.00469).\n\n## Technical Execution Assessment\n\n**Validation**: The 5-fold StratifiedKFold CV methodology is sound. The standard deviation of 0.00469 across folds is reasonable and suggests stable validation. The OOF accuracy matches the mean fold accuracy (0.80674), which is a good sign of proper implementation.\n\n**Leakage Risk**: I identified one **potential minor concern**: The LabelEncoder is fit on combined train+test data (line in cell 5: `combined = pd.concat([train[col].astype(str), test[col].astype(str)])`). While this is a common practice for label encoding to handle unseen categories, it's technically a form of information leakage from test to train. However, for label encoding (which just assigns integer IDs), this is unlikely to affect results meaningfully. The GroupSize calculation also uses combined train+test data, which is acceptable since it's just counting group members.\n\n**Score Integrity**: \u2705 Verified. The CV scores are clearly printed in the notebook output:\n- Fold 1: 0.81196, Fold 2: 0.80276, Fold 3: 0.80679, Fold 4: 0.81185, Fold 5: 0.80035\n- Mean: 0.80674 (+/- 0.00469)\n- OOF Accuracy: 0.80674\n\n**Code Quality**: The code executed successfully. Submission file has correct format (4278 rows including header, matching sample_submission.csv). No silent failures detected. Random seed is set (42) for reproducibility.\n\n**Verdict: TRUSTWORTHY** - Results can be relied upon for decision-making.\n\n## Strategic Assessment\n\n**Approach Fit**: The approach is reasonable for a baseline but **significantly underperforms** relative to the target score of 0.9642. The current CV accuracy of ~80.7% is far from the target. This is a **Getting Started** competition, so the target score is achievable but requires more sophisticated techniques.\n\n**Effort Allocation**: The baseline is a good starting point, but the researcher needs to move quickly to higher-leverage improvements. The feature importance shows **AnySpending dominates at 0.82** - this is a red flag. It suggests the model is essentially learning a simple rule (spending vs. non-spending) rather than capturing nuanced patterns. The other features contribute minimally.\n\n**Assumptions Being Made**:\n1. Simple mode/median imputation is sufficient (seed prompt suggests group-based imputation is better)\n2. Single model is enough (seed prompt emphasizes ensembling XGBoost + LightGBM + CatBoost)\n3. Default threshold of 0.5 is optimal (threshold tuning is recommended)\n4. Current features are sufficient (interaction features, TF-IDF on names not implemented)\n\n**Blind Spots - Critical Missing Elements**:\n1. **No ensemble**: The seed prompt explicitly recommends XGBoost + LightGBM + CatBoost ensemble with Optuna-optimized weights. This alone could add 1-2% accuracy.\n2. **No interaction features**: CryoSleep \u00d7 HomePlanet, Deck \u00d7 Side, spending \u00d7 demographic interactions are mentioned as important for tree models.\n3. **No group-based imputation**: The seed prompt emphasizes using group information for imputation - passengers in same group share characteristics.\n4. **No TF-IDF on names**: Advanced feature mentioned in seed prompt and top kernels.\n5. **No threshold tuning**: Matching predicted distribution to training distribution (~50.4% transported).\n6. **No spending ratios**: RoomService/TotalExpenditure type features not created.\n\n**Trajectory Assessment**: This is experiment 0 - a reasonable baseline. However, the gap to target (0.9642 - 0.8067 = 0.1575) is enormous. The researcher needs to rapidly iterate on higher-leverage changes. The feature importance showing AnySpending at 0.82 suggests the model hasn't learned much beyond \"did they spend money?\" - there's significant room for improvement.\n\n## What's Working\n\n1. **Solid baseline implementation**: Clean code, proper CV, reproducible results\n2. **Good feature engineering foundation**: Group extraction, Cabin parsing, spending features all implemented correctly\n3. **Appropriate model choice**: XGBoost is a strong baseline for tabular data\n4. **Correct validation approach**: StratifiedKFold maintains target distribution\n\n## Key Concerns\n\n1. **Observation**: AnySpending feature has 0.82 importance, dwarfing all other features\n   **Why it matters**: The model is essentially learning one simple rule. This suggests either (a) feature engineering hasn't created enough discriminative features, or (b) there's something about how features are encoded that makes AnySpending too dominant.\n   **Suggestion**: Consider removing AnySpending or creating more nuanced spending features (ratios, interactions with demographics). The individual spending categories and their interactions with CryoSleep/HomePlanet may be more informative.\n\n2. **Observation**: No ensemble implemented despite seed prompt strongly recommending it\n   **Why it matters**: Top solutions consistently use XGBoost + LightGBM + CatBoost ensembles. This is a known high-leverage improvement for this competition.\n   **Suggestion**: Implement at minimum a simple averaging ensemble of XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost. Then optimize weights with Optuna.\n\n3. **Observation**: The target score of 0.9642 is exceptionally high - typical top scores for this competition are in the 0.80-0.82 range\n   **Why it matters**: A target of 0.9642 may be unrealistic or require techniques beyond standard ML (e.g., data augmentation, pseudo-labeling, or exploiting some data quirk). The seed prompt itself notes \"Target to beat: 0.9642 (very high - requires careful feature engineering and ensembling)\".\n   **Suggestion**: First aim for 0.81-0.82 with ensemble and advanced features. If that ceiling is hit, investigate whether the target is achievable or if there's something special about how it was obtained.\n\n4. **Observation**: Group-based imputation not implemented\n   **Why it matters**: Passengers in the same group often share characteristics (same HomePlanet, similar Cabin, etc.). Using group information for imputation is a key technique mentioned in top solutions.\n   **Suggestion**: Implement group-based imputation: for missing values, first try to fill from other group members, then fall back to overall mode/median.\n\n## Top Priority for Next Experiment\n\n**Implement a 3-model ensemble (XGBoost + LightGBM + CatBoost) with simple averaging.**\n\nThis is the single highest-leverage change because:\n1. It's explicitly recommended in the seed prompt and used by all top solutions\n2. It typically adds 1-2% accuracy with minimal additional complexity\n3. It provides model diversity that can capture different patterns\n4. The current single-model approach has likely hit its ceiling\n\nSecondary priority: Address the AnySpending dominance by either (a) removing it to force the model to learn from other features, or (b) creating interaction features (CryoSleep \u00d7 spending, HomePlanet \u00d7 spending) that provide more nuanced signal.\n\nThe gap to target is large (15+ percentage points), so the researcher should focus on high-leverage changes rather than incremental tuning.\n",

Continuous spending variables are best **scaled** (standard\u2011 or min\u2011max) and any missing values **imputed** (mean/median or model\u2011based) to avoid bias ([ProjectPro](https://www.projectpro.io/article/8-feature-engineering-techniques-for-machine-learning/423)). Next, create **interaction features** that capture how spending varies across demographic groups (e.g.,\u202f`spending\u202f\u00d7\u202fage_group`, `spending\u202f\u00d7\u202fincome_bracket`) and **temporal aggregates** such as daily/weekly totals, peak\u2011hour ratios, or l",
