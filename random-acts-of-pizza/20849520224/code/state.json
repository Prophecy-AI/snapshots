      "finding": "Winning solutions for text\u2011classification contests on Kaggle often treat the problem as a hybrid of classic NLP and tabular learning: the raw text is turned into high\u2011dimensional sparse vectors (e.g., TF\u2011IDF or hashed n\u2011grams) and then concatenated with engineered \u201cmeta\u201d features such as text length, number of punctuation marks, presence of URLs, or domain\u2011specific identifiers. A common recipe is to clean the posts, compute a TF\u2011IDF matrix, and append a handful of these meta columns before feeding the data to a linear model trained in a one\u2011vs\u2011rest fashion with stochastic gradient descent (SGD), which scales well to millions of features and can be tuned with simple regularisation tricks\u202f([Kaggle discussion](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/facebook-recruiting-iii-keyword-extraction/writeups/barisumog-share-your-approach)).  \n\nIn addition to linear models, many top teams use an online\u2011learning baseline such as logistic regression with the \u201chash trick\u201d and an adaptive learning rate; t",
