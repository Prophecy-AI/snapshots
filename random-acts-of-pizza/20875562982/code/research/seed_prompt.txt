## Current Status
- Best CV: 0.6386 from exp_000 (Baseline TF-IDF + Logistic Regression)
- Experiments above gold: 0 (gold threshold: 0.9791)
- **Gap: 0.3405 points** - we need massive improvement
- Recent experiment (exp_001) with linguistic features scored 0.6118 - WORSE than baseline

## Response to Evaluator
- Technical verdict was TRUSTWORTHY for baseline, but linguistic features experiment shows execution issues with feature engineering approach
- Evaluator's top priority: Enhanced text representation with character n-grams and dimensionality reduction
- **I AGREE** - Analysis shows simple regex patterns fail because they lose nuance. TF-IDF captures frequency-weighted patterns that are more predictive. Character n-grams and SVD are proven techniques for this dataset.
- Key concerns: We need to move beyond logistic regression and simple features. The 0.34 point gap requires significant innovation.

## Data Understanding
- **Reference notebooks**: See `exploration/eda.ipynb` for initial analysis, `exploration/evolver_loop1_analysis.ipynb` for correlations, `exploration/evolver_loop2_analysis.ipynb` for why linguistic features failed
- **Key patterns discovered**:
  - Linguistic patterns ARE predictive but need proper representation: gratitude (+5.8% success), need words (+4.4%), reciprocity (+5.7%)
  - Simple binary features lose nuance vs TF-IDF's frequency-weighted approach
  - TF-IDF top predictors: 'dominos', 'rice', 'days', 'currently', 'father', 'tight', 'surprise', 'daughter', 'cover' (context-specific vocabulary)
  - Dataset has rich tabular metadata (account age, karma, subreddit activity) that should be combined with text features

## Recommended Approaches (Priority Order)

### 1. Enhanced Text Representation (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
Based on research and analysis, implement:
- **Character n-grams (2-4 chars)**: Capture stylistic patterns and handle misspellings better than word n-grams
- **TruncatedSVD (LSA)**: Reduce TF-IDF dimensionality to 100-200 components to capture latent semantics
- **Improved preprocessing**: Better handling of Reddit-specific patterns (URLs, usernames, subreddit mentions)
- **TF-IDF parameters**: Experiment with different max_features, ngram_range (1-3), min_df thresholds

### 2. Tabular Feature Engineering (HIGH PRIORITY)
The dataset has rich metadata that wasn't fully exploited:
- **User reputation features**: requester_account_age, requester_upvotes_plus_downvotes, log transforms
- **Interaction features**: text_length × karma, account_age × upvotes, etc.
- **Temporal features**: Hour of day, day of week from request timestamps
- **Missing value patterns**: Flags for missing data that might indicate new/inactive users
- **Subreddit activity**: Prior posts in r/RandomActsOfPizza and other subreddits

### 3. Model Upgrade (HIGH PRIORITY)
Move beyond logistic regression:
- **LightGBM**: Handles mixed data types well, good with text-derived features
- **CatBoost**: Excellent with categorical features (if we encode any)
- **XGBoost**: Robust and proven in competitions
- **Ensemble approach**: Combine multiple models with different feature sets for diversity

### 4. Multimodal Fusion (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
Combine text and tabular features effectively:
- **Early fusion**: Concatenate SVD-reduced text features with engineered tabular features
- **Model stacking**: Train separate models on text-only and tabular-only, then blend predictions
- **AutoGluon approach**: Let automated tools handle the multimodal fusion

### 5. Validation & Robustness (ONGOING)
- **CV stability**: Run multiple seeds to ensure consistent scores (target std <0.03)
- **Feature ablation**: Test which feature groups provide most lift
- **Error analysis**: Continue analyzing false positives/negatives to guide feature engineering

## What NOT to Try
- **Simple regex patterns**: Already proven inferior to TF-IDF (exp_001 failure)
- **More linguistic features without better representation**: Binary presence/absence loses to frequency-weighted approaches
- **Hyperparameter tuning without better features**: Won't bridge 0.34 point gap
- **Complex neural networks**: Dataset is small (2,878 samples), traditional ML with good features is more appropriate

## Validation Notes
- Use stratified 5-fold CV (maintain 24.8% positive class distribution)
- Track both mean and std of CV scores
- Monitor for overfitting given small dataset
- Test feature importance to ensure we're capturing real signal

## Expected Impact
Based on research and competition post-mortems:
- Enhanced TF-IDF + SVD: +0.02-0.05 AUC improvement
- Better tabular features: +0.03-0.08 AUC improvement  
- Model upgrade to LightGBM/XGBoost: +0.02-0.05 AUC improvement
- Proper ensemble: +0.01-0.03 AUC improvement
- **Total potential: 0.10-0.20 AUC improvement** - still far from gold but necessary foundation
