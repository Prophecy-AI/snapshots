      "title": "Predicting the Success of a Reddit Submission with Deep Learning and Keras",
      "text": "I\u2019ve been trying to figure out what makes a [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com) submission \u201cgood\u201d for years. If we assume the number of upvotes on a submission is a fair proxy for submission quality, optimizing a statistical model for Reddit data with submission score as a response variable might lead to interesting (and profitable) insights when transferred into other domains, such as Facebook Likes and Twitter Favorites.\n\nAn important part of a Reddit submission is the submission **title**. Like news headlines, a catchy title will make a user [more inclined](https://minimaxir.com/2015/10/reddit-topwords/) to engage with a submission and potentially upvote.\n\nAdditionally, the **time when the submission is made** is [important](https://minimaxir.com/2015/10/reddit-bigquery/); submitting when user activity is the highest tends to lead to better results if you are trying to maximize exposure.\n\nThe actual **content** of the Reddit submission such as images/links to a website is likewise important, but good content is relatively difficult to optimize.\n\nCan the magic of deep learning reconcile these concepts and create a model which can predict if a submission is a good submission? Thanks to [Keras](https://github.com/fchollet/keras), performing deep learning on a very large number of Reddit submissions is actually pretty easy. Performing it _well_ is a different story.\n\n## Getting the Data + Feature Engineering [\\#](https://minimaxir.com/minimaxir.com\\#getting-the-data--feature-engineering)\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to retrieve the content of millions of Reddit submissions at scale (ethically), so let\u2019s initially start by building a model using submissions on [/r/AskReddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/): Reddit\u2019s largest subreddit which receives 8,000+ submissions each day. /r/AskReddit is a self-post only subreddit with no external links, allowing us to focus on only the submission title and timing.\n\n[As always](https://minimaxir.com/2015/10/reddit-bigquery/), we can collect large amounts of Reddit data from the public Reddit dataset on [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/). The submission `title` is available by default. The raw timestamp of the submission is also present, allowing us to extract the `hour` of submission (adjusted to Eastern Standard Time) and `dayofweek`, as used in the heatmap above. But why stop there? Since /r/AskReddit receives hundreds of submissions _every hour_ on average, we should look at the `minute` level to see if there are any deeper trends (e.g. there are only 30 slots available on the first page of /new and since there is so much submission activity, it might be more advantageous to submit during off-peak times). Lastly, to account for potential changes in behavior as the year progresses, we should add a `dayofyear` feature, where January 1st = 1, January 2nd = 2, etc which can also account for variance due to atypical days like holidays.\n\nInstead of predicting the raw number on upvotes of the Reddit submission (as the distribution of submission scores is heavily skewed), we should predict **whether or not the submission is good**, shaping the problem as a [logistic regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression). In this case, let\u2019s define a \u201cgood submission\u201d as one whose score is equal to or above the **50th percentile (median) of all submissions** in /r/AskReddit. Unfortunately, the median score ends up being **2 points**; although \u201cone upvote\u201d might be a low threshold for a \u201cgood\u201d submission, it splits the dataset into 64% bad submissions, 36% good submissions, and setting the percentile threshold higher will result in a very unbalanced dataset for model training (a score of 2+ also implies that the submission did not get downvoted to death, which is useful).\n\nGathering all **976,538 /r/AskReddit submissions** from January 2017 to April 2017 should be enough data for this project. Here\u2019s the final BigQuery:\n\n```\n#standardSQLSELECTid,title,CAST(FORMAT_TIMESTAMP('%H',TIMESTAMP_SECONDS(created_utc),'America/New_York')ASINT64)AShour,CAST(FORMAT_TIMESTAMP('%M',TIMESTAMP_SECONDS(created_utc),'America/New_York')ASINT64)ASminute,CAST(FORMAT_TIMESTAMP('%w',TIMESTAMP_SECONDS(created_utc),'America/New_York')ASINT64)ASdayofweek,CAST(FORMAT_TIMESTAMP('%j',TIMESTAMP_SECONDS(created_utc),'America/New_York')ASINT64)ASdayofyear,IF(PERCENT_RANK()OVER(ORDERBYscoreASC)>=0.50,1,0)asis_top_submissionFROM`fh-bigquery.reddit_posts.*`WHERE(_TABLE_SUFFIXBETWEEN'2017_01'AND'2017_04')ANDsubreddit='AskReddit'\n```\n\n## Model Architecture [\\#](https://minimaxir.com/minimaxir.com\\#model-architecture)\n\n_If you want to see the detailed data transformations and Keras code examples/outputs for this post, you can view [this Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/minimaxir/predict-reddit-submission-success/blob/master/predict_askreddit_submission_success_timing.ipynb)._\n\nText processing is a good use case for deep learning, as it can identify relationships between words where older methods like [tf-idf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf) can\u2019t. Keras, a high level deep-learning framework on top of lower frameworks like [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org), can easily convert a list of texts to a [padded sequence](https://keras.io/preprocessing/sequence/) of [index tokens](https://keras.io/preprocessing/text/) that can interact with deep learning models, along with many other benefits. Data scientists often use [recurrent neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network) that can \u201clearn\u201d for classifying text. However [fasttext](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastText), a newer algorithm from researchers at Facebook, can perform classification tasks at an [order of magnitude faster](https://minimaxir.com/2017/06/keras-cntk/) training time than RNNs, with similar predictive performance.\n\nfasttext works by [averaging word vectors](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.01759). In this Reddit model architecture inspired by the [official Keras fasttext example](https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/examples/imdb_fasttext.py), each word in a Reddit submission title (up to 20) is mapped to a 50-dimensional vector from an Embeddings layer of up to 40,000 words. The Embeddings layer is [initialized](https://blog.keras.io/using-pre-trained-word-embeddings-in-a-keras-model.html) with [GloVe word embeddings](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/) pre-trained on billions of words to give the model a good start. All the word vectors for a given Reddit submission title are averaged together, and then a Dense fully-connected layer outputs a probability the given text is a good submission. The gradients then backpropagate and improve the word embeddings for future batches during training.\n\nKeras has a [convenient utility](https://keras.io/visualization/) to visualize deep learning models:\n\nHowever, the first output above is the _auxiliary output_ for [regularizing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regularization_%28mathematics%29) the word embeddings; we still have to incorporate the submission timing data into the model.\n\nEach of the four timing features (hour, minute, day of week, day of year) receives its own Embeddings layer, outputting a 64D vector. This allows the features to learn latent characteristics which may be missed using traditional [one-hot encoding](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.OneHotEncoder.html) for categorical data in machine learning problems.\n\nThe 50D word average vector is concatenated with the four vectors above, resulting in a 306D vector. This combined vector is connected to another fully-connected layer which can account for hidden interactions between all five input features (plus [batch normalization](https://keras.io/layers/normalization/), which improves training speed for Dense layers). Then the model outputs a final probability prediction: the _main output_.\n\nThe final model:\n\nAll of this sounds difficult to implement, but Keras\u2019s [functional ...",

Marketing leaders took notice. But beyond the impressive growth numbers lies a strategic goldmine: Reddit Predictions, an interactive forecasting feature that\u2019s transforming how brands engage communities and extract market intelligence.\n\nReddit Predictions isn\u2019t just another polling tool. It\u2019s a gamified forecasting system that requires users to stake virtual tokens on their predictions, creating deeper engagement and more thoughtful participation. For marketing leaders, this translates into unprecedented opportunities for audience research, campaign validation, and community building.\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\n- **Reddit Predictions creates higher-quality engagement than traditional polls** because users must stake virtual tokens on their forecasts, resulting in more thoughtful participation and \u201chigh-intent engagement\u201d that reflects genuine consideration rather than casual clicking.\n- **The platform offers three primary strategic applications for marketing teams:** market validation for product launches, audience research and segmentation through behavioral data analysis, and competitive intelligence gathering through community-validated forecasts.\n- **Success requires 2-3 months of authentic community participation before launching prediction campaigns** to build credibility and understand subreddit rules, posting patterns, and community culture. Treating it as a long-term engagement strategy rather than a one-off tactic.\n- **Reddit\u2019s engaged user base provides superior market intelligence opportunities** with users spending an average of 16 minutes 41 seconds per visit and being 22% more likely than other social media users to intentionally seek out brand information.\n- **Integration with existing marketing technology stacks maximizes ROI** by feeding Reddit prediction data into customer data platforms, marketing automation systems, and social listening tools to enhance user profiles, segmentation strategies, and multi-touch attribution analysis.\n\n### [TABLE OF CONTENTS:](javascript:;)\n\n- **[Understanding the Reddit Predictions Mechanism](https://www.singlegrain.com/www.singlegrain.com#understanding-reddit-predictions-mechanism)**\n- **[Market Size and Growth Opportunity](https://www.singlegrain.com/www.singlegrain.com#market-size-growth-opportunity)**\n- **[Strategic Applications for Marketing Teams](https://www.singlegrain.com/www.singlegrain.com#strategic-applications-marketing-teams)**\n- **[Proven Case Studies and Results](https://www.singlegrain.com/www.singlegrain.com#proven-case-studies-results)**\n- **[Implementation Strategy Guide](https://www.singlegrain.com/www.singlegrain.com#implementation-strategy-guide)**\n- **[Measuring ROI and Attribution](https://www.singlegrain.com/www.singlegrain.com#measuring-roi-attribution)**\n- **[Integration with Broader Marketing Stack](https://www.singlegrain.com/www.singlegrain.com#integration-broader-marketing-stack)**\n- **[Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.singlegrain.com/www.singlegrain.com#frequently-asked-questions)**\n- **[Maximizing Reddit Predictions Impact for Marketing Growth](https://www.singlegrain.com/www.singlegrain.com#maximizing-reddit-predictions-impact)**\n\n## Understanding the Reddit Predictions Mechanism\n\nReddit Predictions operates on a fundamentally different principle than traditional social media polls. Users must \u201cbet\u201d community tokens on their forecasted outcomes, creating skin in the game that encourages more deliberate responses. This gamification element generates what researchers call \u201chigh-intent engagement\u201d\u2014participation that reflects genuine consideration rather than casual clicking.\n\nThe system aggregates individual predictions into collective probability estimates, leveraging what behavioral economists term \u201cthe wisdom of crowds.\u201d For marketing teams, this creates a unique dataset: community-validated forecasts backed by user investment, not just opinions.\n\nMarketing operations managers particularly value Reddit Predictions because the platform provides built-in analytics. Every prediction event generates detailed participation metrics, outcome accuracy data, and engagement patterns that can inform broader marketing strategies.\n\n## Market Size and Growth Opportunity\n\nThe numbers behind Reddit\u2019s growth trajectory tell a compelling story for marketing leaders evaluating new channels. [The average Reddit visit lasts 16 minutes 41 seconds with users viewing 5.26 pages per session](https://explodingtopics.com/blog/reddit-users) as of May 2025, indicating the kind of deep engagement that marketing teams struggle to achieve on other platforms.\n\n| Metric | Q2 2025 | Growth Rate | Marketing Implication |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Weekly Active Users | 416.4 million | +21.6% YoY | Expanding audience reach |\n| Average Session Duration | 16m 41s | +12% YoY | Extended brand exposure |\n| Pages per Session | 5.26 | +8% YoY | Multiple touchpoint opportunities |\n\nThis sustained engagement creates what marketing analysts call \u201cprediction-ready audiences\u201d\u2014communities primed for interactive forecasting activities. When brands launch Reddit Predictions in relevant subreddits, they\u2019re tapping into users already conditioned for deep platform engagement.\n\nThe commercial intent data adds another strategic dimension. [Reddit users are 22% more likely than average social media users to intentionally seek out brand information](https://thesocialshepherd.com/blog/reddit-statistics), according to 2024 research. This behavioral pattern makes Reddit Predictions particularly valuable for B2B marketing leaders who need to reach decision-makers in research mode.\n\n## Strategic Applications for Marketing Teams\n\nForward-thinking marketing leaders are deploying Reddit Predictions across three primary use cases: market validation, audience research, and competitive intelligence. Each application offers distinct advantages for data-driven marketing strategies.\n\n### Market Validation for Product Launches\n\nBefore committing significant marketing spend, brands use Reddit Predictions to gauge market sentiment around new features, pricing strategies, or market posit...",

But you don\u2019t want to miss even a second of your _[True Life](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HQ1MJ6O/?tag=slatmaga-20)_ marathon, and more importantly, you don\u2019t have the funds on hand. You figure that your best chance for getting some pizza to appear in your life is to appeal to the Reddit community. Those people spend a lot of time at their computers, and they get you! So you post on the subreddit [Random Acts of Pizza](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/)\u2014a magical place where users fulfill one another\u2019s wishes for a pie. But science says your plan for world laziness domination is not going to work. It\u2019s just not a compelling story.\n\nResearchers at Stanford [recently published](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1405.3282v1.pdf) \u201cHow to Ask for a Favor: A Case Study on the Success of Altruistic Requests,\u201d and behind that name are the more than 21,000 posts and related data that appeared on Random Acts of Pizza between December 2010 and September 2013. The researchers analyzed the language of the pizza requests, the histories of the users who posted them, data about which requests had been fulfilled, and the differences between requests that did and did not result in pizza.\n\n[As _MIT Technology Review_ explains](http://www.technologyreview.com/view/527496/data-mining-reddit-posts-reveals-how-to-ask-for-a-favor-and-get-it/), the group used a common machine-learning algorithm to analyze the body of data. The group used 70 percent of the data to let the algorithm figure out which requests work and which don\u2019t, and then turned it on the last 30 percent to see how accurate its predictions were. Seventy percent of the time, the algorithm correctly predicted which pizza requests had been fulfilled.\n\nYou may not be completely bowled over by those predictive powers, but this is some deep textual analysis. The researchers separated the posts into five different types of narratives: money, a job, being a student, family, and a \u201ccraving\u201d category that often involves things like friends, parties, and/or drunken revelry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd the researchers found that family, money, and job narratives improved the likelihood of pizza fulfillment, while the other categories were neutral or reduced the chance of success. Politeness (specifically expressions of gratitude), evidentiality (like including a photo), reciprocity (an indication that the poster would potentially give pizza to someone else at another time), sentiment, and length were other factors contributing to success.\n\nHere\u2019s an example of a request that worked:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n> My gf and I have hit some hard times with her losing her job and then unemployment as well for being physically unable to perform her job due to various hand injuries as a server in a restuarant. She is currently petitioning to have unemployment reinstated due to medical reasons for being unable to perform her job, but until then things are really tight and ANYTHING would help us out right now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n> I\u2019ve been both a giver and receiver in RAOP before and would certainly return the favor again when I am able to reciprocate. It took everything we have to pay rent today and some food would go a long ways towards making our next couple of days go by much better with some food.\n\nAnd one that didn\u2019t:\n\n> My friend is coming in town for the weekend and my friends and i are so excited because we haven\u2019t seen him since junior high. we are going to a high school football game then to the dollar theater after and it would be so nice if someone fed us before we embarked :)\n\nThe post with more information and context, plus a more compelling personal story, is more likely to do well with the Reddit community than the post that seems shallow and doesn\u2019t make the reader feel like the poster is a meaningful contributor to the Random Acts of Pizza community. You can see how an algorithm that knows how to ask for favors in a compelling way might be able to abuse its power. And likewise good ol\u2019 humans could take these findings and use them to game Random Acts of Pizza, but that would be really crappy. Who could be so heartless when the site\u2019s motto is \u201cRestoring Faith in Humanity, One Slice at a Time\u201d? Oh, right, it\u2019s the Internet.\n\n[Tweet](https://twitter.com/share?text=Here%E2%80%99s+the+Scientific+Way+to+Ask+for+Pizza%2C+or+Any+Favor&via=slate&url=https%3A%2F%2Fslate.com%2Ftechnology%2F2014%2F05%2Fresearchers-at-stanford-analyzed-random-acts-of-pizza-posts-on-reddit.html%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dtraffic%26utm_source%3Darticle%26utm_content%3Dtwitter_share) [Share](https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fslate.com%2Ftechnology%2F2014%2F05%2Fresearchers-at-stanford-analyzed-random-acts-of-pizza-posts-on-reddit.html%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dtraffic%26utm_source%3Darticle%26utm_content%3Dfacebook_share)Share [Comment](https://slate.com/comments/technology/2014/05/researchers-at-stanford-analyzed-random-acts-of-pizza-posts-on-reddit.html)\n\n- [Pizza](https://slate.com/tag/pizza)\n- [Reddit](https://slate.com/tag/reddit)\n\nAdvertisement\n\n* * *\n\nAdvertisement\n\n[iframe](https://d1ad5f186b6916b32bd64769d6171e63.safeframe.googlesyndication.com/safeframe/1-0-40/html/container.html)[iframe](https://s.amazon-adsystem.com/iu3?cm3ppd=1&d=dtb-pub&csif=t&dl=gg_n-index_n-Ogury_ox-db5_smrt_n-sharethrough_n-onetag_pm-db5_rbd_ppt_n-vmg_an-db5_sovrn_3lift)[iframe](about:blank)[iframe](about:blank)[iframe](about:blank)[iframe](https://ch-match.taboola.com/sync?dast=V9JasCABYDAH435BIDHNifBAB-N-QSAxzYnwUAAAAABgYA_gcAJONb-UamhWUt801GbtHKZFwrjCOXW-ZZLkzL1XC0cY2MAEAyvpVvZFpY1jLfZOQWrUzGtcI4crllnuXCtFwNRxvXyAoAH8ZymQxqgYRl9vsOCsrp6TG7DKKi622xO5xmzxsA3tB0Onyue73m7DC97Bq_2y96eYx2v9nvc_4lg8VoL1jtJS_Py2H5GF2Wz1themtOD7vNbzm5FXaH2Xl9mdySh93kd7sVHtPnrbe5BU_r9eEW_D2nz1tvd0teJpPTdBea3mY7AAAAAAA8APz___9DAAAAAABEAAAAAABIAAAAAABQAARUAPxbAAhcAAAAAABgAPz___9rAACMbwAIPKUcAAjid1hObofdHwAAAAAAIAAAAAAAJAAAAAAAJQAAAAAAJwD__________zEAA_SZNzIA_____zcACz0AAA8-AAAPQgAAAA...",

We use multiple machine learning approaches to build models that predict if a request will be successful or not. Some of our methods rely on the paper How to Ask for a Favor: A Case Study on the Success of Altruistic Requests (Althoff et al., 2014).\n\nSource Data: [https://www.kaggle.com/c/random-acts-of-pizza](https://www.kaggle.com/c/random-acts-of-pizza)\n\nSource Paper: [https://cs.stanford.edu/~althoff/raop-dataset/altruistic\\_requests\\_icwsm.pdf](https://cs.stanford.edu/~althoff/raop-dataset/altruistic_requests_icwsm.pdf)\n\n## About\n\nNo description, website, or topics provided.\n\n### Resources\n\n[Readme](https://github.com/miketp333/Random_Acts_of_Pizza_Machine_Learning#readme-ov-file)\n\n[Activity](https://github.com/miketp333/Random_Acts_of_Pizza_Machine_Learning/activity)\n\n### Stars\n\n[**1**\\\nstar](https://github.com/miketp333/Random_Acts_of_Pizza_Machine_Learning/stargazers)\n\n### Watchers\n\n[**4**\\\nwatching](https://github.com/miketp333/Random_Acts_of_Pizza_Machine_Learning/watchers)\n\n### Forks\n\n[**0**\\\nforks](https://github.com/miketp333/Random_Acts_of_Pizza_Machine_Learning/forks)\n\n[Report repository](https://github.com/contact/report-content?content_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmiketp333%2FRandom_Acts_of_Pizza_Machine_Learning&report=miketp333+%28user%29)\n\n## [Releases](https://github.com/miketp333/Random_Acts_of_Pizza_Machine_Learning/releases)\n\nNo releases published\n\n## [Packages\\ 0](https://github.com/users/miketp333/packages?repo_name=Random_Acts_of_Pizza_Machine_Learning)\n\nNo packages published\n\n## [Contributors\\ 3](https://github.com/miketp333/Random_Acts_of_Pizza_Machine_Learning/graphs/contributors)\n\n## Languages\n\n- [Jupyter Notebook100.0%](https://github.com/miketp333/Random_Acts_of_Pizza_Machine_Learning/search?l=jupyter-notebook)\n\nYou can\u2019t perform that action at this time.",
