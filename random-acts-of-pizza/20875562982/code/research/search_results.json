This will be the most international edition ever, with 62 nations involved.\nAVPN closes a record-breaking edition of the Vera Pizza Contest 2025: the 1,360 pizzas submitted from 42 countries, of which 965 were admitted to the competition (the others excluded for not meeting the requirements set by the regulations), once again onfirm the international scope of an initiative that continues to grow in both numbers and quality of participants. After two months of selections, the winner was**Pasquale Visone**, Neapolitan by birth but adopted by Veneto, who, in addition to the great satisfaction of reaching the top step of the podium, received as first prize a 9-day professional course at the AVPN School. Second place went to**Roberto Del Giudice**, awarded a 3-day course with the Association&rsquo;s pizzaioli; while**Patryk Chor&#261;&#380;y**received a 4-hour course.\nAll finalists also received a series of gifts such as mixers, ovens, various equipment, and a selection of high-quality food products provided by partners Molino Caputo, KYS Norway, Gimetal, Sor&igrave; Italia, and Mec Palmieri. The three pizzaioli who competed in front of the AVPN headquarters in Capodimonte were determined by a jury of 14 master pizzaioli, who this year replaced the Facebook audience during the grand finale.\n> > &ldquo;Once again this edition offered an exciting competition, showing how the passion for pizza is increasingly becoming a global phenomenon,&rdquo; said **> Paolo Surace\n**> , AVPN Secretary General. &ldquo;Selections began on October 22nd and brought us to today&rsquo;s three finalists. A special thanks to the jury composed of Peter Surace, Luciano Pignataro, and Giusy Ferraina for their professionalism, and to all the pizzaioli who helped confirm the central role of our Association.&rdquo;\n> > > &ldquo;Winning the contest is an immense emotion,&rdquo; declared the winner. &ldquo;This award is a huge incentive to continue growing. I thank AVPN and all the master pizzaioli for their precious work, protecting the tradition of true Neapolitan pizza while opening the doors to those like me who want to learn and challenge themselves.&rdquo;\n> A global competition now gives way to another worldwide contest: the**Best AVPN Pizzeria 2025**, the first and only tournament where pizzaioli themselves act as judges. The seventh edition this year reaches 62 nations with the entry of the first pizzerias in India and the Philippines, and sees over a thousand participants competing, evaluated not only on the quality of the pizza but also on the choice of raw materials, pairings, table service, and location. After the success of past editions that crowned*La Notizia*by Enzo Coccia,*50 Kal&ograve;*by Ciro Salvo,*Pizzeria da Attilio*by Attilio Bachetti,*Casa De Rinaldi*by Salvatore De Rinaldi,*Leggera*by Andr&egrave; Guidon, and*Zielona G&oacute;rka*by J&#281;drzej Lewandowski, Best AVPN Pizzeria is ready to continue celebrating the great talents of pizza across all continents.\n> > &ldquo;We are truly excited to see, year after year, the growing number of pizzerias choosing to join our Association,&rdquo; said **> Antonio Pace\n**> , President of AVPN. &ldquo;With the entry of the first addresses in India and the Philippines, we open the most international edition ever of Best AVPN Pizzeria: a title of unique value where pizzaioli themselves choose the winner, the most authentic demonstration of the spirit of sharing and growth that animates our community.&rdquo;\n> ### Hall of Fame &ndash; Best AVPN Pizzeria\n* **Enzo Coccia**: Born in 1962, a true Neapolitan, he is one of Italy&rsquo;s most influential master pizzaioli. He entered the pizza world at a young age when he took over*Fortuna*, the historic family trattoria in Naples&rsquo; old town, and began collaborating with AVPN. In the mid-1990s he opened*La Notizia*on Via Caravaggio, an intimate and modern venue away from tourist flows, which quickly became a reference point for take-away pizza and creative pairings, winning Best AVPN Pizzeria in 2014.\n* **Ciro Salvo**: A native of Vesuvius and third generation of a historic pizzaioli family, he opened*50 Kal&ograve;*, first in Naples, then in London and Rome. A devotee of Neapolitan tradition, Salvo is known and loved for the lightness and digestibility of his doughs. As a master pizzaiolo, he combines the choice of quality raw materials with experimentation in flavor pairings. His pizzas embody the perfect synthesis of tradition, research, and gourmet combinations, earning him international fame and the Best AVPN Pizzeria award in 2019.\n* **Attilio Bachetti**: Born in Naples in 1967, he fell in love with pizza from childhood. Over the years, his passion grew into a true lifestyle, carrying forward the family business opened by his grandfather in 1938 with dedication, passion, and research. His studies also made him a sommelier and expert in cheeses and extra virgin olive oil. Faithful to tradition, he continues to amaze enthusiasts with unmistakable Neapolitan flavors, light and well-leavened dough, while embracing creativity and innovation. Recognized with the Best AVPN Pizzeria award in 2021.\n* **Salvatore De Rinaldi**: Born in 1970, he began working at the family business*Ristorante Pizzeria La Stella*at a young age, where he fell in love with the art of pizza. In 1989 he launched the brand*Sas&agrave; Pizza Mia*. De Rinaldi invested in training with numerous experiences across Italy to deepen his knowledge of leavening and gourmet toppings. A master of dough, he focuses on natural fermentation and the search for top-quality local ingredients. His*Pizzeria De Rinaldi*is recognized as the home of true Neapolitan pizza, confirmed by the Best AVPN Pizzeria award.\n* **Andr&egrave; Guidon**: An engineer by training, he loves precision. Unable to digest S&atilde;o Paulo-style pizza, he decided to open his authentic pizzeria*Leggera*to create a product that met his expectations. His success and recognition proved him right. As President of AVPN Brazil, ten years after his first venue he opened a second. Last year was full of triumphs: winning Best AVPN Pizzeria, first place at*50Top Pizza Latin America*, third worldwide, and reconfirmation of the prestigious*Tre Spicchi*award by Gambero Rosso.\n* **J&#281;drzej Lewandowski**: A Polish pizzaiolo known as the founder and face of*Zielona G&oacute;rka*, a pizzeria in Pabianice that has become an international reference point for Neapolitan pizza. A graduate in architecture, Lewandowski worked for years as a designer before changing paths. Driven by his passion for gastronomy and Neapolitan tradition, he studied the art of pizza seriously, attending specialized courses in Naples and obtaining AVPN certifications.\nFriday 12 December 2025\nCategories:[Press Area](https://www.pizzanapoletana.org/en/cat/1-press_area),[Approved](https://www.pizzanapoletana.org/en/cat/3-approved),[Vera Pizza Day](https://www.pizzanapoletana.org/en/cat/6-vera_pizza_day),[Vera Pizza Contest](https://www.pizzanapoletana.org/en/cat/2-vera_pizza_contest),[sonoVerace](https://www.pizzanapoletana.org/en/cat/4-sonoverace)\n[![AVPN Australasia](https://www.pizzanapoletana.org/struttura/avpn_australasia.png)](https://australasia.pizzanapoletana.org/)\n[View all News](news)\n### AVPN Approved Suppliers\n[![Effeuno](https://www.pizzanapoletana.org/public/fornitori/4691668681051_en_f.jpg)](https://www.pizzanapoletana.o...",

The olive oil section was prodigious, and part of my job was writing signs and material to communicate what set apart our hundreds of extra virgin olive oils.\nThe labels were everything from beautiful to barebones, minimalist to magnificent, and included text in all sorts of languages. I thought\u2014if I worked in the industry and had trouble deciphering them, the task must feel overwhelming for customers trying to choose between a Cabe\u00e7o das Nogueiras oil from Portugal and a Catalan Arbequina monocultivar. Where would they even begin?\n![Lori Jean Levy](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/6462edce4d7ed61838fab845/3929d351-4bec-43fb-8793-d366c430ff28/Lori+Jean+Levy+copy.jpg)\nLori Jean Levy\nYears later, olive oil bottles can still feel intimidating. I talked to Lori Levy, my former Fairway colleague and CEO of[My Global Table](https://www.myglobaltable.com), and Nicholas Coleman, founder of[Grove and Vine](https://groveandvine.com)about how to decode olive oil labels. Here\u2019s where to start.\n![Dates on olive oil label](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/6462edce4d7ed61838fab845/c4b9a8ef-ff72-4b3d-a1f7-f8a4290f53a1/Olive+oil+dates.jpeg)\nOlive oil dates\n## Freshness is Key\nThe fresher, the better. \u201cThe first thing I look for is the harvest date,\u201d says Coleman. \u201cFreshness is a key quality component.\u201d\nOlive oil is at its best in its**first two years**. With time, olive oil slowly but surely loses its beautiful, complex flavors and health benefits. \u201cBuy smaller, not bigger. It\u2019s always best to have fresher oil than oxidized oil,\u201d Levy advises.\nOlive oil harvests in the northern hemisphere (in countries like Greece, Spain, and Italy) take place in October and November. This means if you\u2019re looking for the freshest bottle, you\u2019ll want the harvest date listed on the label to be from the previous year.\n![Pretty olive oil labels](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/6462edce4d7ed61838fab845/851ec086-f7a9-4241-8ed5-96e0a3538c2c/Pretty+labels.jpeg)\n## A Pretty Label is Just a Pretty Label\nDon\u2019t judge a book by its cover. \u201cLike wine, a fancy label can disguise,\u201d says Levy. \u201cSo don\u2019t be distracted from making decisions just on the front of the bottle.\u201d Turn the bottle to the back, where the smaller print conveys crucial information.\n![Olive oils from Italy](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/6462edce4d7ed61838fab845/d3d1a51b-afbf-4bc4-8066-98def0689ff1/Labels+with+origin.jpeg)\nOlive oils from Italy\n## Check the Region\nColeman says to \u201cLook for a**single estate or specific region**where the olives originate.\u201d Lesser quality oils often blend olives from all sorts of regions and countries. Like wine, the most delicious EVOOs celebrate the terroir of a specific place. Also like wine, there are excellent oils to be discovered from all sorts of places around the world. When I spoke to Coleman, he was on his way home from an olive oil sourcing trip to Chile. Spain, Italy, Greece, and Portugal produce quality EVOO, as do Tunisia, Australia, California, and beyond.\nLevy urges customers to check if in oil was \u201cpacked, blended or otherwise processed somewhere other than where it was grown,\u201d a piece of information that must appear on the bottle, legally (often in small print). That\u2019s a sign of a lesser quality product.\n## Extra Virgin is Just the Start\n**Extra Virgin**is the top tier of olive oil, and a great place to start. To be classified extra virgin, the oil must be extracted mechanically from olives, have an oleic acidity of less than 0.8%, and be free of defects, according to a tasting panel. Extra virgin olive oil is not chemically altered in any way. But EVOO doesn\u2019t tell you much more than that about what\u2019s inside the bottle. Even though it is the highest grade, the quality, aroma, flavor, color, and price can vary significantly from one bottle to another.\n![Olive oil and tomatoes](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/6462edce4d7ed61838fab845/92d6a8a6-2d44-4dbf-9bbf-32b98d74761e/bruschetta+by+Eva+from+Pixabay.jpg)\n## Know How You\u2019re Going to Use Your EVOO\n\u201cThere are Super Premium EVOOs, that really stand apart,\u201d Levy explains. \u201cThey are more expensive to farm and produce and hence are costly.\u201d Use these stunning oils for drizzling and finishing, so their flavors really shine through. Levy keeps at least two special EVOOs at hand, one delicate and one more robust in flavor to pair with different foods (olive oil should elevate, not overpower).\n\u201cThen there are the workhorses of your kitchen, the EVOO that can do a multitude of things from cooking to dressings and marinades,\u201d explains Levy. She uses older oils she is trying to finish up for this purpose, or a less expensive bottle from a producer she trusts.\n![Olive oil bottle with cultivar on the label](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/6462edce4d7ed61838fab845/fc7847ae-b00c-4ab2-a06d-4af0ba0f3dde/Olive+oil+bottle+with+cultivar.jpg)\nOlive oil bottle with cultivar on the label\n## Get to know your cultivars\nJust as wine is made from different varieties of grapes, olive oil is made from different**olive culitivars**. The term**monocultivar**refers to an oil pressed from a single kind of olive\u2014it\u2019s not inherently better or worse, just a specific style. (More wine analogy\u2014a Bordeaux is usually made from a blend of grapes, a Burgundy is exclusively Pinot Noir. Both are fabulous, and different.)\n\u201cMuch like choosing wine, once you know some of the characteristics of the cultivars you like, you are able to find what you are looking for or something similar,\u201d says Levy. \u201cAnd you may start to explore new cultivars from different countries.\u201d Also like wine, regions tend to plant specific olives, with their own flavor profiles. For example, the vast majority of Picual olives are grown in Ja\u00e9n, in Andalusia, Spain, and tend to have a light peppery taste, fruity flavor, and a little bitterness. Originating in Tuscany, Frantoio olives produce an aromatic, slightly spicy oil, with notes of almonds and fresh herbs.\n[\n![Pizza](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/6462edce4d7ed61838fab845/068b8b89-6b07-4226-a98a-48adf934f86a/Margherita+pizza+at+Pizzeria+Salvo+photo+credit+Aurora+Scotto+di+Minico.jpg)\n](https://oliveoilprofessor.com/blog/choosing-the-best-extra-virgin-olive-oil-for-italian-pizza)\nChoosing the Best Extra Virgin Olive Oil for Pizza\n## Tasting is the Best, Truest Way to Get to Know an olive Oil\nUltimately, let your own taste buds be your guide. If you love the flavor of an olive oil, that\u2019s what matters. \u201cBe sure to taste an oil, on its own and independent of other foo...",

Low-maintenance and foolproof, it creates a beautifully**golden crust**with an airy, soft interior that\u2019s perfectly chewy. It\u2019s time to make the most gorgeous**sourdough bread**from home!\nThis post about my**sourdough bread**journey has been a long time coming. I\u2019ve been working so hard to perfect my process, and although many have been begging for me to share my recipe, I didn\u2019t want to post it when it wasn\u2019t up to standards. I can confidently say that I have the**best-tasting sourdough bread recipe**for you to try. But this is just the beginning. I have more**sourdough bread recipes**coming your way, including**[posts on starters](https://simplytaralynn.com/2024/06/03/where-can-i-get-sourdough-starter-from-make-it-yourself/)**,**discard recipes**, sourdough bread flavors, scoring techniques, and more.\n## ***The Best Golden Sourdough Bread Recipe | Easy Baking for Beginners***\nWe may have different preferences when it comes to**sourdough bread**. I love my bread to be airy, flavorful, golden, and crusty on the outside. I\u2019m not a big fan of dark bread. I don\u2019t cook mine at the highest temps that most sourdough bread recipes require. I rather mine cook longer at a lower temp and stay a bit more golden.\nOne of my favorite ways to eat sourdough bread is by toasting, adding a layer of butter, and my favorite, raspberry jam. We eat our bread by making turkey sandwiches, grilled cheese, and French toast, and I even love making croutons out of stale bread.\n* * * * * * If you have an active starter already established, then this is the blog for you! No worries if you do not have an active starter; I wrote a**[tutorial on sourdough starter](https://simplytaralynn.com/2024/06/03/where-can-i-get-sourdough-starter-from-make-it-yourself/)**, and**[you can find that blog HERE](https://simplytaralynn.com/2024/06/03/where-can-i-get-sourdough-starter-from-make-it-yourself/)**\n### ***Let\u2019s start making and baking the best sourdough bread ever.***\nIt typically takes me 24 hours to make my bread from start to finish (from feeding my starter to baking) 24 hours sounds like a high-maintenance process, but I promise it\u2019s not. There are a lot of hours where you just leave the bread alone to rise or leave the starter alone to activate. The process can be customized to fit any kind of schedule. The more you bake sourdough bread, the more you\u2019ll find your groove when it comes to a timeline that works for you.\n## ***Reasons why you will love an easy beginner\u2019s sourdough bread recipe:***\n1. **Simple ingredients:**This beginner sourdough bread recipe has a short list of simple ingredients, making it easy to get started with minimal fuss.\n2. **Clear instructions:**This Beginner sourdough bread recipe has detailed instructions and step-by-step guidance, making it easy to follow along even if you\u2019ve never made bread before.\n3. **Healthy and natural:****Is sourdough the most healthy bread?**Sourdough bread is a healthier option than regular bread, as it contains more nutrients and is easier to digest. It\u2019s also made with natural yeast, which is better for your gut microbiome.\n4. **Delicious flavor:**Sourdough bread has a unique, tangy flavor that many people find irresistible. Plus, with a little practice, you can customize the flavor by adjusting the fermentation time, adding herbs or spices, or using different types of flour.\n5. **Budget-friendly:**Making your own sourdough bread can be more cost-effective than buying it from a bakery or grocery store, especially if you\u2019re buying high-quality artisan bread.\n6. **Satisfaction of baking:**There\u2019s something satisfying about making your own bread from scratch, and sourdough bread is no exception. Plus, it\u2019s a great way to impress your friends and family with your baking skills!##### ***Sourdough Bread for Beginners***\n## ***The Best Golden Sourdough Bread Recipe:***\nAlong with the**sourdough bread recipe**, I\u2019ll be sharing tips and tricks to perfecting this sourdough bread and some fun ways to jazz it up.Sourdough bread is simple, and once you get the hang of it, you\u2019ll naturally get more daring with the process. You may even put your own spin on the recipe and find a routine that works better for you. The more and more you play with sourdough, the more perfect your loaves turn out each time. It\u2019s fun to look back and see how far I\u2019ve come. I remember googling everything there was to know about sourdough starters, and after reading and watching all the videos, I was still so confused. Eventually, you catch on, and it makes you feel like you\u2019re a bread scientist. I\u2019m~~kind of~~obsessed with it at this point. I love trying new techniques, and I love watching others for inspiration. My for you page is just filled with sourdough videos and scoring art.\n7. 8. #### [**read the blog:**](https://simplytaralynn.com/2025/01/09/where-can-i-get-sourdough-starter-from-make-it-yourself/)\n## Understanding Sourdough Starter!\nOne of the most frequently asked questions I receive is, \u201cHow do I make a sourdough starter?\u201d or \u201cWhere can I get a sourdough starter from?\u201d\nWhat is sourdough starter? How does it work?\nI recommend beginning the sour starter process now, or purchasing an**[active sourdough starter on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/shop/taralynnmcnitt/list/3CBBOL0VG3GYK?linkCode=spc&amp;ref_=aip_sf_list_spv_ons_mixed_d)**. It took me about two weeks to make my starter, and if I\u2019m being honest, I wish I had purchased a starter online to save myself the days of frustration. The good thing is that my starter is still thriving and making the most delicious loaves of bread. I\u2019ve been meaning to name it, too. So, if you have any good name suggestions for my sourdough starter, please leave them in the comments. It always cracks me up listening to people talk to their starters and calling them by name.\n## ***How did I start my sourdough bread journey?***\nI have always admired bakers online making their bread. A few months ago, I was browsing the grocery store and looking to...",
