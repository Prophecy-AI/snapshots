      "title": "ANSWER",
      "text": "Combining TF\u2011IDF text vectors with tabular metadata is a classic multimodal setup that appears frequently in Kaggle\u2011style competitions.  TF\u2011IDF turns each document into a high\u2011dimensional sparse vector, while the remaining columns (numeric, categorical, dates, etc.) are dense and often require separate preprocessing (e.g., scaling, one\u2011hot or target encoding).  Treating the text as a first\u2011class column lets modern AutoML tools automatically fuse the two modalities, which simplifies pipeline construction and reduces the risk of leakage\u202f([auto.gluon.ai\u202f0.7.0](https://auto.gluon.ai/0.7.0/tutorials/tabular_prediction/tabular-multimodal-text-others.html)).  \n\n**Best\u2011practice workflow**  \n1. **Preprocess the text**: compute TF\u2011IDF on the training split only, optionally prune rare terms and apply\u202fTruncated\u202fSVD or PCA to obtain a compact dense representation (e.g., 100\u2013300 components) that can be concatenated with the tabular matrix.  \n2. **Encode tabular features**: use robust schemes such as CatBoost\u2019s categorical handling, target\u2011encoding, or simple one\u2011hot for low\u2011cardinality fields; scale numeric columns if you plan to use linear models.  \n3. **Build a unified pipeline**: keep the TF\u2011IDF/SVD step inside a scikit\u2011learn\u202f`ColumnTransformer` so that the same transformation is applied at inference time, and avoid data leakage by fitting only on the training fold.  \n4. **Stack or blend**: train a fast linear model (e.g., Logistic Regression or Linear SVM) on the TF\u2011IDF alone, a gradient\u2011boosting model (LightGBM, CatBoost, RF) on the tabular part, and then blend their predictions (weighted average or meta\u2011learner).  AutoGluon\u2019s multimodal tabular predictor already implements this strategy, automatically combining raw text with LightGBM/RF/CatBoost back\u2011ends\u202f([auto.gluon.ai\u202f0.7.0](https://auto.gluon.ai/0.7.0/tutorials/tabular_prediction/tabular-multimodal-text-others.html)).  \n\n**Models that excel**  \n- **Tree\u2011based gradient boosters** (LightGBM, CatBoost) natively accept sparse TF\u2011IDF matrices and dense tabular features, often delivering the strongest baseline in competitions\u202f([auto.gluon.ai\u202f0.7.0](https://auto.gluon.ai/0.7.0/tutorials/tabular_prediction/tabular-multimodal-text-others.html)).  \n- **Linear models** (Logistic Regression, Linear SVM) are very effective on pure TF\u2011IDF and can be combined via stacking.  \n- **Multimodal Transformers** such as the Tabular\u2011Text Transformer (TTT) introduce a dual\u2011stream architecture with a distance\u2011to\u2011quantile embedding for numerics and cross\u2011modal attention, achieving state\u2011of\u2011the\u2011art results on tabular\u2011text benchmarks\u202f([ACL Findings\u202f2024](https://aclanthology.org/2024.findings-acl.87)).  \n- **Foundation\u2011model approaches** that treat text as an additional modality in tabular pipelines (e.g., simple TF\u2011IDF + SVD + LightGBM, or pretrained language models fine\u2011tuned jointly with tabular data) have been shown to close the performance gap on real\u2011world datasets\u202f([arXiv\u202f2507.07829](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.07829)).  \n- For rapid prototyping, the open\u2011source **Multimodal\u2011Toolkit** integrates HuggingFace tokenizers and transformer back\u2011ends with tabular encoders, letting you experiment with deep\u2011learning fusion without building the infrastructure from scratch\u202f([ACL\u202f2021](https://aclanthology.org/2021.maiworkshop-1.10.pdf)).  \n\nFollowing this pipeline\u2014clean TF\u2011IDF, dimensionality reduction, robust tabular encoding, and a blend of tree\u2011based or multimodal transformer models\u2014has become a de\u2011facto standard for high\u2011ranking solutions in modern ML competitions.",

However, existing benchmarks for\ntabular data rarely include textual columns, and\nidentifying real-world tabular datasets with se\u0002mantically rich text features is non-trivial. We\npropose a series of simple yet effective ablation\u0002style strategies for incorporating text into con\u0002ventional tabular pipelines. Moreover, we bench\u0002mark how state-of-the-art tabular foundation mod\u0002els can handle textual data by manually curating\na collection of real-world tabular datasets with\nmeaningful textual features. Our study is an im\u0002portant step towards improving benchmarking of\nfoundation models for tabular data with text.\n1. Introduction\nFoundation models have begun to transform tabular learn\u0002ing (Erickson et al., 2020b; Hollmann et al., 2025), echo\u0002ing the trajectory of other research fields. A natural next\nstep is mixed-modality tabular modeling, where structured\ncolumns may also include free-text fields such as job de\u0002scriptions, clinical notes, or product summaries. Current\ntabular benchmarks, however, almost never contain textual\ncolumns, cf. (Bischl et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2024; McEl\u0002fresh et al., 2024). Moreover, locating real-world datasets\nwith semantically rich text features is exceptionally difficult,\nwith even exhaustive searches of OpenML and Kaggle only\nyielding a handful of usable candidates (Shi et al., 2021).\nConsequently, current tabular foundation models are rarely\nevaluated for tabular data with text.\nPipelines that can handle tabular data with text vary greatly\n*Equal contribution 1Department of Computer Science, Uni\u0002versity of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany 2\nPrior Labs, Freiburg,\nGermany 3ELLIS Institute, Tubingen, Germany.

AutoGluon\u2019s AutoMLPipeline\u0002FeatureGenerator (Erickson et al., 2020a) converts text to\nsparse vectors; CARTE (Kim et al., 2024) applies fastText\nsentence embeddings (Bojanowski et al., 2017). and the\nTabPFNv2 API accepts raw text but does not disclose its\nmethodology. These divergent choices raise a fundamental\nquestion: Which embedding strategy works best, and under\nwhat conditions?\nTo answer this question, we present the first systematic\nstudy of predictive machine learning with foundation mod\u0002els for tabular data with text. We study the performance\nof three representative embedding routes: fastText, Skrub\u2019s\nTableVectorizer, and AutoGluon\u2019s text encoder. We show\nqualitatively, with a simple synthetic counter-example, that\nboth n-gram based and off-the-shelf sentence embeddings\ncan fail to recover highly predictive semantic patterns. More\u0002over, quantitatively, we evaluate these methods on a man\u0002ually curated set of real-world tabular benchmark that (i)\ncontain genuinely informative free-text columns (ii) spans\nover a variety of domains and samples.\nOur contributions are: (I) A qualitative study show cas\u0002ing the limitations of standard n-gram based and generic\nNLP-based embeddings for tabular tasks with text. (II) A\nmanually curated set of real-world tabular datasets with se\u0002mantically rich textual columns. (III) An empirical study of\nthree text embedding pipelines for TabPFNv2 and XGBoost\nwith the TabPFNv2 API and AutoGluon Tabular Predictor\nas baselines.\nOur study reveals the limitations of current methods and\nunderscores the need for new methods to handle tabular data\nwith free text.\n2. Related Work\nApproaches incorporating free-text in tabular learning\nlargely follow two paradigms. First, row-as-text meth\u0002ods serialize entire rows into prompts and delegate pre\u0002diction to a large language model (LLM), as seen in\nTABLLM (Hegselmann et al., 2022), TABLE-LLM (Zhang\net al., 2024). These work well when textual fields dominate\nor in few-shot settings. Second, per-column embedding\nstrategies extract textual embeddings from a single or groups\nof features, while preserving the structural nature of tabular\n1\narXiv:2507.07829v1 [cs.LG] 10 Jul 2025\nTowards Benchmarking Foundation Models for Tabular Data With Text\nFigure 1.

They embed each column using fastText or LLMs\nand then concatenate the resulting embeddings to the table,\nor replace the feature with its individual textual embed\u0002ding, cf. (Koloski et al., 2025; Carballo et al., 2023; Kim\net al., 2024). Grinsztajn et al. (2023) compare 30+ LLM\nand substring-based methods for embedding string columns,\nshowing when LLMs yield better representations.\nIn this study, we investigate pre-column embeddings be\u0002cause we focus on a many-shot setting (e.g., more than 32\ntraining samples), in which LLM-based predictive methods\ndo not perform well, cf. (Hegselmann et al., 2023) and (Ma\net al., 2024), or require a prohibitive amount of fine-tuning\n(Shysheya et al., 2025).\nMost popular prior tabular benchmarks contain no free-text\nfield, cf. (Bischl et al., 2019; Gijsbers et al., 2022; McEl\u0002fresh et al., 2023). For tabular data with text, Shi et al.\n(2021) curated 18 datasets with mixed modalities, but many\nrely almost entirely on text, with only one or two tabular\nfeatures, or features derived from the long text, e.g. # of\nwords (Tang et al., 2024). Thus, they benchmark text-based\nmodels rather than tabular models, focusing on text data\nwith tabular features. In contrast, we focus on tabular mod\u0002els extended to handle text, focusing on tabular data with\nadditional text features. Other studies were often limited to\nan evaluation with just one or two datasets (Carballo et al.,\n2023; Lu et al., 2023). Overall, existing studies for tabular\ndata with text lack a domain-agnostic benchmark where\ntextual features complement, rather than dominate, tabular\ndata. This motivates the new benchmark we present.\nThe CARTE Benchmark. The latest seminal work on\nbenchmarking for tabular data with text is the CARTE (Kim\net al., 2024) benchmark. It includes 51 datasets for tabu\u0002lar data with text. However, when we investigated these\ndatasets more closely, we found that at most 11 out of the\n51 datasets are suited to evaluate tabular data with text.\nMoreover, our manually curated collection of datasets for\nbenchmarking only includes 1 out of the 51 datasets.\nWe share an extensive report of our investigation in Ap\u0002pendix G. In short, we found that most datasets (a) do not\nrepresent predictive machine learning tasks for tabular data\nwith text; (b) are skewed towards text data representing\nmany categories instead of longer free text; (c) were pre\u0002processed manually per dataset with logic that seems to\nfavor CARTE; (d) or were very similar datasets from the\nsame domain, with the same features, or similar semantic\ncontent. Thus, while CARTE was a significant step toward\nbenchmarking and learning for tabular data with text, it falls\nshort in several aspects. Our work complements CARTE\u2019s\nefforts and aims to improve benchmarking for tabular data\nwith text further.\n3.

      "text": "Proceedings of the Third Workshop on Multimodal Artificial Intelligence, pages 69\u201373\nJune 6, 2021. \u00a92021 Association for Computational Linguistics\n69\nMultimodal-Toolkit: A Package for Learning on Tabular and\nText Data with Transformers\nKen Gu\nGeorgian\nken.gu@georgian.io\nAkshay Budhkar\nGeorgian\nakshay@georgian.io\nAbstract\nRecent progress in natural language process\u0002ing has led to Transformer architectures be\u0002coming the predominant model used for nat\u0002ural language tasks. However, in many real\u0002world datasets, additional modalities are in\u0002cluded which the Transformer does not di\u0002rectly leverage. We present Multimodal\u0002Toolkit,1\nan open-source Python package to\nincorporate text and tabular (categorical and\nnumerical) data with Transformers for down\u0002stream applications. Our toolkit integrates\nwell with Hugging Face\u2019s existing API such as\ntokenization and the model hub2 which allows\neasy download of different pre-trained models.\n1 Introduction\nIn recent years, Transformers (Vaswani et al.,\n2017) have become popular for model pre-training\n(Howard and Ruder, 2018; Peters et al., 2018; De\u0002vlin et al., 2019) and have yielded state-of-the-art\nresults on many natural language processing (NLP)\ntasks. In addition, well-documented Transformer\nlibraries such as Hugging Face Transformers (Wolf\net al., 2020), and AllenNLP (Gardner et al., 2018)\nhave democratized NLP, making it easier to pro\u0002ductionize and experiment on Transformers.\nHowever, there are not a lot of comprehensive\ntools for Transformers to work with tabular data.\nOften in real-world datasets, there are tabular data\nas well as unstructured text data which can pro\u0002vide meaningful signals for the task at hand. For\ninstance, in the small example in Figure 1, each\nrow is a data point. Columns Title and Review\nText contain text features, columns Division\nName, Class Name, and Department Name\ncontain categorical features, and the Age column\nis a numerical feature. To the best of our knowl\u0002edge, no tool exists that makes it simple for Trans\u0002formers to handle this extra modality. Therefore,\n1Github: https://git.io/JO5a6\n2https://huggingface.co/docs\nFigure 1: An example of a clothing review classifica\u0002tion dataset. Each row is a data point consisting of text,\ncategorical features, and numerical features.\ngiven the advances of Transformers for natural\nlanguage tasks and the maturity of existing Trans\u0002former libraries, we introduce Multimodal-Toolkit,\na lightweight Python package built on top of Hug\u0002ging Face Transformers. Our package extends ex\u0002isting Transformers in the Hugging Face\u2019s Trans\u0002formers library to seamlessly handle structured tab\u0002ular data while keeping the existing tokenization\n(including subword segmentation), experimental\npipeline, and pre-trained model hub functionalities\nof Hugging Face Transformers. We show the effec\u0002tiveness of our toolkit on three real-world datasets.\n2 Related Work\nThere have been several proposed Transformer\nmodels that aim to handle text features and addi\u0002tional features of another modality. For pre-trained\nTransformers on images and text, models such as\nViLBERT (Lu et al., 2019) and VLBERT (Su et al.,\n2020) are mainly the same as the original BERT\nmodel but treat the extra image modality as addi\u0002tional tokens to the input. These models require\npre-training on multimodal image and text data.\nOn the other hand, while treating image features\n70\nas additional input tokens, MMBT (Kiela et al.,\n2019) proposes to use pre-trained BERT directly\nand fine-tune on image and text data. This is simi\u0002lar to Multimodal-Toolkit in which no pre-training\non text and tabular data is needed.\nLikewise, Transformers have been adapted to\nalign, audio, visual, and text modalities in which\nthere is a natural ground truth alignment. MulT\n(Tsai et al., 2019) is similar to ViLBert in which\nco-attention is used between pairs of modalities but\nalso includes temporal convolutions so that input to\u0002kens are aware of their temporal neighbors. Mean\u0002while, Rahman et al. (2020) injects cross modality\nattention at certain Transformer layers via a gating\nmechanism.\nFinally, knowledge graph embeddings have also\nbeen effectively combined with input text tokens\nin Transformers. Ostendorff et al. (2019) com\u0002bines knowledge graph embeddings on authors\nwith book titles and other metadata features via\nsimple concatenation for book genre classification.\nOn the other hand, for more general language tasks,\nERNIE (Zhang et al., 2019) first matches the to\u0002kens in the input text with entities in the knowledge\ngraph. With this matching, the model fuses these\nembeddings to produce entity-aware text embed\u0002dings and text-aware entity embeddings.\nHowever, these models do not capture categor\u0002ical and numerical data explicitly. Hugging Face\ndoes include LXMERT (Tan and Bansal, 2019) to\nhandle language and vision modality but this can\nnot be easily adapted for categorical and numeri\u0002cal data. Nevertheless, existing multimodal Trans\u0002former models do give good insights into how to\ncombine categorical and numerical features. ViL\u0002BERT and VLBERT for example include image\nmodality as input tokens which lead to one of our\nsimple baseline of categorical and numerical fea\u0002tures as additional token inputs to the model. Like\u0002wise, the gating mechanism Rahman et al. (2020),\nattention, and different weighting schemes have\nall been shown to be useful in combining different\nmodalities.\n3 Design\nThe goal of Multimodal-Toolkit is to allow users\nto quickly adapt state-of-the-art Transformer mod\u0002els for situations involving text and tabular data\nwhich occur often in real-world datasets. More\u0002over, we want to bring the benefits of Transformers\nto more use cases while making it simple for users\nFigure 2: The framework of Multimodal-Toolkit.\nThere is a data processing module that outputs pro\u0002cessed text, numerical, and categorical features that are\nthen fed as input to our Transformer With Tabular mod\u0002ule consisting of a Hugging Face Transformer and our\ncombining module.\nof Hugging Face Transformers to adopt. Therefore,\nwe maintain the existing interface of the popular\nHugging Face Transformers library.\nThis design enables us to easily include more\nTransformer models, leverage strengths of spe\u0002cific models, use a feature-rich training pipeline,\nand integrate the thousands of community trained\nmodels on Hugging Face\u2019s model hub. We sup\u0002port a variety of Transformers (e.g. BERT, AL\u0002BERT, RoBERTa, XLNET) for both classification\nand regression tasks. All together, this becomes a\nreusable Transformer With Tabular component. We\nalso provide a data preprocessing module for cate\u0002gorical and numerical features. An overview of the\nsystem is shown in Figure 2. Currently, the library\nsupports PyTorch Transformers implementations.\n3.1 Combining Module\nWe implement a combining module that is model\nagnostic that takes as input, x, the text features\noutputted from a Transformer model and prepro\u0002cessed categorical (c) and numerical (n) features,\nand outputs a combined multimodal representation\nm. Although existing multimodal Transformers\nincorporate cross-modal attention inside middle\nTransformer layers, we choose the design in which\nthe modality combination comes after the Trans\u0002former because this module can be easily included\nwithout much adaptation of the existing Hugging\nFace Transformer interface and can be easily ex\u0002tended to new Transformers included in the future.\nInside the combining module, we implement var-\n71\nCombine Feature Method Equation\nText only m = x\nConcat m = x||c||n\nIndividual MLPs on categorical and\u0002numerical features then concat (MLP + Concat) m = x||MLP(c)||MLP(n)\nMLP on concatenated categorical and\nnumerical features then concat (Concat + MLP) m = x||MLP(c||n)\nAttention on categorical and numerical\nfeatures (Attention)\nm = \u03b1x,xWxx + \u03b1x,cWcc + \u03b1x,nWnn\n\u03b1i,j =\nexp(LeakyReLU(a\nT\n[Wixi||Wjxj ]))\nP\nk\u2208{x,c,n}\nexp(LeakyReLU(aT [Wixi||Wkxk]))\nGating on categorical and numerical\nfeatures and then sum (Rahman et al., 2020)\n(Gating)\nm = x + \u03b1h\nh = gc \f (Wcc...",

      "text": "<div><div><h5>Abstract</h5><p><span>Tabular data with text fields can be leveraged in applications such as financial risk assessment or medical diagnosis prediction. When employing multimodal approaches to make predictions based on these modalities, it is crucial to make the most appropriate modeling choices in terms of numerical feature encoding or fusion strategy. In this paper, we focus on multimodal classification tasks based on tabular datasets with text fields. We build on multimodal Transformers to propose the Tabular-Text Transformer (TTT), a tabular/text dual-stream Transformer network. This architecture includes a distance-to-quantile embedding scheme for numerical features and an overall attention module which concurrently considers self-attention and cross-modal attention. Further, we leverage the two well-informed modality streams to estimate whether a prediction is uncertain or not. To explain uncertainty in terms of feature values, we use a sampling-based approximation of Shapley values in a bimodal context, with two options for the value function. To show the efficacy and relevance of this approach, we compare it to six baselines and measure its ability to quantify and explain uncertainty against various methods.

      "text": "# How to Incorporate Tabular Data with HuggingFace Transformers\n\nIn real-world scenarios, we often encounter data that includes text and tabular features. Leveraging the latest advances for transformers, effectively handling situations with both data structures can increase performance in your models.\n\n* * *\n\n[comments](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2020/11/tabular-data-huggingface-transformers.html#comments)\n\n**By [Ken Gu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ken-gu/), Applied Research Scientist Intern at Georgian**.\n\nTransformer-based models are a game-changer when it comes to using unstructured text data. As of September 2020, the top-performing models in the General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE) benchmark are all BERT transformer-based models. At\u00a0[Georgian](http://georgian.io/), we find ourselves working with supporting tabular feature information as well as unstructured text data. We found that by using the tabular data in\u00a0[our models](http://georgian.io/platform/research-at-georgian/), we could further improve performance, so we set out to build a toolkit that makes it easier for others to do the same.\n\n![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%2090%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\n_The 9 tasks that are part of the GLUE benchmark._\n\n### Building on Top of Transformers\n\nThe main benefits of using transformers are that they can learn long-range dependencies between text and can be trained in parallel (as opposed to sequence to sequence models), meaning they can be pre-trained on large amounts of data.\n\nGiven these advantages, BERT is now a staple model in many real-world applications. Likewise, with libraries such as [HuggingFace Transformers](https://huggingface.co/transformers/), it\u2019s easy to build high-performance transformer models on common NLP problems.\n\nTransformer models using unstructured text data are well understood. However, in the real-world, text data is often supported by rich structured data or other unstructured data like audio or visual information. Each one of these might provide signals that one alone would not. We call these different ways of experiencing data \u2014 audio, visual, or text \u2014 modalities.\n\nThink about e-commerce reviews as an example. In addition to the review text itself, we also have information about the seller, buyer, and product available as numerical and categorical features.\n\nWe set out to explore how we could use text and tabular data together to provide stronger signals in our projects. We started by exploring the field known as multimodal learning, which focuses on how to process different modalities in machine learning.\n\n### Multimodal Literature Review\n\nThe current models for multimodal learning mainly focus on learning from the sensory modalities such as audio, visual, and text.\n\nWithin multimodal learning, there are several branches of research. The MultiComp Lab at Carnegie Mellon University provides an excellent\u00a0[taxonomy](http://multicomp.cs.cmu.edu/research/taxonomy/). Our problem falls under what is known as\u00a0**Multimodal Fusion \u2014** joining information from two or more modalities to make a prediction.\n\nAs text data is our primary modality, our review focues on the literature that treats text as the main modality and introduces models that leverage the transformer architecture.\n\n**Trivial Solution to Structured Data**\n\nBefore we dive into the literature, it\u2019s worth mentioning that there is a simple solution that can be used where the structured data is treated as regular text and is appended to the standard text inputs. Taking the e-commerce reviews example, the input can be structured as follows: Review. Buyer Info. Seller Info. Numbers/Labels. Etc. One caveat with this approach, however, is that it is limited by the maximum token length that a transformer can handle.\n\n### Transformer on Images and Text\n\nIn the last couple of years, transformer extensions for image and text have really advanced.\u00a0[Supervised Multimodal Bitransformers for Classifying Images and Text](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.02950.pdf)\u00a0by Kiela et al. (2019) uses pre-trained ResNet and pre-trained BERT features on unimodal images and text, respectively, and feeds this into a Bidirectional transformer. The key innovation is adapting the image features as additional tokens to the transformer model.\n\n![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%2090%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\n_An illustration of the multimodal transformer. This model takes the output of ResNet on subregions of the image as input image tokens._\n\nAdditionally, there are models \u2014\u00a0[ViLBERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.02265)\u00a0(Lu et al. 2019) and [VLBert](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.08530.pdf)\u00a0(Su et al. 2020) \u2014 that define pretraining tasks for images and text. Both models pre-train on the\u00a0[Conceptual Captions dataset](https://ai.google.com/research/ConceptualCaptions), which contains roughly 3.3 million image-caption pairs (web images with captions from alt text). In both cases, for any given image, a pre-trained object detection model like Faster R-CNN obtains vector representations for regions of the image, which count as input token embeddings to the transformer model.\n\n![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%2090%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\n_The VLBert model diagram. It takes image regions outputted by Faster R-CNN as input image tokens._\n\nAs an example, ViLBert pre-trains on the following training objectives:\n\n1. **Masked multimodal modeling:** Mask input image and word tokens. For the image, the model tries to predict a vector capturing image features for the corresponding image region, while for text, it predicts the masked text based on the textual and visual clues.\n2. **Multimodal alignment:** Whether the image and text pair are actually from the same image and caption pair.\n\n![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%2090%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\n_The two pre-training tasks for ViLBert._\n\n![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20172%20226'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\n![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20156%20141'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\n_An example of masked multimodal learning. Given the image and text, if we mask out_ dog _, then the model should be able to use the unmasked visual information to correctly predict the masked word to be_ dog _._\n\nAll these models use the bidirectional transformer model that is the backbone of BERT. The differences are the pre-training tasks the models are trained on and slight additions to the transformer. In the case of ViLBERT, the authors also introduce a co-attention transformer layer (shown below) to define the attention mechanism between the modalities explicitly.\n\n![](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%2090%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\n_The standard transformer block vs. the co-attention transformer block. The co-attention block injects attention-weighted vectors of another modality (linguistic, for example) into the hidden representations of the current modality (visual)._\n\nFinally, there\u2019s also\u00a0[LXMERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.07490)\u00a0(Tan and Mohit 2019), another pre-trained transformer model that, as of\u00a0[Transformers version 3.1.0](https://pypi.org/project/transformers/3.1.0/), is implemented as part of the library. The input to LXMERT is the same as ViLBERT and VLBERT. However, LXMERT pre-trains on aggregated datasets, which also include visual question answering datasets. In total, LXMERT pre-trains on 9.18 million image text pairs.\n\n### Transformers on Aligning Audio, Visual, and Text\n\nBeyond transformers for combining image and text, there are multimodal models for audio, video, and text modalities in which there is a natural ground truth temporal alignment. Papers for this approach include MulT, [Multimodal Transformer for Unaligned Multimodal Language Sequences](https://arx...",

Verify important information.[Learn more](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/agreements/trustworthy-ai/terms/)\nOver hundreds of Kaggle competitions, we&#8217;ve refined a playbook that consistently lands us near the top of the leaderboard\u2014no matter if we\u2019re working with millions of rows, missing values, or test sets that behave nothing like the training data. This isn\u2019t just a collection of modeling tricks\u2014it\u2019s a repeatable system for solving real-world tabular problems fast.\nBelow are seven of our most battle-tested techniques, each one made practical through GPU acceleration. Whether you\u2019re climbing the leaderboard or deploying models in production, these strategies can give you an edge.\nWe\u2019ve included links to example write-ups or notebooks from past competitions for each technique.\n**Note:**Kaggle and Google Colab notebooks come with free GPUs and accelerated drop-ins like the ones you\u2019ll see below pre-installed.\n## Core principles: the foundations of a winning workflow[**](#core_principles_the_foundations_of_a_winning_workflow)\nBefore diving into techniques, it\u2019s worth pausing to cover the two principles that power everything in this playbook: fast experimentation and careful validation. These aren\u2019t optional best practices\u2014they\u2019re the foundation of how we approach every tabular modeling problem.\n### Fast experimentation[**](#fast_experimentation)\nThe biggest lever we have in any competition or real-world project is the number of high-quality experiments we can run. The more we iterate, the more patterns we discover\u2014and the faster we catch when a model is failing, drifting, or overfitting\u2014so we can course-correct early and improve faster.\nIn practice, that means we optimize our entire pipeline for speed, not just our model training step.\n**Here\u2019s how we make it work:**\n* Accelerate dataframe operations using[GPU drop-in replacements](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/7-drop-in-replacements-to-instantly-speed-up-your-python-data-science-workflows/?linkId=100000376196126)for pandas or Polars to transform and engineer features at scale.\n* Train models with[NVIDIA cuML](https://developer.nvidia.com/topics/ai/data-science/cuda-x-data-science-libraries/cuml)or GPU backends of XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost.\nGPU acceleration isn\u2019t just for deep learning\u2014it&#8217;s often the only way to make advanced tabular techniques practical at scale.\n### Local Validation[**](#local_validation)\nIf you can\u2019t trust your validation score, you\u2019re flying blind. That\u2019s why cross-validation (CV) is a cornerstone to our workflow.\n**Our approach:**\n* Use k-fold cross-validation, where the model trains on most of the data and tests on the part that\u2019s held out.\n* Rotate through folds so every part of the data is tested once.\nThis gives a much more reliable measure of performance than a single train/validation split.\n**Pro tip:**Match your CV strategy to how the test data is structured.\n**For example:**\n* Use TimeSeriesSplit for time-dependent data\n* Use GroupKFold for grouped data (like users or patients)\nWith those foundations in place\u2014moving fast and validating carefully\u2014we can now dive into the techniques themselves. Each one builds on these principles and shows how we turn raw data into world-class models.\n## 1. Start with smarter EDA, not just the basics[**](#1_start_with_smarter_eda_not_just_the_basics)\nMost practitioners know the basics: Check for missing values, outliers, correlations, and feature ranges. Those steps are important, but they\u2019re table stakes. To build models that hold up in the real world, you need to explore the data a little deeper\u2014a couple of quick checks that we\u2019ve found useful, but many people miss:\n**Train vs. test distribution checks:**Spot when evaluation data differs from training, since distribution shift can cause models to validate well but fail in deployment.\n*Figure 1. Comparing feature distributions between train (blue) and test (red) reveals a clear shift\u2014test data is concentrated in a higher range, with minimal overlap. This kind of distribution shift can cause models to validate well but fail in deployment.*\n**Analyze target variable for temporal patterns:**Check for trends or seasonality, since ignoring temporal patterns can lead to models that look accurate in training but break in production.\n*Figure 2. Analyzing the target variable over time uncovers a strong upward trend with seasonal fluctuations and accelerating growth. Ignoring temporal patterns like these can mislead models unless time-aware validation is used.*\nThese techniques aren&#8217;t brand new\u2014but they\u2019re often overlooked, and ignoring them can sink a project.\n**Why it matters:**Skipping these checks can derail an otherwise solid workflow.\n**In action:**In the winning solution to the Amazon KDD Cup \u201823, the team uncovered both a train\u2014test distribution shift and temporal patterns in the target\u2014insights that shaped the final approach.[Read the full write-up &gt;](https://openreview.net/forum?id=J3wj55kK5t)\n**Made practical with GPUs:**Real-world datasets are often millions of rows, which can slow to a crawl in pandas.
