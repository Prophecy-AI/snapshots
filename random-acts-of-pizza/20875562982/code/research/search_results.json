Compared with other Kaggle competitions I had tried before, I found this one\u00a0a bit easier because\u00a0the dataset is not very large (~5,000 records) and is hence perfect for model experimenting, and, more importantly, the competition is based on a real\u00a0[research](http://cs.stanford.edu/~althoff/raop-dataset/altruistic_requests_icwsm.pdf) done by a couple Stanford researchers, which provides me with a lot of guidelines in how to proceed. As my first shot, following the\u00a0paper, I replicated their\u00a0study by constructing\u00a0the same set of variables, and used\u00a0them to train a few predictive models. The result, .69 ROC, landed me at [No. 13](https://www.kaggle.com/c/random-acts-of-pizza/leaderboard) (out of 110)! I have put all my code on [github](https://github.com/Runze/pizza) (including the part related to topic modeling and data exploration) and here is a detailed explanation of what I did.\n\n**Topic modeling**\n\nFollowing the authors\u2019 strategy, the first thing I did was mining the requests (as it turned out, there are a fair amount of posts with blank content. Hence, I concatenated the request content\u00a0with the request title). After cleaning them up, removing stop words and keeping only nouns (using the [openNLP](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/openNLP/openNLP.pdf) package), I created a document-term matrix (DTM) using them and removed the very high- and low-frequency words (as they don\u2019t\u00a0help separate\u00a0topics) using the\u00a0[term frequency\u2013inverse document frequency](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf)\u00a0(tf-idf)\u00a0metric (per the method and code\u00a0described in this [vignette](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/topicmodels/vignettes/topicmodels.pdf)). Using this trimmed DTM, I applied the\u00a0[Latent Dirichlet allocation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_Dirichlet_allocation) (LDA) algorithm from the topicmodels package (again per the vignette linked above) to identify topics. Note in the paper, the authors used \u201cnon-negative matrix factorization (NMF)\u201d to perform topic modeling. However, I wasn\u2019t able to find a package in R to do that. That aside, the 10 buckets of topics I got are not as clearly defined and distinguished as those found by the authors. In fact, I couldn\u2019t\u00a0see any clear-cut difference in the frequent terms used in my\u00a0topics at all.\u00a0Curious, I tried to find the optimal number of topics through a 10-fold cross-validation and evaluated the resulting split using perplexity, which, as defined in the vignette, uses the log likelihood and shares an inverse relationship with it (hence, the lower the perplexity the better the model fits).\u00a0Funnily, the results, as shown below, suggest 10 is indeed the optimal split (in the range of 2 to 10):\n\n![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Runze/pizza/master/perplex.jpg)\n\nPerhaps a little hard to see, but 8 out of 10 cross-validation holdout sets picked 10 as the optimal value.\u00a0Here are the most frequent terms used in the 10\u00a0topics identified by my model:\n\n![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Runze/pizza/master/lda10.png)\n\n![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Runze/pizza/master/lda9.png)\n\n![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Runze/pizza/master/lda8.png)\n\n![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Runze/pizza/master/lda7.png)\n\n![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Runze/pizza/master/lda6.png)\n\n![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Runze/pizza/master/lda5.png)\n\n![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Runze/pizza/master/lda4.png)\n\n![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Runze/pizza/master/lda3.png)\n\n![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Runze/pizza/master/lda2.png)\n\n![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Runze/pizza/master/lda1.png)\n\nAlthough there are some patterns detected such as financial difficulties, family, parties, and so on, they are far less clear than\u00a0those identified by the paper. Besides the different algorithms\u00a0used, it may as\u00a0well\u00a0be that the authors performed more sophisticated cleaning and mining than I did. Out of curiosity, in addition to topic modeling, I also tried simple spherical k-means which, by default, restricts one document to only\u00a0one cluster and hence forces the \u201ctopic\u201d separation. As a result, my resulting 5 clusters (not shown here) are more different from each other and the patterns are closer to those found by the authors. Nevertheless, topic modeling\u00a0was _heaps_ of fun!\n\n**Create and explore variables**\n\nFollowing the authors\u2019 methodology, I created the same set of variables that\u00a0they used in their logistic regression. With regard to what these variables are, what they represent, and how they are constructed, please refer to the original paper. Here, I\u2019ll just show their relationship with the success rate of the pizza request. First, let\u2019s look at the 5 narrative buckets created using the key words suggested by the authors. They are created by matching the requests against those key words using regular expressions, counting the frequencies, dividing those by the total\u00a0length of the request (including the title), and converted them into deciles. Here are the relationships between the deciles and the success rate for each bucket (the 0 deciles shown below\u00a0represent the requests that do not have any key words for a particular bucket):\n\n![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Runze/pizza/master/narrative.jpg)\n\nInterestingly, with the exception of money and craving,\u00a0these narrative categories do not exhibit a clear linear relationship with the outcome. One\u00a0of the reasons is that no other factors that may drive the outcome are\u00a0controlled yet. At least for those that do show a clear trend, the relationship is in line with what the study has found (e.g., more mentions of money troubles lead to a greater chance of success whereas more mentions of craving lead to the opposite).\n\nThe other\u00a0variables are more straightforward and their outcome is also more intuitive. Hence, I\u2019ll just show their relationship with the success rate\u00a0here. You can find the creation process in my code linked above.\n\n![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Runze/pizza/master/explore.jpeg)\n\n**Training models**\n\nNow that we have all the variables, we can finally train some models! The first model I tried is the same logistic regression used by the authors. Even without the paper, I think logistic regression, or linear regression in general, should always be the first thing to try because its inference\u00a0power is very\u00a0valuable in understanding the relationship between the explanatory\u00a0variables and the outcome. Even if prediction is the sole purpose, I think it\u2019s necessary, not to mention fun, to understand what the model can tell us about the hidden relationships. Here are the coefficients and their statistical significance I got from the logit\u00a0model:\n\n![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Runze/pizza/master/screenshot.png)\n\nComparing with the paper, I found my\u00a0results are generally in line with the\u00a0authors\u2019. Specifically, we both found that gratitude, hyperlink (e.g., image), reciprocity, request length, karma, whether...",

      "text": "Random Acts of Pizza: Success Factors of Online Requests\nTim Althoff and Niloufar Salehi and Tuan Nguyen\n{althoff, niloufar, tylernht}@stanford.edu\nProject Group Number: 25\nAbstract\nMany online communities such as Q&A sites, crowd-funding\nplatforms, and online charities are based on users request\u0002ing from one another and receiving responses from within\nthe community; the success of these requests is critical to the\nsuccess of the community. In this paper, we explore the vari\u0002ous factors that influence success. One of the most interesting\naspects in this regard is how the formulation of the requests\naffects it\u2019s chances of succeeding. We argue that previous at\u0002tempts at unraveling factors of success were complicated by\ntheir diverse nature. We introduce a dataset of several thou\u0002sand of requests over the course of more than two years where\nevery requests asks for the very same, a pizza. This allows us\nto analyze the question of how successful request were made,\nin a way that has not been approached before. Our findings\ninclude that putting in some effort, creating a sense of trust,\nand the constructing the right kind of narrative are signifi\u0002cantly correlated with success.\nIntroduction\nWe live in a time where we increasingly turn to the web for\nhelp. However, our needs often go far beyond what a public\ndomain can offer, we need help from real people. A large\nnumber of platforms allow users to post requests through\nwhich they can ask others for help. Understanding the dy\u0002namics of successful requests is critical in many domains\nsuch as crowdfunding projects for startups on crowdfunding\nplatforms like Kickstarter [4], asking for answers to specific\nquestions on Quora [7] or StackOverflow [9], disadvantaged\npeople asking for loans on social peer to peer lending sites\nsuch as Kiva [5] or donations to non-profits and charities\nsuch as GlobalGiving [3] or Donors Choose [2], and people\nfacing hardship and asking for help on online communities\nsuch as Reddit [8]. Not all of these requests are success\u0002ful however, which raises the question of what differentiates\nthe fortunate. Prior research suggests aspects such as what\nis asked for, how it is asked, and who is asking whom as\nlargely influential in the process.\nWe explore these factors by simplifying some of the com\u0002plexities faced in previous work. In this paper we present\na novel case study of factors of online requests that natu\u0002rally controls for the subject of the request (try asking the\nCopyright \rc 2013, Stanford Social Network Analysis course\nproject (CS224W). All rights reserved.\ninternet for a Ferrari!). Further, we eliminate group dynam\u0002ics by looking at requests that a single person could satisfy.\nMoreover, knowledge gathering platforms discourage dupli\u0002cate requests (questions) and thereby introducing complex\nbiases (particularly, when one is trying to control for con\u0002tent to try to understand how people are asking for it). In\nthis project, we study \u201cRandom Acts of Pizza\u201d, an online\ncommunity devoted to giving away free pizzas to strangers\nthat ask for one. We argue that this is a unique platform for\nour study since all requests ask for the same thing, a pizza.\nCompared to many previously studied settings, the structure\nof textual requests in this particular community is relatively\nsimple. For instance, prior interaction between the requester\nand the giver before the request or during the decision mak\u0002ing process is rare and there are no video messages or com\u0002munication (as on Kickstarter) that have been shown to have\na strong influence on success [28]. Furthermore, it is not dis\u0002couraged to post a request with similar content to an existing\nrequest. This is not the case in the study of online popularity,\nQ&A sites or Kickstarter-like crowdfunding platforms.\nOur contribution in this paper is three-fold: (1) We present\na new dataset of online requests that all ask for the same\nthing and that has, to the best of our knowledge, not been\nsubject to scientific analysis before. (2) We present an anal\u0002ysis of various factors of success for online requests through\nmatching and statistical hypothesis testing. (3) We trans\u0002late our findings into concrete guidelines for the requester\nto maximize her chances of success.\nWe find that several factors are significantly correlated\nwith success of online requests: It helps to put in effort to\nwrite a longer narrative, to create a sense of trust by telling a\npersonal story and including pictures, to signal to give back\nto the community in the future, and to be an active and well\u0002regarded member of the community (see Results section for\nmore details and a discussion)\nThe remainder of this paper is structured as follows. We\nfirst present related work on success of online requests. Then\nthe problem statement and the corresponding dataset is in\u0002troduced. The next section elaborates on several factors that\ncould have an impact on success. We explain our methodol\u0002ogy in Methods section before we summarize our findings\nin the Results section. Lastly, we conclude this paper with\na short discussion and summary and describe avenues for\nfuture work.\nRelated Work\nIn the following, we review related work in the domain of\nonline requests and different factors of success such as con\u0002tent, temporal dynamics, the narrative, user similarity and\nstatus.\nThe Cost Spectrum of Online Interaction\nOnline communities and online social networks allow users\nto interact with each other as well as each other\u2019s content.\nMost will allow you to like or up-vote posts of other people,\nto (re)share them, or to comment on them. These modes of\ninteractions have been studied extensively in the context of\nonline popularity [23, 35]. Often the goal of studying online\npopularity is to understand what drivers user consumption,\nwhat content to display on websites, or how to design \u201cviral\u201d\nmarketing campaigns.\nOne dimension that has (to the best of our knowledge) not\nbeen studied explicitly yet is the cost of these interactions.\nVotes, re-shares and comments are usually free of charge\nand also cost very little time. Thus, the threshold to interact\nin these ways is fairly low and they happen relatively often.\nHowever, other modes of interaction have higher costs. For\ninstance, answering somebody else\u2019s question might take\nconsiderable effort and time, and help funding projects on\ncrowdsourcing platforms or donating to certain non-profits\neven comes at a financial cost. In contrast to the mentioned\nlow cost interactions people specifically ask for a nontrivial\namount of help. The act of asking for something is com\u0002monly called a request (see our problem definition below)\nand have adopted this terminology in this paper.\nHowever, determining the factors that influence popu\u0002larity poses similar challenges in that the content either\nneeds to be modeled explicitely [35] or controlled for [23].\nLakkaraju et al. [23] use resubmissions of the same content\n(in this case a picture) to control for content and study how\nthe title, the community, and the time matter for online pop\u0002ularity. When analyzing factors of success of online requests\nthis \u201ccontent\u201d is very similar to \u201cwhat is being asked for\u201d. In\nthis paper, we attempt to understand how one should ask for\nit by controlling what is being asked for.\nTemporal Dynamics of Successful Requests\nPrevious research has largely focused on crowdfunding plat\u0002forms such as Kickstarter [4] or peer to peer lending sites\nsuch as Prosper [6] and more often studied their temporal\ndynamics rather than the content of the requests. For in\u0002stance, Ceyhan et al. [16] find that loans with some early\nfunding are more likely to get fully funded (coined herd\u0002ing effect). Similar effects were found on Kickstarter when\nmodeling funding success as a time series prediction task\nthat included previous donations as well as social features\nsuch as the number of tweets about the project [18]. Partic\u0002ularly, the last donation to fully fund a project was found\nto exhibit special characteristics such...",

The benchmark is simply guessing that no pizzas are given (or all). This results in an AUC score of 50.\nTo beat the AUC = 50 benchmark with a simple model, I first looked at the training and test data to find simple features. I decided to use the word counts of the request title and comment text, as longer comments might be skipped by readers.\nTo build the model I first extracted only the desired fields from the original JSON files with jq and used json2csv to write out CSV.\n```\ncat train.json|jq -c'.[]'|json2csv -p -k=request\\_id,requester\\_received\\_pizza,request\\_title,request\\_text\\_edit\\_aware -d=\"|\"&gt;train\\_1.csv\ncat test.json|jq -c'.[]'|json2csv -p -k=request\\_id,request\\_title,request\\_text\\_edit\\_aware -d=\"|\"&gt;test\\_1.csv\n```\nI then built a very basic random forest model using the default settings in scikit-learn. With a 80/20 training/test split I achieved a local AUC of about 0.52 (single validation). Using the entire training set to build a random forest, I was able to score an AUC of 0.51274 on the competition leaderboard.\nNot great, but not bad for a very simple model.\n```\nimportpandasaspdfromsklearnimportcross\\_validationfromsklearnimportensemblefromsklearnimportmetricstrain=pd.read\\_csv('train\\_1.csv',delimiter='|')test=pd.read\\_csv('test\\_1.csv',delimiter='|')# Create text word count and title word count fields and binarize pizza receivedtrain.requester\\_received\\_pizza=train.requester\\_received\\_pizza.apply(lambdax:1ifxelse0)train['title\\_count']=train.request\\_title.apply(lambdax:len(x.split()))train['text\\_count']=train.request\\_text\\_edit\\_aware.apply(lambdax:len(str(x).split()))test['title\\_count']=test.request\\_title.apply(lambdax:len(x.split()))test['text\\_count']=test.request\\_text\\_edit\\_aware.apply(lambdax:len(str(x).split()))# Create training and testing arrays as well as validation splitstrain\\_X=train.drop(['request\\_id',u'requester\\_received\\_pizza',u'request\\_title',u'request\\_text\\_edit\\_aware'],axis=1).valuestrain\\_y=train.requester\\_received\\_pizza.valuesX,X\\_,y,y\\_=cross\\_validation.train\\_test\\_split(train\\_X,train\\_y,test\\_size=0.2)test\\_X=test.drop(['request\\_id','request\\_title','request\\_text\\_edit\\_aware'],axis=1).values# Train and test random forest modelrf=ensemble.RandomForestClassifier()# Default valuesrf.fit(X,y)y\\_rf=rf.predict(X\\_)printmetrics.roc\\_auc\\_score(y\\_,y\\_rf)# Train model with full training data and predict test y'srf.fit(train\\_X,train\\_y)y\\_test\\_rf=rf.predict(test\\_X)# Write submission filetest\\_out=pd.DataFrame({'request\\_id':test.request\\_id.values,'requester\\_received\\_pizza':y\\_test\\_rf.astype('int')})test\\_out.to\\_csv('rf1.csv',index=False)\n```\n[Sign up for free](https://gist.github.com/join?source=comment-gist)**to join this conversation on GitHub**.\nAlready have an account?[Sign in to comment](https://gist.github.com/login?return_to=https://gist.github.com/roycoding/1e24bce664cce16503b8)\nYou can\u2019t perform that action at this time.\n</div>",

The benchmark is simply guessing that no pizzas are given (or all). This results in an AUC score of 50.\n\nTo beat the AUC = 50 benchmark with a simple model, I first looked at the training and test data to find simple features. I decided to use the word counts of the request title and comment text, as longer comments might be skipped by readers.\n\nTo build the model I first extracted only the desired fields from the original JSON files with jq and used json2csv to write out CSV.\n\n```\ncat train.json|jq -c '.[]' | json2csv -p -k=request_id,requester_received_pizza,request_title,request_text_edit_aware -d=\"|\" > train_1.csv\n\ncat test.json|jq -c '.[]' | json2csv -p -k=request_id,request_title,request_text_edit_aware -d=\"|\" > test_1.csv\n```\n\nI then built a very basic random forest model using the default settings in scikit-learn. With a 80/20 training/test split I achieved a local AUC of about 0.52 (single validation). Using the entire training set to build a random forest, I was able to score an AUC of 0.51274 on the competition leaderboard.\n\nNot great, but not bad for a very simple model.\n\n```\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom sklearn import cross_validation\nfrom sklearn import ensemble\nfrom sklearn import metrics\n\ntrain = pd.read_csv('train_1.csv',delimiter='|')\ntest = pd.read_csv('test_1.csv',delimiter='|')\n\n# Create text word count and title word count fields and binarize pizza received\ntrain.requester_received_pizza = train.requester_received_pizza.apply(lambda x: 1 if x else 0)\ntrain['title_count'] = train.request_title.apply(lambda x: len(x.split()))\ntrain['text_count'] = train.request_text_edit_aware.apply(lambda x: len(str(x).split()))\n\ntest['title_count'] = test.request_title.apply(lambda x: len(x.split()))\ntest['text_count'] = test.request_text_edit_aware.apply(lambda x: len(str(x).split()))\n\n# Create training and testing arrays as well as validation splits\ntrain_X = train.drop(['request_id', u'requester_received_pizza', u'request_title', u'request_text_edit_aware'],axis=1).values\ntrain_y = train.requester_received_pizza.values\nX,X_,y,y_ = cross_validation.train_test_split(train_X,train_y,test_size=0.2)\n\ntest_X = test.drop(['request_id','request_title','request_text_edit_aware'],axis=1).values\n\n# Train and test random forest model\nrf = ensemble.RandomForestClassifier() # Default values\nrf.fit(X,y)\ny_rf = rf.predict(X_)\nprint metrics.roc_auc_score(y_,y_rf)\n\n# Train model with full training data and predict test y's\nrf.fit(train_X,train_y)\ny_test_rf = rf.predict(test_X)\n\n# Write submission file\ntest_out = pd.DataFrame({'request_id':test.request_id.values,'requester_received_pizza':y_test_rf.astype('int')})\ntest_out.to_csv('rf1.csv',index=False)\n```\n\n[Sign up for free](https://gist.github.com/join?source=comment-gist) **to join this conversation on GitHub**.\nAlready have an account?\n[Sign in to comment](https://gist.github.com/login?return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fgist.github.com%2Froycoding%2F1e24bce664cce16503b8)\n\nYou can\u2019t perform that action at this time.",
