      "text": "The Random\u202fActs\u202fof\u202fPizza (RAOP) competition asks you to predict whether a Reddit request for a free pizza will be fulfilled. Because the data set is relatively small (\u22485\u202f000 rows) and contains both a free\u2011form text request and a rich set of request\u2011level metadata, the biggest gains come from turning those raw fields into informative, low\u2011dimensional features rather than from sophisticated model architectures alone.\n\n**Text\u2011based engineering** \u2013 The most common approach is to vectorise the request body with\u202f`sklearn.feature_extraction.text` utilities (e.g.,\u202fTF\u2011IDF on unigrams and bigrams) and then prune the sparse matrix with dimensionality reduction such as truncated\u202fSVD/LSA\u202f([notebook.community](https://notebook.community/omaraltaher/kaggle-pizza-project/Random_Acts_of_Pizza_Kaggle_Competition_Project); [caroarriaga.com](https://www.caroarriaga.com/projects/raop)).\u202fTopic modelling (LDA) and the narrative lexicons introduced in the original Stanford study (desire, family, job, money, student) further condense semantic information into a handful of numeric scores\u202f([runze.github.io](https://runze.github.io/technical-posts/random-acts-of-pizza)).\u202fThese text features are usually combined with simple readability or length metrics (character/word count, presence of URLs or images) to capture request effort.\n\n**User\u2011 and request\u2011metadata engineering** \u2013 The dataset ships with dozens of structured fields such as the requester\u2019s account age, total karma, prior activity on r/RandomActsOfPizza, time\u2011of\u2011day and day\u2011of\u2011week of the post, and whether the request includes a \u201cthank\u2011you\u201d note\u202f([stanford.edu](https://cs.stanford.edu/~althoff/raop-dataset)).\u202fCreating derived variables (e.g.,\u202flog\u2011transformed karma, interaction terms between community\u2011age and request\u2011length, binary flags for gratitude or image inclusion) has been shown to boost predictive power.\u202fWhen these dense metadata vectors are concatenated with the reduced\u2011dimensional text representation, models such as logistic regression, random forests or gradient\u2011boosted trees achieve the best leaderboard scores (the author of the Runze post reported a\u202f0.69\u202fROC and a top\u201115 finish)\u202f([runze.github.io](https://runze.github.io/technical-posts/random-acts-of-pizza)).\n\nIn practice, the most effective pipeline for RAOP\u2011style Reddit classification competitions therefore follows three steps: (1) clean and tokenise the request text, generate TF\u2011IDF n\u2011gram features and optionally topic\u2011model scores; (2) extract and transform user/request metadata (karma, account age, posting time, gratitude cues, request length); and (3) reduce the high\u2011dimensional text matrix with SVD before concatenating it with the dense metadata and feeding the combined feature set to a regularised linear model or an ensemble tree method. This blend of sparse linguistic signals and rich behavioural attributes consistently outperforms models that rely on either source alone.",

Since it's a binary classification problem, we will explore several algorithms with a focus on logistic regression.

The original columns consist of 19 integer values, 4 floats, and 8 objects (there is one boolean column which is the outcome variable). In order to extract predictive value from the dataset a good deal of pre-processing and feature engineering was required.

This work was the final project of the course Applied Machine Learning. _Authors: Carolina Arriaga, Kanika Mahajan._\n**Overview**\n> We used data from the Kaggle competition Random Acts of Pizza to train multiple classifiers to predict a binary class. We used feature engineering by collecting user metadata and adding text-based features. We also applied dimensionality reduction using SVD. We explored four models: Logistic regression, Random Forests (Ada and XGB), Multilayer Neural Network, and Dense Neural Network. Finally, we proceeded with the hyperparameter tuning. We were able to predict whether a user would get a pizza or not.\n* * *\n* * *\n## Templates (for web app):\nLoading\u2026\n# Error\nSorry, an error occurred while loading .\nForwardBack[Permalink](https://www.caroarriaga.com/projects/raop/)Dark Mode",

Compared with other Kaggle competitions I had tried before, I found this one\u00a0a bit easier because\u00a0the dataset is not very large (~5,000 records) and is hence perfect for model experimenting, and, more importantly, the competition is based on a real\u00a0[research](http://cs.stanford.edu/~althoff/raop-dataset/altruistic_requests_icwsm.pdf) done by a couple Stanford researchers, which provides me with a lot of guidelines in how to proceed. As my first shot, following the\u00a0paper, I replicated their\u00a0study by constructing\u00a0the same set of variables, and used\u00a0them to train a few predictive models. The result, .69 ROC, landed me at [No. 13](https://www.kaggle.com/c/random-acts-of-pizza/leaderboard) (out of 110)! I have put all my code on [github](https://github.com/Runze/pizza) (including the part related to topic modeling and data exploration) and here is a detailed explanation of what I did.\n\n**Topic modeling**\n\nFollowing the authors\u2019 strategy, the first thing I did was mining the requests (as it turned out, there are a fair amount of posts with blank content. Hence, I concatenated the request content\u00a0with the request title). After cleaning them up, removing stop words and keeping only nouns (using the [openNLP](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/openNLP/openNLP.pdf) package), I created a document-term matrix (DTM) using them and removed the very high- and low-frequency words (as they don\u2019t\u00a0help separate\u00a0topics) using the\u00a0[term frequency\u2013inverse document frequency](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf)\u00a0(tf-idf)\u00a0metric (per the method and code\u00a0described in this [vignette](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/topicmodels/vignettes/topicmodels.pdf)). Using this trimmed DTM, I applied the\u00a0[Latent Dirichlet allocation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_Dirichlet_allocation) (LDA) algorithm from the topicmodels package (again per the vignette linked above) to identify topics. Note in the paper, the authors used \u201cnon-negative matrix factorization (NMF)\u201d to perform topic modeling. However, I wasn\u2019t able to find a package in R to do that. That aside, the 10 buckets of topics I got are not as clearly defined and distinguished as those found by the authors. In fact, I couldn\u2019t\u00a0see any clear-cut difference in the frequent terms used in my\u00a0topics at all.\u00a0Curious, I tried to find the optimal number of topics through a 10-fold cross-validation and evaluated the resulting split using perplexity, which, as defined in the vignette, uses the log likelihood and shares an inverse relationship with it (hence, the lower the perplexity the better the model fits).\u00a0Funnily, the results, as shown below, suggest 10 is indeed the optimal split (in the range of 2 to 10):\n\n![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Runze/pizza/master/perplex.jpg)\n\nPerhaps a little hard to see, but 8 out of 10 cross-validation holdout sets picked 10 as the optimal value.\u00a0Here are the most frequent terms used in the 10\u00a0topics identified by my model:\n\n![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Runze/pizza/master/lda10.png)\n\n![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Runze/pizza/master/lda9.png)\n\n![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Runze/pizza/master/lda8.png)\n\n![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Runze/pizza/master/lda7.png)\n\n![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Runze/pizza/master/lda6.png)\n\n![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Runze/pizza/master/lda5.png)\n\n![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Runze/pizza/master/lda4.png)\n\n![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Runze/pizza/master/lda3.png)\n\n![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Runze/pizza/master/lda2.png)\n\n![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Runze/pizza/master/lda1.png)\n\nAlthough there are some patterns detected such as financial difficulties, family, parties, and so on, they are far less clear than\u00a0those identified by the paper. Besides the different algorithms\u00a0used, it may as\u00a0well\u00a0be that the authors performed more sophisticated cleaning and mining than I did. Out of curiosity, in addition to topic modeling, I also tried simple spherical k-means which, by default, restricts one document to only\u00a0one cluster and hence forces the \u201ctopic\u201d separation. As a result, my resulting 5 clusters (not shown here) are more different from each other and the patterns are closer to those found by the authors. Nevertheless, topic modeling\u00a0was _heaps_ of fun!\n\n**Create and explore variables**\n\nFollowing the authors\u2019 methodology, I created the same set of variables that\u00a0they used in their logistic regression. With regard to what these variables are, what they represent, and how they are constructed, please refer to the original paper. Here, I\u2019ll just show their relationship with the success rate of the pizza request. First, let\u2019s look at the 5 narrative buckets created using the key words suggested by the authors. They are created by matching the requests against those key words using regular expressions, counting the frequencies, dividing those by the total\u00a0length of the request (including the title), and converted them into deciles. Here are the relationships between the deciles and the success rate for each bucket (the 0 deciles shown below\u00a0represent the requests that do not have any key words for a particular bucket):\n\n![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Runze/pizza/master/narrative.jpg)\n\nInterestingly, with the exception of money and craving,\u00a0these narrative categories do not exhibit a clear linear relationship with the outcome. One\u00a0of the reasons is that no other factors that may drive the outcome are\u00a0controlled yet. At least for those that do show a clear trend, the relationship is in line with what the study has found (e.g., more mentions of money troubles lead to a greater chance of success whereas more mentions of craving lead to the opposite).\n\nThe other\u00a0variables are more straightforward and their outcome is also more intuitive. Hence, I\u2019ll just show their relationship with the success rate\u00a0here. You can find the creation process in my code linked above.\n\n![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Runze/pizza/master/explore.jpeg)\n\n**Training models**\n\nNow that we have all the variables, we can finally train some models! The first model I tried is the same logistic regression used by the authors. Even without the paper, I think logistic regression, or linear regression in general, should always be the first thing to try because its inference\u00a0power is very\u00a0valuable in understanding the relationship between the explanatory\u00a0variables and the outcome. Even if prediction is the sole purpose, I think it\u2019s necessary, not to mention fun, to understand what the model can tell us about the hidden relationships. Here are the coefficients and their statistical significance I got from the logit\u00a0model:\n\n![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Runze/pizza/master/screenshot.png)\n\nComparing with the paper, I found my\u00a0results are generally in line with the\u00a0authors\u2019. Specifically, we both found that gratitude, hyperlink (e.g., image), reciprocity, request length, karma, whether...",

This code and the subsequent writeup were created for the relevant kaggle competition (see [https://www.kaggle.com/c/random-acts-of-pizza](https://www.kaggle.com/c/random-acts-of-pizza)) and as a final project for STAT 365 at Yale.\n\nThe goal of the project was simple: to determine the features of a successful (i.e. pizza-obtaining) post in the subreddit and train a high-accuracy model to predict whether a new post will be successful.\n\nNote that much of the code/analysis is reproducing the results achieved in the academic paper linked to in the kaggle competition.\n\n## The Data\n\nThe data is in the `/data` directory, and was all downloaded from the Kaggle competition. See [https://www.kaggle.com/c/random-acts-of-pizza/data](https://www.kaggle.com/c/random-acts-of-pizza/data) for a detailed description of the data.\n\n## The Code\n\nAll the code and .rda files generated by the code used for the analysis are in the `/R` directory. The main analysis code is all in `pizza_analysis_final.R` \\-\\- it's separated into sections with comments. Note that this code expects the current working directory to be the `/R` directory in order for file paths to work.\n\n### Required packages\n\nThe following R packages are required to run all of the code:\n\n- rjson\n- NLP\n- openNLP\n- clValid\n- lda\n- qdap\n- adabag\n- ROCR\n\n## Methods and Results of Analysis\n\nSee the writeup pdf in the `/writeup` directory for full details on the methods used here and the results.\n\n## About\n\nA formal machine learning-driven analysis of the r/randomactsofpizza subreddit\n\n### Resources\n\n[Readme](https://github.com/iangonzalez/reddit-pizza-analysis#readme-ov-file)\n\n[Activity](https://github.com/iangonzalez/reddit-pizza-analysis/activity)\n\n### Stars\n\n[**1**\\\nstar](https://github.com/iangonzalez/reddit-pizza-analysis/stargazers)\n\n### Watchers\n\n[**2**\\\nwatching](https://github.com/iangonzalez/reddit-pizza-analysis/watchers)\n\n### Forks\n\n[**0**\\\nforks](https://github.com/iangonzalez/reddit-pizza-analysis/forks)\n\n[Report repository](https://github.com/contact/report-content?content_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fiangonzalez%2Freddit-pizza-analysis&report=iangonzalez+%28user%29)\n\n## [Releases](https://github.com/iangonzalez/reddit-pizza-analysis/releases)\n\nNo releases published\n\n## [Packages\\ 0](https://github.com/users/iangonzalez/packages?repo_name=reddit-pizza-analysis)\n\nNo packages published\n\n## Languages\n\n- [TeX79.2%](https://github.com/iangonzalez/reddit-pizza-analysis/search?l=tex)\n- [R20.8%](https://github.com/iangonzalez/reddit-pizza-analysis/search?l=r)\n\nYou can\u2019t perform that action at this time.",

The benchmark is simply guessing that no pizzas are given (or all). This results in an AUC score of 50.\n\nTo beat the AUC = 50 benchmark with a simple model, I first looked at the training and test data to find simple features. I decided to use the word counts of the request title and comment text, as longer comments might be skipped by readers.\n\nTo build the model I first extracted only the desired fields from the original JSON files with jq and used json2csv to write out CSV.\n\n```\ncat train.json|jq -c '.[]' | json2csv -p -k=request_id,requester_received_pizza,request_title,request_text_edit_aware -d=\"|\" > train_1.csv\n\ncat test.json|jq -c '.[]' | json2csv -p -k=request_id,request_title,request_text_edit_aware -d=\"|\" > test_1.csv\n```\n\nI then built a very basic random forest model using the default settings in scikit-learn. With a 80/20 training/test split I achieved a local AUC of about 0.52 (single validation). Using the entire training set to build a random forest, I was able to score an AUC of 0.51274 on the competition leaderboard.\n\nNot great, but not bad for a very simple model.\n\n```\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom sklearn import cross_validation\nfrom sklearn import ensemble\nfrom sklearn import metrics\n\ntrain = pd.read_csv('train_1.csv',delimiter='|')\ntest = pd.read_csv('test_1.csv',delimiter='|')\n\n# Create text word count and title word count fields and binarize pizza received\ntrain.requester_received_pizza = train.requester_received_pizza.apply(lambda x: 1 if x else 0)\ntrain['title_count'] = train.request_title.apply(lambda x: len(x.split()))\ntrain['text_count'] = train.request_text_edit_aware.apply(lambda x: len(str(x).split()))\n\ntest['title_count'] = test.request_title.apply(lambda x: len(x.split()))\ntest['text_count'] = test.request_text_edit_aware.apply(lambda x: len(str(x).split()))\n\n# Create training and testing arrays as well as validation splits\ntrain_X = train.drop(['request_id', u'requester_received_pizza', u'request_title', u'request_text_edit_aware'],axis=1).values\ntrain_y = train.requester_received_pizza.values\nX,X_,y,y_ = cross_validation.train_test_split(train_X,train_y,test_size=0.2)\n\ntest_X = test.drop(['request_id','request_title','request_text_edit_aware'],axis=1).values\n\n# Train and test random forest model\nrf = ensemble.RandomForestClassifier() # Default values\nrf.fit(X,y)\ny_rf = rf.predict(X_)\nprint metrics.roc_auc_score(y_,y_rf)\n\n# Train model with full training data and predict test y's\nrf.fit(train_X,train_y)\ny_test_rf = rf.predict(test_X)\n\n# Write submission file\ntest_out = pd.DataFrame({'request_id':test.request_id.values,'requester_received_pizza':y_test_rf.astype('int')})\ntest_out.to_csv('rf1.csv',index=False)\n```\n\n[Sign up for free](https://gist.github.com/join?source=comment-gist) **to join this conversation on GitHub**.\nAlready have an account?\n[Sign in to comment](https://gist.github.com/login?return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fgist.github.com%2Froycoding%2F1e24bce664cce16503b8)\n\nYou can\u2019t perform that action at this time.",
