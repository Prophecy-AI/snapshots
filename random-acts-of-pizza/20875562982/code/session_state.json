Linguistic Feature Engineering (HIGHEST PRIORITY)\nBased on academic research, extract these patterns from text:\n- **Need narratives**: Detect mentions of family hardship, job loss, financial strain, student status, medical issues\n- **Gratitude expressions**: Count \"thank you\", \"thanks\", \"appreciate\", \"grateful\"\n- **Evidential language**: Look for concrete details (numbers, dates, specific situations)\n- **Reciprocity promises**: Detect \"pay it forward\", \"help others\", \"contribute back\"\n- **Status signals**: Extract Reddit-specific status mentions (karma, account age references)\n- **Sentiment analysis**: Use VADER or TextBlob for sentiment scores\n- **Readability metrics**: Flesch-Kincaid, SMOG index, word diversity\n\n### 2. Enhanced Text Representation (HIGH PRIORITY)\n- **Dimensionality reduction**: Apply TruncatedSVD (LSA) to TF-IDF matrix to capture latent semantics (50-100 components)\n- **Character n-grams**: Add 2-3 character n-grams to capture stylistic patterns\n- **POS tagging**: Extract noun/verb/adjective ratios, sentiment-bearing word counts\n- **Emotion lexicons**: Use NRC Emotion Lexicon or similar for emotion scores\n\n### 3. Expanded Tabular Features (MEDIUM PRIORITY)\n- **User history features**: Calculate requester's prior activity patterns\n- **Temporal features**: Extract day of week, time of day from timestamps\n- **Interaction features**: Create combinations of text length \u00d7 user karma, etc.\n- **Missing value patterns**: Create flags for missing data patterns\n\n### 4. Model Upgrade (MEDIUM PRIORITY)\n- **Tree-based models**: Try XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost (handle mixed data better)\n- **Ensemble strategy**: Combine logistic regression (for linear patterns) with tree models (for non-linear)\n- **Stacking**: Use diverse base models with meta-learner\n\n### 5. Validation & Robustness (ONGOING)\n- **CV stability**: Run multiple seeds to ensure consistent scores\n- **Feature ablation**: Test which feature groups provide most lift\n- **Error analysis**: Continue analyzing false positives/negatives\n\n## What NOT to Try\n- More complex models without better features first (won't bridge 0.34 point gap)\n- Simple hyperparameter tuning (diminishing returns with weak features)\n- Basic text statistics (already exhausted)\n\n## Validation Notes\n- Use stratified 5-fold CV (maintain 24.8% positive class distribution)\n- Track both mean and std of CV scores (target std <0.03 for stability)\n- Monitor for overfitting given small dataset (2,878 samples)",

TF-IDF captures frequency-weighted patterns that are more predictive. Character n-grams and SVD are proven techniques for this dataset.\n- Key concerns: We need to move beyond logistic regression and simple features. The 0.34 point gap requires significant innovation.\n\n## Data Understanding\n- **Reference notebooks**: See `exploration/eda.ipynb` for initial analysis, `exploration/evolver_loop1_analysis.ipynb` for correlations, `exploration/evolver_loop2_analysis.ipynb` for why linguistic features failed\n- **Key patterns discovered**:\n  - Linguistic patterns ARE predictive but need proper representation: gratitude (+5.8% success), need words (+4.4%), reciprocity (+5.7%)\n  - Simple binary features lose nuance vs TF-IDF's frequency-weighted approach\n  - TF-IDF top predictors: 'dominos', 'rice', 'days', 'currently', 'father', 'tight', 'surprise', 'daughter', 'cover' (context-specific vocabulary)\n  - Dataset has rich tabular metadata (account age, karma, subreddit activity) that should be combined with text features\n\n## Recommended Approaches (Priority Order)\n\n### 1. Enhanced Text Representation (HIGHEST PRIORITY)\nBased on research and analysis, implement:\n- **Character n-grams (2-4 chars)**: Capture stylistic patterns and handle misspellings better than word n-grams\n- **TruncatedSVD (LSA)**: Reduce TF-IDF dimensionality to 100-200 components to capture latent semantics\n- **Improved preprocessing**: Better handling of Reddit-specific patterns (URLs, usernames, subreddit mentions)\n- **TF-IDF parameters**: Experiment with different max_features, ngram_range (1-3), min_df thresholds\n\n### 2. Tabular Feature Engineering (HIGH PRIORITY)\nThe dataset has rich metadata that wasn't fully exploited:\n- **User reputation features**: requester_account_age, requester_upvotes_plus_downvotes, log transforms\n- **Interaction features**: text_length \u00d7 karma, account_age \u00d7 upvotes, etc.\n- **Temporal features**: Hour of day, day of week from request timestamps\n- **Missing value patterns**: Flags for missing data that might indicate new/inactive users\n- **Subreddit activity**: Prior posts in r/RandomActsOfPizza and other subreddits\n\n### 3. Model Upgrade (HIGH PRIORITY)\nMove beyond logistic regression:\n- **LightGBM**: Handles mixed data types well, good with text-derived features\n- **CatBoost**: Excellent with categorical features (if we encode any)\n- **XGBoost**: Robust and proven in competitions\n- **Ensemble approach**: Combine multiple models with different feature sets for diversity\n\n### 4. Multimodal Fusion (MEDIUM PRIORITY)\nCombine text and tabular features effectively:\n- **Early fusion**: Concatenate SVD-reduced text features with engineered tabular features\n- **Model stacking**: Train separate models on text-only and tabular-only, then blend predictions\n- **AutoGluon approach**: Let automated tools handle the multimodal fusion\n\n### 5. Validation & Robustness (ONGOING)\n- **CV stability**: Run multiple seeds to ensure consistent scores (target std <0.03)\n- **Feature ablation**: Test which feature groups provide most lift\n- **Error analysis**: Continue analyzing false positives/negatives to guide feature engineering\n\n## What NOT to Try\n- **Simple regex patterns**: Already proven inferior to TF-IDF (exp_001 failure)\n- **More linguistic features without better representation**: Binary presence/absence loses to frequency-weighted approaches\n- **Hyperparameter tuning without better features**: Won't bridge 0.34 point gap\n- **Complex neural networks**: Dataset is small (2,878 samples), traditional ML with good features is more appropriate\n\n## Validation Notes\n- Use stratified 5-fold CV (maintain 24.8% positive class distribution)\n- Track both mean and std of CV scores\n- Monitor for overfitting given small dataset\n- Test feature importance to ensure we're capturing real signal\n\n## Expected Impact\nBased on research and competition post-mortems:\n- Enhanced TF-IDF + SVD: +0.02-0.05 AUC improvement\n- Better tabular features: +0.03-0.08 AUC improvement  \n- Model upgrade to LightGBM/XGBoost: +0.02-0.05 AUC improvement\n- Proper ensemble: +0.01-0.03 AUC improvement\n- **Total potential: 0.10-0.20 AUC improvement** - still far from gold but necessary foundation",

      "feedback": "## What I Understood\n\nThe junior researcher implemented an enhanced text representation experiment following the strategy recommendations. They combined TF-IDF (word and character n-grams), TruncatedSVD dimensionality reduction (100 word + 50 char components), and 8 engineered numeric features. Using logistic regression with class_weight='balanced' and stratified 5-fold CV, they achieved 0.6445 \u00b1 0.0173 AUC\u2014a modest +0.0059 improvement over baseline.\n\n## Technical Execution Assessment\n\n**Validation**: Stratified 5-fold CV is appropriate for the 24.8% positive class distribution. The 0.0173 standard deviation across folds is reasonable, suggesting stable results.\n\n**Leakage Risk**: **POTENTIAL CONCERN**. The researcher fits TF-IDF vectorizers and SVD transformers on the FULL training data before CV splits. While they correctly transform test folds using the fitted transformers, they're still computing IDF statistics and SVD components on data that includes the validation fold. This can leak distributional information. Proper approach: fit transformers ONLY on training folds within each CV iteration.\n\n**Score Integrity**: Verified in execution logs. The 0.6445 score matches the notebook output. However, convergence warnings persist across all folds despite max_iter=1000, suggesting numerical instability from the high-dimensional feature space.\n\n**Code Quality**: The code executed successfully and generated a submission file. However, there are silent issues:\n- Extremely high dimensionality (11,158 features) with logistic regression\n- No feature scaling despite mixing TF-IDF (0-1) and numeric features (various scales)\n- Convergence warnings indicate potential optimization problems\n\nVerdict: **CONCERNS** - Results are mostly trustworthy but the leakage risk and convergence issues need addressing.\n\n## Strategic Assessment\n\n**Approach Fit**: The enhanced text representation is directionally correct\u2014character n-grams and SVD are proven techniques. However, **the model choice is fundamentally mismatched to the approach**. They're using logistic regression (linear model) when the strategy explicitly recommended upgrading to LightGBM/XGBoost for better handling of mixed features and non-linear patterns. This is like putting racing fuel in an economy car.\n\n**Effort Allocation**: **CRITICAL MISALIGNMENT**. The researcher is iterating on feature engineering (which showed diminishing returns: +0.0059 improvement) while ignoring the highest-priority recommendation from the strategy: **model upgrade**. The strategy stated \"Move beyond logistic regression\" as HIGH PRIORITY, yet they're still using the same model as the baseline. This is the wrong bottleneck to focus on.\n\n**Assumptions**: \n- Assumes logistic regression can handle 11,158 features effectively (questionable)\n- Assumes convergence warnings are harmless (they're not - indicate poor conditioning)\n- Assumes feature engineering alone will bridge the 0.34 point gap to gold (unrealistic)\n\n**Blind Spots**: \n- **Model architecture**: Not trying tree-based models that excel with mixed data types\n- **Feature scaling**: No standardization despite vastly different feature scales\n- **Dimensionality**: 11,158 features with only 2,878 samples is a recipe for overfitting\n- **Ensemble potential**: No model diversity or stacking considered\n\n**Trajectory**: The +0.0059 improvement shows marginal gains from feature engineering. At this pace, they'd need ~60 more experiments to reach the target. This is classic **local hill-climbing** with diminishing returns. They need a **strategic pivot**, not incremental improvements.\n\n## What's Working\n\n1. **Multimodal approach**: Combining text + numeric features is correct for this problem\n2. **Character n-grams**: Capturing stylistic patterns is smart and proven for this dataset\n3. **SVD dimensionality reduction**: Using 100 components captures meaningful latent structure (17.85% variance explained is reasonable for text)\n4. **Feature engineering creativity**: The 8 numeric features (ratios, logs, text stats) show good domain thinking\n5. **Validation rigor**: Stratified CV with std tracking is appropriate\n\n## Key Concerns\n\n### 1. **Model-Approach Mismatch** (HIGHEST PRIORITY)\n- **Observation**: Still using logistic regression when strategy explicitly recommended LightGBM/XGBoost\n- **Why it matters**: Tree models handle mixed data types better, capture non-linear interactions, and are more robust to unscaled features. The 0.34 point gap requires model capacity, not just better features.\n- **Suggestion**: **Immediately switch to LightGBM** (or XGBoost/CatBoost). These models will better leverage the engineered features and handle the high dimensionality more gracefully.\n\n### 2. **Data Leakage in Feature Engineering**\n- **Observation**: TF-IDF and SVD fitted on full training data before CV splits\n- **Why it matters**: IDF statistics and SVD components computed on validation data leak distributional information, potentially inflating CV scores\n- **Suggestion**: Move all feature fitting inside the CV loop. Fit vectorizers and transformers on `train_idx` only, then transform `val_idx`.\n\n### 3. **Numerical Instability**\n- **Observation**: Convergence warnings across all folds despite max_iter=1000\n- **Why it matters**: Indicates poor conditioning from unscaled features + high dimensionality. May lead to unreliable coefficients and suboptimal solutions\n- **Suggestion**: Add StandardScaler for numeric features and consider reducing dimensionality further (try 50 word + 25 char components instead of 100 + 50)\n\n### 4. **Feature Scaling Absence**\n- **Observation**: TF-IDF features (0-1 range) combined directly with numeric features (varying scales: account_age_years ~0-10, text_length ~0-5000, ratios ~0-100)\n- **Why it matters**: Logistic regression is sensitive to feature scales. Large magnitude features dominate the regularization\n- **Suggestion**: Standardize numeric features before concatenation\n\n### 5. **Dimensionality vs Sample Size**\n- **Observation**: 11,158 features with only 2,878 samples (3.9:1 ratio)\n- **Why it matters**: High risk of overfitting, especially with linear models. The model can memorize noise\n- **Suggestion**: Aggressive dimensionality reduction (try 50 word + 25 char SVD components = 75 dims + 8 numeric = 83 total features)\n\n## Top Priority for Next Experiment\n\n**Switch to LightGBM (or XGBoost/CatBoost) while keeping the enhanced features**\n\nThe researcher's feature engineering is actually quite good\u2014they've created a rich multimodal representation. The problem is they're using the wrong model to leverage it. LightGBM will:\n- Handle the mixed data types natively without scaling concerns\n- Capture non-linear interactions between text stats and user metadata\n- Be more robust to the high dimensionality\n- Likely yield 0.03-0.08 AUC improvement based on competition post-mortems\n\n**Specific implementation**:\n1. Replace LogisticRegression with LGBMClassifier\n2. Keep class_weight='balanced' (or use scale_pos_weight)\n3. Keep stratified CV but move ALL feature fitting inside CV loops\n4. Try simpler feature combinations first (maybe just SVD components + numeric, without raw TF-IDF)\n5. Tune n_estimators=500, learning_rate=0.05, max_depth=5-7\n\nThis addresses both the technical leakage concern AND the strategic model mismatch in one experiment. The feature engineering work wasn't wasted\u2014it just needs the right model to shine.",

      "query": "What text preprocessing techniques are effective for Reddit posts and social media language in classification tasks?",
      "finding": "Effective text\u2011preprocessing for Reddit posts and other social\u2011media messages typically combines noise\u2011reduction steps that preserve the informal cues (emoticons, slang, elongated words) that are most informative for classification.  Empirical studies on short\u2011text platforms show that **stemming**, **removing numeric tokens**, and **normalising elongated words** (e.g., turning \u201csoooo\u201d into \u201cso\u201d) consistently raise accuracy, whereas stripping punctuation often hurts performance because punctuation can carry sentiment or sarcasm cues\u202f([springer.com](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-67008-9_31)).\n\nAt the lexical level, a simple **tokenisation** pipeline\u2014followed by **lower\u2011casing**, optional **lemmatisation**, and selective **multi\u2011word grouping** (e.g., \u201cNew\u202fYork\u201d \u2192 \u201cNewYork\u201d)\u2014provides a solid baseline for both traditional bag\u2011of\u2011words and neural classifiers.

      "finding": "The Random Acts of Pizza competition was a binary\u2011classification task that rewarded participants who could best predict whether a Reddit pizza request would be funded.  Most of the top solutions relied on **rich text\u2011based features combined with user\u2011metadata** and then applied either linear models or powerful tree\u2011based ensembles.  Early work (the 2017 notebook) focused on extracting TF\u2011IDF / bag\u2011of\u2011words representations from the request body and feeding them to logistic regression, which already gave a solid baseline for the problem\u202f([notebook.community](https://notebook.community/omaraltaher/kaggle-pizza-project/Random_Acts_of_Pizza_Kaggle_Competition_Project)).  \n\nBuilding on the original Stanford study, several teams added **topic\u2011modeling (LDA) and dimensionality reduction (SVD)** to capture latent semantic structure in the posts, while also engineering **user\u2011level variables** such as account age, karma, prior pizza requests, and subreddit activity\u202f([runze.github.io](https://run",

Participants extracted information about each requester \u2013 such as account age, total karma, number of previous pizza requests, and other Reddit activity metrics \u2013 and treated these as numeric features that capture a user\u2019s reputation and experience on the platform\u202f([caroarriaga.com](https://www.caroarriaga.com/projects/raop)).

      "finding": "Simple regex\u2011based linguistic features\u2014such as patterns that flag dates, URLs, or chemical formulas\u2014are usually turned into binary tokens that indicate only the *presence* of a pattern.  Because they are highly sparse and ignore how often a token occurs, they provide little discriminative signal compared with term\u2011frequency statistics.  Moreover, regexes capture only surface forms and cannot represent lexical variation, synonymy, or the surrounding context that often determines a document\u2019s class.  In contrast, TF\u2011IDF weights each term by its frequency in a document and its inverse frequency in the collection, giving a richer representation of word importance and allowing the classifier to exploit subtle differences in term distribution ([Stanford IR book \u2013 Features for text](https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/features-for-text-1.html)).

Because the data set is relatively small (\u22485\u202f000 rows) and contains both a free\u2011form text request and a rich set of request\u2011level metadata, the biggest gains come from turning those raw fields into informative, low\u2011dimensional features rather than from sophisticated model architectures alone.\n\n**Text\u2011based engineering** \u2013 The most common approach is to vectorise the request body with\u202f`sklearn.feature_extraction.text` utilities (e.g.,\u202fTF\u2011IDF on unigrams and bigrams) and then prune the sparse matrix with dimensionality reduction such as truncated\u202fSVD/LSA\u202f([notebook.community](https://notebook.community/omaraltaher/kaggle-pizza-project/Random_Acts_of_Pizza_Kaggle_Competition_Project); [caroarriaga.com](https://www.caroarriaga.com/projects/raop)).\u202fTopic modelling (LDA) and the narrative lexicons introduced in the original Stanford study (desire, family, job, money, s",

      "finding": "Combining TF\u2011IDF text vectors with tabular metadata is a classic multimodal setup that appears frequently in Kaggle\u2011style competitions.  TF\u2011IDF turns each document into a high\u2011dimensional sparse vector, while the remaining columns (numeric, categorical, dates, etc.) are dense and often require separate preprocessing (e.g., scaling, one\u2011hot or target encoding).
