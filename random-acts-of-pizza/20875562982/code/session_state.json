      "finding": "Feature engineering for Reddit\u2011post classification typically starts with **text\u2011centric preprocessing** followed by the creation of **structured metadata features** that capture a post\u2019s social signals.  In most tutorials the raw title and self\u2011text are first merged into a single document, then cleaned by dropping nulls, duplicate or stickied entries, cross\u2011posts, URLs and any non\u2011alphabetic characters\u202f([medium.com](https://medium.com/data-science/reddit-post-classification-b70258d6affe)).

Empirical studies on short\u2011text platforms show that **stemming**, **removing numeric tokens**, and **normalising elongated words** (e.g., turning \u201csoooo\u201d into \u201cso\u201d) consistently raise accuracy, whereas stripping punctuation often hurts performance because punctuation can carry sentiment or sarcasm cues\u202f([springer.com](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-67008-9_31)).\n\nAt the lexical level, a simple **tokenisation** pipeline\u2014followed by **lower\u2011casing**, optional **lemmatisation**, and selective **multi\u2011word grouping** (e.g., \u201cNew\u202fYork\u201d \u2192 \u201cNewYork\u201d)\u2014provides a solid baseline for both traditional bag\u2011of\u2011words and neural classifiers.
