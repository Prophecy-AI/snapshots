    "# Experiment 004: LightGBM with Fixed Leakage\n",
    "\n",
    "This experiment addresses the critical issues identified in exp_003:\n",
    "1. **Model upgrade**: Switch from LogisticRegression to LightGBM\n",
    "2. **Fix data leakage**: Move ALL feature fitting inside CV loop\n",
    "3. **Optimize dimensionality**: Reduce to 75 total SVD components (50 word + 25 char)\n",
    "4. **Better regularization**: LightGBM handles high dimensionality better than logistic regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Expected improvement: +0.03 to +0.08 AUC (target: 0.68-0.72)"
