      "finding": "Winning Kaggle solutions for problems that contain both free\u2011text and structured columns usually treat the data as a **multimodal tabular** task: the raw text is first turned into dense embeddings with a pretrained language model (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa, or GPT\u20114) and those vectors are then concatenated with the numeric and categorical features before feeding the whole matrix to a strong tabular learner such as LightGBM, CatBoost, or a gradient\u2011boosted tree ensemble.  AutoGluon\u2019s multimodal tabular API automates exactly this workflow \u2013 it ingests raw text as a first\u2011class column, trains a pretrained transformer on the text side, trains classical tabular models on the structured side, and finally blends them into a single predictor that often outperforms any single model\u202f([auto.gluon.ai](https://auto.gluon.ai/0.7.0/tutorials/tabular_prediction/tabular-multimodal-text-others.html)).  \n\nBeyond simple concatenation, the most competitive pipelines layer **stacking/ensembling** and **LLM\u2011genera",
