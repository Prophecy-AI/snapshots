Data contains both text (title, request text) and tabular features (user activity metrics, temporal features, votes). Posts with 'EDIT' in text have significantly higher success rate (41.6% vs 22.6%). User flair 'shroom' and 'PIF' indicate past success (100% success rate). Strong correlation between request and retrieval metrics suggests redundancy in features.",

The most reliable pattern is a two\u2011stage pipeline: first turn each free\u2011text column into a dense embedding with a pretrained transformer (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa) or a classic TF\u2011IDF/word\u2011n\u2011gram vector, then concatenate those embeddings with the original numeric and categorical features and feed the whole matrix to a gradient\u2011boosting model such as LightGBM, CatBoost, or a neural tabular architecture (TabTransformer, FT\u2011Transformer, TabM).
