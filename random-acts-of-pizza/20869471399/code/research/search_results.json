      "text": "Kaggle winners typically combine a few proven tricks to keep the 75\u202f%\u202f/\u202f25\u202f% class split from hurting their models\u202f([Neptune blog on Kaggle binary\u2011classification tips](https://neptune.ai/blog/tabular-data-binary-classification-tips-and-tricks-from-5-kaggle-competitions)):\n\n1. **Choose an imbalance\u2011aware metric** \u2013\u202finstead of raw accuracy they monitor AUC\u2011ROC, log\u2011loss, or F1\u2011score and decide early whether false\u2011positives or false\u2011negatives are more costly\u202f([Kaggle discussion on metrics & weighting](https://www.kaggle.com/discussions/questions-and-answers/27589)).\n\n2. **Apply class\u2011weighting in the loss** \u2013\u202ffor neural nets they use a weighted binary\u2011cross\u2011entropy where the positive class weight \u2248\u202f(1\u2011p)/p\u202f\u2248\u202f3\u202fwhen p\u202f=\u202f0.25\u202f([Weighted BCE notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/parthdhameliya77/class-imbalance-weighted-binary-cross-entropy)).\n\n3. **Resample the training data**  \n   * **Oversample the minority** with SMOTE (or its variants) to synthesize new positive examples\u202f([SMOTE + XGBoost case study](https://epjohnson13.medium.com/tomek-links-smote-and-xgboost-for-fraud-detection-1fc8b5208e0d)).  \n   * **Optionally undersample the majority** to keep the dataset size manageable, always using a stratified split so validation still reflects the true 25\u202f% rate\u202f([Kaggle discussion on over/under\u2011sampling](https://www.kaggle.com/discussions/questions-and-answers/27589)).\n\n4. **Use stratified cross\u2011validation** \u2013\u202feach fold preserves the 25\u202f%/75\u202f% ratio, preventing leakage of imbalance information and giving reliable estimates\u202f([Kaggle best practices for imbalanced data](https://www.aicrowd.com/showcase/dealing-with-class-imbalance)).\n\n5. **Fine\u2011tune the decision threshold** \u2013\u202fafter training, they plot precision\u2011recall or ROC curves and pick a threshold that balances the business cost of FP vs\u202fFN, rather than defaulting to 0.5\u202f([Metric\u2011driven threshold selection discussion](https://www.kaggle.com/discussions/questions-and-answers/27589)).\n\n**Quick workflow**\n\n1. Split data with `StratifiedKFold`.  \n2. In each training fold, either (a) apply `SMOTE` (`imblearn.over_sampling.SMOTE`) or (b) set `class_weight={0:1, 1:3}` in the loss function.  \n3. Train your model (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM, or a neural net) using the weighted loss.  \n4. Validate with AUC\u2011ROC / log\u2011loss and adjust the probability threshold based on the validation curve.  \n5. Ensemble several models trained with different resampling/weighting seeds for robustness.\n\nThese steps reflect the core strategies that top Kaggle participants use to neutralize a 25\u202f% positive\u2011rate imbalance and squeeze out the last bits of performance.",

These tricks are obtained from solutions of some of Kaggle\u2019s top tabular data competitions. Without much lag, let\u2019s begin.\nThese are the five competitions that I have gone through to create this article:\n* [**Home credit default risk**](https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk/)\n* [**Santander Customer Transaction Prediction**](https://www.kaggle.com/c/santander-customer-transaction-prediction/notebooks)\n* [**VSB Power Line Fault Detection**](https://www.kaggle.com/c/vsb-power-line-fault-detection/overview/evaluation)\n* [**Microsoft Malware Prediction**](https://www.kaggle.com/c/microsoft-malware-prediction/overview)\n* [**IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection**](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ieee-fraud-detection/overview/evaluation/)## Dealing with larger datasets\nOne issue you might face in any machine learning competition is the size of your data set. If the size of your data is large, that is 3GB + for kaggle kernels and more basic laptops you could find it difficult to load and process with limited resources. Here is the link to some of the articles and kernels that I have found useful in such situations.\n* Faster[data loading with pandas.](https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk/discussion/59575)\n* Data compression techniques to[reduce the size of data by 70%](https://www.kaggle.com/nickycan/compress-70-of-dataset).\n* Optimize the memory by r[educing the size of some attributes.](https://www.kaggle.com/shrutimechlearn/large-data-loading-trick-with-ms-malware-data)\n* Use open-source libraries such as[Dask to read and manipulate the data](https://www.kaggle.com/yuliagm/how-to-work-with-big-datasets-on-16g-ram-dask), it performs parallel computing and saves up memory space.\n* Use[cudf](https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf).\n* Convert data to[parquet](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/parquet.html)format.\n* Converting data to[feather](https://medium.com/@snehotosh.banerjee/feather-a-fast-on-disk-format-for-r-and-python-data-frames-de33d0516b03)format.\n* Reducing memory usage for[optimizing RAM](https://www.kaggle.com/mjbahmani/reducing-memory-size-for-ieee).## Data exploration\nData exploration always helps to better understand the data and gain insights from it. Before starting to develop machine learning models, top competitors always read/do a lot of exploratory data analysis for the data. This helps in feature engineering and cleaning of the data.\n* EDA for microsoft[malware detection.](https://www.kaggle.com/youhanlee/my-eda-i-want-to-see-all)\n* Time Series[EDA for malware detection.](https://www.kaggle.com/cdeotte/time-split-validation-malware-0-68)\n* Complete[EDA for home credit loan prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/codename007/home-credit-complete-eda-feature-importance).\n* Complete[EDA for Santader prediction.](https://www.kaggle.com/gpreda/santander-eda-and-prediction)\n* EDA for[VSB Power Line Fault Detection.](https://www.kaggle.com/go1dfish/basic-eda)## Data preparation\nAfter data exploration, the first thing to do is to use those insights to prepare the data. To tackle issues like class imbalance, encoding categorical data, etc. Let\u2019s see the methods used to do it.\n* Methods to t[ackle class imbalance](https://www.kaggle.com/shahules/tackling-class-imbalance).\n* Data augmentation by[Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique](https://machinelearningmastery.com/smote-oversampling-for-imbalanced-classification/).\n* Fast inplace[shuffle for augmentation](https://www.kaggle.com/jiweiliu/fast-inplace-shuffle-for-augmentation).\n* Finding[synthetic samples in the dataset.](https://www.kaggle.com/yag320/list-of-fake-samples-and-public-private-lb-split)\n* [Signal denoising](https://www.kaggle.com/jackvial/dwt-signal-denoising)used in signal processing competitions.\n* Finding[patterns of missing data](https://www.kaggle.com/jpmiller/patterns-of-missing-data).\n* Methods to handle[missing data](https://towardsdatascience.com/6-different-ways-to-compensate-for-missing-values-data-imputation-with-examples-6022d9ca0779).\n* An overview of various[encoding techniques for categorical data.](https://www.kaggle.com/shahules/an-overview-of-encoding-techniques)\n* Building[model to predict missing values.](https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk/discussion/64598)\n* Random[shuffling of data](https://www.kaggle.com/brandenkmurray/randomly-shuffled-data-also-works)to create new synthetic training set.## Feature engineering\nNext, you can check the most popular feature and feature engineering techniques used in these top kaggle competitions.

      "text": "<div><div><p>There are two general ways of dealing with imbalanced data: 1) change the data; 2) leave the data alone but change the performance metric and/or the weight of individual data points.</p>\n<p>Changing the data means oversampling the under-represented class(es) with synthetic data points, or undersampling (thinning down) the over-represented class(es). There are various ways of doing both operations, and I will give you one <a href=\"https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/imbalanced-learn\"><strong>starting point</strong></a>.</p>\n<p>A second option is to leave the data alone and adjust how we do the training. It is crucial to pick a reliable performance metric for imbalanced data, and to know whether for your purposes it is worse to have too many false positives (FPs) or false negatives (FNs). Ideally, you wouldn't want to have either of the two, but for most applications it should be clear whether we want to avoid FPs or FNs with greater preference.</p>\n<p>To give you an example: you have 900 healthy patients (class 0) and 100 cancer patients (class 1), which is at least somewhat close to the true ratio of healthy and cancer-stricken people out there. If you predict class 0 with 100% accuracy and class 1 with 70% accuracy, your accuracy will be 97% for the whole dataset. That sounds tremendous until we realize that 30 out of 100 cancer patients (30%) will go undiagnosed, meaning that high false negative rate in this case will cost many lives. What if we could adjust our classification so that both classes are predicted with 97% accuracy? This would mean that 27 healthy people would be predicted to have cancer (27 FPs) and 3 cancer-stricken individual would be predicted to be healthy (3 FNs). Now, I wouldn't want to be a doctor who tells a healthy person that they have a cancer because many people have been known to do silly things when they think they are dying. Still, compared to our starting premise, most would agree that on balance it is much better to have 27 people who think they have cancer and later find out they don't, and only 3 patients who were told they are healthy even though they have cancer. The problem is that a simple accuracy as a performance metric for training would never get you to a balanced 97% accuracy. For imbalanced datasets, F1-score (a weighted average of precision and recall), area under curve for ROC and Matthews correlation coefficient may be better measures of classifier quality.</p>\n<p>See the links below for more info:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://machinelearningmastery.com/classification-accuracy-is-not-enough-more-performance-measures-you-can-use/\"><strong>link1</strong></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://eva.fing.edu.uy/mod/resource/view.php?id=33977\"><strong>link2</strong></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/bosch-production-line-performance/forums/t/24120/time-effort-and-reward?forumMessageId=138285#post138285\"><strong>link3</strong></a></p></div></div>",

The resampling is a combination of under- and over-sampling. The under-sampling is accomplished by Tomek Links and the over-sampling by SMOTE. Implementing the resampling is easy with the imblearn package, but understanding what it is we are doing, and in what order, is critical to explaining why this is a valid processing step. I will explain this in the section labelled Imbalanced Learning Problems.\nThe resampling itself improves out-of-the-box XGBoost performance from an 84% fraud detection rate (recall of the fraud data points) and a 99%+ correct classification rate (overall accuracy)to an 88% fraud detection rate and a 99%+ correct classification rate. After tuning XGBoost hyperparameters, I end up with a model that has a 92% fraud detection rate and a 98% correct classification rate. These results vary up or down by a few percentage points depending on the chosen random seed. The obtained recall and overall accuracy values sit near the middle of their respective distributions.\nAs a new data scientist with a PhD in mathematics I was excited to work with this dataset because I believed it presented an opportunity to focus on a few cutting edge classification algorithms. For instance, XGBoost is a fascinating machine learning algorithm that combines mathematical, statistical and computer hardware insights to build a wide array of classification and regression trees. What was truly interesting is that the real challenge with this dataset was finding ways to overcome the class imbalance before modeling even happened.\n## **A First Look at the Data**\nA description of the dataset can be found[here](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud). When we load the dataset, we see that there are 31 variables, 30 of which are data sampled from a continuous variable. I.e., there are no categorical variables other than the class labels which are binary, 0 for a legitimate transaction and 1 for a fraudulent transaction. The 28 variables \u201cV1\u201d \u2014\u201cV28\u201d have been created from a principal component analysis, and so these variables are statistically (and linearly) independent of each other. This also means that most of the variables are not interpretable in terms of domain specific knowledge. The only variables that come with meaningful names are \u201cTime\u201d, \u201cAmount\u201d and \u201cClass\u201d.\nThe \u201cTime\u201d variable is defined as the time duration since the first transaction in the dataset. This is very unlikely to help us since there is no account identification information. This means we cannot calculate the time in-between consecutive transactions for a given credit account. However, it could be argued that if we knew the date on which the first transaction happened then we might be able to track a seasonal component to credit fraud. Maybe there is more fraud generally in the summer (pure speculation)? The date of the first transaction or even a creation date for the dataset are not available. So we drop the \u201cTime\u201d column when we split the dataset into potential model features, X, and the class labels, y.\nBelow is a 3d-plot of the three most significant components derived from PCA analysis of the dataset.\n![]()\nThis plot is evidence for a severe class imbalance. We will talk about that just below and verify that there is a severe class imbalance in the dataset. PCA generally preserves features like clustering. I say generally because counterexamples where PCA destroys cluster information are easy to cook up. You can click[here](https://towardsdatascience.com/interesting-projections-where-pca-fails-fe64ddca73e6)if you would like to read a Towards Data Science article detailing an alternative to PCA called PPA. Moreover, if we are to believe that this PCA preserved most of the important information, the amount of overlap between the fraud data points and legitimate points seems like it might be a challenge to overcome. Luckily, the tight packing of fraudulent and legitimate transactions displayed in this plot will not end up having much impact on final predictive performance.\nBy creating a simple histogram for each variable, one sees that the \u201cAmount\u201d variable covers a very large range of numbers and that the data is concentrated in two main clusters, a low transaction amount cluster and a high transaction amount cluster. To prevent this large change of scale from detracting from a better model, we transform the Amount variable to log space and create the \u201cLog\\_Amount\u201d variable. I am not going to show code for this as it will turn out that \u201cLog\\_Amount\u201d and \u201cAmount\u201d both have a low correlation with the class labels and I did not use them in the final model.\nThe Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Dataset is severely imbalanced. We can see this by doing a count of the values in the \u201cClass\u201d column and making the following chart (found just below the code) using Matplotlib.\n![]()\nIn general, before we have chosen a specific algorithm, there are several standard options for handling this kind of imbalance. Some of these options work at the algorithm level, where a penalty is implemented for classifying the minority class...",

You're starting to think about feature engineering, adding more models to your ensemble, maybe trying one of those tabular deep learning models the cool kids are talking about. **STOP!** Before any of that, there is one BIG issue we need to deal with: class (im)balance.\n\nThe validation set (and presumably the test set) has a different class distribution to the training data. In this notebook we will look at many different ways we can correct for this class imbalance - picking one of these will boost your score tremendously (we're taking ~0.66 with a single simple random forest model). So, let's dive in.\n\n# Setup [\u00b6](https://www.aicrowd.com/www.aicrowd.com\\#Setup)\n\nImporting the libraries we'll be using, loading the data and getting ready to run our experiments.\n\nIn\u00a0\\[1\\]:\n\n```\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\nfrom catboost import CatBoostClassifier, Pool\nfrom sklearn.metrics import f1_score, log_loss\nfrom imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE\nfrom imblearn.under_sampling import RandomUnderSampler\nfrom imblearn.pipeline import Pipeline\n```\n\nIn\u00a0\\[2\\]:\n\n```\n#The training data\ndf = pd.read_csv('ds_shared_drive/train.csv')\nprint(df.shape)\ndf.head(2)\n```\n\n```\n(32777, 122)\n\n```\n\nOut\\[2\\]:\n\n| row\\_id | number\\_of\\_digits | missing\\_digit\\_1 | missing\\_digit\\_2 | missing\\_digit\\_3 | missing\\_digit\\_4 | missing\\_digit\\_5 | missing\\_digit\\_6 | missing\\_digit\\_7 | missing\\_digit\\_8 | ... | bottom\\_area\\_perc | left\\_area\\_perc | right\\_area\\_perc | hor\\_count | vert\\_count | eleven\\_ten\\_error | other\\_error | time\\_diff | centre\\_dot\\_detect | diagnosis |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 0 | S0CIXBKIUEOUBNURP | 12.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | ... | 0.52617 | 0.524975 | 0.474667 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | -105.0 | 0.0 | normal |\n| 1 | IW1Z4Z3H720OPW8LL | 12.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | ... | 0.00081 | 0.516212 | 0.483330 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | NaN | NaN | normal |\n\n2 rows \u00d7 122 columns\n\nIn\u00a0\\[3\\]:\n\n```\n# The validation data (we merge in the labels for convenience)\nval = pd.read_csv('ds_shared_drive/validation.csv')\nval = pd.merge(val, pd.read_csv('ds_shared_drive/validation_ground_truth.csv'),\n               how='left', on='row_id')\nprint(val.shape)\nval.head()\n```\n\n```\n(362, 122)\n\n```\n\nOut\\[3\\]:\n\n| row\\_id | number\\_of\\_digits | missing\\_digit\\_1 | missing\\_digit\\_2 | missing\\_digit\\_3 | missing\\_digit\\_4 | missing\\_digit\\_5 | missing\\_digit\\_6 | missing\\_digit\\_7 | missing\\_digit\\_8 | ... | bottom\\_area\\_perc | left\\_area\\_perc | right\\_area\\_perc | hor\\_count | vert\\_count | eleven\\_ten\\_error | other\\_error | time\\_diff | centre\\_dot\\_detect | diagnosis |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 0 | LA9JQ1JZMJ9D2MBZV | 11.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | ... | 0.499368 | 0.553194 | 0.446447 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | NaN | NaN | post\\_alzheimer |\n| 1 | PSSRCWAPTAG72A1NT | 6.0 | 1.0 | 1.0 | 0.0 | 1.0 | 1.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | ... | 0.427196 | 0.496352 | 0.503273 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | NaN | NaN | normal |\n| 2 | GCTODIZJB42VCBZRZ | 11.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 1.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | ... | 0.505583 | 0.503047 | 0.496615 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | normal |\n| 3 | 7YMVQGV1CDB1WZFNE | 3.0 | 1.0 | 0.0 | 1.0 | 0.0 | 1.0 | 1.0 | 1.0 | 1.0 | ... | 0.444633 | 0.580023 | 0.419575 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | NaN | NaN | post\\_alzheimer |\n| 4 | PHEQC6DV3LTFJYIJU | 1.0 | 1.0 | 1.0 | 1.0 | 1.0 | 1.0 | 1.0 | 1.0 | 0.0 | ... | 0.395976 | 0.494990 | 0.504604 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 150.0 | 0.0 | normal |\n\n5 rows \u00d7 122 columns\n\nIn\u00a0\\[4\\]:\n\n```\n# We'll keep track of how different approaches perform\nresults = []\n```\n\n# Baseline \\#1 - Training on all data [\u00b6](https://www.aicrowd.com/www.aicrowd.com\\#Baseline-%231---Training-on-all-data)\n\nThis is a case where we don't do any correction for the class imbalance. Some models will do better than others - tree-based models like CatBoost will be less sensitive than some other model types, but they will still over-estimate the probability that a given sample will fall into the majority class when making predicitons on the validation set (since the 'normal' class is so much more common in the training data).\n\nIn\u00a0\\[5\\]:\n\n```\n# Prep the data\nX = df.drop(['row_id', 'diagnosis'], axis=1).fillna(0)\ny = df['diagnosis']\nX_val = val.drop(['row_id', 'diagnosis'], axis=1).fillna(0)\ny_val = val['diagnosis']\n\n# Train the model\nmodel = CatBoostClassifier(verbose=False, cat_features=['intersection_pos_rel_centre'])\n\n# Evaluate on val set\nmodel.fit(X, y, eval_set = (X_val, y_val), early_stopping_rounds = 30)\n\n# Store results\nr = {'Approach':'No modifications',\n     'Log Loss':log_loss(y_val, model.predict_proba(X_val)),\n     'F1':f1_score(y_val, model.predict(X_val), average='macro')\n    }\nresults.append(r)\n\nprint(r) # Show results\n```\n\n```\n{'Approach': 'No modifications', 'Log Loss': 0.6745549053231596, 'F1': 0.2848101265822785}\n\n```\n\nA log loss of 0.67 on the validation set isn't terrible. We are using the validation set for early stopping - without that in place we get a log loss of 0.78 on our validation set and 0.8X on the leaderboard. So in a way, by using the validation set for early stopping we are already starting to combat our class balance problem... but we can do much better!\n\n# Adjusting Sample Weights [\u00b6](https://www.aicrowd.com/www.aicrowd.com\\#Adjusting-Sample-Weights)\n\nModels like CatBoost allow us to assign more weight to specific samples. In this case, we use this to place less weight on samples in the over-represented classes, combating the bias introduced by the imbalance:\n\nIn\u00a0\\[6\\]:\n\n```\n# Prep the data\nX = df.drop(['row_id', 'diagnosis'], axis=1).fillna(0)\ny = df['diagnosis']\nX_val = val.drop(['row_id', 'diagnosis'], axis=1).fillna(0)\ny_val = val['diagnosis']\n\n#Our class weights\nweights = {\n    'normal':9/74, # Chosen based on some quick mental maths comparing the distribution of train vs val\n    'post_alzheimer':0.85,\n    'pre_alzheimer':1\n}\n\n# Applying these weights as sample weights by using Pool to wrap our training data\ntrain_data = Pool(\n    data = X,\n    label = y,\n    weight = y.map(weights), # << The important bit\n    cat_features = [list(X.columns).index('intersection_pos_rel_centre')]\n)\n\neval_data = Pool(\n    data = X_val,\n    label = y_val,\n    weight = y_val.map(lambda x: 1.0), # all validation samples get a weight of 1\n    cat_features = [list(X.columns).index('intersection_pos_rel_centre')]\n)\n\n# Train the model\nmodel = CatBoostClassifier(verbose=False)\n\n# Evaluate on val set\nmodel.fit(train_data, eval_set = eval_data, early_stopping_rounds = 30)\n\n# Store results\nr = {'Approach':'Modifying Sample Weights',\n     'Log Loss':log_loss(y_val, model.predict_proba(X_val)),\n     'F1':f1_score(y_val, model.predict(X_val), average='macro')\n    }\nresults.append(r)\n\nprint(r) # Show results\n```\n\n```\n{'Approach': 'Modifying Sample Weights', 'Log Loss': 0.5593949556085255, 'F1': 0.4727603953181...",
