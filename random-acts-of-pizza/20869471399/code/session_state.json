Data contains both text (title, request text) and tabular features (user activity metrics, temporal features, votes). Posts with 'EDIT' in text have significantly higher success rate (41.6% vs 22.6%). User flair 'shroom' and 'PIF' indicate past success (100% success rate). Strong correlation between request and retrieval metrics suggests redundancy in features.",

      "finding": "Winning Kaggle solutions for text\u2011classification tasks that also contain structured (numeric\u202f/\u202fcategorical) columns treat the data as a **multimodal table** and combine a language model with a strong tabular learner.  The most reliable pattern is a two\u2011stage pipeline: first turn each free\u2011text column into a dense embedding with a pretrained transformer (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa) or a classic TF\u2011IDF/word\u2011n\u2011gram vector, then concatenate those embeddings with the original numeric and categorical features and feed the whole matrix to a gradient\u2011boosting model such as LightGBM, CatBoost, or a neural tabular architecture (TabTransformer, FT\u2011Transformer, TabM).  This approach consistently ranks at the top of the multimodal AutoML benchmark, where \u201cstandard two\u2011stage approaches where NLP is used \u2026 then a tabular model is trained on the concatenated features\u201d dominate the leaderboard\u202f([NeurIPS\u202f2021 benchmark](https://datasets-benchmarks-proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2021/file/9bf31c7ff062936a96d3c8bd",
