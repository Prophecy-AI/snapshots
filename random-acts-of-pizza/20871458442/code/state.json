      "query": "What are winning approaches for text classification with metadata features on Kaggle?",
      "finding": "Winning Kaggle solutions for text\u2011classification tasks that also contain rich metadata usually treat the non\u2011text fields as a **second modality** and fuse them with a strong language model.  A common recipe is to (1)\u202ffine\u2011tune a pretrained transformer (BERT, RoBERTa, etc.) on the raw text, (2)\u202fencode categorical or numerical metadata either as additional tokens that are prepended/appended to the input sequence or as separate embeddings that are concatenated to the final CLS vector, and (3)\u202ftrain a lightweight tabular model (e.g., LightGBM, CatBoost) on the same metadata and blend its predictions with the transformer output.  This \u201ctext\u2011plus\u2011metadata\u201d strategy is illustrated by the\u202fMessagenet\u202fapproach, which builds dedicated blocks for each metadata type (sender, timestamp, etc.) and jointly trains them with a BERT backbone, yielding higher accuracy than text\u2011only models\u202f([arxiv](https://export.arxiv.org/pdf/2301.01808v1.pdf)).

      "finding": "Winning solutions for the Reddit\u2011text\u2011classification challenges on Kaggle have typically combined strong preprocessing with an ensemble of classical machine\u2011learning models. In the most\u2011cited Kaggle entry for a Reddit\u2011comments dataset, the authors first cleaned the posts, removed stop\u2011words and applied TF\u2011IDF weighting, then used a \u03c7\u00b2 test to select the most informative features.  They trained several classifiers (including a custom implementation of Bernoulli Naive Bayes) and combined them in an ensemble, which outperformed any single model and achieved\u202f\u2248\u202f61\u202f% accuracy on a held\u2011out validation split and\u202f\u2248\u202f58.6\u202f% on the official Kaggle test set\u202f([nikhilpodila](https://github.com/nikhilpodila/Reddit-Classification)).  \n\nSeveral open\u2011source notebooks also showcase the same pipeline for the \u201cUser Gender Classification on Reddit\u201d competition, providing end\u2011to\u2011end code that follows the same pattern of TF\u2011IDF feature extraction, feature\u2011selection, and ensemble voting (e.g., the repositories ",

      "query": "What are the best techniques for handling class imbalance in text classification competitions?",
      "finding": "Class imbalance is a pervasive problem in text\u2011classification contests because many real\u2011world label distributions follow a long\u2011tail pattern (e.g., sentiment, medical codes, patent categories).  The most effective ways to mitigate it combine **data\u2011level** and **algorithm\u2011level** strategies.  At the data level, oversampling the minority classes (random oversampling, SMOTE and its variants, or more sophisticated synthetic text generation) and undersampling the majority classes are still the workhorses; the imbalanced\u2011learn library provides a comprehensive guide to these samplers and shows how they can be applied to multi\u2011class text data ([imbalanced\u2011learn](https://imbalanced-learn.org/stable/user_guide.html)).  Recent systematic evaluations confirm that SMOTE\u2011based oversampling often yields the biggest boost for transformer\u2011based classifiers, while careful under\u2011sampling can reduce training time without harming performance ([Scientific Reports, 2025](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41",
