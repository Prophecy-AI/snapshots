      "finding": "Winning Kaggle solutions for text\u2011classification tasks that also contain rich metadata usually treat the non\u2011text fields as a **second modality** and fuse them with a strong language model.  A common recipe is to (1)\u202ffine\u2011tune a pretrained transformer (BERT, RoBERTa, etc.) on the raw text, (2)\u202fencode categorical or numerical metadata either as additional tokens that are prepended/appended to the input sequence or as separate embeddings that are concatenated to the final CLS vector, and (3)\u202ftrain a lightweight tabular model (e.g., LightGBM, CatBoost) on the same metadata and blend its predictions with the transformer output.  This \u201ctext\u2011plus\u2011metadata\u201d strategy is illustrated by the\u202fMessagenet\u202fapproach, which builds dedicated blocks for each metadata type (sender, timestamp, etc.) and jointly trains them with a BERT backbone, yielding higher accuracy than text\u2011only models\u202f([arxiv](https://export.arxiv.org/pdf/2301.01808v1.pdf)).  A simpler but equally effective technique is to turn metad",
