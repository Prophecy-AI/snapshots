      "finding": "Winning Kaggle solutions for text\u2011classification tasks that also contain structured metadata usually treat the extra fields as a **second modality** and fuse them with the language model rather than ignoring them.  The most effective patterns that have emerged in recent competitions are:\n\n* **Metadata\u2011driven weak supervision** \u2013 The META framework builds a text\u2011rich graph that links documents with their metadata (author, timestamp, venue, etc.) and extracts \u201cseed motifs\u201d that act as additional weak labels.  By iteratively expanding seed words and motifs, the classifier learns from both text and highly predictive metadata cues, often beating pure\u2011text baselines on real\u2011world datasets\u202f([arXiv\u202f2023](https://export.arxiv.org/pdf/2301.01808v1.pdf)).  \n* **Multimodal deep networks** \u2013 Approaches such as MESSAGENET process each metadata type (categorical, numerical, image, audio) in a dedicated neural block, then jointly train all blocks so that cross\u2011channel interactions are learned end\u2011to\u2011e",

      "finding": "Based on insights from Kaggle winners and the practical techniques shared in competition write\u2011ups, moderate class imbalance in text\u2011classification contests is usually tackled with a short, repeatable workflow\u202f([Neptune blog](https://neptune.ai/blog/text-classification-tips-and-tricks-kaggle-competitions);\u202f[AIcrowd notebook](https://www.aicrowd.com/showcase/dealing-with-class-imbalance)):\n\n1. **Quantify the imbalance** \u2013 compute the label frequencies on the training set and on the validation split; if any class represents\u202f<\u202f20\u202f% of the data, treat it as \u201cmoderately imbalanced.\u201d\u202f([AIcrowd](https://www.aicrowd.com/showcase/dealing-with-class-imbalance))\n\n2. **Apply class\u2011aware sample weighting** \u2013 pass a weight vector to the loss function (e.g., `torch.nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss(pos_weight=\u2026)` or `sklearn`\u2019s `class_weight='balanced'`). This forces the optimizer to penalize mistakes on minority classes more heavily.\u202f([AIcrowd](https://www.aicrowd.com/showcase/dealing-with-class-imbalance))\n\n3. ",
