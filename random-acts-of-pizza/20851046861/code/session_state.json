Achieved perfect ROC AUC of 1.0 on all folds, which is suspiciously high and suggests potential data leakage or overfitting. Features included: combined title+text TF-IDF, account age, subreddit age, number of subreddits, karma scores, comment counts, and user flair one-hot encoding. Model used class_weight='balanced' to handle class imbalance (24.8% positive rate). Submission file created with predictions for 1162 test samples. Next steps: Investigate potential leakage, try simpler features, and validate with alternative models.",

      "finding": "Winning Kaggle solutions for text\u2011classification tasks that also contain structured metadata usually treat the extra fields as a **second modality** and fuse them with the language model rather than ignoring them.  The most effective patterns that have emerged in recent competitions are:\n\n* **Metadata\u2011driven weak supervision** \u2013 The META framework builds a text\u2011rich graph that links documents with their metadata (author, timestamp, venue, etc.) and extracts \u201cseed motifs\u201d that act as additional weak labels.  By iteratively expanding seed words and motifs, the classifier learns from both text and highly predictive metadata cues, often beating pure\u2011text baselines on real\u2011world datasets\u202f([arXiv\u202f2023](https://export.arxiv.org/pdf/2301.01808v1.pdf)).  \n* **Multimodal deep networks** \u2013 Approaches such as MESSAGENET process each metadata type (categorical, numerical, image, audio) in a dedicated neural block, then jointly train all blocks so that cross\u2011channel interactions are learned end\u2011to\u2011e",

This forces the optimizer to penalize mistakes on minority classes more heavily.\u202f([AIcrowd](https://www.aicrowd.com/showcase/dealing-with-class-imbalance))\n\n3. ",
