      "finding": "Winning Kaggle solutions for text\u2011classification tasks that also contain structured metadata usually treat the extra fields as a **second modality** and fuse them with the language model rather than ignoring them.  The most effective patterns that have emerged in recent competitions are:\n\n* **Metadata\u2011driven weak supervision** \u2013 The META framework builds a text\u2011rich graph that links documents with their metadata (author, timestamp, venue, etc.) and extracts \u201cseed motifs\u201d that act as additional weak labels.  By iteratively expanding seed words and motifs, the classifier learns from both text and highly predictive metadata cues, often beating pure\u2011text baselines on real\u2011world datasets\u202f([arXiv\u202f2023](https://export.arxiv.org/pdf/2301.01808v1.pdf)).  \n* **Multimodal deep networks** \u2013 Approaches such as MESSAGENET process each metadata type (categorical, numerical, image, audio) in a dedicated neural block, then jointly train all blocks so that cross\u2011channel interactions are learned end\u2011to\u2011e",
