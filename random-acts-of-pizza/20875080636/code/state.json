The agent concluded the test set excludes post-retrieval signals (votes/comments after posting) to reduce leakage.\n- Checked `sampleSubmission.csv` structure.\n\n**Errors encountered**\n- Notebook cell for numeric feature analysis initially failed with `ValueError: list.remove(x): x not in list` when attempting to remove the target from the numeric feature list. The agent debugged by guarding the removal with an `if` check and re-ran successfully.\n\n**Final state / outputs**\n- Artifacts created/updated:\n  - `/home/code/exploration/eda.ipynb` containing executed EDA cells (loading, target distribution, text length features, train/test comparison, and correlation attempts).\n  - `/home/code/exploration/seed_prompt.txt` summarizing EDA results and recommending baseline approaches (TF\u2011IDF + linear models; gradient boosting on metadata; possible ensembling; class weighting via `scale_pos_weight`; stratified CV).\n- Findings recorded:\n  - Text length correlates with success.\n  - RAOP history features are highly predictive.\n  - Test excludes post-retrieval/leakage features.\n  - `requester_user_flair` appears overly predictive and may not generalize / may be absent in test.\n- Exploration concluded with `EndExploration()`.",
