      "finding": "Winning Kaggle solutions for text\u2011classification problems that also contain **meta features** (e.g., post length, subreddit ID, number of up\u2011votes, time\u2011of\u2011day) follow a repeatable recipe: first turn the raw text into a fast, high\u2011quality vector (fastText embeddings or TF\u2011IDF weights), then concatenate any engineered numeric descriptors and feed the combined matrix into a powerful gradient\u2011boosting or linear\u2011model stack.  This hybrid approach lets the model exploit both the semantic signal of the language and the auxiliary information that often drives the target label in social\u2011media settings such as Reddit\u202fposts\u202f\u200b([Result\u202f1](https://neptune.ai/blog/text-classification-tips-and-tricks-kaggle-competitions)).\n\nThe most common building blocks observed in top Kaggle notebooks are:\n\n* **FastText \u201cbag\u2011of\u2011tricks\u201d** \u2013 a simple word\u2011n\u2011gram embedding that trains on billions of words in minutes and delivers accuracy comparable to deep\u2011learning baselines while keeping the feature matrix small eno",
