## What I Understood

The junior researcher built a baseline model (experiment #001) using only meta/numerical features available in the test set, achieving 0.6691 ± 0.0178 ROC-AUC. They correctly identified and avoided data leakage features (at_retrieval metrics, user flair) and engineered temporal features (hour, dayofweek). The model used LightGBM with class_weight='balanced' to handle the 25% positive class imbalance. This establishes a trustworthy baseline before adding text features.

## Technical Execution Assessment

**Validation**: Sound 5-fold stratified CV with reasonable variance (±0.0178). Fold scores range from 0.6398 to 0.6961, indicating stable but not overly consistent performance - good sign of proper validation.

**Leakage Risk**: NONE DETECTED. The researcher correctly excluded all at_retrieval features and user flair (100% predictive of success). They only used features present in test set.

**Score Integrity**: VERIFIED. Mean ROC-AUC 0.6691 matches execution output. OOF score 0.6656 is consistent with fold scores.

**Code Quality**: Clean, reproducible code with proper random_state setting, early stopping, and balanced class handling. No silent failures detected.

**Feature Engineering**: Added hour and dayofweek from timestamps - appropriate and safe. Feature importance shows temporal features matter (unix_timestamp ranks #1).

Verdict: **TRUSTWORTHY**

## Strategic Assessment

**Approach Fit**: Appropriate baseline strategy. Starting with meta-only features before adding text is sound - isolates signal from structured data first.

**Effort Allocation**: Well-spent. Baseline was necessary, and avoiding leakage shows good judgment. However, 0.6691 is far from the 0.979080 target - major improvements needed.

**Assumptions**: 
- Assumes meta features alone have limited signal (validated by 0.6691 score)
- Assumes text features will add substantial value (reasonable given Reddit context)
- Assumes temporal patterns are linear (hour/dayofweek as categorical might be better)

**Blind Spots**:
- Text features completely ignored (request_title, request_text_edit_aware) - this is the obvious next step
- User subreddits (high cardinality categorical) not encoded
- No interaction features between activity metrics
- No feature scaling/normalization attempted
- Hyperparameters are all defaults except num_leaves=31

**Trajectory**: Baseline complete, ready for next phase. The 0.31 gap to target suggests text features are essential. Current approach is promising but needs acceleration.

## What's Working

1. **Leakage awareness**: Excellent job identifying and avoiding at_retrieval features and user flair
2. **Validation rigor**: Proper stratified CV with reasonable variance across folds
3. **Feature engineering**: Temporal features from timestamps are valuable (unix_timestamp ranks #1 in importance)
4. **Class imbalance handling**: Using class_weight='balanced' is appropriate for 25% positive rate
5. **Baseline establishment**: 0.6691 provides clear benchmark for improvement

## Key Concerns

### 1. Text Features Not Utilized
**Observation**: The most obvious source of signal - request_title and request_text_edit_aware - were completely ignored.
**Why it matters**: Reddit posts are the core content. Success likely depends heavily on request quality, tone, length, sentiment, etc. Meta features alone can't capture this.
**Suggestion**: Add text features immediately. Start with simple length metrics, then TF-IDF, then embeddings. This is the highest-leverage next step.

### 2. Hyperparameter Tuning Premature
**Observation**: Using mostly default LightGBM parameters (only num_leaves=31 changed).
**Why it matters**: With only 13 features, model capacity and regularization matter. Learning_rate=0.05 might be too high for this small feature set.
**Suggestion**: Grid search key parameters: learning_rate (0.01-0.1), num_leaves (15-63), min_child_samples. But do this AFTER adding text features.

### 3. Feature Scaling Ignored
**Observation**: No scaling/normalization of numerical features before modeling.
**Why it matters**: LightGBM handles this better than linear models, but scaling can still help, especially for features with large ranges (upvotes range to 155k).
**Suggestion**: Try standard scaling or rank transformation on vote count features.

### 4. Interaction Features Missing
**Observation**: Using raw activity metrics independently.
**Why it matters**: Ratios like comments/posts or activity normalized by account age might be more predictive than raw counts.
**Suggestion**: Engineer interaction features: comments_per_day, posts_per_day, comment_to_post_ratio, etc.

## Top Priority for Next Experiment

**Add text features using TF-IDF and simple length metrics.** This is the single highest-leverage change:

1. Extract request_title and request_text_edit_aware
2. Engineer features: title_length, text_length, total_length
3. Add TF-IDF vectors (start with unigrams, max_features=1000-5000)
4. Keep existing meta features
5. Re-run same LightGBM setup to isolate text feature impact

Expected outcome: Should see 0.05-0.15 AUC improvement. If text adds minimal value, reconsider approach - perhaps the signal is in specific language patterns requiring more sophisticated NLP (sentiment, LIWC categories, or transformer embeddings).

The foundation is solid. Now build on it with the obvious missing piece: the actual request text.
