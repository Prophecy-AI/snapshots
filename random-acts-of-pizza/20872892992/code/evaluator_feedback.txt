## What I Understood

The junior researcher implemented experiment #002, adding 17 linguistic features and 7 interaction features to the baseline meta features, achieving 0.6815 ± 0.0204 ROC-AUC. This represents a modest +0.0124 improvement over the baseline. They followed the Stanford ICWSM 2014 research paper recommendations, engineering features for gratitude, evidentiality, reciprocity, narrative indicators, and politeness markers. They also added interaction features like comments_per_day, posts_per_day, and activity_score. The model used the same LightGBM setup as the baseline for fair comparison.

## Technical Execution Assessment

**Validation**: Sound 5-fold stratified CV with reasonable variance (±0.0204). Fold scores range from 0.6573 to 0.7087, showing stable performance similar to baseline variance.

**Leakage Risk**: NONE DETECTED. The researcher correctly used only at_request features and avoided all leakage features. All engineered features are computable from test set data.

**Score Integrity**: VERIFIED. CV score 0.6815 matches execution output. OOF score is consistent with fold scores.

**Code Quality**: Clean implementation with proper function structure, error handling, and reproducibility. No silent failures detected.

**Feature Engineering**: Well-implemented based on research literature. 24 new features added (17 linguistic + 7 interaction). Feature importance shows linguistic features contribute 27.5% and interaction features 21.3% of total importance.

Verdict: **TRUSTWORTHY**

## Strategic Assessment

**Approach Fit**: Excellent approach fit. The researcher correctly identified that generic TF-IDF performs poorly (0.5239) and instead implemented research-driven linguistic features. This shows good research taste and understanding of the problem domain.

**Effort Allocation**: Mixed. Time was well-spent on the right type of features (linguistic patterns from Stanford research), but the modest +0.0124 improvement suggests either: (1) the implementation needs refinement, (2) the features need different encoding, or (3) the model needs more capacity to capture these signals.

**Assumptions**:
- Assumes keyword-based counting captures linguistic signals (partially validated by 27.5% importance)
- Assumes linear combinations of meta features are sufficient (interaction features show 21.3% importance, so this seems reasonable)
- Assumes LightGBM with default hyperparameters can capture text patterns (questionable - may need more leaves or lower learning rate)

**Blind Spots**:
- No sentiment analysis (VADER could capture emotional tone)
- No LIWC-style psychological categories
- No pre-trained embeddings for semantic understanding
- Hyperparameters not tuned for the expanded feature set
- No feature selection or dimensionality reduction attempted
- High-cardinality subreddit data not utilized

**Trajectory**: Concerning. The +0.0124 improvement is much smaller than the expected +0.05 to +0.10 from the strategy document. At this pace, reaching the 0.979080 target will take dozens of experiments. Need to identify why the linguistic features underperformed expectations.

## What's Working

1. **Research-driven feature engineering**: Following Stanford paper recommendations was the right approach
2. **Feature importance validation**: Linguistic (27.5%) and interaction (21.3%) features show meaningful contribution
3. **Top features make sense**: total_length, text_length, activity_score, and vote_efficiency in top 5 is logical
4. **No leakage**: Continued proper handling of at_request vs at_retrieval features
5. **Systematic approach**: Adding features in categories allows clear attribution of improvement

## Key Concerns

### 1. Modest Improvement Despite Doubling Features
**Observation**: Added 24 features (185% increase) but only gained +0.0124 AUC (1.85% relative improvement)
**Why it matters**: Feature importance shows linguistic features contribute 27.5% of total importance, but the score improvement is disproportionately small. This suggests the model isn't effectively capturing the signal, or the features need refinement.
**Suggestion**: 
- Increase model capacity: try num_leaves=63 or 127 to capture more complex patterns
- Lower learning_rate to 0.01 with more iterations to allow finer discrimination
- Consider feature interactions: some linguistic features may only be predictive in combination with meta features

### 2. Hyperparameters Not Adapted to Feature Set
**Observation**: Using same LightGBM parameters as baseline (num_leaves=31, learning_rate=0.05) despite adding 24 new features
**Why it matters**: The baseline had 13 features; now with 37 features, the model may need more capacity. Default parameters optimized for 13 features may underfit the richer feature space.
**Suggestion**: 
- Increase num_leaves to 63 or 95
- Decrease learning_rate to 0.01-0.02
- Increase bagging_fraction to 0.9 for better feature utilization
- Run a quick hyperparameter sweep focusing on these key parameters

### 3. Keyword-Based Feature Engineering May Be Too Simple
**Observation**: Using simple substring matching for linguistic features (e.g., "thank" in text)
**Why it matters**: This misses context, synonyms, and semantic meaning. "Grateful" and "appreciative" are captured, but "bless you" or "you're a lifesaver" are missed. Also doesn't handle negation ("not grateful").
**Suggestion**:
- Try VADER sentiment analyzer optimized for social media text
- Implement LIWC-style dictionaries for psychological categories
- Consider Sentence-BERT embeddings for semantic understanding
- Add n-gram features for common phrases

### 4. Missing High-Cardinality Categorical Encoding
**Observation**: requester_subreddits_at_request is used as a count, but the actual subreddit names (in other columns) are ignored
**Why it matters**: Certain subreddits may indicate community engagement patterns that predict success. High karma in helpful subreddits vs. entertainment subreddits may signal different user types.
**Suggestion**: 
- Use target encoding for subreddit features
- Try CatBoost which handles high-cardinality categorical features natively
- Create features: number_of_helpful_subreddits, diversity_score, etc.

### 5. No Error Analysis or Feature Refinement
**Observation**: No analysis of which specific linguistic features underperformed or which request types are still misclassified
**Why it matters**: Without understanding failure modes, we're flying blind. Some narrative categories may work better than others. Some features may need threshold tuning.
**Suggestion**:
- Analyze false positives/negatives to identify patterns
- Check which narrative categories have predictive power
- Consider binning or transforming features (e.g., length bins instead of raw counts)

## Top Priority for Next Experiment

**Hyperparameter tuning for the expanded feature set.** This is the highest-leverage change because:

1. **Low risk**: We're not adding new features that could introduce leakage
2. **High potential**: The 27.5% importance from linguistic features suggests untapped signal
3. **Clear path**: Increase num_leaves and decrease learning_rate to better capture patterns in 37 features
4. **Quick to test**: Can be done in one experiment vs. multiple feature engineering iterations

Specifically:
- num_leaves: 31 → 63 or 95 (more capacity)
- learning_rate: 0.05 → 0.01 or 0.02 (finer optimization)
- num_iterations: increase to 200-300 (compensate for lower LR)
- Keep all 37 features to isolate hyperparameter impact

Expected outcome: Should see additional 0.01-0.03 AUC improvement. If still minimal, then the issue is likely feature quality/refinement, not model capacity.

The research-driven approach is sound, but the model needs more capacity to capture the linguistic signals.
