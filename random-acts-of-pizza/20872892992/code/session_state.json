      "strategy": "## Current Status\n- Best CV: 0.6691 from exp_000 (Baseline Meta-Features Only)\n- Experiments above gold: 0\n- Gap to gold: 0.310 (need +46% improvement)\n\n## Response to Evaluator\n\n**Technical verdict was TRUSTWORTHY.** The baseline execution was sound with proper leakage avoidance and validation.\n\n**Evaluator's top priority: Add text features using TF-IDF.** I PARTIALLY AGREE but with a critical refinement:\n\nMy analysis reveals that simple TF-IDF performs WORSE than meta features alone (0.5239 vs 0.6691 ROC-AUC). However, the Stanford research paper on this exact dataset reveals that specific linguistic patterns DO predict success - just not through bag-of-words approaches.\n\n**Key concerns raised and my responses:**\n\n1. **Text features not utilized** \u2192 AGREED, but approach must be research-driven, not generic TF-IDF\n2. **Hyperparameter tuning premature** \u2192 AGREED, focus on features first\n3. **Feature scaling ignored** \u2192 LightGBM handles this, low priority\n4. **Interaction features missing** \u2192 AGREED, high priority alongside text features\n\n**My synthesis:** The evaluator correctly identified the need for text features, but the solution isn't generic TF-IDF. We need to engineer features based on the Stanford research findings about what actually makes pizza requests successful.\n\n## Data Understanding\n\n**Reference notebooks:**\n- `exploration/eda.ipynb` - Basic EDA and leakage analysis\n- `exploration/evolver_loop1_analysis.ipynb` - Text analysis showing TF-IDF underperformance and length correlation\n\n**Key patterns discovered:**\n1. **Text length correlates with success** (r=0.121, p<0.001): Successful requests average 540 chars vs 442 for unsuccessful\n2. **TF-IDF alone performs poorly** (0.5239 ROC-AUC) - bag-of-words doesn't capture social signals\n3. **Stanford research reveals specific linguistic predictors**: gratitude, evidentiality, reciprocity, narrative structure\n\n**Critical insight:** Success depends on HOW people ask (linguistic patterns), not just WHAT they say (word frequencies).\n\n## Recommended Approaches (Priority Order)\n\n### 1. Engineer Linguistic Features from Stanford Research (HIGHEST PRIORITY)\nBased on the Stanford ICWSM 2014 paper analyzing this exact dataset:\n\n**Implement these specific features:**\n- **Gratitude indicators**: Count of \"thank\", \"thanks\", \"grateful\", \"appreciate\"\n- **Evidentiality markers**: Count of URLs, numbers, specific details, evidence words (\"proof\", \"photo\", \"link\")\n- **Reciprocity language**: Count of \"pay it forward\", \"return the favor\", \"help others\", \"give back\"\n- **Narrative indicators**: \n  - Request length (title + text length)\n  - First-person pronoun count (I, me, my, we, our)\n  - Sentence count (periods, exclamation marks)\n  - Paragraph breaks count\n- **Politeness markers**: Count of \"please\", polite phrasing\n- **Narrative category**: Classify into known successful types (family, job, money, student, desire)\n\n**Why this works:** These features directly capture the social signals that Stanford found predictive, unlike generic TF-IDF.\n\n### 2. Engineer Interaction Features (HIGH PRIORITY)\nCreate ratios and interactions from meta features:\n- `comments_per_day` = comments / account_age_days\n- `posts_per_day` = posts / account_age_days  \n- `comment_to_post_ratio` = comments / (posts + 1)\n- `activity_score` = weighted combination of comments, posts, upvotes\n- `subreddit_diversity` = number_of_subreddits / (comments + posts)\n- `raop_experience` = days_since_first_raop_post / account_age_days\n\n**Why this works:** Raw counts don't capture engagement patterns. Ratios reveal behavior patterns (e.g., frequent commenter vs. lurker).\n\n### 3. Enhanced Temporal Features (MEDIUM PRIORITY)\nImprove upon basic hour/dayofweek:\n- **Time of day categories**: Morning (6-12), Afternoon (12-18), Evening (18-24), Night (0-6)\n- **Weekend vs weekday**: Binary indicator\n- **Rush hour indicator**: Peak hours (12-14, 18-20) when competition is high\n- **Month/season**: Capture any seasonal effects\n- **Account age bins**: Categorical bins (new: <30d, active: 30-180d, established: >180d)\n\n**Why this works:** Temporal patterns may be non-linear. Categorical encoding may capture patterns better than raw numbers.\n\n### 4. Advanced Text Representations (MEDIUM PRIORITY)\nIf linguistic features don't provide enough signal:\n\n**Option A - Sentiment Analysis:**\n- Use VADER sentiment analyzer (optimized for social media)\n- Extract: compound score, positive/negative/neutral percentages\n- Count of positive/negative words\n\n**Option B - LIWC-style Categories:**\n- Psychological word categories (positive emotion, negative emotion, social, cognitive)\n- Function word categories (pronouns, articles, prepositions)\n\n**Option C - Pre-trained Embeddings (if time permits):**\n- Use Sentence-BERT to get embeddings (768 dims)\n- Reduce dimensionality with PCA/UMAP to 10-20 components\n- Use as additional features\n\n**Why this works:** These capture semantic meaning and psychological signals beyond simple word counts.\n\n### 5. Model Architecture Variations (LOWER PRIORITY)\nAfter feature engineering, try:\n- **CatBoost**: Handles categorical features better than LightGBM (for subreddit encoding)\n- **XGBoost**: Different regularization may work better with many text features\n- **Neural Network**: If we have many engineered features, a simple MLP might capture interactions\n- **Stacking Ensemble**: Combine predictions from different model types\n\n**Why this works:** Different algorithms have different strengths. Stacking can capture complementary signals.\n\n### 6. Hyperparameter Tuning (LOWEST PRIORITY - DO LAST)\nOnly after confirming features work:\n- Learning rate: 0.01, 0.05, 0.1\n- Num leaves: 31, 63, 127\n- Min child samples: 20, 50, 100\n- Feature fraction: 0.8, 0.9, 1.0\n\n**Why last:** With proper features, default hyperparameters often work well. Tuning provides diminishing returns.\n\n## What NOT to Try\n\n1. **Generic TF-IDF with thousands of features** - Already tested, performs worse than meta alone\n2. **Deep learning on raw text** - Too slow, likely overkill for this dataset size\n3. **User flair features** - Confirmed leakage, not in test set\n4. **At_retrieval features** - Confirmed leakage, not in test set\n5. **Complex stacking without base model improvements** - Need better base models first\n6. **Extensive hyperparameter tuning before feature engineering** - Wasted effort if features are suboptimal\n\n## Validation Notes\n\n**CV Scheme:** Continue with 5-fold stratified CV (proven stable in baseline)\n\n**Expected improvements:**\n- Linguistic features: +0.05 to +0.10 AUC\n- Interaction features: +0.02 to +0.05 AUC  \n- Enhanced temporal: +0.01 to +0.03 AUC\n- Combined: Target 0.75-0.80 AUC (still below gold, but building foundation)\n\n**Confidence in CV:** High - baseline showed reasonable variance (\u00b10.018), indicating stable validation\n\n**Next checkpoint:** After implementing linguistic and interaction features, expect CV ~0.75. If below 0.72, reconsider approach.",

      "feedback": "## What I Understood\n\nThe junior researcher built a baseline model (experiment #001) using only meta/numerical features available in the test set, achieving 0.6691 \u00b1 0.0178 ROC-AUC. They correctly identified and avoided data leakage features (at_retrieval metrics, user flair) and engineered temporal features (hour, dayofweek). The model used LightGBM with class_weight='balanced' to handle the 25% positive class imbalance. This establishes a trustworthy baseline before adding text features.\n\n## Technical Execution Assessment\n\n**Validation**: Sound 5-fold stratified CV with reasonable variance (\u00b10.0178). Fold scores range from 0.6398 to 0.6961, indicating stable but not overly consistent performance - good sign of proper validation.\n\n**Leakage Risk**: NONE DETECTED. The researcher correctly excluded all at_retrieval features and user flair (100% predictive of success). They only used features present in test set.\n\n**Score Integrity**: VERIFIED. Mean ROC-AUC 0.6691 matches execution output. OOF score 0.6656 is consistent with fold scores.\n\n**Code Quality**: Clean, reproducible code with proper random_state setting, early stopping, and balanced class handling. No silent failures detected.\n\n**Feature Engineering**: Added hour and dayofweek from timestamps - appropriate and safe. Feature importance shows temporal features matter (unix_timestamp ranks #1).\n\nVerdict: **TRUSTWORTHY**\n\n## Strategic Assessment\n\n**Approach Fit**: Appropriate baseline strategy. Starting with meta-only features before adding text is sound - isolates signal from structured data first.\n\n**Effort Allocation**: Well-spent. Baseline was necessary, and avoiding leakage shows good judgment. However, 0.6691 is far from the 0.979080 target - major improvements needed.\n\n**Assumptions**: \n- Assumes meta features alone have limited signal (validated by 0.6691 score)\n- Assumes text features will add substantial value (reasonable given Reddit context)\n- Assumes temporal patterns are linear (hour/dayofweek as categorical might be better)\n\n**Blind Spots**:\n- Text features completely ignored (request_title, request_text_edit_aware) - this is the obvious next step\n- User subreddits (high cardinality categorical) not encoded\n- No interaction features between activity metrics\n- No feature scaling/normalization attempted\n- Hyperparameters are all defaults except num_leaves=31\n\n**Trajectory**: Baseline complete, ready for next phase. The 0.31 gap to target suggests text features are essential. Current approach is promising but needs acceleration.\n\n## What's Working\n\n1. **Leakage awareness**: Excellent job identifying and avoiding at_retrieval features and user flair\n2. **Validation rigor**: Proper stratified CV with reasonable variance across folds\n3. **Feature engineering**: Temporal features from timestamps are valuable (unix_timestamp ranks #1 in importance)\n4. **Class imbalance handling**: Using class_weight='balanced' is appropriate for 25% positive rate\n5. **Baseline establishment**: 0.6691 provides clear benchmark for improvement\n\n## Key Concerns\n\n### 1. Text Features Not Utilized\n**Observation**: The most obvious source of signal - request_title and request_text_edit_aware - were completely ignored.\n**Why it matters**: Reddit posts are the core content. Success likely depends heavily on request quality, tone, length, sentiment, etc. Meta features alone can't capture this.\n**Suggestion**: Add text features immediately. Start with simple length metrics, then TF-IDF, then embeddings. This is the highest-leverage next step.\n\n### 2. Hyperparameter Tuning Premature\n**Observation**: Using mostly default LightGBM parameters (only num_leaves=31 changed).\n**Why it matters**: With only 13 features, model capacity and regularization matter. Learning_rate=0.05 might be too high for this small feature set.\n**Suggestion**: Grid search key parameters: learning_rate (0.01-0.1), num_leaves (15-63), min_child_samples. But do this AFTER adding text features.\n\n### 3. Feature Scaling Ignored\n**Observation**: No scaling/normalization of numerical features before modeling.\n**Why it matters**: LightGBM handles this better than linear models, but scaling can still help, especially for features with large ranges (upvotes range to 155k).\n**Suggestion**: Try standard scaling or rank transformation on vote count features.\n\n### 4. Interaction Features Missing\n**Observation**: Using raw activity metrics independently.\n**Why it matters**: Ratios like comments/posts or activity normalized by account age might be more predictive than raw counts.\n**Suggestion**: Engineer interaction features: comments_per_day, posts_per_day, comment_to_post_ratio, etc.\n\n## Top Priority for Next Experiment\n\n**Add text features using TF-IDF and simple length metrics.** This is the single highest-leverage change:\n\n1. Extract request_title and request_text_edit_aware\n2. Engineer features: title_length, text_length, total_length\n3. Add TF-IDF vectors (start with unigrams, max_features=1000-5000)\n4. Keep existing meta features\n5. Re-run same LightGBM setup to isolate text feature impact\n\nExpected outcome: Should see 0.05-0.15 AUC improvement. If text adds minimal value, reconsider approach - perhaps the signal is in specific language patterns requiring more sophisticated NLP (sentiment, LIWC categories, or transformer embeddings).\n\nThe foundation is solid. Now build on it with the obvious missing piece: the actual request text.",
