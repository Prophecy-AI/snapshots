      "query": "How do Kaggle winners approach text classification problems with both text and meta features?",
      "finding": "Based on winning solutions from several Kaggle NLP competitions, the most common workflow for text\u2011classification tasks that also have numerical or categorical \u201cmeta\u201d features is:\n\n1. **Clean the raw data and engineer simple meta features** \u2013 remove special characters, URLs, HTML tags and emojis; then create quantitative descriptors such as text length, proportion of uppercase characters, or any domain\u2011specific numeric/categorical fields. These engineered features often carry strong signal (e.g., upper\u2011case ratio was a key predictor in the Jigsaw toxicity competition)\u202f([radurobu\u202fGitHub](https://github.com/radurobu/Jigsaw-Comments-Kaggle-Competition)).\n\n2. **Encode the text with a pre\u2011trained transformer** \u2013 fine\u2011tune a model like BERT or RoBERTa on the competition data to obtain contextual embeddings for each document\u202f([FreeAgent\u202fengineering blog](https://engineering.freeagent.com/2024/05/17/combining-text-with-numerical-and-categorical-features-for-classification);\u202f[McCormick\u202fblog](ht",

      "query": "What are the best approaches for handling class imbalance in binary classification on Kaggle?",
      "finding": "Class imbalance is a common obstacle in Kaggle binary\u2011classification contests, especially when the target event (e.g., fraud, churn, or a rare disease) makes up only a few percent of the rows. The most reliable way to mitigate its effect is to combine **data\u2011level** and **algorithm\u2011level** tricks while evaluating with metrics that reward performance on the minority class.\n\nAt the data level, oversampling the rare class (random oversampling or synthetic methods such as SMOTE/ADASYN) or undersampling the majority class can give the model a more balanced training signal. The\u202fimbalanced\u2011learn library provides ready\u2011to\u2011use implementations of these techniques and integrates smoothly with scikit\u2011learn pipelines ([imbalanced\u2011learn.org](https://imbalanced-learn.org/stable/index.html)). For deep\u2011learning models, TensorFlow\u2019s \u201cClassification on imbalanced data\u201d tutorial shows how to apply Keras\u202f`class_weight` or `sample_weight` to penalise mistakes on the minority class and also demonstrates simp",
