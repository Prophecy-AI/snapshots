      "finding": "Based on winning solutions from several Kaggle NLP competitions, the most common workflow for text\u2011classification tasks that also have numerical or categorical \u201cmeta\u201d features is:\n\n1. **Clean the raw data and engineer simple meta features** \u2013 remove special characters, URLs, HTML tags and emojis; then create quantitative descriptors such as text length, proportion of uppercase characters, or any domain\u2011specific numeric/categorical fields. These engineered features often carry strong signal (e.g., upper\u2011case ratio was a key predictor in the Jigsaw toxicity competition)\u202f([radurobu\u202fGitHub](https://github.com/radurobu/Jigsaw-Comments-Kaggle-Competition)).\n\n2. **Encode the text with a pre\u2011trained transformer** \u2013 fine\u2011tune a model like BERT or RoBERTa on the competition data to obtain contextual embeddings for each document\u202f([FreeAgent\u202fengineering blog](https://engineering.freeagent.com/2024/05/17/combining-text-with-numerical-and-categorical-features-for-classification);\u202f[McCormick\u202fblog](ht",

      "finding": "Class imbalance is a common obstacle in Kaggle binary\u2011classification contests, especially when the target event (e.g., fraud, churn, or a rare disease) makes up only a few percent of the rows. The most reliable way to mitigate its effect is to combine **data\u2011level** and **algorithm\u2011level** tricks while evaluating with metrics that reward performance on the minority class.\n\nAt the data level, oversampling the rare class (random oversampling or synthetic methods such as SMOTE/ADASYN) or undersampling the majority class can give the model a more balanced training signal. The\u202fimbalanced\u2011learn library provides ready\u2011to\u2011use implementations of these techniques and integrates smoothly with scikit\u2011learn pipelines ([imbalanced\u2011learn.org](https://imbalanced-learn.org/stable/index.html)).

      "finding": "Text preprocessing is the first\u2011line defence against the noise that makes Reddit and other social\u2011media posts difficult to model.  The most reliable pipeline starts by stripping out platform\u2011specific artefacts \u2013 URLs, subreddit tags (e.g.,\u202fr/\u200bnews), user mentions (u/\u200bname), markdown, HTML entities and non\u2011letter characters \u2013 and normalising case ([textPrep](https://www.churchill.io/papers/textprep.pdf)).  Next, a tokenizer that respects Reddit\u2011specific tokens (hashtags, emojis, emoticons) is applied; the open\u2011source\u202fRedditScore library even provides a \u201cCrazyTokenizer\u201d with built\u2011in options for these symbols ([RedditScore](https://redditscore.readthedocs.io/en/master)).  After tokenisation, most pipelines perform light linguistic normalisation: expanding contractions, removing or optionally keeping stop\u2011words, and applying lemmatisation or stemming (e.g., NLTK\u2019s WordNet lemmatiser) to collapse inflectional forms.

The current best practice is to train **heterogeneous base learners** \u2013 e.g. a transformer\u2011based text model (BERT, RoBERTa, or an LLM\u2011derived embedding) and several classical tabular algorithms such as LightGBM, CatBoost, or Random Forest \u2013 and then fuse their predictions with either **weighted averaging** or a **stacked meta\u2011learner**.  AutoGluon\u2019s multimodal pipeline does exactly this: it fits a TextPredictor alongside a suite of tabular models and automatically combines them via a weighted ensemble or a stack ensemble, letting you tune the blend weights on a validation split\u202f([auto.gluon.ai](https://auto.gluon.ai/0.1.0/tutorials/tabular_prediction/tabular-multimodal-text-others.html)).
