      "finding": "Based on winning solutions from several Kaggle NLP competitions, the most common workflow for text\u2011classification tasks that also have numerical or categorical \u201cmeta\u201d features is:\n\n1. **Clean the raw data and engineer simple meta features** \u2013 remove special characters, URLs, HTML tags and emojis; then create quantitative descriptors such as text length, proportion of uppercase characters, or any domain\u2011specific numeric/categorical fields. These engineered features often carry strong signal (e.g., upper\u2011case ratio was a key predictor in the Jigsaw toxicity competition)\u202f([radurobu\u202fGitHub](https://github.com/radurobu/Jigsaw-Comments-Kaggle-Competition)).\n\n2. **Encode the text with a pre\u2011trained transformer** \u2013 fine\u2011tune a model like BERT or RoBERTa on the competition data to obtain contextual embeddings for each document\u202f([FreeAgent\u202fengineering blog](https://engineering.freeagent.com/2024/05/17/combining-text-with-numerical-and-categorical-features-for-classification);\u202f[McCormick\u202fblog](ht",
