      "text": "The Stanford study found that success is driven far more by *how* a request is written than by who is asking.  Requests that **clearly articulate a need through a coherent narrative** are far more likely to be fulfilled, and the authors identify five \u201cstory types\u201d (desire, family, job, money, student) that differ in effectiveness\u202f([nlp.stanford.edu](https://nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/icwsm2014_pizza.pdf)).  Within those narratives, several linguistic cues stand out:\n\n* **Expressions of gratitude** \u2013 even a brief \u201cthank you\u201d markedly raises the chance of a positive response, while other politeness markers have little effect\u202f([thrillist.com](https://www.thrillist.com/eat/nation/stanford-study-analyzes-random-acts-of-pizza)).  \n* **Evidentiality** \u2013 providing concrete evidence (photos, links, or other verifiable details) that backs up the story makes donors more willing to help\u202f([nlp.stanford.edu](https://nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/icwsm2014_pizza.pdf)).  \n* **Generalized reciprocity** \u2013 explicitly promising to \u201cpay it forward\u201d or otherwise return the favor predicts higher success\u202f([nlp.stanford.edu](https://nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/icwsm2014_pizza.pdf)).  \n* **Request length** \u2013 longer, more detailed posts tend to receive more pizza, suggesting that a richer narrative is persuasive\u202f([thrillist.com](https://www.thrillist.com/eat/nation/stanford-study-analyzes-random-acts-of-pizza)).  \n* **High asker status** \u2013 users with higher Reddit karma or longer community tenure are trusted more and see higher fulfillment rates\u202f([nlp.stanford.edu](https://nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/icwsm2014_pizza.pdf)).\n\nTogether, these linguistic features\u2014gratitude, evidential support, reciprocity promises, detailed storytelling, and signals of asker status\u2014form a predictive model that correctly classifies successful pizza requests about 70\u202f% of the time.",

While the success of such requests is critical to the\nsuccess of the community, the factors that lead community\nmembers to satisfy a request are largely unknown. Success\nof a request depends on factors like who is asking, how they\nare asking, when are they asking, and most critically what\nis being requested, ranging from small favors to substantial\nmonetary donations. We present a case study of altruistic re\u0002quests in an online community where all requests ask for the\nvery same contribution and do not offer anything tangible in\nreturn, allowing us to disentangle what is requested from tex\u0002tual and social factors. Drawing from social psychology liter\u0002ature, we extract high-level social features from text that op\u0002erationalize social relations between recipient and donor and\ndemonstrate that these extracted relations are predictive of\nsuccess. More specifically, we find that clearly communicat\u0002ing need through the narrative is essential and that linguistic\nindications of gratitude, evidentiality, and generalized reci\u0002procity, as well as high status of the asker further increase the\nlikelihood of success. Building on this understanding, we de\u0002velop a model that can predict the success of unseen requests,\nsignificantly improving over several baselines. We link these\nfindings to research in psychology on helping behavior, pro\u0002viding a basis for further analysis of success in social media\nsystems.\n1 Introduction\nWe live in a time where people increasingly turn to the\nweb for help. Our needs, however, often go far beyond\nmere information from existing webpages and we need\nhelp from real people. For example, we ask for answers to\nspecific questions on StackOverflow.com, for donations on\nDonorsChoose.org, or for help on online social communi\u0002ties such as Reddit.com. In each of these cases a user per\u0002forms a request, which we define as an act of asking for\u0002mally for something. All these communities rely heavily on\ntheir members to help satisfy the request. Yet, the factors\nthat lead community members to satisfy a request remain\nlargely unknown. Understanding the dynamics and factors\nof successful requests has the potential to substantially im\u0002prove such communities by educating users about better for\u0002Copyright \u20ddc 2014, Association for the Advancement of Artificial\nIntelligence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved.\nmulating requests and promoting likely-to-succeed requests\n(Greenberg et al. 2013; Mitra and Gilbert 2014). In addi\u0002tion to these practical benefits, understanding the factors that\nmake a request successful has implications for questions in\nsocial psychology and linguistic pragmatics.\nStudies on the popular crowdfunding platform Kickstarter\nhave shown that the success of a request depends most\ncrucially on what is being requested, that is, whether it\nis a small favor like an answer to a simple question or a\nlarge financial contribution (Mitra and Gilbert 2014; Mol\u0002lick 2014). Many other factors need to be controlled as well;\nwhat the giver receives in return, when they are asking, and\neven group dynamics, since people are more likely to give\nto projects that others are already giving to (Etter, Gross\u0002glauser, and Thiran 2013; Ceyhan, Shi, and Leskovec 2011;\nMitra and Gilbert 2014). Satisfying a request on peer-to-peer\nlending or crowd-funding platforms can also bring a reward,\nand this also can drive the selection process. It is extremely\ndifficult to disentangle the effects of all these factors in deter\u0002mining what makes people satisfy requests, and what makes\nthem select some requests over others.\nIn this paper, we develop a framework for controlling for\neach of these potential confounds while studying the role\nof two aspects that characterize compelling requests: social\nfactors (who is asking and how the recipient is related to\nthe donor and community) and linguistic factors (how they\nare asking and what linguistic devices accompany successful\nrequests). With the notable exception of Mitra and Gilbert\n(2014), the effect of language on the success of requests has\nlargely been ignored thus far.1\nOur goal is to understand what motivates people to give\nwhen they do not receive anything tangible in return. That is,\nwe focus on the important special case of altruistic requests\nin which the giver receives no rewards. This controls for the\nincentive to obtain attractive rewards commonly offered on\ncrowdfunding sites such as Kickstarter; the absence of exter\u0002nal factors such as tangible rewards also makes the language\nitself all the more important in persuading others to help. In\nthis domain we also do not need to consider crowdfunding\u0002related marketing strategies such as emphasizing limited\n1Linguistic factors have also been considered to influence the\nresponse quantity, quality, and speed to questions in online com\u0002munities and social networks (Teevan, Morris, and Panovich 2011;\nBurke et al. 2007, inter alia).\ntime offers (scarcity) or showing that other people made the\nsame decision already (social proof) (Cialdini 2001), which\nare known to manifest themselves in language (Mitra and\nGilbert 2014). Second, we focus on requests that a single\nuser can fulfill, thereby additionally eliminating group be\u0002havior effects such as herding (Ceyhan, Shi, and Leskovec\n2011) or completing donation biases (Wash 2013). Finally,\nwe focus on one community in which what is being asked\nfor is held constant. This allows us to explore a large num\u0002ber of different requests of different individual users, at dif\u0002ferent times, that all have the same goal. Controlling for the\nrequest goal therefore allows us to study how to optimize a\nparticular request solely by optimizing its presentation, and\nhelps provide a direct practical benefit to the requester (by\ncontrast, advising a requester who needs something to in\u0002stead ask for something different may be advice of limited\npractical use).\nWe therefore chose to study donations in \u201cRandom Acts\nof Pizza\u201d, an online community devoted to giving away free\npizza to strangers that ask for one. Random Acts of Pizza2\n(RAOP) is a community within the social news and enter\u0002tainment website Reddit.com. Users can submit requests for\nfree pizza and if their story is compelling enough a fellow\nuser might decide to send them one, \u201cbecause... who doesn\u2019t\nlike helping out a stranger? The purpose is to have fun, eat\npizza and help each other out. Together, we aim to restore\nfaith in humanity, one slice at a time.3\u201d A typical post might\nsound something like this: \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since my\nmother and I have had proper food. I\u2019ve been struggling to\nfind any kind of work so I can supplement my mom\u2019s so\u0002cial security... A real pizza would certainly lift our spirits\n(Berman 2011).\u201d\nThis platform addresses many of the potential confounds\nthat complicate other platforms or studies: all requests ask\nfor the same thing, a pizza, there are no additional incen\u0002tives or rewards, each request is satisfied by a single user,\nusers and requests are embedded in a social network within\nReddit, and requests are largely textual. This dataset thus\nprovides us with an unusually clear picture of the effect of\nlanguage and social factors on success.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows: in\u0002spired by studies in crowdfunding, user-to-user evaluations\nin social networks, and helping behavior in social psychol\u0002ogy, we introduce a variety of textual and social factors that\nare potentially associated with successful requests. We use\ntopic modeling and automatic detection to extract a particu\u0002larly complex factor, the narrative s...",

The lab rats at Stanford have put together a real, published study on what gets people free pizza. Now, keep in mind this is **a hyper-specific [case study](http://www.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/pubs/icwsm2014_pizza.pdf)** on the Reddit mainstay [Random Acts of Pizza](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/), where people submit pleas for free pizza to the Reddit community... and sometimes score. But it tells us about how to successfully grovel for pies in general, so listen up:\n\n- **Be grateful**. The team looked at 19 different \"politeness features\" and found that only gratitude -- not \"pleeeease Mom\" -- had a big impact.\n- **Back up your story**. People were more likely to donate pizza if there was evidence backing up the person's tale. So if you're telling people you need free pizza because your car is busted and you need to pay for repairs, show them a photo of your bashed-up Fiero.\n- **Offer to return the favor**. Statistically speaking, Redditors tend to give to peeps who sound like they're gonna pay back the pizza karma.\n- **Ramble**. This is one case where long-winded stories are a good idea. Longer posts meant more pizza, so go ahead and ignore your word count.\n- **Don't just say you're hungry**. Make a real case for yourself: the study found that people who hinged their pleas on a pizza-craving got shut down.\n\nNow that you're wise to how the system works, go forth and offer your pitch to the board.\n\n_**[Kristin Hunt](https://www.thrillist.com/authors/kristin-hunt)** is a food/drink staff writer for Thrillist and is always on the hunt for free pizza.

While the success of such requests is critical to the success of the community, the factors that lead community members to satisfy a request are largely unknown. Success of a request depends on factors like who is asking, how they are asking, when are they asking, and most critically what is being requested, ranging from small favors to substantial monetary donations. We present a case study of altruistic requests in an online community where all requests ask for the very same contribution and do not offer anything tangible in return, allowing us to disentangle what is requested from textual and social factors. Drawing from social psychology literature, we extract high-level social features from text that operationalize social relations between recipient and donor and demonstrate that these extracted relations are predictive of success. More specifically, we find that clearly communicating need through the narrative is essential and that that linguistic indications of gratitude, evidentiality, and generalized reciprocity, as well as high status of the asker further increase the likelihood of success. Building on this understanding, we develop a model that can predict the success of unseen requests, significantly improving over several baselines. We link these findings to research in psychology on helping behavior, providing a basis for further analysis of success in social media systems. Comments:|To appear at ICWSM 2014. 10pp, 3 fig.

But you don\u2019t want to miss even a second of your _[True Life](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HQ1MJ6O/?tag=slatmaga-20)_ marathon, and more importantly, you don\u2019t have the funds on hand. You figure that your best chance for getting some pizza to appear in your life is to appeal to the Reddit community. Those people spend a lot of time at their computers, and they get you! So you post on the subreddit [Random Acts of Pizza](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/)\u2014a magical place where users fulfill one another\u2019s wishes for a pie. But science says your plan for world laziness domination is not going to work. It\u2019s just not a compelling story.\n\nResearchers at Stanford [recently published](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1405.3282v1.pdf) \u201cHow to Ask for a Favor: A Case Study on the Success of Altruistic Requests,\u201d and behind that name are the more than 21,000 posts and related data that appeared on Random Acts of Pizza between December 2010 and September 2013. The researchers analyzed the language of the pizza requests, the histories of the users who posted them, data about which requests had been fulfilled, and the differences between requests that did and did not result in pizza.\n\n[As _MIT Technology Review_ explains](http://www.technologyreview.com/view/527496/data-mining-reddit-posts-reveals-how-to-ask-for-a-favor-and-get-it/), the group used a common machine-learning algorithm to analyze the body of data. The group used 70 percent of the data to let the algorithm figure out which requests work and which don\u2019t, and then turned it on the last 30 percent to see how accurate its predictions were. Seventy percent of the time, the algorithm correctly predicted which pizza requests had been fulfilled.\n\nYou may not be completely bowled over by those predictive powers, but this is some deep textual analysis. The researchers separated the posts into five different types of narratives: money, a job, being a student, family, and a \u201ccraving\u201d category that often involves things like friends, parties, and/or drunken revelry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd the researchers found that family, money, and job narratives improved the likelihood of pizza fulfillment, while the other categories were neutral or reduced the chance of success. Politeness (specifically expressions of gratitude), evidentiality (like including a photo), reciprocity (an indication that the poster would potentially give pizza to someone else at another time), sentiment, and length were other factors contributing to success.\n\nHere\u2019s an example of a request that worked:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n> My gf and I have hit some hard times with her losing her job and then unemployment as well for being physically unable to perform her job due to various hand injuries as a server in a restuarant. She is currently petitioning to have unemployment reinstated due to medical reasons for being unable to perform her job, but until then things are really tight and ANYTHING would help us out right now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n> I\u2019ve been both a giver and receiver in RAOP before and would certainly return the favor again when I am able to reciprocate. It took everything we have to pay rent today and some food would go a long ways towards making our next couple of days go by much better with some food.\n\nAnd one that didn\u2019t:\n\n> My friend is coming in town for the weekend and my friends and i are so excited because we haven\u2019t seen him since junior high. we are going to a high school football game then to the dollar theater after and it would be so nice if someone fed us before we embarked :)\n\nThe post with more information and context, plus a more compelling personal story, is more likely to do well with the Reddit community than the post that seems shallow and doesn\u2019t make the reader feel like the poster is a meaningful contributor to the Random Acts of Pizza community. You can see how an algorithm that knows how to ask for favors in a compelling way might be able to abuse its power. And likewise good ol\u2019 humans could take these findings and use them to game Random Acts of Pizza, but that would be really crappy. Who could be so heartless when the site\u2019s motto is \u201cRestoring Faith in Humanity, One Slice at a Time\u201d? Oh, right, it\u2019s the Internet.\n\n[Tweet](https://twitter.com/share?text=Here%E2%80%99s+the+Scientific+Way+to+Ask+for+Pizza%2C+or+Any+Favor&via=slate&url=https%3A%2F%2Fslate.com%2Ftechnology%2F2014%2F05%2Fresearchers-at-stanford-analyzed-random-acts-of-pizza-posts-on-reddit.html%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dtraffic%26utm_source%3Darticle%26utm_content%3Dtwitter_share) [Share](https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fslate.com%2Ftechnology%2F2014%2F05%2Fresearchers-at-stanford-analyzed-random-acts-of-pizza-posts-on-reddit.html%3Futm_medium%3Dsocial%26utm_campaign%3Dtraffic%26utm_source%3Darticle%26utm_content%3Dfacebook_share)Share [Comment](https://slate.com/comments/technology/2014/05/researchers-at-stanford-analyzed-random-acts-of-pizza-posts-on-reddit.html)\n\n- [Pizza](https://slate.com/tag/pizza)\n- [Reddit](https://slate.com/tag/reddit)\n\nAdvertisement\n\n* * *\n\nAdvertisement\n\n[iframe](https://d1ad5f186b6916b32bd64769d6171e63.safeframe.googlesyndication.com/safeframe/1-0-40/html/container.html)[iframe](https://s.amazon-adsystem.com/iu3?cm3ppd=1&d=dtb-pub&csif=t&dl=gg_n-index_n-Ogury_ox-db5_smrt_n-sharethrough_n-onetag_pm-db5_rbd_ppt_n-vmg_an-db5_sovrn_3lift)[iframe](about:blank)[iframe](about:blank)[iframe](about:blank)[iframe](https://ch-match.taboola.com/sync?dast=V9JasCABYDAH435BIDHNifBAB-N-QSAxzYnwUAAAAABgYA_gcAJONb-UamhWUt801GbtHKZFwrjCOXW-ZZLkzL1XC0cY2MAEAyvpVvZFpY1jLfZOQWrUzGtcI4crllnuXCtFwNRxvXyAoAH8ZymQxqgYRl9vsOCsrp6TG7DKKi622xO5xmzxsA3tB0Onyue73m7DC97Bq_2y96eYx2v9nvc_4lg8VoL1jtJS_Py2H5GF2Wz1themtOD7vNbzm5FXaH2Xl9mdySh93kd7sVHtPnrbe5BU_r9eEW_D2nz1tvd0teJpPTdBea3mY7AAAAAAA8APz___9DAAAAAABEAAAAAABIAAAAAABQAARUAPxbAAhcAAAAAABgAPz___9rAACMbwAIPKUcAAjid1hObofdHwAAAAAAIAAAAAAAJAAAAAAAJQAAAAAAJwD__________zEAA_SZNzIA_____zcACz0AAA8-AAAPQgAAAA...",

Credit: arXiv:1405.3282 \\[cs.CL\\]\n\n\"We live in a time where people increasingly turn to the web for help... Yet, the factors that lead community members to satisfy a request remain largely unknown.\" Thus states a study by researchers at Stanford and the Max Planck Institute SWS who examined a data set of requests for donations of pizza to figure out what kinds of requests for favors actually draw success.\n\nTheir paper, \"How to Ask for a Favor: A Case Study on the Success of Altruistic Requests\" submitted to arXiv on May 13, details how they structured their investigation and what conclusions they were able to draw, by using the Random Acts of Pizza section of the Reddit website as their testbed. Reporting on their work, MIT Technology Review noted that \"psychologists have never understood the factors that make requests successful, largely because it has always been difficult to separate the influence of the request from what is being requested.\" While the question of what makes Web requests successful is far-reaching, the authors explained why they chose to hone in on a pizza-donation site for some answers.\n\nAuthors Tim Althoff, Cristian Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil and Dan Jurafsky said they studied donations in \" [Random Acts of Pizza](ttp://randomactsofpizza.com/)\" (an online community within the website Reddit.com) where strangers ask for free pizza. If requesting stories are compelling enough, a fellow user might respond. The site states that \"Together, we aim to restore faith in humanity, one slice at a time.\" The researchers chose the site because all requests ask for the same thing and each request can be satisfied by a single user. They said, \"users and requests are embedded in a social network within Reddit, and requests are largely textual. This dataset thus provides us with an unusually clear picture of the effect of language and social factors on success.\"\n\nWhat kinds of requests, then, were found to be the most successful in getting a response?\" What features characterize compelling requests? What is interesting about their study is that they not only explored how bidders were asking for pizza but also studied the role played in who was asking and how the recipient was related to the donor and community.\n\nThe authors found that community status was correlated with success. Having posted before in RAOP had a strong positive effect. People were more apt to help users that contributed to the community in some form already. The authors wrote, \"We find that Reddit users with higher status overall (higher karma) or higher status within the subcommunity (previous posts) are significantly more likely to receive help.\" Reciprocation was found to be another step to success. The authors said, \"The language of reciprocity ('return the favor') is used in a variety of ways to signal the willingness to give back to the community by helping out another member in the future (generalized reciprocity). Such claims are significantly correlated with higher chances of success.\"\n\nWhile an old saying is to keep narratives short and sweet the researchers found that longer requests tended to be more successful than short ones. \"Longer requests,\" they said,\" are significantly correlated with [success](https://techxplore.com/tags/success/).\" In analyzing the kind of narrative, the authors found narratives that clearly expressed need, such as for a job or money were more likely to succeed than narratives that did not (craving). Specifically, \"job\", \"money\", and \"family\" narratives were more likely to win than a \"craving\" narrative, which had a negative influence.\n\nMIT Technology Review [commented](http://www.technologyreview.com/view/527496/data-mining-reddit-posts-reveals-how-to-ask-for-a-favor-and-get-it/) that \"An important line of future work will be in using his work to understand altruistic behavior in other communities, too.\"\n\n**More information:**\nHow to Ask for a Favor: A Case Study on the Success of Altruistic Requests, arXiv:1405.3282 \\[cs.CL\\], [arxiv.org/abs/1405.3282](http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.3282)\n\n**Abstract**\n\nRequests are at the core of many social media systems such as question & answer sites and online philanthropy communities. While the success of such requests is critical to the success of the community, the factors that lead community members to satisfy a request are largely unknown. Success of a request depends on factors like who is asking, how they are asking, when are they asking, and most critically what is being requested, ranging from small favors to substantial monetary donations. We present a case study of altruistic requests in an online community where all requests ask for the very same contribution and do not offer anything tangible in return, allowing us to disentangle what is requested from textual and social factors. Drawing from social psychology literature, we extract high-level social features from text that operationalize social relations between recipient and donor and demonstrate that these extracted relations are predictive of success. More specifically, we find that clearly communicating need through the narrative is essential and that that linguistic indications of gratitude, evidentiality, and generalized reciprocity, as well as high status of the asker further increase the likelihood of success. Building on this understanding, we develop a model that can predict the success of unseen requests, significantly improving over several baselines. We link these findings to research in psychology on helping behavior, providing a basis for further analysis of success in social media systems.\n\n\u00a9 2014 Tech Xplore\n\n**Citation**:\nData scientists analyze winning pizza donation requests (2014, May 28)\nretrieved 15 June 2024\nfrom https://techxplore.com/news/2014-05-scientists-pizza-donation.html\n\nThis document is subject to copyright.

The Random Acts of Pizza section of the Reddit website is a good example.\n\n![](https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Altruism20I-3.png)\n\nPeople leave messages asking for pizza which others fulfill if they find the story compelling. As the site says: \u201cbecause \u2026 who doesn\u2019t like helping out a stranger? The purpose is to have fun, eat pizza and help each other out. Together, we aim to restore faith in humanity, one slice at a time.\u201d\n\nA request might go something like this:\u00a0_\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since my mother and I have had proper food. I\u2019ve been struggling to find any kind of work so I can supplement my mom\u2019s social security \u2026 A real pizza would certainly lift our spirits.\u201d_ Anybody can then fulfill the order which is then marked on the site with a badge saying \u201cgot pizza\u2019d,\u201d often with notes of thanks.\n\nThat raises an interesting question. What kinds of requests are most successful in getting a response? Today, we get an answer thanks to the work of Tim Althoff at Stanford University and a couple of pals who lift the veil on the previously murky question of how to ask for a favor\u2014and receive it.\n\nTheir approach is straightforward. They analyze requests on the Random Acts of Pizza site and look for features that successful ones have on common.\n\nThey begin by downloading the entire history of the site from December 2010 to September 2013. This is more than 21,000 posts, which includes requests, fulfillment notes, and other posts.\n\nThey then looked at each person who had posted on the site and downloaded their entire history of posts across the whole of Reddit. That added up to a total of 1.87 million posts.\n\nFinally, they filtered out requests where it was unclear whether they had been fulfilled, leaving a total of 5,738 requests. Of these, they were able to identify the benefactor in 379 cases.\n\nThey analyzed how various features might be responsible for the success of a post, such as the politeness of the post; its sentiment, whether positive or negative, for example; its length. The team also looked at the similarity of the requester to the benefactor; and also the status of the requester.\n\nFinally, they examined whether the post contained evidence of need in the form of a narrative that described why the requester needed free pizza.\n\nAlthoff and co used a standard machine learning algorithm to comb through all the possible correlations in 70 percent of the data, which they used for training. Having found various correlations, they tested to see whether this had predictive power in the remaining 30 percent of the data. In other words, can their algorithm predict whether a previously unseen request will be successful or not?\n\nIt turns out that their algorithm makes a successful prediction about 70 percent of the time. That\u2019s far from perfect but much better than random guessing which is right only half the time.\n\nSo what kinds of factors are important? Narrative is a key part of many of the posts, so Althoff and co spent some time categorizing the types of stories people use.\n\nThey divided the narratives into five types, those that mention: money; a job; being a student; family; and a final group that includes mentions of friends, being drunk, celebrating and so on, which Althoff and co call \u201ccraving.\u201d\n\nOf these, narratives about jobs, family, and money increase the probability of success. Student narratives have no effect while craving narratives significantly reduce the chances of success. In other words, narratives that communicate a need are more successful than those that do not.\n\n\u201cWe find that clearly communicating need through the narrative is essential,\u201d say Althoff and co. And evidence of reciprocation helps too.\n\n(Given these narrative requirements, it is not surprising that longer requests tend to be more successful than short ones.)\n\nSo for example, the following request was successful because it clearly demonstrates both need and evidence of reciprocation.\n\n_\u201cMy gf and I have hit some hard times with her losing her job and then unemployment as well for being physically unable to perform her job due to various hand injuries as a server in a restaurant. She is currently petitioning to have unemployment reinstated due to medical reasons for being unable to perform her job, but until then things are really tight and ANYTHING would help us out right now._\n\n_I\u2019ve been both a giver and receiver in RAOP before and would certainly return the favor again when I am able to reciprocate. It took everything we have to pay rent today and some food would go a long ways towards making our next couple of days go by much better with some food.\u201d_\n\nBy contrast, the \u201ccraving\u201d narrative below demonstrates neither and was not successful.\n\n_\u201cMy friend is coming in town for the weekend and my friends and i are so excited because we haven\u2019t seen him since junior high. we are going to a high school football game then to the_ _dollar theater after and it would be so nice if someone fed us before we embarked\u00a0:)\u201d_\n\nAlthoff and co also say that the status of the requester is an important factor, too. \u201cWe find that Reddit users with higher status overall (higher karma) or higher status within the subcommunity (previous posts) are significantly more likely to receive help,\u201d they say.\n\nBut surprisingly, being polite does not help (except by offering thanks).\n\nThat\u2019s interesting work. Until now, psychologists have never understood the factors that make requests successful, largely because it has always been difficult to separate the influence of the request from what is being requested.\n\nThe key here is that everybody making requests in this study wants the same thing\u2014pizza. In one swoop, this makes the data significantly easier to tease apart.\n\nAn important line of future work will be in using his work to understand altruistic behavior in other communities, too.\n\nThe take-home message here is that if you want free pizza, it helps if you really need one, that you\u2019re willing to pay it back in future, and above all that you can turn all that into a good story.\n\nGood luck!\n\nRef:\u00a0[http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.3282](http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.3282)\u00a0: How to Ask for a Favor: A Case Study on the Success of Altruistic Requests\n\nhide\n\n### Keep Reading\n\n### Most Popular\n\n[**Ethically sourced \u201cspare\u201d human bodies could revolutionize medicine**](https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/03/25/1113611/ethically-sourced-spare-human-bodies-could-revolutionize-medicine/)\n\nHuman \u201cbodyoids\u201d could reduce animal testing, improve drug development, and alleviate organ shortages.\n\nBy\n\n- [Carsten T.
