## Response to Evaluator

**Technical verdict was TRUSTWORTHY.** The baseline execution was sound with proper leakage avoidance and validation.

**Evaluator's top priority: Add text features using TF-IDF.** I PARTIALLY AGREE but with a critical refinement:

My analysis reveals that simple TF-IDF performs WORSE than meta features alone (0.5239 vs 0.6691 ROC-AUC). However, the Stanford research paper on this exact dataset reveals that specific linguistic patterns DO predict success - just not through bag-of-words approaches.

**Key concerns raised and my responses:**

1. **Text features not utilized** → AGREED, but approach must be research-driven, not generic TF-IDF
2. **Hyperparameter tuning premature** → AGREED, focus on features first
3. **Feature scaling ignored** → LightGBM handles this, low priority
4. **Interaction features missing** → AGREED, high priority alongside text features

**My synthesis:** The evaluator correctly identified the need for text features, but the solution isn't generic TF-IDF. We need to engineer features based on the Stanford research findings about what actually makes pizza requests successful.

## Data Understanding

**Reference notebooks:**
- `exploration/eda.ipynb` - Basic EDA and leakage analysis
- `exploration/evolver_loop1_analysis.ipynb` - Text analysis showing TF-IDF underperformance and length correlation

**Key patterns discovered:**
1. **Text length correlates with success** (r=0.121, p<0.001): Successful requests average 540 chars vs 442 for unsuccessful
2. **TF-IDF alone performs poorly** (0.5239 ROC-AUC) - bag-of-words doesn't capture social signals
3. **Stanford research reveals specific linguistic predictors**: gratitude, evidentiality, reciprocity, narrative structure

**Critical insight:** Success depends on HOW people ask (linguistic patterns), not just WHAT they say (word frequencies).

## Recommended Approaches (Priority Order)

### 1. Engineer Linguistic Features from Stanford Research (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
Based on the Stanford ICWSM 2014 paper analyzing this exact dataset:

**Implement these specific features:**
- **Gratitude indicators**: Count of "thank", "thanks", "grateful", "appreciate"
- **Evidentiality markers**: Count of URLs, numbers, specific details, evidence words ("proof", "photo", "link")
- **Reciprocity language**: Count of "pay it forward", "return the favor", "help others", "give back"
- **Narrative indicators**: 
  - Request length (title + text length)
  - First-person pronoun count (I, me, my, we, our)
  - Sentence count (periods, exclamation marks)
  - Paragraph breaks count
- **Politeness markers**: Count of "please", polite phrasing
- **Narrative category**: Classify into known successful types (family, job, money, student, desire)

**Why this works:** These features directly capture the social signals that Stanford found predictive, unlike generic TF-IDF.

### 2. Engineer Interaction Features (HIGH PRIORITY)
Create ratios and interactions from meta features:
- `comments_per_day` = comments / account_age_days
- `posts_per_day` = posts / account_age_days  
- `comment_to_post_ratio` = comments / (posts + 1)
- `activity_score` = weighted combination of comments, posts, upvotes
- `subreddit_diversity` = number_of_subreddits / (comments + posts)
- `raop_experience` = days_since_first_raop_post / account_age_days

**Why this works:** Raw counts don't capture engagement patterns. Ratios reveal behavior patterns (e.g., frequent commenter vs. lurker).

### 3. Enhanced Temporal Features (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
Improve upon basic hour/dayofweek:
- **Time of day categories**: Morning (6-12), Afternoon (12-18), Evening (18-24), Night (0-6)
- **Weekend vs weekday**: Binary indicator
- **Rush hour indicator**: Peak hours (12-14, 18-20) when competition is high
- **Month/season**: Capture any seasonal effects
- **Account age bins**: Categorical bins (new: <30d, active: 30-180d, established: >180d)

**Why this works:** Temporal patterns may be non-linear. Categorical encoding may capture patterns better than raw numbers.

### 4. Advanced Text Representations (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
If linguistic features don't provide enough signal:

**Option A - Sentiment Analysis:**
- Use VADER sentiment analyzer (optimized for social media)
- Extract: compound score, positive/negative/neutral percentages
- Count of positive/negative words

**Option B - LIWC-style Categories:**
- Psychological word categories (positive emotion, negative emotion, social, cognitive)
- Function word categories (pronouns, articles, prepositions)

**Option C - Pre-trained Embeddings (if time permits):**
- Use Sentence-BERT to get embeddings (768 dims)
- Reduce dimensionality with PCA/UMAP to 10-20 components
- Use as additional features

**Why this works:** These capture semantic meaning and psychological signals beyond simple word counts.

### 5. Model Architecture Variations (LOWER PRIORITY)
After feature engineering, try:
- **CatBoost**: Handles categorical features better than LightGBM (for subreddit encoding)
- **XGBoost**: Different regularization may work better with many text features
- **Neural Network**: If we have many engineered features, a simple MLP might capture interactions
- **Stacking Ensemble**: Combine predictions from different model types

**Why this works:** Different algorithms have different strengths. Stacking can capture complementary signals.

### 6. Hyperparameter Tuning (LOWEST PRIORITY - DO LAST)
Only after confirming features work:
- Learning rate: 0.01, 0.05, 0.1
- Num leaves: 31, 63, 127
- Min child samples: 20, 50, 100
- Feature fraction: 0.8, 0.9, 1.0

**Why last:** With proper features, default hyperparameters often work well. Tuning provides diminishing returns.

## What NOT to Try

1. **Generic TF-IDF with thousands of features** - Already tested, performs worse than meta alone
2. **Deep learning on raw text** - Too slow, likely overkill for this dataset size
3. **User flair features** - Confirmed leakage, not in test set
4. **At_retrieval features** - Confirmed leakage, not in test set
5. **Complex stacking without base model improvements** - Need better base models first
6. **Extensive hyperparameter tuning before feature engineering** - Wasted effort if features are suboptimal

## Validation Notes

**CV Scheme:** Continue with 5-fold stratified CV (proven stable in baseline)

**Expected improvements:**
- Linguistic features: +0.05 to +0.10 AUC
- Interaction features: +0.02 to +0.05 AUC  
- Enhanced temporal: +0.01 to +0.03 AUC
- Combined: Target 0.75-0.80 AUC (still below gold, but building foundation)

**Confidence in CV:** High - baseline showed reasonable variance (±0.018), indicating stable validation

**Next checkpoint:** After implementing linguistic and interaction features, expect CV ~0.75. If below 0.72, reconsider approach.
