I am a 22yo veteran of the Army Reserve who is currently being medically discharged for Bipolar Affective Disorder type 2(severe depression, dysphoric hypomania). I have tried to work but I have chest pains and anxiety attacks from ptsd. I try my hardest to hold out but i cant work if Im curled up in the bathroom praying for death. Im just trying to explain why Im so broke. I cant get any VA benefits until my claim is processed(months from now) so I have to pay for my meds out of pocket. I make 20$ a week taking an experimental sleep medication in a clinical trial but most of that goes to bus fare, meds(Ive got a few rx's), and stretching out food. I applied for food stamps but my card was delayed(stolen out of mailbox) and now I wont see it until a couple weeks. Im living with my roommate who has been kind enough to only ask me for 50 a month in rent, but that leaves little room for pizza! I honestly havent had a pizza this year. Its one of the few things that makes me feel better, like theres something to live for and look forward to again. maybe Im not the most deserving, but it would really help me out. Thanks for reading this.",

Thank you so much! http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/1g3me0/thanks_iamseth_your_generosity_fills_our_hearts/\n\nIt's been a difficult couple months for my boyfriend (22M) and I (23F).  He is currently unemployed and looking for a job, and I am self employed, but all my income has been needed to cover our bills while my boyfriend has been out of work, so there is absolutely nothing left.  I spent the whole afternoon trying to get local assistance to put some money on our M-Power card (a pay-as-you-go program for electricity here in Phoenix Arizona) to NO AVAIL : ( all our local agencies are either full for appointments or not assisting those without children in the home.  So we are keeping our apartment dark and very warm (it's currently 108 degrees outside!) having to be extremely cautious with any ac use as our electric is about to run out.  My boyfriend ran around today using the very last of our gas going to job interviews and the required drug testing.  We could really just use a filling dinner so we can collect our thoughts and regroup since we need all the energy we can get to figure out a way to cover our very basic needs until we get more income.  There are no groceries here, I actually used the last of what we had here (some vegetables, rice, and tuna) to feed our two dogs.  Of course we would be incredibly grateful with any form of help from anybody.  A Pizza Hut gift card would be amazing, and any other help as well.  I do understand there are other subreddits for assistance also and I will look into those guidelines to see if it is appropriate for me to post there too.  \n\nIn exchange for any help someone can give I would like to make you a small beaded item.  I could do a brooch or a pendant with seed beads, crystal, felt, some semi precious gem beads I have here.  You could tell me what colors you like and I could make something for you or a loved one.  I am open to suggestions.  Included are examples of what I can do.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/4rTLqft.jpg\nhttp://i.imgur.com/HVsPqO6.jpg\nhttp://i.imgur.com/ycN1RI2.jpg\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this.",

We've got some leftovers in the freezer and a bunch of odds and ends in the cupboards and even a bunch of friends who'd take us out to dinner or have us over if we asked (but we'd feel bad asking because we're old enough to be meant to be beyond this!). So, absolutely no worries if no-one can give. \n\nI'm asking because a bunch of unexpected grown up expenses just ambushed us. My boyfriend's grandfather died unexpectedly and we wanted to go to the funeral - but it was 5 hours away and we didn't have a car. So we bought a cheap car and made it to the funeral, but it turns out that car ownership is super expensive. Rego is nearly $1000! Add insurance, NRMA membership (needed cos we weren't sure whether our little bomb of a car would make the drive and we didnt want to be stranded in the australian outback forever), random fees for vehicle inspections and more random fees just for existing add up to be the value of the car again! What. The. Hell. (yes, I *have* lived a sheltered life, thank you for asking.)\n\nAdd that to the billion and one other things we're saving up for/need to pay (rent, bills, house deposit, wedding, honeymoon maybe, helping our families) and it's come as a bit of a shock to our financial system :P\nWe literally have $0.67 in the bank and a bit of change in cash until pay day. This is an odd and disconcerting feeling. \n\nWhat would pizza mean to us? Laughter and joy. The pleasure of knowing that there are good people who care about strangers. A memory to carry with us both when things are hard and when things are good and we can give again. A small easing of financial stress for the next few days. \n\nI might also pull the request later because like I said - it's most definitely not a do or die type situation. And anyway, my credit card's taken such a pounding this week, what harm is pizza going to do? :P\n\nBut thanks for reading anyway, RAoP!\n\nAlso, please and thank you ;)",

His brother lives with us because his mom is a dangerous person and has nowhere else to go. He got laid off five months ago, when our baby was born, and because his employer didn't do paperwork, we were only eligable for one month of food stamps. \n\nHe went back to work not too long ago, and when our lease was up, we could barely afford a new apartment. I was also just diagnosed with depression, and my medicine is another thing we have to worry about. Our situation is very overwhelming to me, and I don't know how we're going to get through this. \n\nI wouldn't do this if I knew we would be okay, we have doctors appointments that are coming up, medicine to buy, food, rent, bills, tons of other things that are stressing us out, and when I found this, I could breathe a sigh of relief. Please help us have a night where we don't have to worry so much, and I can repay you in cute baby pictures. :)",

He was in a coma for the first couple of days, then he came out but the doctors had to put him back into one (Self induced coma) in order to maintain his levels of stability for surgery. He is still in critical condition and I am hosting a benefit concert with my band for his family. They lost their mother when they were young (Elementary school) and Ethan (The boy who was hurt) has a twin brother. I've known them almost all of my life and am putting this concert together almost single handedly. \n\nI'm hoping to give pizza to the folks that are working at the concert and the bands playing.\nIf I get enough, I'll even sell it for just $1 a slice at the concert for extra benefit money for his family! \n\nHere is the link to the concert information for those of you wanting to just send your support.- https://www.facebook.com/events/164208037116711/?ref_newsfeed_story_type=regular\n\nThe pizza place (Shaker's) does not deliver so I will have to pick it up. You can order it for September the 28th from 1pm-6pm. You can possibly even preorder it! But if you do decide to order, order it under the name of \"Steeple\". That's how I'll pick it up. Thank you so much for those of you who send support and those who order! It means a lot. I've been so busy with this concert. \n\nThe pizza place's number is (731)-663-2700.\n\nEDIT: Also, please let me know if you order and for what time.\n",

My paycheck only clocked me for 8 hours where I deserved to be clocked 16, and the bank would absolutely not allow me to deposit or cash my check. So that leaves me without GTA V(which I had planned to buy yesterday), as well as without money in general. I had planned to buy a large pizza to share with my friends while we played GTA V but now none of that is possible. My friend brought his hard copy over to my house, and so now I request a random act of pizza be given to us. Note: This isn't a sob story, this is just a request so please don't feel guilty if you don't want to give us pizza. I have cereal. \n\nTL;DR Wasn't able to get GTA V or pizza, so I'm asking for a random act of pizza. Much appreciated.",

To top it off, today I was moved to a 8-5 shift and couldn't make it in time to donate due to traffic.\n\nI won't get paid until next Friday, which will be kind of a stretch. Not looking for anything major, just hoping for a nice random act to keep me full until tomorrow afternoon.\n\nAnd I guess to guilt you guys a bit, my new job is providing network support to literally EVERY Army hospital in the world and keeping their gears turning.

Anyway, I had enough left over to buy a few packs of ramen which is ran out pretty fast. I went to my local food bank after work (not above getting help there), however they closed at 3 today (normally they close at 5). I'm going tomorrow after work but am very hungry. Sorry for the long post but if anyone is willing to give I'd be grateful. I'd be willing to provide any proof I can give. Cheers",

A pizza would easily last me a few nights worth of dinner and certainly beat the rice krispies and peanut butter sandwiches I've had for every meal the last week.\n\nOnce that loan comes through I'll be sure to pizza it forward if someone comes through for me :)\n\nI'm located in Oakville, Ontario",

I will receive *some* unemployment, but it will not come in for another two weeks, provided my last employer doesn't somehow convince the state to also screw me over.

Have you ever gone to someone's house and thought \"Wow, why did they pick this stupid color?\" I am regretting my decision of selecting this color. Just placing one finger on the wall and that one spot is now 10x darker than the rest of the wall. Maybe I just have dirty fingers? :D\n\nI hope I can satisfy someones curiosity or desire in just wanting to have some control or a say over someone else's living space. I'm not a good designer by any means. I still think a milk crate and a towel make a perfect chair. No wonder I'm single. \n\nAnyway, I want to thank you for reading my very long post. I hope you enjoy your Saturday and won't spend the day watching paint dry. Please pick a good color. Any color other than white/egg shell. Please and thank you :)\n\n[Pics of my room](http://imgur.com/a/qRQa7).\n\n*",

Alas I don't even have money for that.  Due to my hours at work getting cut (I make minimum wage at a bowling alley) and just having paid rent I'm looking at 2 weeks with no food or Ramen if I'm luckily enough to find some change in the parking lot at work.  \n\nHow did I get into this position one might ask, well here is a brief backstory.  I moved out here to Arizona from Ohio to try and get clean from a 7 year hardcore heroin addiction that cost me my own business (I used to own a pizza shop ironically) my girlfriend her life (She overdosed and died in bed next to me last year) and of course I couldn't pay for school while still on drugs and found myself on the streets.  I've worked so hard to finally get a job, albeit its meager and they are doing everything in their power to keep payroll costs as low as possible, and stay clean.  Due to the state being broke I don't qualify for food stamps since I can afford my rent ( although BARELY) that seems to be the biggest deciding factor on whether or not I can get assistance.  I don't have any family as both my father and mother have passed away and both were adopted and had no siblings.  I just don't know what to do and am beyond depressed and fed up with life.  I work so hard and I can't even afford to feed my dog, let alone myself.  I just can't take it anymore, so I finally decided to actually ask reddit for help.  I would give anything just to not be hungry for one night.  If anybody out there is feeling generous, I don't know what I can do in return other than thank you daily for the next few months straight.  \n\nAbout to give up on life,\n\nPublius0\n\n(Yes I could sell my computer, but its worth MAYBE $25-50 at a pawn shop if they would even take a 11 year old dell with a cracked screen, taped together powercord and missing keys :/)",

My town is at a low point for a while and even getting hired at McDonalds is a competition between young kids and elders. This, however, is beside the point.\n\nI want to surprise my dad with his favorite Large Cheese Pizza from Pizza Hut. I want to do this because he recently quit smoking. This is pretty big as my family as a huge history of addiction. He quit drinking 2 years ago after 3 years of nearly killing himself. He has liver cirrhosis and if he cannot get a transplant within 6 years, he is guaranteed to die. So, I want to reward him for cleaning himself up and being strong for the rest of our family. If someone can help, that would be great. I have seen some awesome things done here, and you are all fantastic.\n\nThank you",

My boyfriend and I decided to move into this awesome house because he's going back to school and it makes his commute significantly shorter.  Our new landlord is awesome and told us, since the house is already empty, we could start moving our stuff a couple weeks early so that it makes our move easier, awesome right? So, last Monday comes along and I decide to give her a call.  She doesn't answer so I leave a message, no answer.  Tuesday comes and still no call back.  I have to go to Portland that weekend for a baby shower and my Aunt's birthday party, come back Sunday and still no call back.  She calls me this Monday and tells me cheerfully they've been at the beach all week. I pick up the keys later that day and I've been moving car loads of stuff between work.  We planned on moving today since the beginning of the month, so I scheduled this particular carpet cleaner that our current landlord says we have to use for Thursday (he's very popular in town so there's no way to reschedule). So then, last night as I'm cleaning our place and getting ready for the move, our current landlord rings our doorbell.  She tells me that they are \"resealing\" our road tomorrow and that the road will be completely closed to our driveway from 6AM-6PM.  I start to panic so she gives me the phone number of the guy who is in charge of this project.  I give him a call and he is a TOTAL jerk about it.  At first I was trying to be polite to him in an effort to have him help me out, but I soon realized he wasn't going to help me out (or even apologize for that matter).  Now we can't even start moving until 6PM tonight, which is sort of a nightmare because my brother and his wife are helping us move and I feel pretty guilty about making them move that late.  I've spent a lot of my time (and not to mention expenses) on this move and I am pretty stressed and frustrated.  If someone would send a pizza to our new place it would make me (and I'm sure my brother...he loves pizza) the happiest mover that has ever walked the planet!",

I have already been surviving off ramen and toast for the last 3 days.\nPlease help me out. I promise to pay it forward as soon as I am able. I can try and draw you something but my art skills are pretty lacking. I cant think of anything else to barter with if you think of something let me know.

We have been living off ramen and sandwiches for a couple weeks now we all need some sort of break. Since I live somewhat far away from other Redditors so any type of egift card would be great. For some reason just about all of our utilities are cut off except for power and internet/phone. I'm sure that any type of help would be greatly appreciated.

That's just magical.  The other side of that is while I'm not glad to know there are others going through what I'm going through, I am glad to know that I'm not alone.  I think that's probably the hardest part sometimes.  You look around and you see everyone else, and no one lets on that anything is wrong.  Some people make life look so easy.  I haven't know easy in a long time.  There's a Sheryl Crow song that goes, \"No one said it would be easy, but no one said it'd be this hard.\"  I hear that in my head a lot.  I'm not looking for easy, I just wish every minute wasn't such a struggle.  \n\nI will say this though.  Today has been an amazing day.  I came on here looking for help, and have found myself being able to help others.  I can't tell you how great that has made me feel today.  This is a feeling that everyone should know.  \n\nMy husband died a little over a year ago.  I have been working three jobs to try and support our two kids who are 3 and 4.  In January I went back to school to pursue a degree in nursing so that I could have a steady future.  I can not tell you how intimidating it is being back in school all these years later and being a mom on top of that.  It's going well though, and I'm excited for the future.  \n\nWe are barely making it each month, but we find a way.  My daughter is going to turn 4 in two weeks, and I'm having a small party for her at our home.  It has a modest budget, and I've been coming up with what will hopefully be fun cheap activities for the party.  What I'm hoping is to make it a pizza party.  It's just something that the way the bills fall and the money comes in that I'm not in a position to really splurge on.  \nI'm praying for some help and appreciate anyone who stopped to even read this.\n\nThank you.\n",

Normally, I'd get a lunch break, but as I'm the only one here (no supervisor, or anything), and I don't have a key, I can't leave the office.\n\nDelivery is fine, but I'm running low on cash until payday. A tight spot to be in this week, but I'm usually OK. When I get off, there will be campus food I can get, so it's really a matter of making it til 10pm.\n\n---\n\nAnything else you'd like to know, please let me know.

I'll be able to donate $10 to someone on the 18th, i realize it's not much, but I've seen others like myself on here seeking help so i'm going to try my best to do help them out whether someone helps me or not.

Please excuse the new account, I saw this on the news, what an amazing idea!\n\nI am currently living with a roommate who has just moved out of her mother's house, she has no job and her mother sends her utility and rent money. Her only responsibility is to send her mom the rent bill, and she sends half of that or pays half to the company. The problem is that this girl is SO lazy, can't be bothered to send the bills, can't be bothered to call her mom for rent and I'm under the impression she told her mom she already had a job (her mom has been chiding her for not having a job), so her mother does not feel obligated to pay this girl's bills. I have been carrying the weight of the major bills, such as electricity and rent (2x), and my paycheck is being stretched thin. To top it off, it's obvious to see where she gets her flaky attitude from...her mother REFUSES to answer my phone calls or emails. So here I am reddit, living with a girl who labels her food in the fridge so I don't touch it, and for the sake of keeping the peace...I am down to begging for a pizza X(.  I would prefer giftcards, because I would rather give out my email address than my physical address, but I will understand those who dont want to in case they believe I am a scammer.\n\n\nMy email address is: Jen.Beam.1984@gmail.com",

My wife was killed in a car accident a year ago last week. She was an amazing mother and wife. Readjusting has been really hard, but our kids are tough and are working through it. I have an amazing support system, but sometimes things just don't add up. My parents and her dad are incredible and do so much for us, but I hate asking them for help. They already do so much and it's really embarrassing not being able to give my kids something as small as pizza. Normally we do a \"pizza\" night once a month, but with school just starting, I'm coming up short. I hate asking for help, but it seems like a really open and friendly environment, so I'd like to try. I can't wait to pay it back next month. I'm thinking the kids can pick a contest and the winner. Thanking you from the bottom of my heart. Jim",

I know I wont do anything, but it's still an awful way to start my day.

        "request_text_edit_aware": "New to Reddit, guys on 4Chan sent me this way so hopefully I strike a cord with someone. To sum it all up, here's the general overview of my life since April of this year.\n\n I used to work for a major cell phone carrier answering calls from the general public. I liked my 9 dollars an hour, then they fired me, for taking 3 days off in a row because I couldn't get to work (I couldn't miracle up a car to drive while mine was getting fixed). Seems unlikely right? Well this is Sprint we're talking about, the same people who offer to take $25 off your bill when you call to complain about their wonderful service. They don't bother to tell you it extends your contract by a year and removes your upgrade eligibility, and if you ask odds are they'll lie about it. Speaking from experience, 90% of my coworkers in my department didn't know that. So as you can tell nothings beneath them. If you have any questions about Sprint I'll happily clear them up, there's a way around almost anything lol.\n\nI've tried my best to be self supportive up until now. I cut a few yards every month, sold all my worldly possessions, I even defaulted on my car payments with just 4 to go. You know, the usual stuff. I also tried the unusual, for a week I was selling male enhancement pills from home in my spare time. Then the company went under lol. Just as well, they were nothing but banana peel powder and saccharin anyway. Oh and crab shells or some crap like that, I dunno, I didn't keep the bottle they gave me.\n\nMy family's been real supportive through all this, my uncle even changed his phone number without telling me. Ironically I hadn't even asked for anything from them, they saw my post on twitter and deserted me on the spot. I'm the only one in the family who owns his own home, and the only one who hasn't begged the grandparents for anything. After all, I've always managed on my own, so my uncle probably figures I can do it again. Of coarse when his mule faced wife wanted a tummy tuck and a boob job done last year, they asked me to keep her in my prayers. Fair weather family is like that, thank goodness I'm the youngest. I take solace in that I'll be alive and dragging my butt on their graves long after they're dead. Might even take a wizz, gotta water the grass ya know?\n\nSince I got fired I don't get unemployment, and I'm a natural born tax paying citizen living near a major metropolitan city, so there isn't any government programs I qualify for either. Work prospects are bleak at best, especially since now I'm without wheels. I tried doing the day labor gigs they have down at the local employment office, line was already a hundred people long when I got their, 3 hours early x.x Tried finding religion to see if the divine spirit would help with any of my problems, then I found out God gives you hardships to make you stronger. Sure enough my gas stove died later that week, so as these and countless other things continue to stack up I find myself getting stronger and stronger. You can't tell because of this fat exterior but man, underneath all that I'm built like a brick house.\n\nSo that's some of it, if I got into all of it we'd be here all day. I just want a couple bucks worth of pizza or maybe a couple of those sandwiches Dominos makes, that'd greatly improve my mood here in the short term. Tomorrow and Thursday I'll be glued to the phone hoping that for the first time since April I'll get offered a job. If nothing else wish me luck on that. Also if anyone's interested in buying whatever curse I've been afflicted with I'm selling it on the cheap =)",

I wanna repay a favor to a friend I've known for a very short time, but he's done a lot for me in that time.\n\nI lost my job a while back and started posting up my stuff for sale online. He's been a godsend to me, he's bought stuff from me on multiple occasions and helped me eat when I wouldn't have been able to otherwise. He lives an hour away and he travels down here to buy from me and even takes me to the grocery store so I don't have to waste money on a cab! I've known the guy less than 2 months and he's already been more awesome than anyone else has been to me in probably my whole life.\n\nHe's been sweating some bills due this week, but even though he was strapped he helped me out big time earlier this week. I had to notarize my I-9 for my new job and get my driver's license renewed. He spent 5 hours on Tuesday not only taking me to the DMV and the notary, but he did it with money out of his own pocket. I tried to pay him back yesterday but he wouldn't let me, he said he did it out of friendship. The mans struggling to pay his bills this week and he helped make sure I could get back on my feet at long last, now that's a friend.\n\nHe's got 2 kids under the age of 7 he's in his late fifties no less, so the man is definitely a warrior in my mind. I won't start getting paid for a few more weeks, but he's had it rough the past few days and still put me before himself. I wanna thank him but I had to buy three weeks worth of food yesterday in one sitting, plus pay for the cab ride, so I'm  fresh out of dough. It never even crossed my mind to send him a pizza until I wandered on here. He can't very well turn down dinner when it arrives at his door free of charge, so that's what I wanna do.\n\nAnyone think they can spot me a gift card so I can send him some dinner tonight or tomorrow? He's been awesome to me these past few months, he even overpaid me for some of the things he bought because he knew I needed the money. This would be a small drop in the bucket but I wanna pay him back for some of his kindness at least. I don't mind coming back in three weeks and returning the favor, I'm gonna be set making 14 an hour at this job, but he could use this right now, I know he could. So pretty please, will someone help me make this man's day?\n\nI don't have many friends, and finding a best friend at such a low point really saved my life. I can't ever repay him for all of it, just some of it, and this is how I wanna start.",

We were doing ok until my boyfriend lost his job this past March. Which is fabulous since around the same time we found out we were pregnant with our third child. So he has been pounding the pavement trying to find a new job, and in the meantime my salary gets stretched pretty thin. We use to have pizza night on Friday with the kids. We'd get a movie from the Redbox, enjoy a pizza pie and have a fun family night. Its amazing how you miss simple things like that. I hope we are soon in a position again where we can give more, and need for less. Heck, I hope we all are. Times are just hard, jobs are scarce and I just hope things get better for everyone. But if you are in the position to provide pizza night for a grateful family, it would mean a lot. Maybe show the kids that yes, money is tight...but not everything is changing. Things are going to be okay. And I will surely pay it forward. Thanks for reading :)",

I am very sorry for the pity parade, honestly, however my embarrassment is over weighed by my concerned for my friend and her family. If you have any advice that I can forward to her please private message me. Thank you.**\n\nSo here is the situation:\nI am requesting pizzafication on behalf of a friend of mine who does not Reddit. She is a young mother, married, and with two children (3 and 1). She recently moved to Glendale, AZ from Florida. She was supposed to be able to stay with an In-Law. That plan fell through due to circumstances outside of her control and she has to vacate her current residence this Friday. She has one other family member in the city that she will be moving in with. She has a job lined up with a call center but doesn't start for 2 months (she has to wait for the next training classes to start). \n\n**So yes, long term, she will be OK.**\n\nThe problem, is that DES hasn't approved her application yet (she has not been in the state long) and she and her husband are skipping eating meals days at a time. Thankfully she is still managing for her children, at the expense of her and her husband eating. I am just looking for a meal to help her get to next week, where I am pretty sure she will be OK (and I will be able to lend further aid at that point if she isn't). ",

I spend my days looking for work, following up on applications that I've submitted, and just trying to figure out how I'll get my bills paid. It has been mentally and physically exhausting.\n\nMy bills are paid but I am down to a few cans of peas and ramen. I won't be able to buy any food until next month. I would love a pizza and savor every single bite. You have no idea! Simple things like going to Mc Donalds or even just going out to eat at any restaurant..I haven't been able to afford to do this. \n\nBecause I'm a man with pride and work ethic, I would like to do some work for you. If you're near or in Reading, I am offering to clean your attic or do some yard work. If you're not near Reading, I will offer my computer skills to you. I can help you with anything Microsoft office related. \n\nI am not new to Reddit, despite what the bot may say. This is my first and only request.

First our fuel pump went out, we got that fixed now the battery went out (possibly the alternator which I hope not) . We just bought this car so it cut us short all around.. We don't have enough money to even get the /battery/ fixed until tomorrow as well. Anyways that's the reason why we are broke at the moment. We usually keep our refrigerator full but that didn't happen this week. \n\nAlso..some kind redditor helped us out awhile ago with pizza.

I would like to think I am an honest man so I shall tell you an honest tale. \n\nMy name is Dave and I currently am working at a Homeless shelter for homeless youth in Seattle called ROOTS. I love working at ROOTS, I can sleep easily in the mornings (since I work throughout the nights) knowing that I am helping keeping 30 homeless youth off the streets and away from SNOWzilla's wrath as he stomps through Seattle. \n\nSNOWzilla has ruined things here in Seattle. Because of the nature of the place I work at, someone MUST be on staff every night, and I have to work throughout the weekend and since the buses are closed? I must walk 5 miles in ice and snow to get to work. \n\nSadly though, I don't get paid very much. [(Bank Statement)](http://imgur.com/DvEeh) But that is the way of the world working for a homeless shelter. I haven't eaten in the last day and a half because of there being nothing in my kitchen [My fridge](http://imgur.com/05ffR) and stores being closed.\n\nSo I am asking you all, if you are willing, would be able to show a snowed-in man with no money some kindness? Even under these difficult times, and even if whether or not my ask for some kindness has no results, know that I have fun even when times are grim [I did it all for you, Reddit!](http://imgur.com/bhnxu)\n\nI hope you can all find it in your hearts to give some kindness my way. I hope you all have a SAFE time as snowzilla causes havoc in everyone's regions and I live you with one last picture.\n\n[Will you be my angel tonight??](http://imgur.com/vBBNm)",

I used the last of my money recently to sign onto a friends lease, so my bank accounts are currently zero-ed out, and I don't have a credit card.\n\n  I had gotten hired by a pyramid scheme place, and they didn't pay me, even though I met the criteria to get paid.  I just had orientation for a new job, but I won't start for another week, and won't get paid for another two.  I have almost no food in this house, except for some bread, and some crackers.  Is there any way someone could send me some pizza? It'd be greatly appreciated, and I would pay it forward once I have some cash. \n\nThanks for reading.",

I reside in Walnut, California. We have a local Pizza hut, and there's a Domino's and a Papa Johns just down the street from my place. I'll gladly accept absolutely anything, from anywhere. Even something as simple as plain cheese would be awesome. I'm a cheap date. \n\nThis is my first time posting here, so I'm not entirely sure how this works. I'll keep tabs on my post over the course of the next hour or two in the hope it's seen by anyone willing to help. In return I can either pay it forward when I can, or order a pizza for you down the road once I'm back on my feet. Thanks in advance  :)\n\n*Edit - I know, I know....my choices aren't exactly ideal, but alas those are the three closest options. I'm not exactly in a position to be picky, so even Domino's sounds great right now. But I don't have a preference between the three. Whatever is the cheapest still works for me. \n\n*Edit 2 - If you were planning on ordering a pie or two tonight and you're willing to share, I'd be happy to join you as long as it's a public setting. I'm still unsure how this all works....am I supposed to provide a phone number and an address to someone via PM? \n\n*Edit 3 - Well, this isn't getting any attention and my stomach is gurgling all the same, so I'm just going to scrounge for the evening. Short of a miracle in the job department I'm still going to be nearly broke tomorrow and a little while beyond, so if anyone would like to help me out another day, that would still be great. \n",

That's normally not a problem here in Germany, but to make a VERY long story short: The government agencies that are supposed to help you out in a case such as this didn't help me out. I haven't recieved any money in 3 months. So I have been living off of left-overs some friends bring by sometime. I'm a freelance voice-actor, but I haven't gotten any contracts lately, except for a bigger one 1 1/2 weeks ago.\n\nHowever, my 'boss' there hasn't paid me yet. I'm about to lose my apartment and I ran out of food.\n\nI'm not sitting idly by though - I've been sending out CVs like crazy and have gotten an interview for next week. We'll see how that goes.\n\nSo yeah, there's the short version of what happened. I don't really know what I'm supposed to write here, sorry. If you have any question, go ahead and ask.\n\nIf anyone is actually willing to send me pizza, then there could be a minor problem seeing as I live in Germany. But - if you have a credit card (mastercard/visa) we could use [lieferando](http://www.lieferando.de). I can guide you through the ordering process via Skype for example - or I'll write something up.\n\nIf you want me to do something for the Pizza: I could record something for you.\n\nThanks for reading, I guess?",

(Specifically The Soulard Area)\n\nSo here is my story, Hopefully it will warrant delicious pizza..\n\nFor the past 5 months i have been an addict in recovery.\nAt one point i realized i no longer wanted to keep living the way i was living.. Talked to my family and got help. I was addicted to Amphetamines and was starting to develop a bad heroin habit. I spend 42 days in rehab.. Came out with a new lease on life, and spent the next 3 - 4 months in a sober living facility. Just trying to remember how to live and enjoy life sober.. I got the best job i have ever had (Contracting for charter) and after a month i was promoted to be the south Saint Louis Market contractor. (Basically i managed all southern saint Louis contractors)\nThings were going great, With my new job i rented out a new apartment Set myself up a home office, and genuinely enjoyed day to day activities. Then one day, When i was heading back from a Narcotics Anonymous meeting, I got pulled over in Illinois (15 minutes from my apartment in Saint Louis) The Police Officer Informed me that i had an outstanding warrant in O-Fallon Missouri for Possession of a controlled substance. You see, I knew that this warrant was a possibility, But i had assumed they would let me know when they decided to issue the warrant! 6 months prior (Before Rehab) i had been arrested for Possesion and they had let me go, With no ticket, Not even a court date. Since that was my first serious charge ever i had assumed they would at least let me know if i had a warrant.\nWell. Long story short(er) I ended up spending 5 days in a holding cell in collinsville Illinois, 2 Days in Madison County, and 1 day in St Charles County. MY mother had got me a lawyer so that i could bond out (they didn't want to let me post 10% so without a lawyer my bond would have been 20,000) and ended up spending 5k just so i can hopefully keep my job.\n\nShe had hoped that by getting a lawyer and since this was my first offence, ever, We would be able to preserve my job. Well, No luck. I lost my job because of my 1 week absence and the fact that i had obtained a felony. Since i was a contractor i cannot collect unemployment.\n\nSo here i am. 1 month later. With barely Any food in my fridge, A carton of cigarettes, and an internet connection that will be shut off any day now. I have until the 30th of august before i get evicted, and am currently considering moving back into a half-way house.\nBUT i am STILL SOBER! Which i am proud of, Months ago i would have been wasted the second anything went wrong.\nSo i come to you, knights of pizza, humbly asking to Make my evening tonight. I would LOVE to eat something other than macaroni and cheese.\n\nI can prove any of it! i can provide pictures of: Graduation certificates, An empty fridge, a hungry dog, anything you can think of..\nThanks in advance.\n\nTLDR; Living Life Like a boss, then old warrant came up, Lost everything because of bad decisions in the past.. pizza will help morale.",

It amazes me to no end to see the kindness still left in some people, and pushes me forward to keep providing that same kindness to others whenever I am able. I'll follow up with some pictures of some pizza!\n\nHello fellow Redditors. I'm probably gonna rant and make a bigger deal of this than I should, and I'll try to keep it short and simple. But let me mention, I am NOT one to ask for assistance. But there comes times when we must swallow our pride.\n\nI have a small family of three, just my daughter, my wife, and myself. I'm a mechanic by trade, and make an acceptable amount of money...normally. The last month has been very rough, with work being slow and hours being cut. We are in an apartment that costs us $325/wk, and that is killing us. We've had to cut off both phones, and recently our car took a turn for the worst and left us without transportation.\n\nI've been able to keep food in the house, up until the last week or so. Mostly thanks to foodstamps, but those funds have run out. This last week I've had to pay back some small debts to my boss and father, and it's really hurt.\n\nAlso, our stove at this apartment doesn't work, so we've had to basically resort to microwave, cold prep foods, and a single burner hotplate. My cupboards and fridge are empty, short of some month old ice cream and leftovers that we've been too lazy to throw away. My family is hungry, but just for the day.\n\nSo here is my request, which I will counter with an offer. In exchange for a pizza, I will buy 2 other people in need a pizza in the near future. This is my way of setting aside the guilt of asking, and expanding the assistance of RAOP. I can provide any and all proof and verification needed. And whatever happens, I'd still like to thank RAOP for all their awesomeness.\n\nNOTE: Come Monday, I can get my paycheck advanced to me. Yesterday we just barely slid by, and all will be well from Moday on. I've got a second job that I start Tuesday at. It's just rather...depressing(maybe even desperate) feeling to be hungry, have an empty wallet, and feel like there is nothing I can do. Thanks again Reddit. :)\n\nEDIT: I'm so sorry, I completely forgot to put my location, and I kept saying it in my head. :P Anyways, I'm in South Florida, right by Ft. Lauderdale.\n\n",

Sometime on Sunday, my Xbox Live account was stolen, and almost $140 dollars worth of Xbox Live points were charged to my debit card. I called Xbox and got help getting a claim filed as soon as I realized. THEY said it would take 25 days, and I should contact my bank if I want a speedier return of my precious monies. They also said my Xbox live account would remain suspended until their investigation was complete.\n\nToday after work, I did so, getting another fraud case opened by my bank. The banker said, or so I thought, that my card would be closed **in** 5-7 days. Mission accomplished, I head to the grocery story to buy something for dinner.   \n\nI had my food items rounded up and checked out, when BAM! My card was declined. Okay... maybe they went ahead and turned it off for purchases. No worries, my bank is across the street, and while they may be closed, they have an ATM.  \n\nMaybe you see where this is going...  \n\nOM NOM NOM went the ATM, gobbling my debit card and spitting out a mere slip of paper in its stead- in essence it said \"this is **our** card now, criminal.\"  \n\nSo that's it. No entertainment (by way of online video games), no food (by way of the cancelled card), and not even a way to get money (by way of the gluttonous automatic teller machine) until sometime tomorrow when I can physically walk into my bank and withdraw the cash from their electronic grasp.

No matter how I dress up these minute noodles, the taste cannot compare to a delicious slice of pizza. I'm hoping some kind soul out there would be nice enough to treat me to some pizza please.

Sorry but I'm requesting incognito because I don't want anyone I know to find out about what's happening right now. There's a really messed up situation and I haven't even told my dad about this yet, so I don't want my friends or cousins finding out yet either because they can't keep their mouths shut.\n\nI got a surprise yesterday when a guy I've never even met greets me in the hallway of my apartment building and tells me he wants me to leave my girlfriend of 2 years. My girlfriend then confronts us both and gives me the shock of my life, she's been cheating on me with this guy, and she's pregnant, but she's 90% certain neither of us is the father! She was cheating on me with this guy, and cheating on him with someone else. I've never raised a hand to a girl and never will, I was raised better than that, but I've never been more tempted in my life to haul back and deck someone!\n\nAfter a two hour conversation with this dude I find out she hasn't been working for a whole year. He's been paying our electric and water since we moved into the apartment! She goes over to his house almost daily when she left me to head to work. Some days she leaves and neither of us could account for where she was. My girlfriend of 2 years is a lady of the night and has been milking 3 guys, me included and maybe more than just us, for everything we've got for years!\n\nI'm at my bros house and he's been very tolerant of all this, real step up kind of guy to take me in because I've been living with this tramp for over a year now, I got no place else to go right now. I need something to eat because neither of us has any money and he's living off noodles right now. I'll happily pay it forward on the 8th when I get paid. But for today, I need something better than noodles or black beans and rice, and I think he would appreciate it too.\n\nSorry again for being a bit deceptive with my post. If I wasn't starving I wouldn't be spreading it around for that matter either. If anyone can help you have my gratitude. \n\n8:30 AM. Taking a trip out and about, will be back in a few hours to check the thread.\n",

But I have been a lurker for quite a while and have even gotten my mum addicted to this site (and the aww sub).  \nRight now I have no gas, and that in itself is nothing new.  But I also have no food, or cash.  I'm not really a fan of spilling my life story.  I don't think it's fair to people, especially if they think I'm only after pity.  But I will explain some, at least that's connected to why I'm in this situation.  Otherwise, what's the point?  \nMy baby sister died when she was barely out of her teens.  I was still a teen myself at the time, and my mum took it very badly.  I ended up becoming her carer and after about five years of constantly hiding anything sharp or pill related and just generally taking care of her, I kind of snapped (or broke. However you want to put it).  It's now eleven years later and the depression pretty much controls my life.  \nI do get enough money to pay most of my bills.  Though gas and shopping are the lowest priorities.  I have gas/electric here, so thankfully the gas doesn't heat the water for the shower.  \nI'm not the type of person that can put off paying the bills in order to buy groceries.  Even though sometimes I really should.  That's just the way I was raised.  Sucky, yes, but at least I have the internet and tv to keep me from going insane.  \n\nI don't know what kind of proof you could ask for about me.  But please feel free to ask away and I will try my best to verify anything.  Unless you want a picture of me.  That's just wrong.  And evil.  And....wrong :)\n\nEdit: Forgot to include [request] doh",

We have a Pizza Butt local to here and that would be juuuust fine (and you can order online etc so that I never need to know your cc info, etc, so on, so forth). \n\nThanks for reading/thinking about it, and have a great New Year's Eve!",

Right now our house is going up for short sale, and we have to move out.  My parents couldn't afford the mortgage anymore, and Bank of America was completely unwilling to work with us in some kind of payment plan; so we're forced to sell and move.  If that wasn't bad enough, I just graduated college and can't get a job (been trying for months, every day; hours on end). \n\nMy step dad was in the hospital for a routine procedure and ended up contracting Sepsis.  So every six hours he has to attach an IV with ampicillin (some of the strongest anti-biotics you can take) so he's unable to work.  While he was in the hospital for almost three weeks, I was taking care of my siblings, making them dinner (which consists of 4-5 chicken nuggets every day..).\n\nThis is becoming quite long and I don't want to write a novel, but I'm really truly desperate right now for something to eat (besides nuggets).

I have found work recently, but do not start for another 3 weeks. We basically live off of what food will fit in a mini- fridge. With morale being low right now, I think a hot pizza would lift spirits. There is nothing more soothing then some hot comfort food! \nAnd in the next few weeks I plan to buy someone a pizza myself. ... Pay it forward they say!",

I am knee deep in debt from being screwed by my partner while trying to start a business.  My current job pays monthly and I am a few days out from being paid but due to some unforeseen vet bills this month, I have found myself without much money or food for the last 2 weeks.  \nTonight, I will be having another meal of rice and peas, which I have been surviving on since my cats incident (she is fine now, thankfully) and I am dieing for something nice for a Sunday night.  If there is a kind internet stranger out there who feels like helping someone who has been going through a rough time over the last few months, it would make my entire year!  When I get paid I'll be happy to come visit again to pass the karma on to someone else who needs it. \nI live in Australia, if that makes a difference.\n",

Also, my parents are not on any assistance which would be great for us but they are struggling financially.\nIf someone can help great, if not, thank you anyways. We do have junk food like peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and chocolate chip cookies but no PIZZA. Dominoes will work if anyone is interested in helping me surprise my family. Thanks",

Towed for all the money in my checking. Problem not found, magically starts running again.\n\n* Had to miss a week of work due to lack of transportation--less money, more problems\n\n* Discovery that I can't cook well, and I don't have the cash to spend to improve my cooking skills (read: buy a cookbook, or a good square pan, or microwavable dinners).\n\n* My other grandmother, the gentlest woman I will ever meet and the guiding role model in my life, passes away suddenly. \n\n* Car breaks down again. AGAIN. Fortunately, it magically restarts AGAIN, and I don't have to have it towed. But it's almost guaranteed now that whatever is going wrong is going to be expensive.\n\n* I get a sunburn from the funeral, and a mysterious rash from apparently holding a rabbit.\n\n* Grades come back. I am officially beneath the required GPA necessary to keep my scholarship. \n\nAside from the food courtesy of the funeral, I haven't had a decent meal in maybe a month due to stress, finals, and lack of cooking skills. I would like to have a few days where I don't worry about hunger. \n",

It's an amicable split, but that doesn't make it instantly easy, either.\n\nThat all being said, it's not only rough emotionally, but selling a house is rough (especially with the nature of the economy and us not being at a point where we were expecting to sell).\n\nI could probably spare the $10 for a small or medium pizza, but I'm *really* trying to save every penny to help with all the costs.  Plus, right now, a lot of things just feel like it sucks.  A little more right now since I'm in this house by myself.\n\nIf anyone thinks I'm a troll/scammer, I'd be happy to give you the name of my primary reddit name in private and verify through there and/or through the verification system.\n\nFYI, I'm in the U.S., if that matters to anyone.\n\nThanks, guys and gals.",

My dad called me this morning to tell me that my grandmother was rushed to the hospital last night and she has pancreatic cancer. There's nothing they can do. They can't operate. My dad is not doing well. I'm here in Vermont and my family is in Montreal. I'd like to go to Montreal tomorrow to see my grandmother and be with everyone during this time. \n\nMy fridge has hardly anything in it (I can show you this too!) and basically, a pizza would be a life saver tonight. It's been a rough Monday so far. A pizza would mean that I'd have a meal for dinner tonight, lunch tomorrow, and dinner on the way to Montreal tomorrow. I can also provide a verification code.

I just emptied the little money I had left in my bank account to register for classes at my local community college.  I never finished my degree and left and worked at a big company making good money for a while.  When that came to an end I moved and had no clue what to do.  I have been looking for work for over 2 years now.  I just recently had to move back home, and I am incredibly lucky to have a mother who would even allow such a thing.  She still has two pre-teen children at home, and works incredibly hard.  Hopefully I can be a positive influence to everyone now that I am living with my fam.  I know my little bro is going to love the three drumsets I brought home (he just started learning).  He seems genuinely interested in music, and I know that's one thing I can really help him with.  Even though I didn't work over the past few years, I have had some great experiences that really started to give me direction.  I am lucky enough to be able to live at home now, and go back to school.  My goal is to get back into a University in a years time, study in intnat'l business and economics and live in Europe for a while (I love to be the foreigner and there is so much to see!).  I kinda did everything backwards, but I am actually excited about working towards my goals.  I would love to celebrate this new beginning with some pizza, but the few bucks I have to spend for myself are going towards bills and I want to take my little bro to go see the Hobbit tomorrow when he gets off of school.  Like I said, I wouldn't go hungry, but pizza seems like a good way to celebrate the first step in changing my path.\n\nWe all must face the consequences of our actions, and I want my actions to finally start having beneficial consequences.  A part of me is scared that I will just fail the whole college thing again, but I know I more mature now, and can accomplish what I want out of life.  Fear is not an excuse to not try.  Thanks for reading!  I know my story isn't unique, but it is mine nonetheless.\n\nedit:  I guess it would be useful to know I live right near Google HQ in San Fran Bay Area.",

So I go on to the papa john's website to order my pizza to pick on the way to my friends house tonight but it tells me \"The promo code you entered has exceeded the maximum allowed usage\" but I haven't used it yet. I called customer service but I got a busy signal. After a few tries, I gave up. Because it's my cake day and I love the Oscars, I thought someone might have sympathy for me. \n\nBut, if someone thinks I can get this fixed once I get a hold of customer service, I'll keep trying but I don't know how to prove I didn't already use it. I mean, my order history will be blank bc I created the account to use the code but other than that, I don't know what to tell them. If I can get this fixed then I won't need/accept an offer from you guys. \n\nEDIT: Finally got through to customer service and we got it worked out. They gave me a new code. Thanks to anyone who considered helping me out. I'll try to pizza someone in the future when I have the means. ",

Well an employer from last fall is contesting the fact that they should have to contribute to my unemployment. I had the phone hearing, I know I am in the right, I got a w2 from them with taxes taken out. But until the final call is made, my unemployment checks are being withheld. It has been 2 weeks now, well 3 unemployment checks. I have been steadily looking for work. My phone got shut off the other day and I had to use $80 of my last $100 to pay it so I can receive phone interviews. \n\nI bought some ramen and have been eating it for most of my meals for the past week now, my Thanksgiving dinner looks like more of the same.  I would really like some protein, something tasty and feel full again after a meal.\n\nI live in Chicago, IL which has a million and a half great pizza joints but I am by no means picky, just hungry.

It had been getting worse over the course of last week. After the vet's initial examination, he thought it had something to do with Volks kidneys, so I left him with the vet overnight. I got a call this morning from the Vet's office, telling me that it was some congenital disease, that causes terminal kidney failure and that though I could probably keep him alive on dialysis for a while, it would be extremely expensive and he wouldn't be living a full, happy life. So, I went in this morning and said good-bye. \nAnyway, the total cost of the visit, tests, and euthanasia was close to $300, all of which I had to pay up front. That was supposed to be grocery money. I feel bad asking for help from people I don't even know, but all my roommates and friends went home for the summer, and I promise I'll pay it forward.\n\nI'm in Dallas.",

As I'm said, I'm new, and don't quite know how to verify this, but heck, I'll take some kind comments at the very least. Seems like a very loving subreddit, so I suppose I'm just looking for a support outlet somewhere.\n\nThanks, guys.\n\nEDIT: Orlando, Florida. Sorry, forgot to put that in the title.",

Because of the physical nature of my job I have been unable to work for the past three months although I have started back up this week past week so hooray for that. We do have insurance to pay much of the bills for which I am thankful, but the bills we have had to pay have wiped us out and put us in debt. No money in the bank account until Friday when my husband gets paid and in the meantime no food in the pantry but rice and beans which we've been eating every single night this week.\nI've never asked for assistance before and feel slightly unworthy when there are people with no food in their pantry out there. Still, if anyone can spare us a pizza tonight we'd be very grateful. We're vegetarians so please no meat. I will be happy to pay the pizza forward next month when I get my first paycheck.\nThank you.",

Every pay day she would disappear for weeks at a time. I would drive around until I either found her somewhere, or she would come home with no money and \"no clue\" as to what happened with her paycheck. Supporting a household on my own was not something I was prepared for. I try to juggle my bills so that the most important bills get paid. I offered the power company half, but they would not accept it. I had to make a choice between getting food and having my kids stay in a home without power. We are down to 3 cans of tuna.

There have been a lot of really frustrating and stressful developments over the past nine months leading to my parents moving into this new home. I've taken most of this week off of work to come and help with this transition.\n\nUnfortunately, after I arrived I learned that they have delayed the actual move-in days because the previous owner was a \"crazy cat lady\" and the house still reeks of urine. (There are visible signs of spraying in some of the rooms.)\n\nI have learned that over the weekend my mother spent most of her time shampooing, and re-shampooing all of the rooms. Today my father and I spent most of the day addressing  and then moving in the heavy furniture and furnishings. Hopefully if all went well with the previous cleanings, we'll be able to start moving the majority of items into the home. (Unless it is decided that the carpeting will need to be replaced first.)\n\nAnyway, long story short, it would be fantastic if we could have pizza for dinner tomorrow (Tuesday) night. I'm not financially able to supply any food while I'm staying here, and I was hoping that maybe someone would be willing to help us out.\n\nThanks!",

I am not starving to death, but I would like a warm pizza to fill our stomachs. Also, I lost my wallet with my cards and a bit of cash over a week ago, I am not a deadbeat, but just having a hardish time. Can a man get a pizza for my girlfriend and brother? (refereed to as friend earlier as we are not blood related or related by marriage) I live in California, in Los Angeles County.

I think it'd be a really nice surprise for him and he loves Reddit as much as I do, so it'd give him one heck of a smile. If you're interested, I want to provide some history so you know where I'm coming from and why I'd like to see that smile. I'll try to provide enough context without being too verbose :)\n\nAbout 3 years ago I lost my job in marketing. I was the breadwinner in the relationship and he worked for fun, really. I set out to find another job at the start of the recession and it didn't go so well.\n\nAfter about a year of being unemployed, living off savings and looking for another job that would pay enough for me to pay my bills (a big concern that stopped me from taking a lot of jobs due to pay requirements... we all have to service our debt obligations!)  I realized I hated what I was doing. I was 25 then... 2 years ago. \n\nIt's strange and hard to describe, I think, unless you've gone through something similar. I worked hard, ever since I was 13 and had a paper route that earned me a couple hundred a month. When I was 16 I got a job at Best Buy and that's when my 'career' in sales took off. I sold on the Best Buy floor for about a year, then went to CompUSA where I worked as a commissioned sales guy. My first commission job and I was only 17. I made really good money and continued to progress through retail and then into retail marketing. \n\nBy the time I was entering college I was making more than most people who had been out of college for years, and that number went up every year. That kind of money blinded me to the fact that I wasn't enjoying what I was doing... I was enjoying making and spending money. So much so that I burned through it faster than I made it. It was really the only thing I had fun doing, though. I dropped out of college (probably a good thing, since I was going for a degree I wouldn't want now).\n\nI met my partner through Myspace at about the time I had gotten my first management position and was traveling 90% of the time. The first couple years were great. I was gone so much it was like a long honeymoon. Sometimes he'd come with me; Vegas, NYC, Seattle... etc. \n\nFor his part he worked off and on. It was never a big deal... I made a lot more money than him. He'd always worked odd retail jobs, hourly stuff, customer service stuff. Never made over $10 an hour or held a job for more than half a year. I didn't care because I'd rather spend my time with him when I was home than have him working and making a couple extra bucks.\n\nSo, back to three years ago when I lost my job. After about a year of coming up dry, I fell into a pretty bad depression. I couldn't find work that would pay my bills, and realized that I didn't even like doing that work. It affected our relationship dramatically. I retreated into World of Warcraft and stopped talking to family. Eventually the money ran out and bills stopped getting paid. \n\nI hit bottom after a long, dark period... but thankfully for me bottom was a nice soft pillow of people that loved me. My parents stepped in to help get me through some tough financials and my partner stepped up to support me mentally and financially. \n\nFast forward to today. My partner is now happily employed (1 year anniversary this month) with a company that is providing him with a promising career opportunity that he loves doing. We've downsized our lives; no car, eating cheap, staying in, cooking and we've moved into a studio apartment. My partner is working we're saving so I can go to school and do something that I do love; be a vet. He even got me a chocolate Labrador puppy in February. We named him Fizban and he's a constant source of joy for me. The person I was 3 years ago would not recognize the person I am today.\n\nI try to do nice things for him whenever possible to lessen the stress of being the sole earner in the house. That's what this request is about. We're not starving, but we live tight. This would not only be a delicious treat for us, but once my partner found out that it came from a generous person on Reddit he will be amazed.\n\nOne day I promise to pay it forward. Here's a picture of my dog, Fizban and my partner:  http://imgur.com/SoygY",

But finding work is another story. \n\nI have 89 cents to my name until who-knows-when. Unfortunately where I live, there are no places that deliver. Since my car's broken, I'm not sure I could even do pizza. I was thinking, if I could find the cash, I would walk to the nearest gas station and stock up on pasta-type stuff. \n\nSo if anyone out there is willing to help, I would be so very much appreciative. If you have questions on anything, feel free to ask. I have verification as well. \n\nThank you everyone for your consideration.",

Nothing to lose by taking the time to fill out a simple message, but I admit I am new to this. I have been lurking now for a year and finally broke down and made an account for advice.\n\nSo I will just put it out there, I am in the foothills so it is a half hour to get pizza but I will gladly make the drive if someone would help with the pie. I will be getting some financial help from my folks hopefully in the next few weeks and will pay it forward as soon as I can. If anyone can help me we have Round Table and Domino's or Mountain Mikes. I am not choosy :)\nThank you for any help. I do have a verification code if that is helpful.\n",

I am 21, a recent college graduate, who managed to land a game programming job prior to graduating (and by luck my job actually pays well), however this month when trying to get ahead in tuition loan payments and spending a bit to try to get into basic electronics engineering as a hobby I managed to somehow end up in quite the situation. Due to a compounding of unexpected expenses, netflix pulling money out of the wrong (and empty) account, a rather large (at least for me) loan payment, and well simply an outright failure to budget this month... I managed to become absolutely broke aside from the bare minimum I need to get to work once this week (I work from home mostly as well). \n\nFor the past week I've been limited to the scarce quanitity of frozen meals that I bought about two weeks prior, however three weeks ago for what ever reason I acquired a large amount of soda. I ran out of food two days ago and my only intake since then has been soda. At first I was like, \"No big deal, I get paid in a few days\", but that has turned into \"MAYBE IF I USE THESE NAIL CLIPPERS I CAN CARVE A HOLE IN THIS 360 CONTROLLER TO LIVE IN THIS SODA CAN COLLECTION\" mental instability.\n\nLong story short, I have no karma, no food, but get paid in about 3-6 days (my job is slowly moving to direct deposit but hasn't set me up yet...) and I would really like a pizza. In exchange, I'd be more than willing to pay you back as soon as I get paid, or do some small task of some reasonable sort.\n\nI prefer Dominos, a medium pizza and a \"build your own breadbowl pasta\" (usually a coupon deal online) can last me almost two days, but really I'll take whatever I can get as I'm not exactly in a position to choose.\n\nHeres a link to my outdated blog for some loose type of verification? (I also have one of those verification system code things as well).\nhttp://www.forecourse.com\n\nAlso, what I've been 'eating' the last two-three days:\nhttp://a5.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/392812_1674416038329_1775307151_885951_630529237_n.jpg",

He has had several blood tests and labs done and we're hopefully getting the results back tomorrow. He has been tested from everything from food allergies and parasites to some pretty serious diseases. As of yesterday he has been feeling a bit better and is feeling up to eating something other than soup. I told him a while ago that once he was feeling better he could have whatever he wanted. Well, my little man has chosen pizza and unfortunately I just don't have the funds to do this right now. (only have a dollar and some change in the bank) So, I'm hoping someone can be my little boys pizza hero before he's not feeling up to eating.",

We are raising the 4 of them without any help (physical, mental or financial) from the other parents.  We have had to close down our Small Business this year due to the economy and for the first time have had to go on public assistance.  We are struggling to find gainful employment for my husband, but so far have had no luck.  I would be willing to go back to work immediately, however I will be having lung surgery in the near future to find out if I have cancer.  It seems like with the summer here we should be having some kind of fun with our kiddos, but we are not able to afford to take them anywhere so we have made \"movie\" night and \"game\" night at home......a pizza would make it a wonderful night....a much needed wonderful night.

[NaNoWriMo](http://www.nanowrimo.org/) 30 days of literary abandon!  I am currently attempting to log my sexual memoirs during this event as a writing experiment for myself.  I am home pounding away at the keys trying to catch up and reach my word count goals and recall details that have escaped me in moments of passion ; )\n\nI'm home with the SO and we are both very hungry and equally broke doing the starving artist/starving writer thing.  Anyone who can relate to this situation and is in a position to help us out with dinner would be our hero!!  I would love to share the fruits of my labor from this evenings writing with whoever helps me out.  If you are intrigued to read it, I will send you a private work in progress vignette from my pizza nourished efforts!\n\n",

I felt bad for him, and I stuck with him. Several years go by, and I'm still his only friend, so I convince him to come to my school, and meet my friends! So school starts, and he meets my friends, he doesn't really click with them, and decides to meet new people. A month go by, and he meets some really bad kids. Stupid kids no one else likes. Any way, I try and talk to him today, and he gives me a cold shoulder. \n\nWhen I tell him what he did wasn't cool (being an awkward homeschooler he doesn't know much about being with people), he apologizes. The bell rings, we go to class. After class him and his buddy come up to me, punch me, and run off. \n\nThis puts me in a bad mood. I storm home. He texts \"What's wrong?\" I tell him \"You, punching me.\" He then, goes on about how I'm over reacting, because I'm upset, he punched me, and I tell him to go away, not wanting to talk, and he just refuses to believe he did anything wrong.  He then argues, that \"I should just suck it up, it's your fault you're in pain, if you weren't so weak, it wouldn't have hurt!\"\n\nI then at that very moment, lose it, sh*t hits the fan. I tell him \"Screw off. We're not friends. I don't wanna be associated with a person who believe they're not ever at fault.\" I haven't talk to him since. This was a few hours ago. So I'm just lost. He's one of the few people I had left. \n\nI'd just like a Pizza to cheer me up. ",

Like I said, being sued for 50k, due to a bus accident I caused a year ago in which 14 people were injured (an honest mistake; it was raining, couldn't get out of the way in time, just spun in place). Insurance couldn't cover it all. Had to empty my bank account to pay for a lawyer, and on top of that I got laid off from my job a few months ago. Living with my parents again, and was almost able to move back out, until the accident. Back to square one.\n\nI've always had problems with anxiety and depression, and this is really making me crumble. Had to stop seeing my therapist due to losing my insurance through my job (called some sliding scale clinics but not taking new patients). It would just be nice to eat some comforting pizza. But I can't afford much. \n\nThanks for your consideration and for reading this. If you want proof of some kind I'll provide whatever you need; I know it sounds like kind of a fantastic run of bad luck.",

First chick to furnish both wins a date with me and a pillow covered in drool.\"\n\nA friend responded with this link.\nNothing special about my story, but here goes.\nA bit over a year ago, I bombed out of college. Hard. After that, I was unable to find a job, even in the pizza industry, where I have 3.5 years experience, 1.5 of those in management. Throughout the year I have been bouncing around between cities, going back to Eugene and Corvallis for a time, and eventually went to Texas because I wanted to meet a girl I'd been talking to online for a year and a half or so and was quite enamoured with. That journey was a complete disaster, and months after I wound up back in Portland, I still think about it everyday. I still can't find a job... I interviewed at Voodoo Donuts the day before yesterday, and by now I would have heard back if I'd gotten the job. I feel like I kicked ass at the interview, but most 'cool' jobs in Portland are always won by scrubby hipsters and overly-tatted indie/rocker chicks. I'm an electronic musician, an artist, and writer, and slowly over the last year I've been watching a lot of the stuff I use to do my work break or disappear. My speakers broke, so I can't properly make music, I ditched 80$ worth of art supplies while I was trying to hitchhike to Texas, as it was weighing me down. My laptop's hard drive fried out but I was lucky enough to trade a much smaller one for some computer repair work. I've been couch-surfing various places this whole time, right now I am staying at a nice rasta lady's house with her schizophrenic ex-boyfriend and his mother, who has alzheimers. I'm lucky in that I get to stay in a room that is half-filled with their storage stuff yet has a bed in it. But I can't remember the last time I had a good pizza. Nevertheless, there are certainly people worse off than myself and if I had stumbled upon this sub-reddit on my own, I would've though that it was awesome, but would likely not be requesting pizza on it. However, since it was suggested to me, I figure I might as well give it a go.\n\nWhat can I offer you? Well, I can send you a bunch of mp3s of my music, mail you some drawings, or perhaps help with some editing work if you have any writing you need someone to look over, whether for school or for personal writing. I live in the St. Johns neighbourhood of North Portland. Hope I got everything I need here, lemme know any questions or otherwise. Thanks reddit.",

I'm not looking for something extravagant, but I was hoping I'd be able to find a generous soul willing to help me surprise her.  She knows I can't afford anything, so I know she'll be surprised.  I even made this throwaway account just so she doesn't see a request if she happens to check my reddit activity.  \n\nWe're in Minneapolis.  It's a cold night out there and we could really use your help.  Please help me make this an anniversary to remember.

We were required to use our own vehicles because the company only had so many (that were breaking down anyway).  The transmission went in my husbands car and our boss told him that he refuses to pay for the gas to run the stuff in a van instead of his car that he can't afford to get fixed and fired him.  We were in a tight spot in the first place because we're constantly spending our money on fixing the cars (that we still owe $10k on) + necessities. We have an infant, 9yr old, 11yr old and a pet dog. Ever since he lost his job we've been eating nothing but cheap things (hamburger helper, ramen, hot dogs) for at least a month.  We were accepted for food stamps but with my income they only give us $150 per month which lasts us a week with the amount of food my boys consume. My husband has had interview after interview with no luck whatsoever. I think they'd be really happy to come home from the pool tonight and have a great feast of pizza. \n\nTldr; We're broke and sick of the same dinner table scenery and would really like a couple pizzas tonight.\n\nWe were taken care of!

But Paychecks are two weeks away, and will finally make life easy again! Two of us are finishing getting our degrees. \n\nIt's been a long day, and we Just managed to scrape rent together, but don't really have a great amount of food in the house (save some rice, eggs and oatmeal, that we need to save for the rest of the week and until our next paychecks) \n\nWe Just really want to enjoy a pizza together on a sunday night! \n\nThanks RAOP!",

I also have to work because i come from a fairly poor family and need to pay for an apartment close to campus (not to mention there's no room for me at any of my relative's houses). all my money goes to rent and other monthlys. i don't really have a supportive family, and the friends i thought i had in my city have left because \"i'm too much of a downer.\" really supportive of them huh? now i just have really superficial relationships with the ones that were closest to me and i hate it...yeah, making stupid jokes is fun, but real friends should be there for each other, through anything. \n\ntonight i'm studying for finals and i would really enjoy some decent food. i've never asked for anything like this but maybe the universe will smile upon me today? i promise to pay it forward, i know that energy flows in a circle. i am really grateful for everything i do have and i know that i'm a million times better off than 98% of the world...but still...suffering is relative to the individual, isn't it? if you can help i will be eternally grateful to you and will do anything i can for you or for another person later on.\n\nthanks for looking",

My bank account is in the negative, and nothing aside from some cheese slices and my mother's frozen TV dinners are in the refrigerator.\n\nI'd be more than willing to do some digital artwork with my tablet, or a physical and mail it/scan it in to you for basically anything.\n\nI attempted using the verification system in the sidebar, but I'm not sure if it worked.

I have $60 in Fandango cash that I basically have nothing to do with right now.  The kids and I have seen what we're going to see until the summer, and I figured maybe I could trade it for a gift card somewhere.  As I said, I've followed this site for a long time, but I've always been too proud to ask for help.  This way I figure I'm not taking a handout.  What I'm hoping is to get 2 $25 gift cards, and I would give $30 in movie cash for each one.  If you're not familiar with Fandango cash, you can use it at any theater that accepts fandango, and it never expires.  You can look on Fandango.com for more info.  \n\nI know there are a lot of great people on here, and I'm hoping some of them would enjoy going to the movies :)\n\nHave a great day!",

They are just really in the \"World against us\" point of view. They could really use some love from the world at large, and that is where I was hoping ROAP might come in.\n\nIf you guys could find a way to send them some saucy cheesy goodness that would be amazing, and come next friday (Payday) I will be passing it on.\n\nThanks guys!",

She arrived the next day and moved into the downstairs guest bedroom with her baby daughter. Four days later her 12 year old daughter moved in upstairs next to me. My dad never cooks and this is fine because I'll cook for myself and enjoy cooking. But I've noticed the food disappearing more and more, when I asked my father to go shopping he did about 2 weeks later and to my surprise 2 more people moved in. Friends of my dads from Tennessee. They were only here for a week but when they left there was no food again. When I asked my dad if I could go shopping with him he said he didn't have the money to feed all these people and asked the women with the 2 daughters to find a place. It feels like it's been forever and they are still here. There's almost nothing I can make to eat besides ramen and corn. The only thing she buys is junk food but not even anything you would want to eat as a snack. Ice creme, ice creme cake, microwave dinners which I can't eat because it's for her \"diet\", and baby food.\n\nWhat I've been doing is just going out and eating but I quit my last job and began to work with my father. It was hard work and good pay but we live in Florida and it's rain so much the past few days we haven't been able to work and he hasn't giving me a paycheck. Like I said there is corn, ramen, and ice creme I CAN eat. I really rather not but if you are generous enough to give someone a pizza, try and find someone in more need than I am. If you can't and decide to help me out I will LOVE YOU!\n\nThanks for reading and I'll answer any questions.\n\nTL;DR: Guest who've been staying at my house eat everything and leave me nothing. Haven't left after being asked to. I'm terrible at writing.\n\n:",

This all adds up to another 300+ dollars and I just had to pay rent which was another 450+ dollars. I have no food in my apartment except for 6 bags of popcorn and a gallon of water, and I have 20 dollars left in the banks. I don't have an official job but work in landscaping making money on the side whenever they have room for one more worker. My parents help but they can't help much and I don't want to worry them with this. A pizza would help me a lot, that would at least secure me for 3 more days just to keep the hunger away, especially during my finals week where concentration is a necessity. So please help, I have requested before when someone posts an offer but right now I am really really desperate so please help.\n\n\nI'm in California, specifically San Diego.",

I'm backed up on my finances because of kidney stones that were so painful that I couldn't work a full 40 for a few weeks.  My job has no benefits and I couldn't afford to go to the doctor, so I manned up and gritted my teeth through it without awesome drugs...  \n  \nNow my power, internet(which I'm downgrading soon) and TV service(i'm cutting the cord as soon as this stupid contract is gone), cell phone bills(on contract so nothing I can do here) are all late.  I've been late on my car payment twice in the past 5 months.  I can't afford to pay any of them right now because my rent is coming due, and if I don't pay that on time they charge a $50 late fee plus $10 for every additional day late.  I also need gas, and my car insurance is going to be due in full soon.  And I have a huge student loan in my mother's name with myself co-signed that I haven't been able to make the payment on for a few months... so I'm just hurting her.\n  \nI live alone and haven't really made many friends since I moved to this state.  I've been begging for part time jobs for over a year and no one is hiring me.  Now I'm close to being unemployed and my employer(staffing firm) hasn't found me a replacement yet.  \n  \nI'm subsisting on Ramen, buttered pasta, the cheapest hot dogs I can find, and any other sale items I can find for less than $1 per dinner, around .50-.75 for lunch, and I don't even eat breakfast.  \n  \nBefore the troubles started I loved that new Dominos pan pizza.  I'm a cynical, pissed off, \"hates everything\" manic depressive who doesn't like to smile.  But that stuff always puts a smile on my face.  \n  \n  \nI'm going to join this sub, and as soon as I can I will return the gesture if someone can help me feel good again for a little bit before I start looking for stuff in my apartment to sell to pay these stupid bills.  \n  \nIf you live in the area I would be happy to try to help you with any technology issues that you may be having in return.",

I just missed an IM from my little sister lamenting that another week is going by, and my family hasn't got the money for food right now. She was upset because their pets are hungry, and that all she'd had for lunch was a piece of bread. I feel awful about this, but I'm not really in a position to do anything about it myself. Making matters worse, I thoughtlessly made a comment on Facebook earlier today, complaining about all the leftovers in my fridge, and wishing that my sisters were around to help. How I must have made them feel upon reading that puts me near tears.\n\nTheir financial situation is complicated and I don't want to get into detail, because it's not my place to talk about their problems in a public forum. Suffice it to say, they're going through a rough patch, but if someone would be so kind as to provide them a hot meal, I hope that a random act of kindness would help them feel better about life in general. I've been where they are, and I know how low it makes a person feel not being able to afford food. \n\nHere's my favourite picture of me and my siblings and our dogs, taken about a decade ago:\nhttp://i.imgur.com/jDz5L.jpg\n\nThanks in advance to anyone who's taken the time to read this.",

I haven't seen him since the beginning of May so I'm pretty excited, but here's the situation.\n\nMy boyfriend doesn't have a job (I do, but I get paid by the month and my first paycheck isn't coming until June 30th).  The only reason he can visit me now is because his brother is taking summer classes so that's half of the traveling cost paid.  He also sprained his ankle on Saturday meaning he's still in crutches.  Lastly (and I realize this one's mostly my fault), my mother really wants us to go with her to Lake Erie for a day and a half.  \n\n[Following paragraph contains a lot of venting about crazy Polish mothers]\n\nNow you may be wondering \"What's wrong with the last part\" in which I will refer you to the crutches.  Yes, I've explained to her about the crutches, that he can't and shouldn't walk very much and that he is not going to be comfortable on this trip.  I've even suggested other alternatives, like going to a free movie in the park.  The thing is, my mother is crazy and you can't argue with crazy.  Also, I'm going to have to tell my BF that apparently, he has to go because if he doesn't, I'm going to be the one getting bitched at about how my boyfriend doesn't care about me and how he's lazy.  I know I should just shake it off and deal with it but honestly, I can't change my situation RIGHT NOW so I'd prefer dealing with this as painlessly as possible.  Of course, my boyfriend seemed pretty pissed about it when I told him my mom suggested this idea so, thanks mom, you're probably going to be the cause of our first fight.\n\nAnyway, it's gonna be a terrible few days for him and I'd like to make sure he has a tasty meal after a long trip and to say \"I'm sorry that my mom's crazy and I can't do anything about it.\"  His house is in Oakland so I'd suggest Sorento (4126219129 cheap and decent quality) or Antoons (4126875446 cheaper but more meh pizza) since they are local and cheap.\n\nAlso, since I'm getting my first paycheck in June 30th, I'll make sure to donate a pizza.  \n",

I'm a 24 year old college student from South-West Sydney, working a part-time warehouse job to help pay bills, and just moved into a shared accommodation. Things weren't always this difficult. I had a girlfriend live with me, so sharing bills and having food wasn't an issue.\n\nBut now that I've been single for a year, and trying to make my way through college, things have been rough. I have depleted any savings I once had, and my credit cards are shot. I still have at least another year in college, but seriously need to consider some kind of alternative to make my way through this.\n\nI rarely go out with friends because of my situation. I haven't had a beer in ages, and can't remember the last time I ate 3 square meals in a day. I might only have one meal a day, because I have to consciously ration the food and money I have. I even invested in hair-clippers recently, just so I can save money on haircuts. I have been living paycheck to paycheck for the past few months now, and putting food on my plate is simply getting more difficult.\n\nIt's kind of depressing actually. I never have thought surviving alone would be so hard.\n\nI must admit, I had a little too much pride to think about asking this pizza Reddit before, but long story short... I'm starving. I'm very embarrassed to ask anyone, as I don't want people to know how poor I am. However, if someone could help a brother out, I would forever be in-debt. Its not just about the pizza, its about helping someone in a time its needed most. I would most certainly love to be able to \"pay-it-back\" to others who need help, when I get back on my feet (if I find my feet at all).\n\n\n\n**UPDATE:**\n\n*",
