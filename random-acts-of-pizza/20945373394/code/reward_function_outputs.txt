  ],
  "overall_failure_reason": "There was notable jury disagreement: one juror (Claude Opus) argued the agent was pursuing the wrong paradigm (missing-word imputation with n-gram LMs), while the other two jurors (o3-mini-high and Gemini) found the agent correctly oriented toward a text+tabular Reddit-style binary classification problem and performing reasonable early-stage EDA/research. I resolve this by weighting the two consistent verdicts more heavily and treating the imputation critique as likely task-mismatch. Overall, the agent performed competent exploratory setup and strategy gathering but remains incomplete (limited depth and no demonstrated end-to-end modeling/validation), so RL is triggered to push toward implementation and higher-impact iterations."
