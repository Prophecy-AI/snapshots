Participants must create an algorithm capable of predicting which requests will garner a cheesy (but sincere!) act of kindness.\\n\\n\\\"I'll write a poem, sing a song, do a dance, play an instrument, whatever! I just want a pizza,\\\" says one hopeful poster. What about making an algorithm?\\n\\n![Pizzas](https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/competitions/kaggle/3949/media/pizzas.png)\\n\\nKaggle is hosting this competition for the machine learning community to use for fun and practice. This [data](http://cs.stanford.edu/~althoff/raop-dataset/) was collected and graciously shared by [Althoff](http://www.timalthoff.com/) et al. (Buy them a pizza -- data collection is a thankless and tedious job!) We encourage participants to explore their [accompanying paper](http://cs.stanford.edu/~althoff/raop-dataset/altruistic_requests_icwsm.pdf) and ask that you cite the following reference in any publications that result from your work:\\n\\nTim Althoff, Cristian Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil, Dan Jurafsky. *How to Ask for a Favor: A Case Study on the Success of Altruistic Requests*, Proceedings of ICWSM, 2014.\\n\\n~*Pizza icons designed by Matthew Dera from the [Noun Project](http://thenounproject.com/term/pizza/30194/)*~\\n\\n### Evaluation\\n\\nSubmissions are evaluated on [area under the ROC curve](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic) between the predicted probability that a request will get pizza and the observed outcomes.\\n\\n### Submission File\\n\\nFor each request in the test set, you should predict a real-valued probability that it resulted in a pizza. The file should contain a header and have the following format:\\n\\n```\\nrequest_id,requester_received_pizza\\nt3_i8iy4,0\\nt3_1mfqi0,0\\nt3_lclka,0\\n...\\n...\\n```\\n\\n### Citation\\n\\nWill Cukierski.

The outcome of each request -- whether its author received a pizza or not -- is known. Meta-data includes information such as: time of the request, activity of the requester, community-age of the requester, etc.\\n\\nEach JSON entry corresponds to one request (the first and only request by the requester on Random Acts of Pizza). We have removed fields from the test set which would not be available at the time of posting.\\n\\n## Data fields\\n\\n\\\"giver_username_if_known\\\": Reddit username of giver if known, i.e. the person satisfying the request (\\\"N/A\\\" otherwise).\\n\\n\\\"number_of_downvotes_of_request_at_retrieval\\\": Number of downvotes at the time the request was collected.\\n\\n\\\"number_of_upvotes_of_request_at_retrieval\\\": Number of upvotes at the time the request was collected.\\n\\n\\\"post_was_edited\\\": Boolean indicating whether this post was edited (from Reddit).\\n\\n\\\"request_id\\\": Identifier of the post on Reddit, e.g. \\\"t3_w5491\\\".\\n\\n\\\"request_number_of_comments_at_retrieval\\\": Number of comments for the request at time of retrieval.\\n\\n\\\"request_text\\\": Full text of the request.\\n\\n\\\"request_text_edit_aware\\\": Edit aware version of \\\"request_text\\\". We use a set of rules to strip edited comments indicating the success of the request such as \\\"EDIT: Thanks /u/foo, the pizza was delicous\\\".\\n\\n\\\"request_title\\\": Title of the request.\\n\\n\\\"requester_account_age_in_days_at_request\\\": Account age of requester in days at time of request.\\n\\n\\\"requester_account_age_in_days_at_retrieval\\\": Account age of requester in days at time of retrieval.\\n\\n\\\"requester_days_since_first_post_on_raop_at_request\\\": Number of days between requesters first post on RAOP and this request (zero if requester has never posted before on RAOP).\\n\\n\\\"requester_days_since_first_post_on_raop_at_retrieval\\\": Number of days between requesters first post on RAOP and time of retrieval.\\n\\n\\\"requester_number_of_comments_at_request\\\": Total number of comments on Reddit by requester at time of request.\\n\\n\\\"requester_number_of_comments_at_retrieval\\\": Total number of comments on Reddit by requester at time of retrieval.\\n\\n\\\"requester_number_of_comments_in_raop_at_request\\\": Total number of comments in RAOP by requester at time of request.\\n\\n\\\"requester_number_of_comments_in_raop_at_retrieval\\\": Total number of comments in RAOP by requester at time of retrieval.\\n\\n\\\"requester_number_of_posts_at_request\\\": Total number of posts on Reddit by requester at time of request.\\n\\n\\\"requester_number_of_posts_at_retrieval\\\": Total number of posts on Reddit by requester at time of retrieval.\\n\\n\\\"requester_number_of_posts_on_raop_at_request\\\": Total number of posts in RAOP by requester at time of request.\\n\\n\\\"requester_number_of_posts_on_raop_at_retrieval\\\": Total number of posts in RAOP by requester at time of retrieval.\\n\\n\\\"requester_number_of_subreddits_at_request\\\": The number of subreddits in which the author had already posted in at the time of request.\\n\\n\\\"requester_received_pizza\\\": Boolean indicating the success of the request, i.e., whether the requester received pizza.\\n\\n\\\"requester_subreddits_at_request\\\": The list of subreddits in which the author had already posted in at the time of request.\\n\\n\\\"requester_upvotes_minus_downvotes_at_request\\\": Difference of total upvotes and total downvotes of requester at time of request.\\n\\n\\\"requester_upvotes_minus_downvotes_at_retrieval\\\": Difference of total upvotes and total downvotes of requester at time of retrieval.\\n\\n\\\"requester_upvotes_plus_downvotes_at_request\\\": Sum of total upvotes and total downvotes of requester at time of request.\\n\\n\\\"requester_upvotes_plus_downvotes_at_retrieval\\\": Sum of total upvotes and total downvotes of requester at time of retrieval.\\n\\n\\\"requester_user_flair\\\": Users on RAOP receive badges (Reddit calls them flairs) which is a small picture next to their username.
