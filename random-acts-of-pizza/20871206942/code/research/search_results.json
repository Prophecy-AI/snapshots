      "title": "ANSWER",
      "text": "Winning Kaggle solutions for text classification that also exploit meta\u2011data (e.g., timestamps, author IDs, numeric or categorical side\u2011information) follow a few recurring patterns.  First, they treat the raw text with a strong pretrained language model (BERT, RoBERTa, DeBERTa, etc.) and then **merge the meta\u2011features with the text representation** before the final classifier.  The simplest and most common recipe is to concatenate a dense vector of the meta\u2011features (numeric fields normalized, categorical fields embedded) with the pooled output of the transformer and train a linear head on the combined vector\u202f\u2014\u202fthis mirrors the classic \u201c\u03b2\u2080X\u2080\u202f+\u202f\u03b2\u2081X\u2081\u201d formulation that practitioners cite on statistics forums\u202f([stats.stackexchange](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/285224/how-to-incorporate-meta-data-into-text-classification-model)).\n\nMore sophisticated tricks have also proven effective.  One popular Kaggle hack is to **turn the side\u2011information into pseudo\u2011text** and prepend it to the original document, letting the transformer attend to it directly; this \u201cfeatures\u2011to\u2011text\u201d approach often outperforms na\u00efve concatenation for datasets like the 23\u202fk clothing\u2011review competition\u202f([mccormickml](https://mccormickml.com/2021/06/29/combining-categorical-numerical-features-with-bert)).  Another line of research injects metadata deeper into the network: categorical metadata can be represented with learned basis vectors that modulate embeddings, attention weights, or classifier biases, dramatically reducing parameters while improving performance on tail categories\u202f([ACL paper](https://aclanthology.org/Q19-1013.pdf)).  A complementary paradigm treats metadata as a **source of weak supervision**: the META framework builds a text\u2011rich graph that couples documents with their metadata, extracts high\u2011confidence \u201cseed motifs,\u201d and iteratively expands both seed words and seed motifs to generate pseudo\u2011labels\u202f([EMNLP META paper](https://aclanthology.org/2020.emnlp-main.670),\u202f[GitHub implementation](https://github.com/dheeraj7596/META)).\n\nBeyond model architecture, Kaggle winners consistently apply general best\u2011practices: efficient data loading (Dask, parquet/feather formats), stratified K\u2011fold validation, heavy ensembling of multiple pretrained models, and careful handling of class imbalance.  These tactics, distilled from five top NLP competitions (Jigsaw toxicity, Quora insincere questions, Google QUEST, etc.), together with the meta\u2011feature integration strategies above, form the backbone of the highest\u2011scoring Kaggle text\u2011classification pipelines\u202f([Neptune blog](https://neptune.ai/blog/text-classification-tips-and-tricks-kaggle-competitions)).",

      "text": "In this article, I will discuss some great tips and tricks to [improve the performance](https://neptune.ai/blog/improving-machine-learning-deep-learning-models) of your text classification model. These tricks are obtained from solutions of some of Kaggle\u2019s top NLP competitions.\n\nNamely, I\u2019ve gone through:\n\n- [Jigsaw Unintended Bias in Toxicity Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-unintended-bias-in-toxicity-classification) \u2013 $65,000\n- [Toxic Comment Classification Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge/) \u2013 $35,000\n- [Quora Insincere Questions Classification](http://kaggle.com/c/quora-insincere-questions-classification) \u2013 $25,000\n- [Google QUEST Q&A Labeling](https://www.kaggle.com/c/google-quest-challenge) \u2013 $25,000\n- [TensorFlow 2.0 Question Answering](https://www.kaggle.com/c/tensorflow2-question-answering) \u2013 $50,000\n\nand found a ton of great ideas.\n\nWithout much lag, let\u2019s begin.\n\n## Dealing with larger datasets\n\nOne issue you might face in any machine learning competition is the size of your data set. If the size of your data is large, that is 3GB + for Kaggle kernels and more basic laptops you could find it difficult to load and process with limited resources. Here is the link to some of the articles and kernels that I have found useful in such situations.\n\n- Optimize the memory by [reducing the size of some attributes](https://www.kaggle.com/shrutimechlearn/large-data-loading-trick-with-ms-malware-data)\n- Use open-source libraries such as [Dask to read and manipulate the data](https://www.kaggle.com/yuliagm/how-to-work-with-big-datasets-on-16g-ram-dask), it performs parallel computing and saves up memory space\n- Use [cudf](https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf)\n- Convert data to [parquet](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/parquet.html) format\n- Convert data to [feather](https://medium.com/@snehotosh.banerjee/feather-a-fast-on-disk-format-for-r-and-python-data-frames-de33d0516b03) format\n\n## Small datasets and external data\n\nBut, what can one do if the dataset is small? Let\u2019s see some techniques to tackle this situation.\n\nOne way to increase the performance of any machine learning model is to use some external data frame that contains some variables that influence the predicate variable.\n\nLet\u2019s see some of the external datasets.\n\n- Use of [squad](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/) data for Question Answering tasks\n- Other [datasets](http://nlpprogress.com/english/question_answering.html) for QA tasks\n- Wikitext long term dependency language modeling [dataset](https://www.salesforce.com/products/einstein/ai-research/the-wikitext-dependency-language-modeling-dataset/)\n- [Stackexchange data](https://archive.org/download/stackexchange)\n- Prepare a dictionary of commonly misspelled words and corrected words.\n- Use of [helper datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/kyakovlev/jigsaw-general-helper-public) for cleaning\n- [Pseudo labeling](https://www.kaggle.com/cdeotte/pseudo-labeling-qda-0-969/) is the process of adding confidently predicted test data to your training data\n- Use different data [sampling methods](https://www.kaggle.com/shahules/tackling-class-imbalance)\n- Text augmentation by [Exchanging words with synonym](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.01710.pdf) [s](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.01710.pdf)\n- Text augmentation by [noising in RNN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.02573.pdf)\n- Text augmentation by [translation to other languages and back](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge/discussion/48038)\n\n## Data exploration and gaining insights\n\nData exploration always helps to better understand the data and gain insights from it. Before starting to develop machine learning models, top competitors always read/do a lot of exploratory data analysis for the data. This helps in feature engineering and cleaning of the data.\n\n- Twitter data [exploration methods](https://www.kaggle.com/jagangupta/stop-the-s-toxic-comments-eda)\n- Simple [EDA for tweets](https://www.kaggle.com/nz0722/simple-eda-text-preprocessing-jigsaw)\n- [EDA](https://www.kaggle.com/tunguz/just-some-simple-eda) for Quora data\n- [EDA](https://www.kaggle.com/kailex/r-eda-for-q-gru) in \u00a0R for Quora data\n- Complete [EDA](https://www.kaggle.com/codename007/start-from-here-quest-complete-eda-fe) with stack exchange data\n- My previous article on [EDA for natural language processing](https://neptune.ai/blog/exploratory-data-analysis-natural-language-processing-tools)\n\n## Data cleaning\n\nData cleaning is one of the important and integral parts of any NLP problem.

      "text": "Categorical Metadata Representation for Customized Text Classification\nJihyeok Kim*1 Reinald Kim Amplayo*2\nKyungjae Lee1 Sua Sung1 Minji Seo1 Seung-won Hwang1\n(* equal contribution)\n1Yonsei University 2University of Edinburgh\nzizi1532@yonsei.ac.kr reinald.kim@ed.ac.uk\n{lkj0509,dormouse,ggatalminji,seungwonh}@yonsei.ac.kr\nAbstract\nThe performance of text classification has\nimproved tremendously using intelligently\nengineered neural-based models, especially those\ninjecting categorical metadata as additional\ninformation, e.g., using user/product informa\u0002tion for sentiment classification. This infor\u0002mation has been used to modify parts of the\nmodel (e.g., word embeddings, attention mech\u0002anisms) such that results can be customized\naccording to the metadata. We observe that\ncurrent representation methods for categorical\nmetadata, which are devised for human con\u0002sumption, are not as effective as claimed in\npopular classification methods, outperformed\neven by simple concatenation of categorical\nfeatures in the final layer of the sentence\nencoder. We conjecture that categorical fea\u0002tures are harder to represent for machine use,\nas available context only indirectly describes\nthe category, and even such context is often\nscarce (for tail category). To this end, we pro\u0002pose using basis vectors to effectively incor\u0002porate categorical metadata on various parts\nof a neural-based model. This additionally\ndecreases the number of parameters dramatic\u0002ally, especially when the number of categori\u0002cal features is large. Extensive experiments on\nvarious data sets with different properties are\nperformed and show that through our method,\nwe can represent categorical metadata more\neffectively to customize parts of the model,\nincluding unexplored ones, and increase the\nperformance of the model greatly.\n1 Introduction\nText classification is the backbone of most NLP\ntasks: review classification in sentiment analysis\n(Pang et al., 2002), paper classification in sci\u0002entific data discovery (Sebastiani, 2002), and\nquestion classification in question answering (Li\nand Roth, 2002), to name a few. While prior meth\u0002ods require intensive feature engineering, recent\nmethods enjoy automatic extraction of features\nfrom text using neural-based models (Socher et al.,\n2011) by encoding texts into low-dimensional\ndense feature vectors.\nThis paper discusses customized text clas\u0002sification, generalized from personalized text\nclassification (Baruzzo et al., 2009), where we\ncustomize classifiers based on possibly multiple\ndifferent known categorical metadata information\n(e.g., user/product information for sentiment\nclassification) instead of just the user information.\nAs shown in Figure 1, in addition to the text,\na customizable text classifier is given a list of\ncategories specific to the text to predict its class.\nExisting works applied metadata information to\nimprove the performance of a model, such as\nuser and product (Tang et al., 2015) information\nin sentiment classification, and author (Rosen\u0002Zvi et al., 2004) and publication (Joorabchi and\nMahdi, 2011) information in paper classification.\nTowards our goal, we are inspired by the ad\u0002vancement in neural-based models, incorporat\u0002ing categorical information \u2018\u2018as is\u2019\u2019 and injecting\nit on various parts of the model such as in the\nword embeddings (Tang et al., 2015), attention\nmechanism (Chen et al., 2016; Amplayo et al.,\n2018a) and memory networks (Dou, 2017).\nIndeed, these methods theoretically make use\nof combined features from both textual and\ncategorical features, which make them more\npowerful than disconnected features. However,\nmetadata is generated for human understanding,\nand thus we claim that these categories need\nto be carefully represented for machine use to\n201\nTransactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, vol. 7, pp. 201\u2013215, 2019.

Example\ntasks are shown in the left of the figure.\nimprove the performance of the text classifier\neffectively.\nFirst, we empirically invalidate the results from\nprevious studies by showing in our experiments\non multiple data sets that popular methods using\nmetadata categories \u2018\u2018as is\u2019\u2019 perform worse than\na simple concatenation of textual and categorical\nfeature vectors. We argue that this is because of\nthe difficulties of the model in learning optimized\ndense vector representation of the categorical\nfeatures to be used by the classification model.\nThe reasons are two-fold: (a) categorical features\ndo not have direct context and thus rely solely\non classification labels when training the feature\nvectors, and (b) there are categorical information\nthat are sparse and thus cannot effectively learn\noptimal feature vectors.\nSecond, we suggest an alternative represen\u0002tation, using low-dimensional basis vectors to\nmitigate the optimization problems of categorical\nfeature vectors. Basis vectors have nice properties\nthat can solve the issues presented here because\nthey (a) transform multiple categories into useful\ncombinations, which serve as mutual context to all\ncategories, and (b) intelligently initialize vectors,\nespecially of sparse categorical information, to\na suboptimal location to efficiently train them\nfurther. Furthermore, our method reduces the\nnumber of trainable parameters and thus is flex\u0002ible for any kinds and any number of available\ncategories.\nWe experiment on multiple classification tasks\nwith different properties and kinds of catego\u0002ries available. Our experiments show that while\ncustomization methods using categorical infor\u0002mation \u2018\u2018as is\u2019\u2019 do not perform as well as the\nnaive concatenation method, applying our pro\u0002posed basis-customization method makes them\nmuch more effective than the naive method. Our\nmethod also enables the use of categorical meta\u0002data to customize other parts of the model, such\nas the encoder weights, that are previously un\u0002explored due to their high space complexity and\nweak performance. We show that this unexplored\nuse of customization outperform popular and con\u0002ventional methods such as attention mechanism\nwhen our proposed basis-customization method\nis used.\n202\n2 Preliminaries\n2.1 Problem: Customized Text Classification\nThe original text classification task is defined\nas follows: Given a text W = {w1, w2, ..., wn},\nwe are tasked to train a mapping function f(W)\nto predict a correct class y \u2208 {y1, y2, ..., yp}\namong the p classes. The customized text\nclassification task makes use of the categorical\nmetadata information attached on the text to\ncustomize the mapping function. In this paper,\nwe define categorical metadata as non-continuous\ninformation that describes the text.1 An example\ntask is review sentiment classification with user\nand product information as categorical metadata.\nFormally, given a text t = {W, C}, where\nW = {w1, w2, ..., wn}, C = {c1, c2, ..., cm}, wx\nis the xth of the n tokens in the text, and cz is the\ncategory label of the text on the zth category of\nthe m available categories, the goal of customized\ntext classification is to optimize a function fC(W)\nto predict a label y, where fC(W) is the classifier\ndependent with C. In our example task, W is the\nreview text, and we have m = 2 categories where\nc1 and c2 are the user and product information.\nThis is an interesting problem because of the\nvast opportunities it provides. First, we are moti\u0002vated to use categorical metadata because exist\u0002ing work has shown that non-textual additional\ninformation, such as POS tags (Go et al., 2009)\nand latent topics (Zhao et al., 2017), can be used\nas strong supplementary supervision to improve\nthe performance of text classifi...",

However I'm not sure how to proceed.\n\nAssume that I have a dataset that is $N \\\\times 3$, where the columns are:\n\n1. text document - for example, an amazon review or newspaper article\n2. some meta\\_data - for example, number of words of length > 5, or time article was published\n3. category - either A, B or C\n\nThe goal is to use the text document and the meta\\_data to classify the example in the correct category.\n\nTypically one would perform text classification on the text document (tokenize, lemmatize, remove stopwords, etc...) and build a sparse matrix of word counts. A model (for example SVM is popular) would be trained on this sparse matrix and tested on some unseen data, whereby it would be classified A, B or C.\n\nBut what about the meta data? I'd like to incorporate that somehow but in this paradigm it's unclear to me where I can inject it. I feel like what I want is a model of the form:\n\n$y = \\\\beta\\_0X\\_0 + \\\\beta\\_1X\\_1$\n\nWhere $X\\_0$ is the meta data and $X\\_1$ is the result of the NLP part. But how would I set up such a model? Can I reduce the text classification portion into a single coefficient? Or am I conflating two distinct approaches of modeling text?\n\n- [machine-learning](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/machine-learning)\n- [text-mining](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/text-mining)\n- [natural-language](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/natural-language)\n\n[Share](https://stats.stackexchange.com/q/285224)\n\nCite\n\n[Improve this question](https://stats.stackexchange.com/posts/285224/edit)\n\nFollow\n\nasked Jun 13, 2017 at 23:43\n\n[![ilanman's user avatar](https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/790b4c3cafa53954ceb10c33dc9b21e5?s=64&d=identicon&r=PG)](https://stats.stackexchange.com/users/73527/ilanman)\n\n[ilanman](https://stats.stackexchange.com/users/73527/ilanman) ilanman\n\n4,78711 gold badge2929 silver badges4848 bronze badges\n\n$\\\\endgroup$\n\n[Add a comment](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/285224/how-to-incorporate-meta-data-into-text-classification-model)\u00a0\\|\n\n## 1 Answer 1\n\nSorted by:\n[Reset to default](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/285224/how-to-incorporate-meta-data-into-text-classification-model?answertab=scoredesc#tab-top)\n\nHighest score (default)Date modified (newest first)Date created (oldest first)\n\n2\n\n$\\\\begingroup$\n\nJust use the metadata features as features for the SVM.\n\nTypically the features that you feed into the SVM would be the $n \\\\times k$ document-term matrix $\\\\mathbf{T}$.

      "text": "# Combining Categorical and Numerical Features with Text in BERT\n\n29 Jun 2021\n\nIn this tutorial we\u2019ll look at the topic of classifying text with BERT, but where we also have additional numerical or categorical features that we want to use to improve our predictions.\n\nTo help motivate our discussion, we\u2019ll be working with a dataset of about 23k clothing reviews. For each review, we have the review text, but also additional information such as:\n\n- The age of the reviewer (numerical feature)\n- The number of upvotes on the review (numerical feature)\n- The department and category of the clothing item (categorical features)\n\nFor each review, we also have a binary label, which is whether or not the reviewer ultimately recommends the item. This is what we are trying to predict.\n\nThis dataset was scraped from an (un-specified) e-commerce website by Nick Brooks and made available on Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/nicapotato/womens-ecommerce-clothing-reviews).\n\nIn Section 2 of this Notebook, I\u2019ve implemented four different \u201cbaseline\u201d strategies which score fairly well, but which don\u2019t incorporate all of the features together.\n\nThen, in Section 3, I\u2019ve implemented a simple strategy to combine _everything_ and feed it through BERT. Specifically, I make text out of the additional features, and prepend this text to the review.\n\nThere is a GitHub project called the [Multimodal-Toolkit](https://github.com/georgian-io/Multimodal-Toolkit) which is how I learned about this clothing review dataset. The toolkit implements a number of more complicated techniques, but their benchmarks (as well as our results below) show that this simple features-to-text strategy works best for this dataset.\n\nIn our weekly discussion group, I talked through this Notebook and we also met with Ken Gu, the author of the Multi-Modal Toolkit!

Existing methods mainly use text data\nalone to generate pseudo-labels despite the\nfact that metadata information (e.g., author\nand timestamp) is widely available across var\u0002ious domains. Strong label indicators exist in\nthe metadata and it has been long overlooked\nmainly due to the following challenges: (1)\nmetadata is multi-typed, requiring systematic\nmodeling of different types and their combi\u0002nations, (2) metadata is noisy, some metadata\nentities (e.g., authors, venues) are more com\u0002pelling label indicators than others. In this\npaper, we propose a novel framework, META,\nwhich goes beyond the existing paradigm and\nleverages metadata as an additional source of\nweak supervision. Specifically, we organize\nthe text data and metadata together into a\ntext-rich network and adopt network motifs to\ncapture appropriate combinations of metadata.\nBased on seed words, we rank and filter mo\u0002tif instances to distill highly label-indicative\nones as \u201cseed motifs\u201d, which provide addi\u0002tional weak supervision. Following a boot\u0002strapping manner, we train the classifier and\nexpand the seed words and seed motifs itera\u0002tively. Extensive experiments and case stud\u0002ies on real-world datasets demonstrate supe\u0002rior performance and significant advantages of\nleveraging metadata as weak supervision.\n1 Introduction\nWeakly supervised text classification has recently\ngained much attention from the researchers because\nit reduces the burden of annotating the data. So far,\nthe major source of weak supervision lies in text\ndata itself (Agichtein and Gravano, 2000; Kuipers\net al., 2006; Riloff et al., 2003; Tao et al., 2015;\nMeng et al., 2018; Mekala and Shang, 2020). These\nmethods typically require a few user-provided seed\nPaper Authors Year Category\nP1 G. Hinton, S. Osindero, YW. Teh 2006 ML\nP2 G. Hinton, O. Vinyals, J. Dean 2015 ML\nP3 J.

They ex\u0002pand seed words with generated pseudo labels and\nimprove their text classifier in an iterative fashion.\nMetadata information (e.g., author, published\nyear) in addition to textual information, is widely\navailable across various domains (e.g., news arti\u0002cles, social media posts, and scientific papers) and\nit could serve as a strong, complementary weak\nsupervision source. Take a look at the research\npapers in Figure 1(a) as an example. It shall be\nlearned in a data-driven manner that G. Hinton is a\nhighly-reputed machine learning researcher, thus\nhis presence is a strong indicator of a paper belong\u0002ing to the Machine Learning category.\nDistilling effective metadata for weak supervi\u0002sion faces several major challenges. Metadata is\noften multi-typed, each type and the type combi\u0002nations could have very different semantics and\nmay not be equally important. Moreover, even en\u0002tities within a single metadata type could be noisy.\nContinuing our example in Figure 1(a), we shall\nnotice that year is less helpful than an author to do\nclassification. Among the authors, J. Dean might\nbe an important figure but has research interests\n8352\nm1,1 .95 .01 .04\nm1,2 .32 .30 .38\nText Classifier\nSeed Words \u2460 Pseudo Label Generation \u2462 Motif Ranking & \u2026\nC1 Neural Network\nC2 Image Classification\nC3 Translation\nPaper\nAuthor 1 Author 2\nM1\nM2\nm2,1 .03 .89 .08\nm2,2 .31 .26 .43\nInstance C1 C2 C3\nKlein Manning\nP1 P2\n\u2461 Classifier Training / Prediction\nRecursion\nUser Given\nMotif Pattern\nMatched (Seed)\nMotif Instances\n\u2026\n\u2026\nC1 m1,1 m1,6 m2,3 m1,4 \u2026\nC2 m2,1 m2,4 m1,2 m1,4 \u2026\nC3 m1,3 m2,5 m2,2 m1,7 \u2026\n...

However, if we\njoin the author with year, it carries more accurate\nsemantics, and we may discover J. Dean has more\ninterest in machine learning in recent years, thus\nbecoming highly label-indicative.\nBearing the challenges in mind, we propose\nMETA, a principled framework for metadata\u0002empowered weakly-supervised text classification.\nAs illustrated in Figure 1 and Figure 2, we first\norganize the text data and metadata together into\na text-rich network. The network structure gives\nus a holistic view of the corpus and enables us to\nrank and select useful metadata entities. We lever\u0002age motif patterns (Benson et al., 2016; Milo et al.,\n2002; Shang et al., 2020) to model typed metadata\nas well as their combinations. A motif pattern is\na subgraph pattern at the meta-level that captures\nhigher-order connections and the semantics repre\u0002sented by these connections. It serves as a useful\ntool to model typed edges, typed paths (a.k.a. meta\u0002paths) (Sun et al., 2011), and higher-order struc\u0002tures in the network. With little effort, users can\nspecify a few possibly useful motif patterns as in\u0002put to our model. We develop a unified, principled\nranking mechanism to select label-indicative motif\ninstances and words, forming expanded weak su\u0002pervision. Note that, such instance-level selection\nprocess also implicitly refines the motif patterns,\nensuring the robust performance of META even\nwhen irrelevant motif patterns exist in input. It is\nworth a mention that META is compatible with any\ntext classifiers.\nOur contributions are summarized as follows:\n\u2022 We explore to incorporate metadata information\nas an additional source of weak supervision for\ntext classification along with seed words.\n\u2022 We propose a novel framework META, which in\u0002troduces motif patterns to capture the high-order\ncombinations among different types of metadata\nand conducts a unified ranking and selection of\nlabel-indicative motif instances and words.\n\u2022 We conduct experiments on two real-world\ndatasets. The results and case studies demon\u0002strate the superiority of incorporating metadata\nas parts of weak supervision and verify the effec\u0002tiveness of META.\nReproducibility. Our code is made publicly avail\u0002able at GitHub1\n.\n2 Preliminaries\n2.1 Documents as Text-rich Network\nGiven a collection of n text documents D =\n{D1, D2, . . . , Dn}, and their corresponding meta\u0002data, we propose to organize them into a text-rich\nnetwork, as illustrated in Figure 1(b). A text-rich\nnetwork is a heterogeneous network with docu\u0002ments, words, different types of metadata as nodes,\nand their associations as edges. For example, our\ntext-rich network for research papers has papers,\nwords, authors, and publication years as nodes.\nEach paper is connected to its associated words\nand metadata nodes. Such a network provides a\nholistic and structured representation of the input.\n2.2 Seed Words and Motif Patterns\nUsers are asked to provide a few seed words S\n= {Sw\n1\n, S\nw\n2\n, . . . , S\nw\nl\n} for each of l classes (i.e.,\nC1, C2, . . . , ...",

Please refer to our [> A Journey Throuhgh Text Data Competitions\n](https://www.kaggle.com/code/sophieb/a-journey-through-text-data-competitions)> notebook for further details.\nN**atural Language Processing (NLP)**, the branch of artificial intelligence that enables computers to understand human language, has witnessed remarkable growth and transformative advancements in recent years. This surge has been driven by the increasing availability of vast amounts of text data and the rapid development of sophisticated machine-learning techniques.\n*> \u201cIt is estimated that 90% of the world\u2019s data was generated in the last two years alone\u201d\n*> by [> Amount of Data Created Daily (2023)\n](https://explodingtopics.com/blog/data-generated-per-day)\n[**Kaggle**](https://www.kaggle.com/)is an online platform that hosts machine learning and data science competitions. Among these competitions, text data competitions specifically focus on tasks related to NLP and text analysis. Participants are provided with text datasets and are tasked with developing models and algorithms to solve language-related challenges such as sentiment analysis, text classification, and machine translation. These competitions are instrumental in advancing NLP techniques and provide participants with valuable experience and knowledge exchange opportunities.\nAccessing and learning about the latest techniques employed in text data Kaggle competitions can be challenging due to their dispersion within discussions and winning solution write-ups.**Valuable information about these cutting-edge approaches tends to get buried, making it difficult to stay updated on the evolving landscape of text data techniques.**\nIn this essay, our objective is to offer valuable insights into key lessons learned by the Kaggle community during their engagement in text data competitions spanning from 2021 to 2023. We will focus on**four pivotal topics**that have emerged as the foundation for successful solutions in recent years:**model architectures**,**pseudo labeling**,**adversarial weight perturbation**, and**mask language modeling**. By examining these four key areas, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of the essential elements driving winning strategies in text data competitions.\n## Methodology\nTo gain a better understanding of the text data landscape, we carried out the following tasks:\n* **Analyze 27 write-ups from nine Kaggle competitions specifically related to text data**. We dove deeper into the top three solutions for text data competitions held from 2021 to 2023, see**Figure 1**. Also, we explore a range of topics, including the prevalent techniques and methodologies employed, the most effective model architectures utilized, and the challenges encountered and overcame. This analysis enabled us to gain deeper insights into the problem-solving approaches and thought processes employed by Kagglers in developing their successful solutions.\n* **Perform a general but not exhaustive analysis of the**[**arXiv dataset**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/Cornell-University/arxiv). We filter out categories with the potential to include NLP papers published within the past two years. By leveraging a predefined list of keywords associated with text data, we directed our efforts towards uncovering the specific problem domains and top leading model architectures [1][2] that have garnered attention within the research community.\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\n![]()\n**Figure 1.**Kaggle text data competitions held from 2021 to 2023\n## Key Discoveries of Text Data Competitions\nThe result of the analysis of the 27 write-ups and their most notable comments can be seen in[Table I of Appendix A](https://www.kaggle.com/code/sophieb/a-journey-through-text-data-competitions#Appendix-A)and[Table II of Appendix B](https://www.kaggle.com/code/sophieb/a-journey-through-text-data-competitions#Appendix-B), respectively.**Table I**provides information about the top three winning solutions in each Kaggle competition related to text, highlighting aspects such as model architectures, parameters like PB and LB, optimizers, ensembles, and the most innovative proposed ideas, among others. On the other hand,**Table II**presents a summary of comments from the write-ups in a question-like format. Additionally, the analysis of the arXiv dataset has allowed us to unveil, on a larger scale, how the use of certain model architectures and their application to specific text domains compares to the solutions presented in text-oriented Kaggle competitions over the past two years. For more details, please refer to[EDA Kaggle and Arxiv datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/code/sophieb/eda-kaggle-and-arxiv-datasets)notebook.\nAs**Figure 2**shows, out of the nine competitions, five focused on text classification tasks, two aimed at information extraction tasks, while the remaining targeted text matching and question-and-answer tasks. Interestingly,**Figure 3**shows that with the frequency of the term \u201cquestion answering\u201d exceeding 400 times, it can be inferred that the scientific community has placed greater importance on domains related to this field.
