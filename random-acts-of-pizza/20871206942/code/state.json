      "query": "What are winning approaches for text classification with both text content and meta-data features on Kaggle?",
      "finding": "Winning Kaggle solutions for text classification that also exploit meta\u2011data (e.g., timestamps, author IDs, numeric or categorical side\u2011information) follow a few recurring patterns.  First, they treat the raw text with a strong pretrained language model (BERT, RoBERTa, DeBERTa, etc.) and then **merge the meta\u2011features with the text representation** before the final classifier.  The simplest and most common recipe is to concatenate a dense vector of the meta\u2011features (numeric fields normalized, categorical fields embedded) with the pooled output of the transformer and train a linear head on the combined vector\u202f\u2014\u202fthis mirrors the classic \u201c\u03b2\u2080X\u2080\u202f+\u202f\u03b2\u2081X\u2081\u201d formulation that practitioners cite on statistics forums\u202f([stats.stackexchange](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/285224/how-to-incorporate-meta-data-into-text-classification-model)).\n\nMore sophisticated tricks have also proven effective.
