  "overall_failure_reason": "There was notable jury disagreement: one verdict rated the work near-perfect (good debugging and correct loading), one rated it very low citing a 'wrong trajectory' (insufficient NLP sophistication), and one rated it high but flagged the initial parsing failure. Resolving this, the agent’s EDA-first approach is reasonable for early-stage exploration, so the harshest critique is partially overstated; however, the initial brittle data-loading assumption and the generally surface-level feature exploration (especially for text) justify a non-perfect score and an RL trigger to improve robust ingestion and to more quickly transition from basic EDA to NLP-relevant analyses."
