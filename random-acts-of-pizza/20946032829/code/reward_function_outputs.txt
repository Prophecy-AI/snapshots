Resolving this, the agent’s EDA-first approach is reasonable for early-stage exploration, so the harshest critique is partially overstated; however, the initial brittle data-loading assumption and the generally surface-level feature exploration (especially for text) justify a non-perfect score and an RL trigger to improve robust ingestion and to more quickly transition from basic EDA to NLP-relevant analyses."

I weighted the consensus on concrete execution quality: the agent made notable early mistakes (feature mismatch, variable/state issues, some tooling/logging oversights) supporting the lower scores, but also demonstrated strong recovery and debugging to deliver a working baseline submission supporting the higher score. Net result is middling performance: competent baseline creation and fixes, yet underpowered modeling and avoidable errors compared with winning-strategy sophistication."
