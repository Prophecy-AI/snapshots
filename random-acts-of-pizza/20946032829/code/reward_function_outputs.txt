  ],
  "overall_failure_reason": "Primary deficiency: the agent failed to validate the JSON format before implementing parsing, causing an avoidable execution error (later fixed well). Secondary point of disagreement among jurors: one evaluator argues the agent may be pursuing the wrong task relative to the provided reference 'top solutions'; the others treat the mismatch as external/contextual and score the agent on general best practices. Final score resolves this by crediting strong recovery/EDA while discounting for the initial data-loading lapse and potential task-alignment uncertainty."
