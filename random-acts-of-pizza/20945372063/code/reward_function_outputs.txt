  "overall_failure_reason": "There is partial disagreement in emphasis: one juror finds the EDA strongly aligned with good practice but flags leakage that must be mitigated; the other agrees on leakage but judges the approach insufficiently competitive due to missing advanced NLP/text feature engineering. Reconciling these, the work is solid exploratory groundwork, but requires RL-guided updates to (1) remove/mitigate leakage-prone fields and (2) expand beyond basic length/account features into meaningful text modeling (e.g., n-grams/TF-IDF, embeddings, or other NLP features) to reach competitive performance."
