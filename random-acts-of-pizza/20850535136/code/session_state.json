      "finding": "Winning Kaggle solutions for problems that mix free\u2011text columns with ordinary numeric or categorical fields treat the data as **multimodal** and deliberately combine a strong NLP encoder with classic tabular learners.  In practice the most reliable recipe is a three\u2011step pipeline:  \n\n1. **Encode the raw text** with a pretrained transformer (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa) to obtain dense sentence\u2011level embeddings.  AutoGluon\u2019s\u202f`TextPredictor` can do this automatically and returns embeddings that can be fed to any tabular model\u202f([auto.gluon.ai](https://auto.gluon.ai/0.7.0/tutorials/tabular_prediction/tabular-multimodal-text-others.html)).  \n2. **Merge the embeddings with the structured features** \u2013 either by concatenating them to the numeric/categorical matrix (the \u201ctwo\u2011stage\u201d approach evaluated in the multimodal AutoML benchmark\u202f([datasets\u2011benchmarks\u2011proceedings.neurips.cc](https://datasets-benchmarks-proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2021/hash/9bf31c7ff062936a96d3c8bd1f8f2ff3-Abstract-round2.html)))",

      "query": "What are winning approaches for text classification competitions on Kaggle that combine text and meta-data features?",
      "finding": "Winning solutions in Kaggle text\u2011classification contests usually blend strong language\u2011model representations with carefully engineered meta\u2011data features, then stack or ensemble the resulting models.  The most successful pipelines start by extracting dense embeddings from pretrained transformers (e.g.,\u202fBERT, RoBERTa) or fast\u2011text vectors for the raw text, while simultaneously turning auxiliary information such as document length, source, author ID, timestamp or categorical tags into numeric features (one\u2011hot, target\u2011encoded, or simple statistics).  These meta\u2011features are concatenated with the text embeddings and fed into a gradient\u2011boosting model (LightGBM, XGBoost) or a shallow neural net, which often outperforms a pure\u2011text model because the extra signals help disambiguate noisy or short inputs.  After the base models are trained, competitors typically blend several variants (different seeds, architectures, or feature sets) using weighted averaging or stacking, and they validate wit",
