In practice the most reliable recipe is a three\u2011step pipeline:  \n\n1. **Encode the raw text** with a pretrained transformer (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa) to obtain dense sentence\u2011level embeddings.  AutoGluon\u2019s\u202f`TextPredictor` can do this automatically and returns embeddings that can be fed to any tabular model\u202f([auto.gluon.ai](https://auto.gluon.ai/0.7.0/tutorials/tabular_prediction/tabular-multimodal-text-others.html)).  \n2. **Merge the embeddings with the structured features** \u2013 either by concatenating them to the numeric/categorical matrix (the \u201ctwo\u2011stage\u201d approach evaluated in the multimodal AutoML benchmark\u202f([datasets\u2011benchmarks\u2011proceedings.neurips.cc](https://datasets-benchmarks-proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2021/hash/9bf31c7ff062936a96d3c8bd1f8f2ff3-Abstract-round2.html)))",
