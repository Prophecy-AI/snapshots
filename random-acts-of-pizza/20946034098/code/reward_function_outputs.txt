I resolve this as moderate: useful basic text stats, but not yet capturing the richer text-feature insights expected for a text-heavy prediction task."

  ],
  "overall_failure_reason": "Consensus is that the agent’s workflow and iterative debugging were strong, but performance is capped by (1) an avoidable JSON parsing error early on and (2) text-feature exploration that, while serviceable, does not yet reach the depth/top-solution orientation expected for a primarily text-driven classification problem. The jury disagreed on how thorough the text EDA was; I resolved this by assigning a middle-ground score that credits progress but penalizes missing richer NLP analyses."
