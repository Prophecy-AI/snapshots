  "overall_failure_reason": "Consensus is that the agent’s early-stage exploration is competent and directionally sound, but it has not yet produced a concrete, competition-tailored modeling pipeline. Jurors disagreed on whether the strategy/searches were appropriately specific; I sided with the more detailed critiques that the work remains too generic and insufficiently tied to proven top-solution techniques, while still acknowledging the value of the modern multimodal framing."
