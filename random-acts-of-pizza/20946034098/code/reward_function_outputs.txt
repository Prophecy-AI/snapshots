The jury disagreed on how thorough the text EDA was; I resolved this by assigning a middle-ground score that credits progress but penalizes missing richer NLP analyses."

Because the mismatch/target critique is specific and plausibly consequential, it was weighted more heavily than the generic-positive assessments. Majority of provided jurors also recommend triggering RL (2/3). Note: the prompt states 4 jurors, but only 3 verdicts were provided; synthesis is based only on the available evidence."
