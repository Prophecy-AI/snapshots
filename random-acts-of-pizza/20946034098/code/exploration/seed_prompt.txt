## Current Status
- Best CV: 0.7261 from exp_000 (001_baseline_logistic_regression)
- Gap to Gold: 0.2529 points (need 0.9791)
- Experiments above gold: 0

## Response to Evaluator
- **Technical verdict was TRUSTWORTHY**: The baseline execution is sound with proper validation and no leakage. Convergence warnings were addressed by increasing max_iter to 1000.
- **Evaluator's top priority: Feature engineering over model improvements**: I strongly agree. The 0.253-point gap cannot be closed with marginal model tweaks. Analysis shows multiple high-signal patterns that haven't been exploited.
- **Key concerns raised**:
  - Convergence warnings: Addressed by increasing max_iter and will add feature scaling
  - Minimal text preprocessing: Will engineer Reddit-specific features (politeness, mentions, sentiment)
  - Untapped categorical features: Will implement proper target encoding for user flair and subreddits
  - No interaction features: Will create ratios and combinations of metadata
  - Need stronger models: Will try gradient boosting after feature enrichment

## Data Understanding
- **Reference notebooks**: See `exploration/evolver_loop1_analysis.ipynb` for comprehensive analysis
- **Key patterns discovered**:
  1. **request_number_of_comments_at_retrieval** has 0.291 correlation with success - strongest metadata predictor
  2. **Edited posts** have 42.7% success vs 22.2% for non-edited - editing is a strong positive signal
  3. **Text length** shows non-linear relationship: medium posts (33-35% success) outperform very short (24%) or very long (0%)
  4. **User flair "PIF" and "shroom"** have 100% success rates (but small samples - need careful handling)
  5. **Hour of day** patterns: 3pm (15:00) shows highest success rate at 32.4%
  6. **Politeness markers**: "thank" shows 0.065 correlation (weak but consistent)
  7. **Account activity ratios**: Comments/posts ratio shows promise (0.043 correlation)

## Recommended Approaches (Priority Order)

### 1. Engineer Reddit-Specific Text Features (Highest Priority)
**Because**: Analysis shows text patterns correlate with success, and Reddit has unique linguistic markers.
- Extract politeness markers: count of "please", "thank you", "sorry", "appreciate"
- Extract desperation indicators: "hungry", "starving", "desperate", "broke", "bills"
- Count username mentions (u/) and subreddit mentions (r/)
- Calculate text statistics: length, word count, unique word ratio, readability scores
- Extract sentiment scores using VADER (Reddit-optimized)
- Create binary flags: contains story, contains offer to pay forward, mentions family/kids
- Engineer edit patterns: length change ratio, added politeness markers

### 2. Transform Metadata with Intelligence
**Because**: Raw metadata shows weak correlations (0.03-0.05), but interactions and ratios may be stronger.
- Create interaction features:
  - comments_per_post = comments / (posts + 1)
  - account_age_activity = account_age / (comments + posts + 1)
  - upvote_ratio = total_votes / (comments + 1)
  - retrieval_vs_request_comments = comments_at_retrieval / (comments_at_request + 1)
- Bin continuous variables: account_age tiers, activity level categories
- Log transform skewed features: vote counts, comment counts
- Create flags: is_new_account (< 30 days), is_high_activity (> 100 comments)

### 3. Leverage Categorical Features with Target Encoding
**Because**: User flair shows extreme success rates (100% for some flairs), and subreddits may have community-specific patterns.
- **User flair**: Use TargetEncoder with 5-fold cross-fitting to prevent leakage
  - Apply smoothing to handle small sample sizes
  - Create "unknown" category for new flairs in test set
- **Subreddits**: Extract top 20 most common subreddits and target encode
  - Use cross-validation within CV to prevent leakage
  - Create "other" category for rare subreddits
- **Requester username**: Consider frequency encoding (how many times user has posted)

### 4. Add Temporal Features
**Because**: Hour-of-day analysis shows 3pm peak success rate, suggesting temporal patterns.
- Extract hour of day, day of week, month from timestamp
- Create cyclical features: sin/cos transformations for hour/day
- Engineer "time since first post" features using RAOP-specific timestamps
- Create flags: is_weekend, is_evening (6pm-10pm), is_late_night (10pm-6am)

### 5. Try Gradient Boosting Models
**Because**: Logistic regression assumes linear relationships, but success patterns are likely non-linear.
- **LightGBM**: Handles sparse features well, fast training, good with imbalanced data
- **XGBoost**: Robust, excellent performance on tabular + text features
- **CatBoost**: Handles categorical features automatically (good for flair/subreddit)
- Use same 5-fold stratified CV for fair comparison
- Keep class_weight='balanced' or adjust scale_pos_weight

### 6. Advanced Text Representations (If time permits)
- **BERT embeddings**: Use pretrained models fine-tuned on Reddit data
- **FastText**: Train on combined title + text for domain-specific embeddings
- **LLM features**: Use GPT-style models to extract semantic features

## What NOT to Try
- **Simple hyperparameter tuning**: Won't close 0.253-point gap without better features
- **Basic TF-IDF increases**: Already at 5000 features, diminishing returns
- **More logistic regression variants**: Linear model is limited without feature engineering
- **Ensembling now**: Need diverse, strong base models first
- **Deep neural networks**: Too complex without proper feature foundation, risk of overfitting on small dataset (2878 samples)

## Validation Notes
- **CV scheme**: Continue with 5-fold stratified CV (proven stable, std=0.0095)
- **Leakage prevention**: Critical for target encoding - use cross-validation within CV
- **Confidence**: Current CV is trustworthy (TRUSTWORTHY verdict). Feature engineering should improve scores significantly.
- **Success criteria**: Aim for >0.80 CV score with engineered features before moving to ensembling

## Implementation Priority
1. Start with text feature engineering (highest impact, lowest risk)
2. Add metadata interactions and transformations
3. Implement target encoding for categorical features
4. Try LightGBM/XGBoost with new features
5. Evaluate improvement - if >0.80, consider ensembling strategies
6. If plateau, research more advanced techniques (BERT, stacking)
