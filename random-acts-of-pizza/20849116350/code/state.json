In most competitions (e.g., Jigsaw Toxicity, Quora Insincere, Google\u202fQUEST) the best scores were achieved by **fusing a textual encoder (BERT, RoBERTa or TF\u2011IDF\u202f+\u202fLinear models) with a separate representation of the auxiliary fields** such as author ID, timestamp, length, or attached media\u202f([neptune.ai](https://neptune.ai/blog/text-classification-tips-and-tricks-kaggle-competitions)).  The most common pattern is **early\u2011fusion**: the meta\u2011features are encoded (one\u2011hot, target\u2011encoded, or passed through a small dense network) and concatenated to the final text embedding before the classifier head.  This can be implemented with a multi\u2011modal block that processes each data type in its own sub\u2011network and merges them with attention or simple concatenation, as demonstrated in the MESSAGENET architecture where sender info, timestamps, and images are each handled by a dedicated ",
