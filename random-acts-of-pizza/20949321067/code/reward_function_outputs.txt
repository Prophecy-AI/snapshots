      "score": 0.65,
      "reasoning": "Numerical feature summaries/correlations were appropriate, but at least one juror found the analysis surface-level and noted missing checks for feature interactions or potential leakage (e.g., 'at_retrieval' style features)."

      "call_id": "9",
      "score": 0.85,
      "reasoning": "Strong agreement that the categorical/text keyword probing (e.g., user_flair signal, relevant terms) was domain-relevant and more competition-specific than generic EDA; minor criticism that keyword probing remains simplistic versus top-tier approaches."

      "call_id": "11",
      "score": 0.8,
      "reasoning": "Jury disagreement: one juror rated the synthesis+web-search as excellent and well-targeted, while another found the query too generic and not keyed to known top-solution patterns. Resolved by awarding a solid but not perfect score: good strategic direction, but could be more competition-specific."
    }
  ],
  "overall_failure_reason": "Overall consensus is that the agent is performing strong early-stage EDA and correctly identifying key signals (class imbalance, text/tabular integration, categorical predictors). However, there is meaningful disagreement on how targeted/competition-specific the strategy is—especially the web search and recognition of deeper NLP modeling patterns—and some gaps remain (deeper text analysis, leakage/temporal checks, and moving beyond generic EDA toward solution-level feature/model design). Trigger set to true because 2 of 3 jurors recommended triggering RL and the majority view is that progress is good but incomplete."
