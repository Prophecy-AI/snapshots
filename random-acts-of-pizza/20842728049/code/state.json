A common recipe is to let a pretrained transformer (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa) encode each text field into a dense vector, then feed those vectors together with the original tabular features into gradient\u2011boosted decision\u2011tree models such as LightGBM, CatBoost or Random Forest.  This \u201ctwo\u2011stage\u201d pipeline lets the tree\u2011based model exploit the rich semantic signal from the embeddings while still handling categorical encodings, missing values and interactions that trees capture well\u202f([Papers with Code benchmark](https://paperswithcode.com/paper/benchmarking-multimodal-automl-for-tabular)).\n\nA more integrated alternative is to **train a single multimodal network** that ingests both modalities directly.
