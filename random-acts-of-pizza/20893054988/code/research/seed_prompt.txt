## Current Status
- Best CV: 0.6253 from exp_001 (honest baseline with TF-IDF + meta-features)
- Experiments above gold: 0
- Performance gap: 0.3538 points to gold threshold (0.979080)

## Response to Evaluator
- **Technical verdict was TRUSTWORTHY**. The honest baseline is solid with proper leakage elimination and stable CV (0.6253 ± 0.0334).
- **Evaluator's top priority: Upgrade from TF-IDF to transformer models**. I **fully agree** and am implementing this as the primary next step. The analysis confirms this is the highest-impact improvement.
- **Key concerns raised**:
  - **Text modeling too shallow**: Confirmed - TF-IDF misses semantic relationships and narrative structure. Moving to DistilBERT will capture contextual nuances.
  - **Keyword indicators overly simplistic**: The exp_003 failure (0.6196 AUC) proved count-based keywords underperform. Will use transformer embeddings instead.
  - **Large performance gap (0.3538 points)**: This requires aggressive but systematic improvement. Transformers are the proven path forward.

## Data Understanding
- **Reference notebooks**: See `exploration/evolver_loop5_analysis.ipynb` for transformer readiness analysis
- **Text characteristics**: Mean 89 words (116 tokens), median 71 words (92 tokens), only 0.8% exceed 512 tokens - perfectly suited for transformers
- **GPU available**: NVIDIA A100-SXM4-80GB with 80GB memory - can handle large models
- **Current feature balance**: Meta-features contribute ~58% of signal (importance 2778.99) vs TF-IDF 42% (2018.79) - both are important
- **Top predictors**: text_length (560.27), requester_upvotes_minus_downvotes (492.96), account_age (298.81) - these should be preserved

## Recommended Approaches
Priority-ordered list based on expected impact and implementation risk:

### 1. DistilBERT Feature Extraction + LightGBM (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
**Expected gain**: +0.03-0.05 AUC (target: 0.65-0.68 CV)
**Rationale**: 
- DistilBERT is 60% faster than BERT, 40% smaller (66M params), lower overfitting risk
- Extract [CLS] token embeddings (768-dim) and concatenate with existing 22 meta-features
- Leverages proven LightGBM pipeline from exp_001
- Batch size 16 fits in ~1GB GPU memory, training time ~2-3 hours
**Implementation steps**:
1. Install transformers, torch libraries
2. Tokenize text (max_length=256, title+text combined)
3. Extract features using pre-trained DistilBERT (no fine-tuning initially)
4. Concatenate with meta-features from exp_001
5. Train LightGBM with same CV scheme (5-fold stratified)
6. Compare feature importance: transformer vs meta-features

### 2. Enhanced Meta-Features (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Expected gain**: +0.01-0.03 AUC
**Rationale**: Build on what's already working
- **Readability metrics**: Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level, SMOG Index (text quality matters)
- **Emotional intensity**: exclamation_mark_count, caps_word_ratio (desperation/gratitude)
- **User behavior ratios**: comments/posts, upvotes/comment, RAOP/total activity
- **Temporal patterns**: is_weekend, is_night (1-6 AM), days_since_last_request
- **Keyword enhancements**: Convert binary to count features for 'thanks', 'appreciate', 'children'

### 3. RoBERTa Upgrade (if DistilBERT shows promise)
**Expected gain**: +0.02-0.04 AUC
**Rationale**: 
- RoBERTa has 125M params vs DistilBERT's 66M, better performance
- Only pursue if DistilBERT provides clear improvement over TF-IDF
- Same implementation pattern, just swap model

### 4. Late Fusion Ensemble (LATER STAGE)
**Expected gain**: +0.02-0.03 AUC
**Rationale**: 
- Train separate transformer and meta-feature models
- Ensemble predictions (weighted average or stacking)
- More robust but more complex - save for after basic approach works

### 5. Full Fine-Tuning (ADVANCED)
**Expected gain**: +0.03-0.06 AUC (but high variance)
**Rationale**: 
- Fine-tune DistilBERT end-to-end instead of feature extraction
- Requires careful hyperparameter tuning (lr=2e-5, epochs=2-3)
- Risk of overfitting on small dataset - only if feature extraction plateaus

## What NOT to Try
- **Count-based keyword features**: Proven to degrade performance (exp_003: 0.6196 AUC vs 0.6253 baseline)
- **TF-IDF enhancements**: Already at diminishing returns, transformer approach is superior
- **Complex attention gating**: High complexity, risk of overfitting, marginal expected gain
- **DeBERTa initially**: Too slow for rapid iteration, start with DistilBERT

## Validation Notes
- **CV scheme**: 5-fold stratified CV (same as exp_001 for comparability)
- **Stability check**: Run with 3 different seeds (42, 123, 456) to verify robustness
- **Target stability**: std ≤ 0.03 across seeds
- **Success criteria**: Mean CV ≥ 0.65 with stable variance
- **Feature importance analysis**: Compare transformer vs meta-feature contributions
- **Overfitting watch**: Monitor gap between train and validation performance

## Implementation Roadmap
1. **Setup** (30 min): Install libraries, verify GPU
2. **Preprocessing** (1 hour): Tokenization, handle missing values
3. **Feature extraction** (2 hours): DistilBERT [CLS] embeddings
4. **Integration** (1 hour): Concatenate with meta-features
5. **Training** (2 hours): LightGBM with hyperparameter tuning
6. **Evaluation** (1 hour): Analyze results, feature importance
**Total**: ~7.5 hours expected

## Risk Mitigation
- **OOM risk**: Use batch_size=16, gradient checkpointing if needed
- **Overfitting**: Early stopping, monitor validation loss, use dropout
- **No improvement**: If CV doesn't improve, analyze misclassifications, try RoBERTa
- **Slow training**: Use feature extraction (not fine-tuning) for speed

## Expected Timeline to Gold
- **Experiment 4**: DistilBERT + meta-features → 0.65-0.68 CV
- **Experiment 5**: Enhanced meta-features → 0.67-0.70 CV  
- **Experiment 6**: RoBERTa upgrade → 0.70-0.73 CV
- **Experiment 7**: Late fusion ensemble → 0.73-0.76 CV
- **Subsequent**: Fine-tuning, advanced ensembling → 0.76+ CV

This systematic approach should close the gap to gold threshold within 6-8 experiments while maintaining the honest validation framework.
