## Current Status
- Best CV: 0.6253 ± 0.0334 from exp_001 (honest baseline, no leakage)
- Experiments above gold: 0
- Performance gap: 0.3538 points to gold threshold (0.979080)

## Response to Evaluator
**Technical verdict was TRUSTWORTHY. I fully agree** - The honest baseline is properly validated with no leakage. The CV score of 0.6253 is realistic and provides a solid foundation.

**Evaluator's top priority: Enhance text modeling with advanced features and validate CV stability.** I completely agree and have conducted fresh analysis to identify specific high-impact improvements:

**Key concerns raised and how I'm addressing them:**

1. **Text modeling is too shallow** → Analysis shows keyword frequency (not just binary) provides 8-10% lift for top keywords like 'thank' (+10.5%), 'forward' (+8.1%)
2. **Keyword indicators are overly simplistic** → Converting from binary to count features will capture frequency and intensity
3. **User behavior features underdeveloped** → Behavior ratios show correlations of 0.04-0.07 with target - moderate but meaningful signal
4. **Temporal patterns need deeper exploration** → Hour 14 (2 PM) shows 36.8% success vs 24.8% baseline - strong signal to exploit
5. **CV stability unknown** → Will validate with multiple seeds in next experiment

## Data Understanding
**Reference notebooks**: See `exploration/evolver_loop2_analysis.ipynb` for fresh analysis

**Key patterns to exploit (with evidence):**

### Text Features (Highest Impact)
1. **Keyword frequency matters**: 'thank' shows +10.5% lift (0.318 vs 0.213), 'forward' +8.1% (0.317 vs 0.237), 'thanks' +8.0% (0.310 vs 0.230). Count features will capture intensity vs binary presence.

2. **Text length is predictive**: Correlation 0.1311 with target. Successful requests average 558 chars vs 448 chars for unsuccessful (25% longer). More words = more storytelling.

3. **Word count correlation**: 0.1280 with target. Successful requests average 105 words vs 84 words (25% more content).

### Temporal Features (High Impact)
1. **Hour of day matters**: Hour 14 (2 PM) shows 36.8% success rate vs 24.8% baseline - 12 point lift! Other strong hours: 18 (6 PM) at 32.9%, 16 (4 PM) at 31.7%.

2. **Night requests underperform**: Night (1-6 AM) shows 21.9% success vs 25.8% for day requests. Avoid late-night posting.

3. **Weekend effect minimal**: Weekend 24.1% vs weekday 25.1% - not a strong differentiator.

### User Behavior Features (Medium Impact)
1. **Activity ratios show promise**: comments_per_post correlation 0.0564, raop_comments_per_total 0.0664 - moderate but consistent signal.

2. **Engagement quality**: upvotes_per_comment 0.0477, upvotes_per_post 0.0396 - users with better karma per activity slightly more successful.

## Recommended Approaches (Priority Order)

### 1. Enhanced Text Feature Engineering (Expected +0.03-0.06 AUC)
**Rationale**: Analysis shows clear lift from keyword frequency and text length. Current binary indicators discard valuable intensity information.

**Specific implementations:**
- Convert all keyword indicators from binary to count features (thanks_count, thank_count, please_count, etc.)
- Add new high-lift keywords based on analysis: 'appreciate', 'grateful', 'children', 'family', 'desperate', 'hungry', 'job', 'work', 'broke', 'help', 'need'
- Engineer text quality metrics: vocabulary_diversity (unique_words/total_words), avg_word_length, avg_sentence_length
- Add emotional intensity: exclamation_mark_count, caps_word_ratio (words with ALL CAPS), question_mark_count
- Create storytelling markers: causal_word_count (because, since, when, after, before), promise_word_count (promise, swear, guarantee)

**Expected impact**: Moving from binary to count for top keywords should capture 8-10% lift observed in analysis.

### 2. Advanced TF-IDF Configuration (Expected +0.02-0.04 AUC)
**Rationale**: Current TF-IDF (5000 features, ngram_range=(1,2)) is conservative. Text is primary signal source.

**Specific implementations:**
- Increase max_features: 5000 → 10000 → 15000 (test both)
- Expand ngram_range: (1,2) → (1,3) to capture phrases like "pay it forward", "thank you so much"
- Test different min_df: 2 → 3 (reduce noise from very rare terms)
- Consider character ngrams: (3,5) for capturing word stems and subword patterns
- Try sublinear_tf=True for better handling of term frequency

**Memory check**: Available RAM is 160GB - can handle larger feature matrices safely.

### 3. Temporal Feature Enhancement (Expected +0.02-0.03 AUC)
**Rationale**: Hour 14 shows 12-point lift over baseline - this is one of the strongest signals found.

**Specific implementations:**
- One-hot encode top hours: hour_14, hour_18, hour_16 (based on analysis showing >30% success)
- Create time_bucket features: morning (6-12), afternoon (12-18), evening (18-24), night (0-6)
- Add is_weekend, is_night, is_evening as binary indicators
- Engineer request_frequency: days_since_last_request (need to calculate per user from timestamps)
- Create account_age_buckets: new (<30d), growing (30-90d), established (90-365d), veteran (>365d)
- Add RAOP_tenure_buckets: first_timer (0d), new (1-30d), regular (30-180d), long_term (>180d)

**Note**: days_since_last_request requires careful implementation to avoid leakage - use only previous requests in time.

### 4. User Behavior Deep Dive (Expected +0.01-0.02 AUC)
**Rationale**: Ratios show moderate correlation (0.04-0.07) - not huge but consistent signal that complements text features.

**Specific implementations:**
- Engineer ratio features: comments_per_post, raop_comments_per_total_comments, upvotes_per_comment, upvotes_per_post
- Create engagement_quality: upvotes_per_total_activity, downvotes_per_total_activity
- Add activity_trend: recent_activity_ratio (last 30 days vs lifetime activity) - requires timestamp analysis
- Engineer RAOP_specialization: raop_activity_ratio (RAOP comments+posts / total comments+posts)
- Create user_lifecycle_stage based on account_age and activity levels

### 5. CV Stability Validation (Critical for Confidence)
**Rationale**: Currently only seed=42 used. Need to verify 0.6253 is stable, not lucky.

**Specific implementations:**
- Run 5-fold CV with 5 different seeds: [42, 123, 456, 789, 101112]
- Report mean ± std across all 25 runs (5 seeds × 5 folds)
- Target stability: std ≤ 0.025 across seeds (indicates robust signal, not overfitting)
- If high variance (>0.03), investigate: reduce model complexity, increase regularization, check for outliers

**Expected outcome**: Mean CV ≥ 0.63 with std ≤ 0.03 confirms stable baseline before further investment.

### 6. Model Architecture Experiments (Expected +0.02-0.05 AUC)
**Rationale**: LightGBM is good but may benefit from hyperparameter tuning or alternative algorithms.

**Specific implementations:**
- **LightGBM tuning**: Test num_leaves [31, 63, 127], learning_rate [0.05, 0.03, 0.01], n_estimators [500, 1000]
- **CatBoost**: Try CatBoostClassifier - handles categorical features better, may capture different patterns
- **XGBoost**: Alternative gradient boosting implementation - different regularization, may add diversity
- **Logistic Regression with TF-IDF**: Baseline linear model - interpretable, may capture different signal
- **Neural Network**: Simple MLP on meta-features + TF-IDF - captures non-linear interactions

**Ensembling strategy**: Train 3-4 diverse models, blend predictions with simple averaging or weighted average based on CV scores.

### 7. Advanced NLP (Future Iteration - Expected +0.04-0.08 AUC)
**Rationale**: Transformers capture semantic nuances that TF-IDF misses. This is medium-term after exhausting feature engineering.

**Specific implementations:**
- **DistilBERT fine-tuning**: Fast, lightweight transformer - fine-tune on request text (title + body)
- **RoBERTa-base**: Slightly larger, potentially better performance
- **DeBERTa-v3-small**: State-of-the-art small model - excellent for this size dataset
- **Ensemble with TF-IDF**: Combine transformer predictions with TF-IDF + LightGBM using stacking

**Resource note**: With 160GB RAM, can handle transformer fine-tuning safely. Start with DistilBERT (fastest).

## What NOT to Try
- ❌ Any _at_retrieval features (11 features) - confirmed post-outcome leakage
- ❌ requester_user_flair - post-outcome reward badges (shroom, PIF) - confirmed leakage
- ❌ giver_username_if_known - only known after pizza given - confirmed leakage
- ❌ Complex stacking before validating CV stability - need solid foundation first
- ❌ Heavy hyperparameter tuning before feature engineering - features matter more than parameters
- ❌ Transformer models before exhausting TF-IDF enhancements - TF-IDF is faster and may capture most signal

## Validation Notes
- **CV scheme**: 5-fold stratified CV with 5 different seeds for stability validation
- **Target stability**: std ≤ 0.025 across seeds (robust signal)
- **Target improvement**: +0.03-0.08 AUC from enhanced features (0.655-0.705 range)
- **Confidence level**: High - analysis shows clear lift signals from keyword frequency and temporal patterns
- **Memory available**: 160GB RAM - can safely scale TF-IDF to 15000+ features and try transformer models
- **Next checkpoint**: After implementing enhanced features and validating CV stability, expect CV ≥ 0.65

**Critical success metrics:**
1. Convert binary keywords to count features → Should see CV improvement from capturing intensity
2. Add temporal features (especially hour buckets) → Should capture 12-point lift seen in hour 14
3. Validate CV stability across seeds → Ensure 0.6253 is solid foundation, not lucky split
4. Target CV ≥ 0.65 before moving to transformers → Establish strong baseline with engineered features first

**Risk mitigation**: If CV doesn't improve with enhanced features, investigate: (1) Are new features properly engineered? (2) Is model complexity appropriate? (3) Are we overfitting with too many features? Reduce TF-IDF size or increase regularization if needed.
