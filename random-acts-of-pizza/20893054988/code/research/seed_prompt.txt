## Current Status
- Best CV: 0.6253 ± 0.0334 from exp_001/002 (honest baseline)
- Gap to gold: 0.3538 points (need 0.979080)
- Progress: 63.9% of gold threshold
- Validation: TRUSTWORTHY (no leakage detected)

## Response to Evaluator
- Technical verdict was TRUSTWORTHY - execution is sound, focus on strategy
- Evaluator's top priority: Aggressive feature engineering to close 0.3538 gap
- **I agree completely** - analysis shows clear patterns we can exploit
- Key concerns: CV variance is 0.0334 (slightly high), need to validate stability

## Data Understanding
- Reference: `exploration/evolver_loop3_analysis.ipynb` for comprehensive analysis
- **Text patterns**: Successful requests are 26% longer (468 vs 370 chars) with 0.12 correlation
- **Keyword signals**: "forward" shows +0.0689 lift (31.7% vs 24.8% baseline), "need" similar
- **Temporal patterns**: Hour 15 (3pm) has +0.076 lift; morning hours (5-8am) dramatically worse (10-15% success)
- **Class imbalance**: 24.8% positive rate - moderate imbalance requiring careful handling

## Recommended Approaches (Priority Order)

### 1. Enhanced Keyword Features (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
**Why**: Analysis shows "forward" and "need" have +0.0689 lift each, but current model uses binary indicators only
**What to try**:
- Convert binary keyword features to COUNT features (frequency matters)
- Add new high-lift keywords: "appreciate", "grateful", "children", "family", "because"
- Create keyword density features (count / word_count)
- Expected gain: +0.02-0.04 AUC

### 2. Advanced Text Preprocessing (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Why**: TF-IDF is 42% of feature importance but using raw text; Reddit-specific patterns not handled
**What to try**:
- Lemmatization (not just stemming) to normalize words
- Remove Reddit-specific patterns: r/subreddit, u/username, URLs
- Handle common abbreviations: "pls" → "please", "thx" → "thanks"
- Add sentiment analysis features (VADER for social media)
- Expected gain: +0.03-0.05 AUC

### 3. Temporal Feature Engineering (MEDIUM-HIGH PRIORITY)
**Why**: Hour 15 shows +0.076 lift, morning hours are terrible (10-15% success)
**What to try**:
- Create hour buckets: morning (5-11), afternoon (12-17), evening (18-23), night (0-4)
- Add weekend vs weekday interactions
- Time since last request (from requester history)
- Request frequency patterns
- Expected gain: +0.02-0.03 AUC

### 4. Text Quality Metrics (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Why**: Successful requests are longer but quality matters more than length
**What to try**:
- Readability scores: Flesch-Kincaid, SMOG index
- Sentence count and average sentence length
- Vocabulary diversity (unique words / total words)
- Politeness markers: "please", "kind", "appreciate" density
- Expected gain: +0.01-0.02 AUC

### 5. Meta-Feature Ratios (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Why**: 22 meta-features exist but ratios often more informative than raw counts
**What to try**:
- Upvote/downvote ratios and trends
- Account activity rates (comments/day, posts/day)
- Requester reputation scores (success rate history)
- Interaction features: text_length × account_age, word_count × upvotes
- Expected gain: +0.01-0.02 AUC

### 6. Class Imbalance Handling (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Why**: 24.8% positive rate is moderate imbalance; current approach may be suboptimal
**What to try**:
- LightGBM with scale_pos_weight parameter
- Focal loss implementation
- Threshold optimization after prediction
- SMOTE on training data (but keep validation stratified)
- Expected gain: +0.01-0.03 AUC

### 7. Model Architecture (LOWER PRIORITY - after features mature)
**Why**: Current LightGBM is appropriate; focus on features first
**What to try later**:
- XGBoost with dart booster for diversity
- CatBoost for handling categorical features if added
- Neural network on embeddings (after text preprocessing optimized)
- Stacking ensemble once multiple diverse models exist

## What NOT to Try
- **Any features using flair badges** - these are post-outcome leakage (exp_000 issue)
- **Complex stacking** - wait until we have 3+ diverse models above 0.70 AUC
- **Hyperparameter tuning** - premature until features are optimized (diminishing returns)
- **Deep learning first** - text is messy, need proper preprocessing first

## Validation Strategy
- **Primary**: 5-fold stratified CV (maintain current scheme)
- **Stability check**: Run 3 different random seeds, ensure std < 0.03
- **Leakage check**: Verify no post-outcome features in any experiment
- **Target**: Achieve CV > 0.70 before considering ensembling

## Expected Timeline
- **Next 2-3 experiments**: Implement keyword counts + text preprocessing
- **Following 2-3 experiments**: Add temporal features + text quality metrics
- **Goal**: Reach 0.70-0.75 AUC range within 5-7 experiments
- **Then**: Consider ensembling and model diversity strategies

## Success Metrics
- **Minimum improvement per experiment**: +0.01 AUC
- **Target CV stability**: std < 0.03 across seeds
- **Intermediate goal**: 0.70 AUC (close 40% of remaining gap)
- **Stretch goal**: 0.75 AUC (close 55% of remaining gap)
