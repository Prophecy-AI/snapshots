## What I Understood

The junior researcher implemented a baseline TF-IDF + LightGBM model with 5-fold stratified CV, engineering features from text and metadata. They achieved a perfect 1.0 CV AUC and identified that `flair_shroom` has 0.96 correlation with the target, dominating model importance (3199 vs next best at 442). They created a submission with predictions ranging 0.225-0.244.

## Technical Execution Assessment

**Validation**: Stratified K-Fold is appropriate for class imbalance, but the validation scheme is compromised by leakage.

**Leakage Risk**: **CRITICAL - Clear data leakage detected**. Investigation reveals:
- ALL 677 users with `flair_shroom` received pizza (100%)
- ALL 38 users with `flair_PIF` received pizza (100%)
- Combined: 715/2878 samples (24.8%) have perfect separation
- This matches exactly the positive class distribution

The flair is a **post-outcome reward** assigned AFTER users receive pizza, not a pre-outcome predictor. Using it is equivalent to using the target as a feature.

**Score Integrity**: The perfect 1.0 AUC is **meaningless** - it's entirely driven by leakage, not predictive signal. The model learned nothing useful.

**Code Quality**: Code runs correctly with proper CV setup, class imbalance handling (scale_pos_weight), and reproducible seeds. However, silent failure occurred: no validation of feature legitimacy before modeling.

Verdict: **UNRELIABLE** - Results cannot be trusted. Submission will likely perform poorly on leaderboard.

## Strategic Assessment

**Approach Fit**: TF-IDF + LightGBM is reasonable for this problem, but the approach failed at feature validation - the most critical step.

**Effort Allocation**: Time was wasted building a model on leaked features. The perfect CV score should have been a red flag triggering investigation, not celebration.

**Assumptions**: The researcher assumed all available fields are legitimate pre-outcome features. This is dangerous in competitions where data often contains post-outcome fields.

**Blind Spots**:
- Didn't question why a feature would have 0.96 correlation (should be suspicious)
- Didn't investigate what "shroom" and "PIF" mean contextually (they're rewards)
- Didn't check for 100% separation patterns
- Didn't validate temporal legitimacy of features
- Didn't recognize that perfect scores in ML almost always mean leakage

**Trajectory**: This line of inquiry is a dead end. The model has zero predictive value for actual pizza requests.

## What's Working

- Solid experimental setup: proper CV, class imbalance handling, clean code
- Good feature engineering pipeline structure
- Correct identification of strong signals in EDA
- Reproducible with seeds set

## Key Concerns

1. **Catastrophic Data Leakage**: The flair features are post-outcome labels. This is like predicting lottery winners using "has winner's certificate" as a feature. The model learned to detect rewards, not predict success.

2. **Missed Red Flags**: Perfect CV score (1.0) should have triggered immediate investigation. In real-world ML, perfect scores are anomalies, not achievements.

3. **No Feature Validation**: Critical step missing - asking "what does this field represent and when is it available?"

## Top Priority for Next Experiment

**Remove all flair features and re-run baseline to get honest score**. Then:

1. **Validate feature legitimacy**: For each feature, confirm it's available BEFORE outcome
2. **Focus on legitimate signals**: Text content, writing style, sentiment, request timing, user history (pre-request), subreddit activity patterns
3. **Investigate text patterns**: What makes a successful request? Length, tone, keywords, storytelling?
4. **Engineer temporal features**: Time of day, day of week, account age (properly), user activity trends
5. **Target leakage-free CV score**: Likely much lower than 1.0, but it will be real

The junior researcher needs to develop stronger feature validation instincts. Always ask: "Could this feature only exist after the outcome?" When correlation is too good to be true, it usually is.
