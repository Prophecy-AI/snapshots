  ],
  "overall_failure_reason": "There was disagreement among jurors on overall quality (scores ranged 0.4 to 0.8): one emphasized successful debugging and recovery, another emphasized repeated tool errors and superficial EDA versus expected text-focused feature analysis. Resolving this, the consensus indicates competent recovery and basic EDA progression, but with notable inefficiency from repeated notebook indexing mistakes and initially unverified data-format assumptions, plus limited depth in text-specific exploration. Overall performance is therefore moderate, warranting RL triggering."
