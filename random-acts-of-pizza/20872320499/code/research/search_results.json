      "title": "ANSWER",
      "text": "Text classification of social\u2011media posts and Reddit requests benefits from a blend of classic lexical tricks and domain\u2011specific signals.  First, standard preprocessing\u2014removing stopwords, applying stemming or lemmatization, and generating count\u2011based vectors (Bag\u2011of\u2011Words, n\u2011grams, TF\u2011IDF)\u2014still provides a strong baseline for classical models such as Na\u00efve Bayes or linear SVMs and helps curb the high dimensionality of short, noisy posts\u202f([machinelearningmastery.com](https://machinelearningmastery.com/7-feature-engineering-tricks-for-text-data)).  Because social media text is littered with emojis, hashtags, user mentions, and URLs, tokenizers that treat these tokens specially (e.g., splitting or preserving hashtags, normalising URLs) improve representation quality; the RedditScore library even offers a \u201cCrazyTokenizer\u201d with Reddit\u2011 and Twitter\u2011specific options for this purpose\u202f([redditscore.readthedocs.io](https://redditscore.readthedocs.io/en/master)).  Adding character\u2011level n\u2011grams and handling elongated words further captures informal spelling variations common on these platforms.\n\nSecond, leveraging pretrained language models that have been exposed to social\u2011media corpora yields the biggest gains for modern deep\u2011learning pipelines.  Models such as BERTweet, SocBERT (trained on 929\u202fM Twitter and Reddit sequences), and other transformer\u2011based variants consistently outperform generic BERT on social\u2011media benchmarks\u202f([aclanthology.org](https://aclanthology.org/2023.insights-1.5)).  For low\u2011resource languages, monolingual BERT\u2011style models (e.g., PhoBERT for Vietnamese) still dominate multilingual ones, underscoring the value of domain\u2011specific pretraining\u202f([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10482)).  Fine\u2011tuning these models while feeding them the same lexical features (hashtags, mentions) as separate \u201cnon\u2011textual units\u201d (NTUs) can further boost performance; the NTU\u2011centric NTULM approach shows 2\u20135\u202f% relative improvements by co\u2011embedding metadata such as author IDs, timestamps, and hyperlinks alongside the text\u202f([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.10482.pdf)).\n\nFinally, combining textual embeddings with structured metadata\u2014subreddit name, post score, comment depth, or author karma\u2014creates a richer feature set for classifiers like fastText or shallow neural nets.  The RedditScore toolkit demonstrates a practical workflow: tokenize with Reddit\u2011aware rules, train a fastText model on the tokenized text, and optionally augment it with these auxiliary signals for higher accuracy\u202f([redditscore.readthedocs.io](https://redditscore.readthedocs.io/en/master)).  In practice, the most effective pipeline for Reddit or broader social\u2011media classification therefore stacks (1) careful cleaning and tokenization of platform\u2011specific symbols, (2) classic lexical vectors for baseline robustness, (3) domain\u2011pretrained transformer embeddings, and (4) engineered metadata features that capture the social context of each post.",

      "text": "### [Navigation](https://machinelearningmastery.com/machinelearningmastery.com\\#navigation)\n\nBy[Iv\u00e1n Palomares Carrascosa](https://machinelearningmastery.com/author/ivanpc/)onOctober 17, 2025in[Data Science](https://machinelearningmastery.com/category/data-science/)[0](https://machinelearningmastery.com/7-feature-engineering-tricks-for-text-data/#respond)\n\nShare _Post_Share\n\n7 Feature Engineering Tricks for Text Data\nImage by Editor\n\n## Introduction\n\nAn increasing number of AI and machine learning-based systems feed on **text data** \u2014 language models are a notable example today. However, it is essential to note that machines do not truly understand language but rather numbers. Put another way: some **feature engineering** steps are typically needed to turn raw text data into useful numeric data features that these systems can digest and perform inference upon.\n\nThis article presents seven easy-to-implement tricks for performing feature engineering on text data. Depending on the complexity and requirements of the specific model to feed your data to, you may require a more or less ambitious set of these tricks.\n\n- **Numbers 1 to 5** are typically used for classical machine learning dealing with text, including [decision-tree-based models](https://machinelearningmastery.com/making-sense-of-text-with-decision-trees/), for instance.\n- **Numbers 6 and 7** are indispensable for deep learning models like recurrent neural networks and transformers, although number 2 (stemming and lemmatization) might still be necessary to enhance these models\u2019 performance.\n\n## 1\\. Removing Stopwords\n\nStopword removal helps reduce dimensionality: something indispensable for certain models that may suffer the so-called curse of dimensionality. Common words that may predominantly add noise to your data, like articles, prepositions, and auxiliary verbs, are removed, thereby keeping only those that convey most of the semantics in the source text.\n\nHere\u2019s how to do it in just a few lines of code (you may simply replace `words` with a list of text chunked into words of your own). We\u2019ll use **[NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/)** for the English stopword list:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>6<br>7<br>8 | import nltk<br>nltk.download('stopwords')<br>from nltk.corpus import stopwords<br>words=\\[\"this\",\"is\",\"a\",\"crane\",\"with\",\"black\",\"feathers\",\"on\",\"its\",\"head\"\\]<br>stop\\_set=set(stopwords.words('english'))<br>filtered=\\[wforwinwords ifw.lower()notinstop\\_set\\]<br>print(filtered) |\n\n## 2\\. Stemming and Lemmatization\n\nReducing words to their root form can help merge variants (e.g., different tenses of a verb) into a unified feature. In deep learning models based on text embeddings, morphological aspects are usually captured, hence this step is rarely needed. However, when available data is very limited, it can still be useful because it alleviates sparsity and pushes the model to focus on core word meanings rather than assimilating redundant representations.\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1<br>2<br>3 | from nltk.stem import PorterStemmer<br>stemmer=PorterStemmer()<br>print(stemmer.stem(\"running\")) |\n\n## 3\\. Count-based Vectors: Bag of Words\n\nOne of the simplest approaches to turn text into numerical features in classical machine learning is the Bag of Words approach. It simply encodes word frequency into vectors. The result is a two-dimensional array of word counts describing simple baseline features: something advantageous for capturing the overall presence and relevance of words across documents, but limited because it fails to capture important aspects for understanding language like word order, context, or semantic relationships.\n\nStill, it might end up being a simple yet effective approach for not-too-complex text classification models, for instance. Using **[scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/)**:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1<br>2<br>3 | from sklearn.feature\\_extraction.text import CountVectorizer<br>cv=CountVectorizer()<br>print(cv.fit\\_transform(\\[\"dog bites man\",\"man bites dog\",\"crane astonishes man\"\\]).toarray()) |\n\n## 4\\. TF-IDF Feature Extraction\n\nTerm Frequency \u2014 Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) has long been one of natural language processing\u2019s cornerstone approaches. It goes a step beyond Bag of Words and accounts for the frequency of words and their overall relevance not only at the single text (document) level, but at the dataset level. For example, in a text dataset containing 200 pieces of text or documents, words that appear frequently in a specific, narrow subset of texts but overall appear in few texts out of the existing 200 are deemed highly relevant: this is the idea behind inverse frequency. As a result, unique and important words are given higher weight.\n\nBy applying it to the following small dataset containing three texts, each word in each text is assigned a TF-IDF importance weight between 0 and 1:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1<br>2<br>3 | from sklearn.feature\\_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer<br>tfidf=TfidfVectorizer()<br>print(tfidf.fit\\_transform(\\[\"dog bites man\",\"man bites dog\",\"crane astonishes man\"\\]).toarray()) |\n\n## 5\\. Sentence-based N-Grams\n\nSentence-based n-grams help capture the interaction between words, for instance, \u201cnew\u201d and \u201cyork.\u201d Using the `CountVectorizer` class from **[scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/)**, we can capture phrase-level semantics by setting the `ngram_range` parameter to incorporate sequences of multiple words. For instance, setting it to `(1,2)` creates features that are associated with both single words (unigrams) and combinations of two consecutive words (bigrams).\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1<br>2<br>3 | from sklearn.feature\\_extraction.text import CountVectorizer<br>cv=CountVectorizer(ngram\\_range=(1,2))<br>print(cv.fit\\_transform(\\[\"new york is big\",\"tokyo is even bigger\"\\]).toarray()) |\n\n## 6\\. Cleaning and Tokenization\n\nAlthough there exist plenty of specialized tokenization algorithms out there in Python libraries like **[Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index)**, the basic approach they are based on consists of removing punctuation, casing, and other symbols that downstream models may not understand. A simple cleaning and tokenization pipeline could consist of splitting text into words, lower-casing, and removing punctuation signs or other special characters. The result is a list of clean, normalized word units or tokens.\n\nThe `re` library for handling regular expressions can be used to build a simple tokenizer like this:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1<br>2<br>3<br>4 | import re<br>text=\"Hello, World!!!\"<br>tokens=re.findall(r'\\\\b\\\\w+\\\\b',text.lower())<br>print(tokens) |\n\n## 7\\. Dense Features: Word Embeddings\n\nFinally, one of the highlights and most powerful approaches to turn text into machine-readable information nowadays: word embeddings. They are great at capturing semantics, such as words with similar meaning, like \u2018shogun\u2019 and \u2018samurai\u2019, or \u2018aikido\u2019 and \u2018jiujitsu\u2019, which are encoded as numerically similar vectors (embeddings). In essence, words are mapped into a vector space using pre-defined approaches like Word2Vec or **[spaCy](https://spacy.io/)**:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5 | import spacy<br>\\# Use a spaCy model with vectors (e.g., \"en\\_core\\_web\\_md\")<br>nlp=spacy.load(\"en\\_core\\_web\\_md\")<br>vec=nlp(\"dog\").vector<br>print(vec\\[:5\\])\\# we only print a few dimensions of the dense embedding vector |\n\nThe output dimensionality of the embedding vector each word is transformed into is determined by the specific embedding algorithm and model used.\n\n## Wrapping Up\n\nThis article showcased seven useful tricks to make sense of raw text data when using it for machine learning and deep learning models that perform natural language processing tasks, such as text classification and summarization.\n\nShare _Post_Share\n\n### More On This Topic\n\n- [7 Pandas Tricks for Time-Series Feature Engineering](https://machinelearn...",

      "text": "[View PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.10482)\n\n> Abstract:Text classification is a typical natural language processing or computational linguistics task with various interesting applications. As the number of users on social media platforms increases, data acceleration promotes emerging studies on Social Media Text Classification (SMTC) or social media text mining on these valuable resources. In contrast to English, Vietnamese, one of the low-resource languages, is still not concentrated on and exploited thoroughly. Inspired by the success of the GLUE, we introduce the Social Media Text Classification Evaluation (SMTCE) benchmark, as a collection of datasets and models across a diverse set of SMTC tasks. With the proposed benchmark, we implement and analyze the effectiveness of a variety of multilingual BERT-based models (mBERT, XLM-R, and DistilmBERT) and monolingual BERT-based models (PhoBERT, viBERT, vELECTRA, and viBERT4news) for tasks in the SMTCE benchmark. Monolingual models outperform multilingual models and achieve state-of-the-art results on all text classification tasks. It provides an objective assessment of multilingual and monolingual BERT-based models on the benchmark, which will benefit future studies about BERTology in the Vietnamese language.\n\n## Submission history\n\nFrom: Luan Thanh Nguyen \\[ [view email](https://arxiv.org/show-email/9350f935/2209.10482)\\]\n\n**\\[v1\\]**\nWed, 21 Sep 2022 16:33:46 UTC (195 KB)",

Text classification\u2014an essential task in**Natural Language Processing (NLP)**\u2014helps automatically categorize text into predefined labels, making it easier to organize, filter, and analyze large volumes of information. From spam detection in emails to sentiment analysis on social media, text classification is everywhere.\nThis blog explores the core**techniques used in text classification**and their**real-world applications**across industries.\n#### **What is Text Classification?**\nText classification is the process of assigning categories or tags to text based on its content. It leverages machine learning and NLP to automate what would otherwise be a time-consuming manual task.\nSome popular examples include:\n* Marking emails as*spam*or*not spam*.\n* Categorizing customer reviews as*positive*,*neutral*, or*negative*.\n* Routing customer support queries to the right department.#### #### **Techniques in Text Classification**\n1. **Rule-Based Approaches**\n2. Early systems relied on hand-crafted rules like keyword matching and regular expressions. While simple, they lack scalability and adaptability.\n3. **Traditional Machine Learning Algorithms**\n* **Na\u00efve Bayes**: Based on Bayes\u2019 theorem, it\u2019s fast and effective for text classification tasks like spam detection.\n* **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: Finds the optimal decision boundary for classification. Great for high-dimensional text data.\n* **Logistic Regression**: Widely used for binary classification tasks.\n1. These models rely heavily on feature engineering, often using**Bag-of-Words**or**TF-IDF**to represent text.\n**Deep Learning Techniques**\n* **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: Capture local word patterns useful in sentiment analysis.\n* **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and LSTMs**: Model sequential dependencies in text, making them ideal for contextual analysis.\n1. **Transformers and Pre-Trained Models**\n* **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)**and**GPT-based models**have revolutionized text classification. They understand context more effectively than traditional models and can be fine-tuned for specific tasks.\n* These models eliminate the need for extensive manual feature engineering.\n1. **Unsupervised &amp; Semi-Supervised Techniques**\n* **Topic Modeling (LDA, NMF)**: Groups text into topics without labeled data.\n* **Self-training and Transfer Learning**: Allow effective use of limited labeled datasets.#### #### **Use Cases of Text Classification**\n1. **Spam Detection**\n2. One of the earliest applications of text classification, spam filters use algorithms like Na\u00efve Bayes to block unwanted emails while letting genuine messages through.\n3. **Sentiment Analysis**\n4. Businesses use sentiment analysis to understand customer opinions on products, services, or brands. Social media monitoring platforms leverage this technique to track brand reputation.\n5. **Customer Support Automation**\n6. AI-powered chatbots and support systems classify queries into categories, such as billing, technical support, or account issues, and route them to the right department.\n7. **News Categorization**\n8. News outlets classify articles into categories such as sports, politics, or entertainment, enabling better content organization and personalized recommendations.\n9. **Healthcare**\n10. Text classification helps process medical records, categorize patient notes, and even detect early signs of diseases through clinical text mining.\n11. **E-commerce**\n12. Online retailers classify product reviews by sentiment and categorize product descriptions for improved search and recommendation engines.\n13. **Legal Industry**\n14. Large volumes of legal documents can be automatically classified into contracts, case laws, or compliance documents for faster retrieval and analysis.#### #### **Challenges in Text Classification**\n* **Ambiguity in Language**: Words may carry different meanings depending on context.\n* **Data Imbalance**: Some classes may have fewer examples, leading to biased models.\n* **Domain-Specific Vocabulary**: Models trained on general datasets may perform poorly in specialized domains like law or medicine.\n* **Scalability**: Handling billions of text documents efficiently requires robust infrastructure.#### #### **Future of Text Classification**\nWith advances in transformers and generative AI, text classification will continue to evolve.

      "text": "<div><div><div><a href=\"https://medium.com/@jangdaehan1?source=post_page---byline--5611f37fca49---------------------------------------\"><div><p></p></div></a></div><p>In the vast and rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence (AI), one of the most prominent and transformative branches is machine learning (ML), particularly the supervised learning paradigm. Among the myriad applications of supervised learning, text classification stands out as a pivotal task that intertwines language processing with algorithmic sophistication. As businesses and organizations grapple with vast amounts of textual data, understanding the nuances of text classification has become crucial. This article unpacks the intricate components of text classification, examining its methodologies, real-world applications, challenges, and future directions.</p></div><div><h2>Understanding Text Classification</h2><p>Text classification is the process of assigning predefined categories or tags to text data. This task is fundamental in natural language processing (NLP) and can be defined as a supervised learning problem where input features (text) are mapped to discrete outputs (labels). The objective is to build a model that can accurately predict the category of new, unseen text based on the training data it has observed.</p><h2>Key Terminology</h2><ul><li><strong>Supervised Learning:</strong> A machine learning approach where models learn from labeled data, meaning that each training sample is paired with an output label.</li><li><strong>Features:</strong> Measurable properties or characteristics of the input data. In text classification, features might include the occurrence of words, phrases, or even more complex linguistic traits.</li><li><strong>Labels:</strong> Predefined categories used to annotate the training data, such as \u2018spam\u2019 or \u2018not spam\u2019 in email classification.</li><li><strong>Training Data:</strong> The dataset used to train the model, comprising input features and their corresponding labels.</li><li><strong>Model Evaluation:</strong> Techniques used to assess the performance of a trained model, which can include metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.</li></ul><h2>Classification Techniques in Text Classification</h2><p>Text classification can be approached using various algorithms, each with unique strengths, weaknesses, and operational mechanisms. Broadly, these can be categorized into traditional machine learning algorithms and contemporary deep learning methods.</p><h2>Traditional Machine Learning Approaches</h2><p>Traditional approaches for text classification leverage statistical and algorithmic foundations, often relying on feature engineering. Some of the most common algorithms include:</p><ul><li><strong>Naive Bayes Classifier:</strong> A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes\u2019 theorem, assuming independence among predictors. Despite its simplicity, it often performs impressively on text classification tasks due to the high-dimensional nature of text data. The decision rule is based on maximizing the posterior probability:</li></ul><pre><span>P(C|X) = (P(X|C) * P(C)) / P(X)</span></pre><ul><li><strong>Support Vector Machines (SVM):</strong> A powerful classifier that operates by finding a hyperplane that best divides a dataset into two classes. In text classification, SVMs can handle high-dimensional spaces efficiently, making them suitable for large feature sets.</li><li><strong>Decision Trees:</strong> Constructed by splitting data based on feature values, decision trees can model complex decision boundaries through hierarchical structures.</li><li><strong>Random Forests:</strong> An ensemble learning technique that constructs multiple decision trees during training and merges their outcomes to improve robustness and generalizability.</li></ul><h2>Deep Learning Techniques</h2><p>With advancements in neural networks, deep learning has revolutionized text classification through the leveraging of vast amounts of unstructured text. Key methodologies include:</p><ul><li><strong>Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN):</strong> RNNs excel in processing sequential data due to their feedback loops, making them suitable for language modeling and sequence prediction. LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) architectures enhance RNNs\u2019 capabilities by addressing the vanishing gradient problem, allowing models to learn long-range dependencies.</li><li><strong>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN):</strong> Initially designed for image processing, CNNs have proved effective for text classification by treating sentences as one-dimensional data. They capture local patterns with convolutional layers, making them adept at identifying key phrases in a sentence.</li><li><strong>Transformers:</strong> This architecture, exemplified by models such as BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), has propelled NLP forward. Transformers rely on self-attention mechanisms to analyze contextual relationships between words, resulting in highly sophisticated representations that enhance classification accuracy.</li></ul><h2>Real-World Applications of Text Classification</h2><p>Text classification encompasses a wealth of real-world applications across industries. Below are notable cases illustrating its significance:</p><h2>1. Email Filtering</h2><p>Email service providers implement text classification to filter spam and categorize emails effectively.

According to Statista, over 50% of global email traffic is spam, emphasizing the necessity of robust classification to mitigate this issue.</p><h2>2. Sentiment Analysis</h2><p>Businesses leverage text classification to analyze customer feedback and social media interactions, classifying sentiments as positive, negative, or neutral. A notable example is the case of Netflix, which uses sentiment analysis on user reviews to improve recommendations and content creation, driving user satisfaction and engagement.</p><h2>3. Medical Diagnosis</h2><p>Text classification is becoming increasingly vital in the healthcare sector, where patient records and research articles are examined for disease classification or symptom identification. IBM Watson Health employs sophisticated NLP models to assist physicians in diagnosing diseases based on patient notes, showcasing the tangible benefits of this technology in clinical settings.</p><h2>Challenges and Considerations</h2><p>While text classification offers significant benefits, it is not without challenges. Among the primary issues are:</p><h2>1. Data Quality and Quantity</h2><p>The success of supervised learning models largely hinges on the quality and quantity of labeled data. Insufficient or biased datasets can lead to overfitting, where models perform poorly on new data. Strategies to mitigate this include augmenting datasets or applying transfer learning techniques from pre-trained models.</p><h2>2. Context Understanding</h2><p>Text classification models may struggle with context-sensitive meanings or idiomatic expressions in language. Advanced models such as BERT and GPT leverage extensive pre-training on diverse corpora to develop an understanding of context, yet challenges remain in specialized domains.</p><h2>3. Computational Requirements</h2><p>Deep learning models often demand significant computational resources, particularly in terms of training time and hardware. This can impose barriers for smaller organizations or individual researchers. Techniques such as model distillation and pruning can help in deploying less resource-intensive versions of these models without significantly compromising performance.</p><h2>Future Directions and Emerging Trends</h2><p>The field of text classification is in constant flux due to ongoing research and technological advancements.

NLP focuses on enabling machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language, which ultimately helps bridge the gap between humans and computers.\n### **Importance of Entity Recognition and Text Classification in NLP**\nEntity recognition and text classification are important tasks in natural language processing (NLP) because they help to extract relevant information from unstructured textual data, which can be used to improve various applications, such as search engines, chatbots, and recommendation systems.\nEntity recognition involves identifying and classifying named entities such as people, organizations, locations, dates, and other types of entities in text. This is important because it can help to extract important information from text and make it more usable for downstream applications. For example, if you&#x27;re building a recommendation system for a bookstore, you might want to extract the names of authors, book titles, and other relevant entities from customer reviews to help inform your recommendations.\n[Text classification involves categorizing text](https://kili-technology.com/data-labeling/creating-a-dataset-of-tweets)into predefined categories or classes. This is important because it can help to organize and filter large volumes of text, making it more manageable for further analysis. For example, if you&#x27;re analyzing customer feedback for a product, you might want to classify the feedback into positive, negative, or neutral categories to help identify common themes and areas for improvement.\n## **Fundamentals of Entity Recognition**\n### Definition and Importance of Entity Recognition\nEntity recognition, also known as named entity recognition (NER), is a process that identifies and categorizes real-world objects, or &quot;entities,&quot; within a text. These entities can include names of people, organizations, locations, and more. By accurately recognizing entities, machines can better understand the context of a given text and perform more complex tasks.\n![text-entity-recognition](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/68da32b2041c593b0511a582/68f82042cf75a82a9ed6ef3c_text-entity-recognition.webp)\n### Types Of Entities: Named, Nominal, and Pronominal\nEntities can be classified into three main types: named, nominal, and pronominal. Named entities are proper nouns, such as &quot;New York City&quot; or &quot;Apple Inc.&quot; Nominal entities are common nouns, like &quot;car&quot; or &quot;dog,&quot; while pronominal entities are pronouns that refer to other entities, such as &quot;he&quot; or &quot;she.\u201d\n### Popular Techniques for Entity Recognition\n1. **1. Rule-based methods:**These methods rely on handcrafted rules and patterns, often using regular expressions, to identify entities in a text.\n2. **2. Supervised learning:**In this approach, a model is trained on a labeled dataset, learning to recognize entities based on features extracted from the text.\n3. **3. Unsupervised learning:**These methods cluster similar words or phrases together, identifying entities without the need for labeled data.\n4. **4. Hybrid methods:**Combining rule-based and machine learning techniques, hybrid methods aim to leverage the strengths of both approaches.### Evaluating Entity Recognition Models: Precision, Recall, and F1-score\nPrecision, recall, and F1-score are commonly used metrics to evaluate entity recognition models. Here&#x27;s how they are defined:\n1. 1. Precision: Precision is the number of true positive (TP) entities detected by the model divided by the total number of entities detected by the model (true positive + false positive). Precision measures the proportion of entities that the model correctly identified among all the entities it identified. A high precision score means that the model is accurate in identifying entities.\n1. *Precision = TP / (TP + FP)*\n1. 2. Recall: Recall is the number of true positive entities detected by the model divided by the total number of true positive entities in the data. Recall measures the proportion of entities that the model correctly identified among all the entities that were present in the data. A high recall score means that the model is able to identify most of the entities.\n*Recall = TP / (TP + FN)*\n1. 3. F1-score: F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. It provides a balance between precision and recall and is often used as a single summary metric to evaluate entity recognition models. A high F1-score means that the model is performing well in terms of both precision and recall.\n*F1-score = 2 \u00a0(precision \u00a0recall) / (precision + recall)*\nTo evaluate an entity recognition model using these metrics, you need to have a labeled dataset (i.e., a dataset where the entities are annotated). Then, you can run your model on this dataset and compare the[predicted entities](https://kili-technology.com/data-labeling/understand-predictive-model-through-topological-analysis-of-the-dataset-and-kili-technology)with the labeled entities. You can calculate precision, recall, and F1-score using the formulas mentioned above. A high precision, recall, and F1-score are desirable for a good entity recognition model.\n## Fundamentals of Text Classification\n### Definition and Importance of Text Classification\nText classification is the process of assigning predefined categories, or &quot;labels,&quot; to a given text based on its content. This technique is essential for tasks like sentiment analysis, spam detection, and topic categorization.\n### Common Applications: Sentiment Analysis, Topic Categorization, and Spam Detection\n1. **1. Sentiment analysis:**This involves determining the sentiment or emotion expressed in a text, such as positive, negative, or neutral.\n2. **2. Topic categorization:**This task consists of assigning a text to one or more predefined topics or categories.\n3. **3. Spam detection:**Identifying and filtering out unwanted or malicious messages, such as spam emails or comments.### Popular Techniques for Text Classification\n1. **1. ...",

Techniques for Text Classification serve as the key component of this procedure.\nText categorisation exhibits a wide range of potentialities, including sentiment analysis skills, subject labelling features, and spam detection features. This article provides a thorough discussion of the traditional and modern methods used to create sophisticated text categorisation systems.\nWhat is Text Classification?\nA process that applies predetermined categories or labels to textual material is produced by text categorisation. Document tagging, sentiment analysis, email screening, and other duties are made possible by an automated system that sorts and manages content using language understanding capabilities. Text categorisation, which gives text data predetermined classifications, enhances user experience and organisational operational efficiency.\nWhy Understand Different Techniques?\nBased on the intended application scenario, different text classification techniques must be used. The quantity of the project data determines the model's complexity; small datasets can be used with simple models, whereas large NLP applications need deep learning capabilities.\u00a0\u00a0Comprehending the distinct benefits and drawbacks of the various methods enables users to make choices that yield better results.\nTraditional Machine Learning Techniques\nEarlier machine-learning techniques created the basic framework for textual classification. Because these processes preserve simple implementation and interpretation techniques, they perform well in scenarios involving limited data and rapid prototyping. Although deep learning technology has gained prominence, conventional approaches still yield notable outcomes in real-world applications.\nCTA:\nStart Your Text Classification Project Today\nDiscover how our experts at Rapidise can help implement the best classification models tailored to your business.\n[Contact Us](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https://rapidise.co/contact/&amp;urlhash=QuP6&amp;trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_little-text-block)\nDeep Learning Techniques\nThrough deep learning the process of natural language processing became more human-like since machines acquired advanced text interpretation capabilities. Through these Text Classification Techniques, computers acquire hierarchical and contextual patterns without manual input from human beings.\nWord Embeddings\n* Explanation:The representation of words through dense vectors allows researchers to embed them into lower-dimensional continuous spaces. The developed vectors show semantic links because words with matching meanings end up nearer to one another throughout the vector domain.\n* Popular Techniques:Three popular methods used to generate static embeddings from large corpora consist of Word2Vec, GloVe and FastText.\n* Key Components:The word embedding system includes an embedding matrix that can be learned or pre-trained as well as a context window setting and training protocols that use skip-gram or CBOW.\n* Advantages:Models benefit from these methods because they minimize the dimensions lower than sparse BoW vectors while preserving semantic relationships for better performance.\n* Disadvantages:Static embedding systems provide a single vector value to words, which hinders their functionality with words that possess multiple meanings.\n* Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)\n* Explanation:RNNS operate with sequential data by storing information about previous input data; therefore, they are optimal for detecting relationships between words across sentences.\n* Popular Techniques:LSTM and GRU networks operate as enhanced models that handle problems linked to vanishing gradients.\n* Key Components:RNNS consist of memory cells as well as hidden states, together with gates, which are found in LSTM/GRU that manage sequence information propagation.\n* Advantages:LSTM has proven its excellence in processing sequences when word arrangement plays an important role, such as sentiment analysis and named entity recognition.\n* Disadvantages:Long texts increase computational requirements and make parallelisation complicated because these networks follow a sequential processing order.\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNS)\n* Explanation:The main purpose of CNNS was image processing, but they work effectively with text by applying convolution fil...",
