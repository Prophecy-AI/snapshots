Applied stratified 5-fold CV with class imbalance handling (scale_pos_weight=3.03). Engineered features: text lengths, temporal features, user activity ratios, and interaction terms. Overall OOF AUC: 0.6498, Mean CV AUC: 0.6729 \u00b1 0.0293. Key findings: text length features (text_length, title_length) and temporal features (unix_timestamp_of_request) were most important. RAOP-specific activity features showed moderate importance. Model shows reasonable performance but has room for improvement with text embeddings and more sophisticated feature engineering.",

      "query": "What are winning approaches for text classification with tabular meta-data on Kaggle?",
      "finding": "Winning Kaggle solutions for text\u2011classification problems that also contain tabular meta\u2011data usually treat the dataset as **multimodal** and combine a pretrained language model with strong gradient\u2011boosting tabular learners.  AutoGluon\u2019s Tabular\u202fPredictor makes this straightforward: raw text columns are fed to a built\u2011in\u202fTextPredictor (a BERT\u2011style encoder) while numeric and categorical columns are handled by LightGBM, CatBoost or Random\u202fForest; the framework then automatically stacks or ensembles the heterogeneous models for the final prediction\u202f([auto.gluon.ai](https://auto.gluon.ai/0.7.0/tutorials/tabular_prediction/tabular-multimodal-text-others.html)).  \n\nA common \u201ctwo\u2011stage\u201d pipeline follows the same idea. First, a transformer (e.g., BERT, Sentence\u2011BERT, or any LLM) converts each text field into a dense embedding. Those embeddings are then concatenated with engineered tabular features (target\u2011encoded categories, interaction terms, etc.) and supplied to a gradient\u2011boosting model ",

      "query": "How do Kaggle winners handle moderate class imbalance in binary classification with 25% positive rate?",
      "finding": "Based on the strategies shared by Kaggle competition winners and the community discussions on handling imbalanced binary targets (\u2248\u202f25\u202f% positives), the most common workflow is:\n\n1. **Choose a metric that reflects the minority class** \u2013 switch from plain accuracy to AUC\u2011ROC, PR\u2011AUC, or a custom loss that penalises false\u2011negatives/false\u2011positives according to the problem. This ensures the model is rewarded for correctly identifying the 25\u202f% positive cases.\u202f([Unbalanced data and cross\u2011validation | Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/discussions/questions-and-answers/27589))  \n\n2. **Apply class\u2011weighting or cost\u2011sensitive learning** \u2013 many winning solutions pass the class frequencies to the algorithm (e.g., `class_weight='balanced'` in scikit\u2011learn, or custom loss weighting) so the minority class contributes more to the loss.\u202f([Binary classification with strongly unbalanced classes | Stats.SE](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/235808))  \n\n3. **Resample the training data**  \n   - **Unde",

      "query": "What text feature engineering techniques work best for social media posts and Reddit requests classification?",
      "finding": "Text classification of social\u2011media posts and Reddit requests benefits from a blend of classic lexical tricks and domain\u2011specific signals.  First, standard preprocessing\u2014removing stopwords, applying stemming or lemmatization, and generating count\u2011based vectors (Bag\u2011of\u2011Words, n\u2011grams, TF\u2011IDF)\u2014still provides a strong baseline for classical models such as Na\u00efve Bayes or linear SVMs and helps curb the high dimensionality of short, noisy posts\u202f([machinelearningmastery.com](https://machinelearningmastery.com/7-feature-engineering-tricks-for-text-data)).  Because social media text is littered with emojis, hashtags, user mentions, and URLs, tokenizers that treat these tokens specially (e.g., splitting or preserving hashtags, normalising URLs) improve representation quality; the RedditScore library even offers a \u201cCrazyTokenizer\u201d with Reddit\u2011 and Twitter\u2011specific options for this purpose\u202f([redditscore.readthedocs.io](https://redditscore.readthedocs.io/en/master)).

      "query": "How do Kaggle winners handle text data leakage when training data contains edited posts with outcome information?",
      "finding": "Kaggle winners typically neutralize text\u2011data leakage by first **detecting** any parts of the posts that directly reveal the target (e.g., edited \u201coutcome\u201d notes) and then **removing or neutralizing** that information before modeling. The common workflow is:\n\n1. **Identify leaky signals** \u2013 Scan the text columns for strings that are highly correlated with the label (e.g., \u201cedited because \u2026\u201d, \u201cremoved for \u2026\u201d). Kaggle notebooks on data leakage suggest using simple frequency\u2011or\u2011correlation checks to flag such columns or substrings as potential leaky predictors ([Kaggle\u202fData\u2011Leakage\u202fNotebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/dansbecker/data-leakage)).\n\n2. **Strip outcome\u2011specific fragments** \u2013 Apply regex or rule\u2011based cleaning to delete the edited\u2011post annotations (e.g., anything after \u201c[edited]\u201d, \u201c[removed]\u201d, or moderator comments). This ensures the model only sees the original content.\n\n3. **Distill the text** \u2013 When the leakage is embedded in the language itself (the text carries treatment ",
