      "query": "What are winning approaches for text classification with tabular meta-data on Kaggle?",
      "finding": "Winning Kaggle solutions for text\u2011classification problems that also contain tabular meta\u2011data usually treat the dataset as **multimodal** and combine a pretrained language model with strong gradient\u2011boosting tabular learners.  AutoGluon\u2019s Tabular\u202fPredictor makes this straightforward: raw text columns are fed to a built\u2011in\u202fTextPredictor (a BERT\u2011style encoder) while numeric and categorical columns are handled by LightGBM, CatBoost or Random\u202fForest; the framework then automatically stacks or ensembles the heterogeneous models for the final prediction\u202f([auto.gluon.ai](https://auto.gluon.ai/0.7.0/tutorials/tabular_prediction/tabular-multimodal-text-others.html)).  \n\nA common \u201ctwo\u2011stage\u201d pipeline follows the same idea. First, a transformer (e.g., BERT, Sentence\u2011BERT, or any LLM) converts each text field into a dense embedding. Those embeddings are then concatenated with engineered tabular features (target\u2011encoded categories, interaction terms, etc.) and supplied to a gradient\u2011boosting model ",

      "query": "How do Kaggle winners handle moderate class imbalance in binary classification with 25% positive rate?",
      "finding": "Based on the strategies shared by Kaggle competition winners and the community discussions on handling imbalanced binary targets (\u2248\u202f25\u202f% positives), the most common workflow is:\n\n1. **Choose a metric that reflects the minority class** \u2013 switch from plain accuracy to AUC\u2011ROC, PR\u2011AUC, or a custom loss that penalises false\u2011negatives/false\u2011positives according to the problem. This ensures the model is rewarded for correctly identifying the 25\u202f% positive cases.\u202f([Unbalanced data and cross\u2011validation | Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/discussions/questions-and-answers/27589))  \n\n2. **Apply class\u2011weighting or cost\u2011sensitive learning** \u2013 many winning solutions pass the class frequencies to the algorithm (e.g., `class_weight='balanced'` in scikit\u2011learn, or custom loss weighting) so the minority class contributes more to the loss.\u202f([Binary classification with strongly unbalanced classes | Stats.SE](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/235808))  \n\n3. **Resample the training data**  \n   - **Unde",
