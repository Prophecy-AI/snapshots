      "finding": "Winning Kaggle solutions for text\u2011classification problems that also contain tabular meta\u2011data usually treat the dataset as **multimodal** and combine a pretrained language model with strong gradient\u2011boosting tabular learners.  AutoGluon\u2019s Tabular\u202fPredictor makes this straightforward: raw text columns are fed to a built\u2011in\u202fTextPredictor (a BERT\u2011style encoder) while numeric and categorical columns are handled by LightGBM, CatBoost or Random\u202fForest; the framework then automatically stacks or ensembles the heterogeneous models for the final prediction\u202f([auto.gluon.ai](https://auto.gluon.ai/0.7.0/tutorials/tabular_prediction/tabular-multimodal-text-others.html)).  \n\nA common \u201ctwo\u2011stage\u201d pipeline follows the same idea. First, a transformer (e.g., BERT, Sentence\u2011BERT, or any LLM) converts each text field into a dense embedding. Those embeddings are then concatenated with engineered tabular features (target\u2011encoded categories, interaction terms, etc.) and supplied to a gradient\u2011boosting model ",
