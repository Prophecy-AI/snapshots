      "finding": "Winning Kaggle solutions for text classification often treat the accompanying metadata (e.g., author, timestamp, country, gender, device) as a first\u2011class source of supervision rather than an after\u2011thought.  The\u202fMETA\u202fframework showed that organizing text and its heterogeneous metadata into a \u201ctext\u2011rich network\u201d and extracting high\u2011quality\u202fseed motifs\u202ffrom this graph can generate powerful weak labels that bootstrap a classifier and iteratively expand both seed words and seed motifs\u202f([arXiv\u202f2020](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.01808v1.pdf)).  In practice this means encoding each metadata type (categorical or numeric) with appropriate embeddings or target\u2011encoding, then feeding the resulting vectors into the same model that processes the text\u2014either by concatenating them to the final hidden state of a transformer (BERT, ULMFiT) or by passing them through dedicated \u201cmetadata blocks\u201d that are jointly trained with the text encoder\u202f([MESSAGENET\u202f2023](https://export.arxiv.org/pdf/2301.01808v1.pdf)",
