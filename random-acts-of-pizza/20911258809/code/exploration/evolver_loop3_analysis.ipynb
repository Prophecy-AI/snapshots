    "## Key Findings from exp_003\n",
    "- Character n-grams dominate feature importance (4 of top 10 features)\n",
    "- Feature selection worked: 3,000 features better than 10,000\n",
    "- Removed stop words to keep domain vocabulary\n",
    "- CV improved from 0.6217 → 0.6555 (+0.0338)\n",
    "- Low variance (±0.0104) indicates stable model"
