      "finding": "Winning Kaggle text\u2011classification solutions rarely rely on raw text alone; they augment high\u2011dimensional text vectors (e.g., TF\u2011IDF, hash\u2011trick embeddings, or pre\u2011trained word\u2011/sentence\u2011embeddings) with a set of engineered meta\u2011features that capture properties of each document such as length, punctuation count, presence of URLs or emojis, and any available categorical identifiers. These combined feature matrices are then fed into powerful gradient\u2011boosting models\u2014most notably XGBoost, which has a strong track record on large\u2011scale text tasks and can easily handle a mix of sparse and dense inputs ([Medium \u2013 XGBoost for text classification](https://medium.com/@gaurishah143/xg-boost-for-text-classification-9c8b1f8f24aa)).  \n\nPractitioners also use simple linear baselines (logistic regression with the hash trick) as a fast way to incorporate both hashed text n\u2011grams and meta\u2011features, often improving them with an adaptive learning rate before stacking or blending with deeper neural models",
