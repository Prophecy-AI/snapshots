      "query": "What are winning approaches for text classification competitions on Kaggle that combine text features with meta-features?",
      "finding": "Winning Kaggle text\u2011classification solutions rarely rely on raw text alone; they augment high\u2011dimensional text vectors (e.g., TF\u2011IDF, hash\u2011trick embeddings, or pre\u2011trained word\u2011/sentence\u2011embeddings) with a set of engineered meta\u2011features that capture properties of each document such as length, punctuation count, presence of URLs or emojis, and any available categorical identifiers. These combined feature matrices are then fed into powerful gradient\u2011boosting models\u2014most notably XGBoost, which has a strong track record on large\u2011scale text tasks and can easily handle a mix of sparse and dense inputs ([Medium \u2013 XGBoost for text classification](https://medium.com/@gaurishah143/xg-boost-for-text-classification-9c8b1f8f24aa)).  \n\nPractitioners also use simple linear baselines (logistic regression with the hash trick) as a fast way to incorporate both hashed text n\u2011grams and meta\u2011features, often improving them with an adaptive learning rate before stacking or blending with deeper neural models",

      "query": "How do Kaggle winners handle class imbalance in binary classification with around 25% positive rate?",
      "finding": "Based on the tips distilled from several Kaggle competition post\u2011mortems and the Kaggle discussion on handling imbalanced data, winners typically follow a short, repeatable workflow when the positive class makes up only about\u202f25\u202f% of the rows ([Neptune blog](https://neptune.ai/blog/tabular-data-binary-classification-tips-and-tricks-from-5-kaggle-competitions);\u202f[Unbalanced data and cross\u2011validation](https://www.kaggle.com/discussions/questions-and-answers/27589)):\n\n1. **Preserve the class ratio in validation** \u2013 split the data with stratified (or group\u2011aware) cross\u2011validation so each fold keeps the ~25\u202f% positive rate, ensuring the model is evaluated on the true imbalance.  \n\n2. **Add class\u2011level weighting** \u2013 tell the learner to \u201cpay more attention\u201d to the minority class (e.g., `class_weight='balanced'` in scikit\u2011learn, `scale_pos_weight` in XGBoost, or explicit sample\u2011weight vectors). This directly compensates for the 3\u2011to\u20111 imbalance without altering the data. ([Unbalanced data and c",

      "query": "What text preprocessing and feature engineering techniques work best for Reddit posts and social media text classification on Kaggle?",
      "finding": "Text classification on Reddit and other social\u2011media platforms benefits from a preprocessing pipeline that first normalises the highly informal, noisy language and then extracts both lexical and meta\u2011features that capture the platform\u2011specific signals.  A common first step is to strip or replace URLs, user mentions (`u/\u2026`), subreddit tags (`r/\u2026`), HTML entities and markdown, then lower\u2011case the text and expand common contractions.  Specialized tokenisers such as **CrazyTokenizer** from the\u202fRedditScore library provide Reddit\u2011 and Twitter\u2011aware options for handling hashtags, emojis, and emoticons out\u2011of\u2011the\u2011box, which helps preserve sentiment\u2011bearing symbols while still producing clean tokens\u202f([redditscore](https://redditscore.readthedocs.io/en/master)).  After tokenisation, most Kaggle solutions apply standard NLP cleaning \u2013 stop\u2011word removal, optional lemmatisation or stemming, and removal of very short or non\u2011alphabetic tokens \u2013 as demonstrated in the Reddit\u2011Classification project tha",
