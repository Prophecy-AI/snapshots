      "text": "Winning Kaggle text\u2011classification solutions rarely rely on raw text alone; they augment high\u2011dimensional text vectors (e.g., TF\u2011IDF, hash\u2011trick embeddings, or pre\u2011trained word\u2011/sentence\u2011embeddings) with a set of engineered meta\u2011features that capture properties of each document such as length, punctuation count, presence of URLs or emojis, and any available categorical identifiers. These combined feature matrices are then fed into powerful gradient\u2011boosting models\u2014most notably XGBoost, which has a strong track record on large\u2011scale text tasks and can easily handle a mix of sparse and dense inputs ([Medium \u2013 XGBoost for text classification](https://medium.com/@gaurishah143/xg-boost-for-text-classification-9c8b1f8f24aa)).  \n\nPractitioners also use simple linear baselines (logistic regression with the hash trick) as a fast way to incorporate both hashed text n\u2011grams and meta\u2011features, often improving them with an adaptive learning rate before stacking or blending with deeper neural models. The \u201cAll Tips and Tricks\u201d guide distilled from several top Kaggle competitions emphasizes this hybrid strategy\u2014pairing efficient text preprocessing with extra numeric descriptors and then training ensembles (e.g., LightGBM/XGBoost + neural nets) to squeeze out the last few leaderboard points ([Neptune blog \u2013 Text Classification tips from 5 Kaggle competitions](https://neptune.ai/blog/text-classification-tips-and-tricks-kaggle-competitions)).

In the context of text classification, each tree takes a set of features extracted from the text document as input and outputs a predicted class label. XGBoost then trains multiple trees on the training data and aggregates their predictions to produce the final prediction for each text document.*\nOne of the advantages of XGBoost is that it can handle large amounts of data and can be run on parallel computing systems, making it a fast and efficient algorithm for text classification. Additionally, XGBoost also supports various regularization techniques to prevent overfitting, which is a common problem in text classification due to the large number of features often present in text data.\nTo implement XGBoost for text classification, the first step is to preprocess the text data and extract meaningful features from it, such as term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) values. These features are then used as input to the XGBoost model, which is trained on the preprocessed data. Finally, the trained model can be used to predict the class label for new text documents.\nHere is a simple example of how to use XGBoost for text classification in Python:\n```\nimport xgboost as xgb\nfrom sklearn.feature\\_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer\nfrom sklearn.model\\_selection import train\\_test\\_split\nfrom sklearn.metrics import accuracy\\_score\n# Text data and labels\ntexts = [...]\nlabels = [...]\n# Split the data into train and test sets\ntexts\\_train, texts\\_test, labels\\_train, labels\\_test = train\\_test\\_split(texts, labels, test\\_size=0.2, random\\_state=42)\n# Convert text data into numerical features using TF-IDF\nvectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()\nX\\_train = vectorizer.fit\\_transform(texts\\_train)\nX\\_test = vectorizer.transform(texts\\_test)\n# Train the XGBoost model\nmodel = xgb.XGBClassifier(n\\_jobs=-1)\nmodel.fit(X\\_train, labels\\_train)\n# Make predictions on the test set\npredictions = model.predict(X\\_test)\n# Evaluate the model performance\naccuracy = accuracy\\_score(labels\\_test, predictions)\nprint(&quot;&quot;Accuracy: {:.2f}%&quot;&quot;.format(accuracy \\* 100))\n```\nIn this example,`texts`is a list of text documents, and`labels`is a list of class labels. The data is split into training and testing sets using the`train\\_test\\_split`function from scikit-learn. The text data is then converted into numerical features using the`TfidfVectorizer`from scikit-learn. The XGBoost model is trained on the training data using the`fit`method, and predictions are made on the test set using the`predict`method. Finally, the accuracy of the model is evaluated using the`accuracy\\_score`function from scikit-learn.\nNote that this is just a simple example, and in practice, you might need to perform additional steps such as hyperparameter tuning or cross-validation to achieve optimal performance.\n**There are several reasons why XGBoost is a popular choice for text classification:**\n1. Speed and Scalability: XGBoost is designed to handle large datasets and can be run on parallel computing systems, making it a fast and efficient algorithm for text classification. This is important in text classification because text data can often be large and complex.\n2. Good Performance: XGBoost has a good track record of achieving high accuracy in text classification tasks, especially when compared to other traditional machine learning algorithms such as linear models or Naive Bayes.\n3. Feature Importance: XGBoost provides feature importances, which can give insights into which words or features are most important in determining the class label of a text document. This can be useful in understanding the underlying patterns in the data and can also be used for feature selection.\n4. Regularization: XGBoost supports various regularization techniques, such as L1 and L2 regularization, which can prevent overfitting. Overfitting is a common problem in text classification due to the large number of features often present in text data.\n5. Model Interpretability: XGBoost uses decision trees as base models, which are easy to interpret and understand. This makes it easier to understand the relationship between the features and the predicted class labels.\nOverall, XGBoost is a powerful and flexible algorithm that can handle the complex and large-scale nature of text data and has a good track record of achieving high accuracy in text classification tasks.\n[\nText Classification\n](https://medium.com/tag/text-classification?source=post_page-----9c8b1f8f24aa---------------------------------------)\n[\nMachine Learning\n](https://medium.com/tag/machine-learning?source=post_page-----9c8b1f8f24aa---------------------------------------)\n[\nNaturallanguageprocessing\n](https://medium.com/tag/naturallanguageprocessing?source=post_page-----9c8b1f8f24aa---------------------------------------)\n[\n![Gauri Bhatnagar](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:96:96/1*3Toq7r_mcTrPicXaWPbNSg.jpeg)\n](https://medium.com/@gaurishah143?source=post_page---post_author_info--9c8b1f8f24aa---------------------------------------)\n[\n![Gauri Bhatnagar](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:128:128/1*3Toq7r_mcTrPicXaWPbNSg.jpeg)\n](https://medium.com/@gaurishah143?source=post_page---post...",

      "text": "In this article, I will discuss some great tips and tricks to [improve the performance](https://neptune.ai/blog/improving-machine-learning-deep-learning-models) of your text classification model. These tricks are obtained from solutions of some of Kaggle\u2019s top NLP competitions.\n\nNamely, I\u2019ve gone through:\n\n- [Jigsaw Unintended Bias in Toxicity Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-unintended-bias-in-toxicity-classification) \u2013 $65,000\n- [Toxic Comment Classification Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge/) \u2013 $35,000\n- [Quora Insincere Questions Classification](http://kaggle.com/c/quora-insincere-questions-classification) \u2013 $25,000\n- [Google QUEST Q&A Labeling](https://www.kaggle.com/c/google-quest-challenge) \u2013 $25,000\n- [TensorFlow 2.0 Question Answering](https://www.kaggle.com/c/tensorflow2-question-answering) \u2013 $50,000\n\nand found a ton of great ideas.\n\nWithout much lag, let\u2019s begin.\n\n## Dealing with larger datasets\n\nOne issue you might face in any machine learning competition is the size of your data set. If the size of your data is large, that is 3GB + for Kaggle kernels and more basic laptops you could find it difficult to load and process with limited resources. Here is the link to some of the articles and kernels that I have found useful in such situations.\n\n- Optimize the memory by [reducing the size of some attributes](https://www.kaggle.com/shrutimechlearn/large-data-loading-trick-with-ms-malware-data)\n- Use open-source libraries such as [Dask to read and manipulate the data](https://www.kaggle.com/yuliagm/how-to-work-with-big-datasets-on-16g-ram-dask), it performs parallel computing and saves up memory space\n- Use [cudf](https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf)\n- Convert data to [parquet](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/parquet.html) format\n- Convert data to [feather](https://medium.com/@snehotosh.banerjee/feather-a-fast-on-disk-format-for-r-and-python-data-frames-de33d0516b03) format\n\n## Small datasets and external data\n\nBut, what can one do if the dataset is small? Let\u2019s see some techniques to tackle this situation.\n\nOne way to increase the performance of any machine learning model is to use some external data frame that contains some variables that influence the predicate variable.\n\nLet\u2019s see some of the external datasets.\n\n- Use of [squad](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/) data for Question Answering tasks\n- Other [datasets](http://nlpprogress.com/english/question_answering.html) for QA tasks\n- Wikitext long term dependency language modeling [dataset](https://www.salesforce.com/products/einstein/ai-research/the-wikitext-dependency-language-modeling-dataset/)\n- [Stackexchange data](https://archive.org/download/stackexchange)\n- Prepare a dictionary of commonly misspelled words and corrected words.\n- Use of [helper datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/kyakovlev/jigsaw-general-helper-public) for cleaning\n- [Pseudo labeling](https://www.kaggle.com/cdeotte/pseudo-labeling-qda-0-969/) is the process of adding confidently predicted test data to your training data\n- Use different data [sampling methods](https://www.kaggle.com/shahules/tackling-class-imbalance)\n- Text augmentation by [Exchanging words with synonym](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.01710.pdf) [s](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.01710.pdf)\n- Text augmentation by [noising in RNN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.02573.pdf)\n- Text augmentation by [translation to other languages and back](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge/discussion/48038)\n\n## Data exploration and gaining insights\n\nData exploration always helps to better understand the data and gain insights from it. Before starting to develop machine learning models, top competitors always read/do a lot of exploratory data analysis for the data. This helps in feature engineering and cleaning of the data.\n\n- Twitter data [exploration methods](https://www.kaggle.com/jagangupta/stop-the-s-toxic-comments-eda)\n- Simple [EDA for tweets](https://www.kaggle.com/nz0722/simple-eda-text-preprocessing-jigsaw)\n- [EDA](https://www.kaggle.com/tunguz/just-some-simple-eda) for Quora data\n- [EDA](https://www.kaggle.com/kailex/r-eda-for-q-gru) in \u00a0R for Quora data\n- Complete [EDA](https://www.kaggle.com/codename007/start-from-here-quest-complete-eda-fe) with stack exchange data\n- My previous article on [EDA for natural language processing](https://neptune.ai/blog/exploratory-data-analysis-natural-language-processing-tools)\n\n## Data cleaning\n\nData cleaning is one of the important and integral parts of any NLP problem.

It is based on the assumption that the words in a text are independent of each other, and that the probability of a text belonging to a class is proportional to the product of the probabilities of each word in that class. Naive Bayes can handle large and sparse data sets, and can deal with multiple classes. However, it may not perform well when the words are not independent, or when there are strong correlations between features and classes. To use Naive Bayes for text classification, you need to first convert your text into a vector of word counts or frequencies, and then apply the Bayes theorem to calculate the class probabilities.\n``````\n[\nAdd your perspective\n](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=/advice/1/what-most-effective-text-classification-algorithms&amp;trk=article-ssr-frontend-x-article)\n````````````````````````\nHelp others by sharing more (125 characters min.)Cancel\nAddSave\n* [![Contributor profile photo]()![Contributor profile photo]()\nJyothsna Devi Tiruveedhula\nEngineer-1 @Verizon | DE Intern\u201925 @Verizon | DS Intern\u201924 @PayPal | CSE-AI ML Grad (VIT-AP Rank 4) | Data Science | Machine Learning | Deep Learning | NLP\n](https://in.linkedin.com/in/jyothsna-devi-tiruveedhula-b70a33222?trk=article-ssr-frontend-x-article)\n* Copy link to contribution\n* [Report contribution](https://www.linkedin.com/uas/login?session_redirect=https://www.linkedin.com/advice/1/what-most-effective-text-classification-algorithms&amp;trk=comment-semaphore-sign-in-redirect&amp;guestReportContentType=AUTO_GENERATED_SKILL_ARTICLE_CONTRIBUTION&amp;_f=guest-reporting)\nThanks for letting us know&#33; You&#39;ll no longer see this contribution\n``````\nNaive Bayes is indeed a solid choice for text classification due to its simplicity and efficiency, especially when dealing with large datasets. However, its assumption of word independence can be limiting in capturing more complex relationships within text data. In scenarios where semantic meaning and context play a crucial role, more advanced algorithms such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or transformer-based models like BERT and GPT-3 might outperform Naive Bayes. These deep learning models excel in capturing intricate patterns and contextual nuances in language, making them particularly effective for sophisticated NLP tasks.\n\u2026see more\n``\n[\nLike\n](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=/advice/1/what-most-effective-text-classification-algorithms&amp;trk=article-ssr-frontend-x-article_contribution-social-activity_like-cta)\n![Like]()Like\n![Celebrate]()Celebrate\n![Support]()Support\n![Love]()Love\n![Insightful]()Insightful\n![Funny]()Funny\n````\n![]()![]()14\n``````````````\n* [![Contributor profile photo]()![Contributor profile photo]()\nShravan Kumar K.\nAI Leader | AI Speaker | IIT Madras - IIM Bangalore Alumnus | Associate Director at Novartis| Gen AI | 40 under 40 DS, AIM-25\n](https://in.linkedin.com/in/shravankoninti?trk=article-ssr-frontend-x-article)\n* Copy link to contribution\n* [Report contribution](https://www.linkedin.com/uas/login?session_redirect=https://www.linkedin.com/advice/1/what-most-effective-text-classification-algorithms&...",
