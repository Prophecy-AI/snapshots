      "query": "What are winning approaches for text classification with mixed text and numerical features on Kaggle?",
      "finding": "Winning Kaggle solutions for text\u2011classification problems that also contain numeric (or categorical) columns usually treat the data as a **multimodal** problem and combine the strengths of transformer\u2011based language models with classic tabular\u2011model techniques. A very popular shortcut is to **convert every feature to a string and concatenate them with a special separator** (e.g., `[SEP]`) before feeding the whole sequence to a pre\u2011trained transformer such as BERT or RoBERTa. This \u201cfeatures\u2011to\u2011text\u201d trick lets the model attend to the numeric value as if it were a token and has been shown to give strong baselines on real Kaggle datasets (e.g., wine\u2011review classification at FreeAgent and clothing\u2011review sentiment at Kaggle)\u202f([FreeAgent](https://engineering.freeagent.com/2024/05/17/combining-text-with-numerical-and-categorical-features-for-classification), [McCormick\u202fML](https://mccormickml.com/2021/06/29/combining-categorical-numerical-features-with-bert)).  \n\nA more \u201cprincipled\u201d variant ",

      "finding": "Based on discussions from Kaggle participants and the tips shared from top Kaggle binary\u2011classification contests, winners typically handle a moderate class imbalance with a small, repeatable workflow ([Kaggle discussion on imbalanced data](https://www.kaggle.com/discussions/questions-and-answers/27589);\u202f[Neptune blog on Kaggle tricks](https://neptune.ai/blog/tabular-data-binary-classification-tips-and-tricks-from-5-kaggle-competitions)):\n\n1. **Pick a metric that reflects imbalance** \u2013 Use AUC\u2011ROC, log\u2011loss, or F1 rather than raw accuracy, and decide whether false positives or false negatives are more costly for the problem ([Kaggle discussion](https://www.kaggle.com/discussions/questions-and-answers/27589)).  \n\n2. **Apply simple sampling before model training** \u2013  \n   * **Oversample** the minority class (e.g., SMOTE or random replication) to give it more representation.  \n   * **Undersample** the majority class if the dataset is large enough, to reduce bias.
