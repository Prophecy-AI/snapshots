      "query": "What are winning approaches for text classification with mixed text and numerical features on Kaggle?",
      "finding": "Winning Kaggle solutions for text\u2011classification problems that also contain numeric (or categorical) columns usually treat the data as a **multimodal** problem and combine the strengths of transformer\u2011based language models with classic tabular\u2011model techniques. A very popular shortcut is to **convert every feature to a string and concatenate them with a special separator** (e.g., `[SEP]`) before feeding the whole sequence to a pre\u2011trained transformer such as BERT or RoBERTa. This \u201cfeatures\u2011to\u2011text\u201d trick lets the model attend to the numeric value as if it were a token and has been shown to give strong baselines on real Kaggle datasets (e.g., wine\u2011review classification at FreeAgent and clothing\u2011review sentiment at Kaggle)\u202f([FreeAgent](https://engineering.freeagent.com/2024/05/17/combining-text-with-numerical-and-categorical-features-for-classification), [McCormick\u202fML](https://mccormickml.com/2021/06/29/combining-categorical-numerical-features-with-bert)).  \n\nA more \u201cprincipled\u201d variant ",

      "query": "What are effective feature engineering techniques for Reddit comment classification using user flair and engagement metrics?",
      "finding": "Effective feature engineering for Reddit comment classification that leverages **user flair** and **engagement metrics** combines textual signals with rich metadata about the author and the comment\u2019s interaction history.  \n\nFirst, treat the flair as a categorical attribute that can be **one\u2011hot encoded** or, for higher\u2011dimensional models, transformed into dense embeddings (e.g., using\u202f`sklearn`\u202f`DictVectorizer` or\u202f`torch.nn.Embedding`). Because flairs often encode community\u2011specific roles (e.g., \u201cModerator\u201d, \u201cNewbie\u201d, \u201cExpert\u201d), they act as a strong prior about a user\u2019s likely posting style and can be concatenated with text\u2011based vectors (TF\u2011IDF, word2vec, BERT) before feeding the combined feature set to a classifier\u202f([GitHub \u2013 11\u2011aryan/Reddit\u2011Flair\u2011Classification](https://github.com/11-aryan/Reddit-Flair-Classification)).  \n\nSecond, extract **engagement metrics** that capture how the community reacts to a comment: up\u2011vote count, down\u2011vote count, net score, award count, reply depth, nu",

      "query": "What ensembling strategies work best for text classification competitions on Kaggle?",
      "finding": "Ensembling is the de\u2011facto \u201csecret sauce\u201d for winning Kaggle text\u2011classification contests.  The most reliable recipe starts with **diverse, high\u2011performing base models** \u2013 e.g., several fine\u2011tuned transformer checkpoints or zero\u2011shot LLMs \u2013 and then combines their predictions in a low\u2011bias, high\u2011variance way.  Simple **blending** (averaging the class\u2011probability vectors) already yields a consistent lift; arithmetic means work for any task, while a **geometric mean** of probabilities often improves calibration for classification problems\u30103\u3011.  When the base models are heterogeneous, a **majority\u2011vote / majority\u2011rules ensemble** can dramatically reduce hallucinations and mis\u2011classifications, as shown by a recent eLLM framework that achieved up to\u202f65\u202f% F1 improvement over the strongest single LLM\u30102\u3011.  \n\nFor larger gains, Kagglers move to **stacked generalization**: out\u2011of\u2011fold predictions from each base model become features for a second\u2011level learner.
