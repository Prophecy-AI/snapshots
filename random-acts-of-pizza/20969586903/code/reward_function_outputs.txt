Resolving this, the most consequential risk is the missed generalization/strategy gap, so the final score is moderated and RL is triggered."

I resolved this by prioritizing the majority view and the concrete performance evidence cited (hidden/test performance ~0.595 AUC still far below stronger CV/top-solution patterns), concluding RL should trigger to push toward implementation-focused progress and higher end-to-end scores."
