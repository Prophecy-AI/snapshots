  "overall_failure_reason": "There was disagreement among jurors: one viewed the work as excellent overall (no RL trigger) due to quick correction of the JSON issue and some metadata focus, while two judged it RL-worthy due to an avoidable initial parsing failure and a lack of competition-specific, high-value feature exploration. Resolving this, the majority and the more detailed critique indicates the agent’s analysis remains too generic relative to top-solution strategies despite recovery, so RL is triggered with a moderate-positive score."
