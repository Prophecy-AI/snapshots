## What I Understood

The junior researcher built a baseline LightGBM model for the Random Acts of Pizza competition. They extracted 19 simple text features (length, word count, keyword indicators like "please", "thank", "hungry") from `request_text_edit_aware` and combined them with 15 tabular features. They used 5-fold stratified CV, optimizing for AUC but reporting log loss of 0.4481 ± 0.0298. The target score to beat is 0.979080 AUC.

## Technical Execution Assessment

**Validation**: Stratified 5-fold CV is appropriate for this binary classification problem. The standard deviation (0.0298) is reasonable, suggesting stable validation.

**Leakage Risk**: **CRITICAL ISSUE - DATA LEAKAGE CONFIRMED**
- `giver_username_if_known` is the most important feature (importance: 2091, vs 466 for second place)
- This is direct leakage: if a giver username is known (not "N/A"), the request was successful
- This information would NOT be available when predicting new requests
- The model is essentially "cheating" by using future information

**Score Integrity**: 
- Log loss of 0.4481 is verified in notebook output
- However, competition uses AUC (target: 0.979080), not log loss
- They optimized for AUC (`metric: 'auc'`) but never reported AUC scores
- Fold AUCs shown in training: 0.792, 0.788, 0.815, 0.747, 0.783 (mean ~0.785)
- This is FAR from the 0.979080 target - they're not even close

**Code Quality**: Code executed successfully, but the leakage issue invalidates all results.

Verdict: **UNRELIABLE** due to confirmed data leakage

## Strategic Assessment

**Approach Fit**: The basic approach (gradient boosting + simple text features) is reasonable for this tabular + text problem. However:
- Text features are too simplistic (keyword counting only)
- Missing sophisticated text processing (TF-IDF, embeddings, sentiment)
- Not leveraging the actual `request_text` field (only using edit_aware version)
- Feature engineering is minimal - many timestamp and user activity fields aren't being used creatively

**Effort Allocation**: 
- Time spent on the wrong bottleneck: They're using a leaked feature instead of building real predictive signal
- Text processing is too basic given that text is the core of this competition
- Should focus on: (1) removing leakage, (2) better text features, (3) more sophisticated modeling

**Assumptions**:
- Assumed all features are fair game (wrong - giver_username is leakage)
- Assumed simple keyword counting would capture text signal (unlikely)
- Assumed LightGBM with default-ish parameters would be competitive (not for 0.979 AUC target)

**Blind Spots**:
- Not using actual `request_text` field (only edit_aware version)
- No TF-IDF, word embeddings, or transformer-based text features
- No feature engineering on timestamps (hour of day, day of week, etc.)
- No analysis of requester history patterns
- No mention of class imbalance handling (though stratified CV helps)
- No attempt at ensembling or model stacking

**Trajectory**: Current path will not reach target. With leakage: false confidence. Without leakage: likely much worse performance. Need major pivot.

## What's Working
- Solid CV framework (5-fold stratified)
- Correct handling of categorical features with LabelEncoder
- Good practice: combining predictions across folds
- Feature importance analysis (helped identify leakage!)

## Key Concerns

### 1. CRITICAL: Data Leakage in giver_username_if_known
**Observation**: This feature has 4x higher importance than any other feature. When giver is known (not "N/A"), request was successful.
**Why it matters**: This is classic data leakage - using information that wouldn't be available at prediction time. All current results are meaningless.
**Suggestion**: Remove this feature immediately. Re-run CV to see true performance. Expect significant score drop.

### 2. Wrong Metric Being Optimized/Reported
**Observation**: Optimizing for AUC but reporting log loss. Target is 0.979080 AUC but not tracking this metric.
**Why it matters**: Can't know if you're making progress toward target. Log loss and AUC are correlated but different.
**Suggestion**: Report AUC for all validation. Convert log loss target to AUC if needed, or vice versa. Track the right metric.

### 3. Text Features Are Too Simplistic
**Observation**: Only using basic keyword counting (19 features). No TF-IDF, embeddings, or semantic analysis.
**Why it matters**: Text is the core of this problem. Keyword counting misses context, sentiment, writing quality, politeness signals.
**Suggestion**: Add TF-IDF features (unigrams, bigrams), sentiment analysis, readability scores, politeness markers. Consider pretrained embeddings or even fine-tuning a small transformer.

### 4. Feature Engineering is Minimal
**Observation**: Using raw timestamp, not extracting time-of-day, day-of-week, etc. No interaction features.
**Why it matters**: Temporal patterns likely exist (posting time, account age effects).
**Suggestion**: Engineer temporal features: hour, day_of_week, is_weekend, account_age_buckets, requester_activity_ratios.

## Top Priority for Next Experiment

**Remove the leakage and establish a true baseline**: 
1. Re-run the exact same model WITHOUT `giver_username_if_known` 
2. Report both AUC and log loss
3. This will give you the REAL baseline performance (likely much worse than 0.785 AUC)
4. Only then can you start meaningful improvement iterations

**Second priority**: Add TF-IDF features (unigrams + bigrams) on `request_text_edit_aware` to capture actual text signal. This is a high-leverage change that could significantly boost performance.

**Confidence level**: Very high on leakage identification (clear from feature importance). High on need for better text features. Medium-high on metric tracking issue.
