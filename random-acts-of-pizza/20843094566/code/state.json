A common recipe is to **encode the text with a pre\u2011trained transformer** (e.g.,\u202fBERT, RoBERTa) and **encode each metadata column separately** \u2013 categorical variables with embedding layers, numeric variables with scaling or bucketisation \u2013 then concatenate all vectors before the final classification head.  This \u201cdual\u2011tower\u201d design lets the model learn interactions between language and auxiliary signals while keeping each modality in a suitable representation space\u202f([FreeAgent blog](https://engineering.freeagent.com/2024/05/17/combining-text-with-numerical-and-categorical-features-for-classification)).  \n\nA simpler but surprisingly effective trick is to **inject metadata directly into the transformer\u2019s token stream**.  By joining the raw fields with a special separator token (e.g.,\u202f`[SEP]`) the model sees the amount, category, tim",

      "query": "How do Kaggle winners handle class imbalance in text classification competitions?",
      "finding": "Based on the strategies described by Kaggle winners in the Jigsaw\u2011toxic\u2011comment and other text\u2011classification contests, the most common ways to tame severe class imbalance are:\n\n1. **Analyze the label distribution and set class\u2011wise loss weights** \u2013 compute the frequency of each class and pass the inverse frequencies (or a smoothed version) to the loss function (e.g., weighted\u202fbinary\u2011cross\u2011entropy or focal loss). This forces the model to pay more attention to rare toxic or insincere labels.\u202f([Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-i-handled-imbalanced-text-data-ba9b757ab1d8))  \n\n2. **Oversample the minority class at the data\u2011loader level** \u2013 duplicate or augment under\u2011represented samples so each training batch contains a roughly balanced mix. Simple duplication works well, and many winners combine it with text\u2011augmentation (back\u2011translation, synonym replacement) to increase diversity.\u202f([Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-i-handled-imbalanced-text",
