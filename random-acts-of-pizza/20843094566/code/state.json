A common recipe is to **encode the text with a pre\u2011trained transformer** (e.g.,\u202fBERT, RoBERTa) and **encode each metadata column separately** \u2013 categorical variables with embedding layers, numeric variables with scaling or bucketisation \u2013 then concatenate all vectors before the final classification head.
