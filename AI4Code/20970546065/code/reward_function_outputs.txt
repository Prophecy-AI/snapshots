I resolve this by treating the step as competent but incomplete—good initial hygiene, but not yet aligned with the most critical early insight—yielding a blended score near the average."

There was minor disagreement on severity (scores 0.2 vs 0.4), resolved by weighting the detailed evidence about near-random performance and the mismatch to known winning approaches, yielding a consensus score around 0.33 and triggering RL."
