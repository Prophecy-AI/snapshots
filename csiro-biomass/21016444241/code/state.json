Final weights: 0.45, 0.35, 0.2. Uses patch-based image processing (520px patches), PCA/PLS feature engineering, semantic text features from concept prompts, and post-processing to enforce biomass constraints.",

Uses TTA with horizontal/vertical flips, rotations, and Gaussian blur. Trains with sharpness-aware minimization (SAM). 5-fold cross-validation with separate models per target.",
