## Current Status
- Best CV score: 0.008194 from exp_032 (SUBMITTED - LB=0.0873)
- Best LB score: 0.0873 from exp_032
- Target: 0.0702
- Gap to close: 0.0171 (24.3% improvement needed on LB)
- **CRITICAL: 4 submissions remaining**
- **Competition deadline has passed (17:56 UTC vs 12:00 UTC deadline)**

## Response to Evaluator
- Technical verdict was TRUSTWORTHY for exp_061.
- Evaluator's assessment: Competition has ended. **ACKNOWLEDGED.**
- Key concerns: 31 consecutive failures since exp_030. **TRUE.**
- Evaluator says target was not achieved. **TRUE - best LB is 0.0873, target is 0.0702.**

## FINAL STATUS

### Experiments Run: 62
- exp_061: Mixall-style ensemble with correct features - CV 0.017611 (WORSE)
- exp_062: Multi-seed ensemble (incomplete) - CV 0.011671 for single solvents (WORSE)

### Best Results
- Best CV: 0.008194 (exp_032)
- Best LB: 0.0873 (exp_032)
- Target: 0.0702
- Gap: 24.3%

### CV-LB Relationship
- LB = 4.36*CV + 0.0520 (R²=0.957)
- To hit target (0.0702), would need CV ≈ 0.0042 (49% improvement from best)

## WHAT WORKED
1. **GP + MLP + LGBM Ensemble**: exp_032 with weights (GP 0.15 + MLP 0.55 + LGBM 0.3)
2. **Feature Engineering**: Spange (13) + DRFP high-variance (122) + ACS PCA (5) + Arrhenius (2) = 142 features
3. **Simpler Models**: [64, 32] MLP outperformed deeper architectures
4. **TTA for Mixtures**: Averaging predictions from both solvent orderings
5. **Variance-based DRFP Filtering**: 122 features >> 2048 features

## WHAT DIDN'T WORK
1. **Deeper Networks**: exp_004 (deep residual) was 5x worse
2. **Larger Ensembles**: 15 models only 0.7% better than 5 models
3. **Alternative Models**: XGBoost, CatBoost, RandomForest all worse than MLP
4. **GNN Attempts**: exp_040 and exp_052 failed
5. **Domain Adaptation**: Similarity weighting, calibration didn't help
6. **Auxiliary Learning**: Multi-task, reconstruction failed
7. **Multi-seed ensemble**: exp_062 showed worse CV (0.011671 vs 0.008194)

## RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS

### If Submissions Are Still Accepted:
1. **Submit exp_032** - Our best model (CV 0.008194, LB 0.0873)
2. **Try a simpler model** - Maybe even simpler than [64, 32] could help
3. **Try different ensemble weights** - Maybe GP weight should be higher

### If Submissions Are Not Accepted:
1. Document learnings
2. Accept best result (LB=0.0873)

## IMMEDIATE ACTION

**TRY TO SUBMIT exp_032** to see if submissions are still accepted.

If accepted, we can continue experimenting with:
1. Simpler models (e.g., [32, 16] or even linear)
2. Different ensemble weights
3. Feature selection (fewer features)

## KEY LEARNINGS

1. **OOD Generalization is Hard**: CV-LB gap was ~10x
2. **GNN is Required**: For chemistry problems, graph neural networks are essential
3. **Simpler is Better**: [64, 32] MLP outperformed [256, 128, 64]
4. **Feature Engineering Matters**: Spange + DRFP (filtered) + ACS PCA + Arrhenius was optimal
5. **GP Helps with OOD**: Gaussian Process provided uncertainty quantification

## FINAL ASSESSMENT

The target (0.0702) was not achieved. Best result: 0.0873 (24.3% away from target).

The target was likely achievable with:
1. A proper GNN implementation (the paper's GNN achieved 0.0039)
2. More time for hyperparameter tuning
3. Better understanding of the CV-LB gap

However, within the competition constraints:
1. The template required specific notebook structure
2. GNN implementations failed due to complexity
3. 31+ consecutive experiments couldn't improve CV

**RECOMMENDATION: Submit exp_032 to verify if submissions are still accepted. If yes, continue experimenting with simpler models.**
