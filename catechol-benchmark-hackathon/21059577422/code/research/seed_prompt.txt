## Current Status
- Best CV score: 0.0082 from exp_032
- Best LB score: 0.0873 from exp_032
- CV-LB relationship: LB = 4.36*CV + 0.0520 (R²=0.96)
- Target: 0.070180
- Gap: 19.6% improvement needed on LB (49% improvement needed on CV)
- Remaining submissions: 4
- Time: LESS THAN 4 HOURS - FINAL DAY

## Response to Evaluator
- Technical verdict was TRUSTWORTHY for exp_063 (CatBoost + XGBoost)
- Evaluator's top priority: Submit the best model (exp_032) and try variations
- Key concerns: exp_063 was 34.5% worse than baseline - CatBoost/XGBoost don't provide GP's benefits
- Agreement: The evaluator is correct that we should focus on submitting and trying quick variations

## Data Understanding
- Reference notebooks: See `exploration/evolver_loop64_analysis.ipynb` for CV-LB analysis
- Key patterns:
  1. CV-LB relationship is very strong (R²=0.96)
  2. Intercept (0.0520) < Target (0.0702) - target IS theoretically reachable
  3. Best residual is -0.0022 (exp_000) - simpler models sometimes generalize better
  4. Required CV to hit target: 0.00417 (49% improvement from best)

## CRITICAL: TIME-SENSITIVE STRATEGY

With 4 submissions and less than 4 hours, we must be strategic:

### Priority 1: Verify exp_032 is submitted (DONE - LB 0.0873)

### Priority 2: Try HIGH-IMPACT variations (use remaining 4 submissions)

**Experiment 064: Increase GP Weight Slightly**
- Hypothesis: GP may help OOD generalization more than CV suggests
- Config: GP(0.20) + MLP(0.50) + LGBM(0.30) instead of GP(0.15) + MLP(0.55) + LGBM(0.30)
- Rationale: exp_030 (GP 0.2) had LB 0.0877, exp_032 (GP 0.15) had LB 0.0873 - small difference
- Quick to implement, low risk

**Experiment 065: Pure MLP (no GP, no LGBM)**
- Hypothesis: Simpler models may have better LB (exp_000 had best residual -0.0022)
- Config: Just MLP [32,16] with current features
- Rationale: exp_000 (simple model) had better residual than expected from CV

**Experiment 066: Different Feature Combination**
- Hypothesis: Feature selection affects CV-LB gap
- Config: Try Spange-only (like exp_000) with current best architecture
- Rationale: exp_000 used simpler features and had best residual

**Experiment 067: Ensemble of exp_030 and exp_032 predictions**
- Hypothesis: Averaging predictions from different models may help
- Config: Average predictions from exp_030 (GP 0.2) and exp_032 (GP 0.15)
- Rationale: Ensemble diversity

## What NOT to Try
- CatBoost + XGBoost ensemble (exp_063 was 34.5% worse)
- Deep networks (exp_004 was 5x worse)
- Learned embeddings (exp_039 was 9.8x worse)
- Attention models (exp_017 was 159% worse)
- Similarity weighting (exp_037 was 220% worse)
- GNN (too complex for remaining time)

## Validation Notes
- CV scheme: Leave-one-solvent-out for single, leave-one-ramp-out for mixtures
- CV-LB relationship: LB = 4.36*CV + 0.0520 (R²=0.96)
- Residual std: 0.0011 - small variations in LB are expected

## EXECUTION INSTRUCTIONS

1. **SUBMIT exp_032 FIRST** if not already submitted (it's our best LB)
2. Try experiments 064-067 in order of expected impact
3. Submit each experiment to get LB feedback
4. Use all 4 remaining submissions - we're on the last day!

## Key Insight

The target (0.0702) requires CV = 0.00417, which is 49% better than our best CV (0.0082). This is a massive gap that likely requires a fundamentally different approach (like GNN). However, with limited time, we should:

1. Maximize our LB score with tabular approaches
2. Try variations that might improve LB even slightly
3. Use all submissions to explore the space

The goal is to get the BEST POSSIBLE score, even if we can't hit the target.
