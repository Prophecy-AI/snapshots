## What I Understood

The junior researcher ran experiment 061, a "Mixall-style" ensemble (MLP + XGBoost + RandomForest + LightGBM) with CORRECT feature filtering (122 DRFP features instead of the buggy 2048 used in experiments 058-060). The hypothesis was that this ensemble combination might have a different CV-LB relationship. The experiment achieved CV = 0.017611, which is 114.9% WORSE than the baseline (exp_030 CV = 0.008298).

This is the 31st consecutive experiment that failed to improve on the baseline. The competition deadline has now passed (deadline was 2026-01-16T12:00:00Z, current time is ~6 hours past deadline).

## Technical Execution Assessment

**Validation**: SOUND ✓
- Proper leave-one-solvent-out CV for single solvents (24 folds)
- Leave-one-ramp-out CV for mixtures (13 folds)
- Results verified in output.log

**Leakage Risk**: None detected ✓
- Scalers fitted on training data only per fold
- No information leakage observed

**Score Integrity**: VERIFIED ✓
- Single Solvent CV: 0.009278 ± 0.007798
- Mixture CV: 0.024149 ± 0.020763
- Overall CV: 0.017611

**Code Quality**: CORRECT ✓
- The bug from experiments 058-060 was fixed (now uses 122 DRFP features instead of 2048)
- Mixture CV is now reasonable (0.024 vs 0.111 in buggy experiments)
- The experiment ran correctly

Verdict: **TRUSTWORTHY** - The experiment executed correctly with proper feature filtering.

## Strategic Assessment

### CRITICAL CONTEXT: COMPETITION HAS ENDED

**The deadline was 2026-01-16T12:00:00Z. Current time is ~6 hours past deadline.**

**Final Results:**
| Experiment | CV Score | LB Score | Status |
|------------|----------|----------|--------|
| exp_032 | 0.008194 | **0.08731** | BEST LB |
| exp_030 | 0.008298 | 0.08772 | 2nd best LB |
| exp_026 | 0.008465 | 0.08875 | 3rd best LB |

**Target: 0.070180** (was not achieved)
**Best LB: 0.08731** (19% away from target)

### Post-Mortem Analysis

**Why the target was not reached:**

1. **CV-LB Gap is Structural**: The relationship LB ≈ 10.5 × CV is consistent across all 13 submissions. This ~10x gap reflects the fundamental difficulty of predicting yields for completely unseen solvents (out-of-distribution generalization).

2. **Target Required CV ≈ 0.0043**: To reach LB = 0.0707, the linear fit suggests CV ≈ (0.0707 - 0.052) / 4.3 ≈ 0.0043. Our best CV was 0.008194, which is 91% higher than required.

3. **31 Consecutive Failures**: After exp_030, 31 experiments failed to improve CV. This includes:
   - Model variations: XGBoost, CatBoost, GNN, ChemBERTa, attention mechanisms
   - Feature variations: minimal features, learned embeddings, different PCA components
   - Regularization variations: stronger/weaker dropout, weight decay
   - Domain adaptation: similarity weighting, calibration
   - Auxiliary learning: multi-task, reconstruction

4. **The GNN Benchmark**: The paper's GNN achieved MSE 0.0039 using graph attention networks on molecular graphs. This suggests the target IS achievable, but requires fundamentally different architecture (graph neural networks with message passing) that couldn't be properly implemented within the competition template constraints.

### What Worked

1. **GP + MLP + LGBM Ensemble**: exp_032 with weights (GP 0.15 + MLP 0.55 + LGBM 0.3) achieved the best LB (0.08731)
2. **Feature Engineering**: Spange (13) + DRFP high-variance (122) + ACS PCA (5) + Arrhenius (5) = 145 features
3. **Simpler Models**: [64, 32] MLP outperformed deeper architectures
4. **TTA for Mixtures**: Averaging predictions from both solvent orderings helped
5. **Variance-based DRFP Filtering**: 122 features >> 2048 features (or PCA)

### What Didn't Work

1. **Deeper Networks**: exp_004 (deep residual) was 5x worse than baseline
2. **Larger Ensembles**: 15 models only 0.7% better than 5 models
3. **Alternative Models**: XGBoost, CatBoost, RandomForest all worse than MLP
4. **GNN Attempts**: exp_040 and exp_052 failed to implement proper graph attention
5. **Domain Adaptation**: Similarity weighting, calibration didn't help

## What's Working

1. **Best model identified**: exp_032 (GP 0.15 + MLP 0.55 + LGBM 0.3) with CV 0.008194, LB 0.08731
2. **Bug fix successful**: Experiment 061 correctly identified and fixed the DRFP feature filtering bug
3. **Systematic exploration**: 61 experiments covering all major approaches
4. **CV-LB relationship understood**: Linear fit with R² ≈ 0.95

## Key Concerns

### HIGH: Competition Has Ended

**Observation**: The deadline was 2026-01-16T12:00:00Z. Current time is ~6 hours past deadline.

**Why it matters**: No more submissions can be made. The final score is locked at LB = 0.08731.

**Suggestion**: Document learnings for future competitions.

### MEDIUM: Target Required Different Approach

**Observation**: The target (0.0707) required CV ≈ 0.0043, which is 48% better than our best CV (0.008194).

**Why it matters**: The tabular ML approach hit a ceiling around CV = 0.008. The GNN benchmark (0.0039) suggests graph neural networks are needed.

**Suggestion**: For future similar competitions, prioritize GNN implementation from the start.

### LOW: Experiment 061 Confirmed Mixall Ensemble is Worse

**Observation**: Mixall-style ensemble (MLP + XGB + RF + LGBM) achieved CV = 0.017611, which is 114.9% worse than baseline.

**Why it matters**: Confirms that GP + MLP + LGBM is the optimal ensemble for this problem.

**Suggestion**: N/A (competition ended)

## Top Priority for Next Action

### ⚠️ COMPETITION HAS ENDED ⚠️

**The deadline has passed. No further experiments or submissions are possible.**

**Final Summary:**
- **Best LB Score**: 0.08731 (exp_032)
- **Target**: 0.070180
- **Gap**: 19% (target not achieved)
- **Submissions Used**: 13/5 (exceeded daily limit across multiple days)

**Key Learnings for Future Competitions:**

1. **OOD Generalization is Hard**: When test data is completely unseen (new solvents), the CV-LB gap can be ~10x. This is a fundamental limitation of tabular ML.

2. **GNN is Required**: The paper's GNN achieved 0.0039 MSE. For chemistry problems with molecular structure, graph neural networks are essential.

3. **Simpler is Better (to a point)**: [64, 32] MLP outperformed [256, 128, 64]. But linear models were worse.

4. **Feature Engineering Matters**: Spange + DRFP (filtered) + ACS PCA + Arrhenius was the optimal feature set.

5. **GP Helps with OOD**: Gaussian Process provided uncertainty quantification that helped with unseen solvents.

**The honest assessment**: The target (0.0707) was likely achievable with a proper GNN implementation, but the competition template constraints and time limitations prevented this. The best tabular ML result (0.08731) represents a strong baseline but couldn't close the gap to the GNN benchmark.
