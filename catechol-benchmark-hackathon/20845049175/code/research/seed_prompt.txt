## Current Status
- Best CV score: 0.009004 from exp_012 (2-model ensemble: MLP[32,16] + LightGBM, 0.6/0.4 weights)
- Best LB score: 0.0913 from exp_012
- CV-LB gap: ~10x ratio (consistent across all experiments)
- Target: 0.0333 (2.74x better than our best)
- Submissions remaining: 4

## Response to Evaluator
- Technical verdict was TRUSTWORTHY. Agreed - all experiments executed correctly.
- Evaluator's top priority: "NO FURTHER EXPERIMENTS NEEDED". I PARTIALLY AGREE.
- Key concerns raised: Target is mathematically unreachable with tabular ML. CONFIRMED.
- However, I want to try ONE FINAL approach: attention mechanism on tabular features.

## Data Understanding
- Reference notebooks: See `exploration/evolver_loop16_analysis.ipynb` for final analysis
- Key patterns validated:
  1. Simpler MLP architectures generalize better ([32,16] optimal)
  2. 2-model ensemble (MLP + LightGBM) is optimal
  3. CV-LB ratio is ~10x (consistent)

## Benchmark Context (from arXiv paper 2512.19530)
- Paper's GBDT baseline: 0.099 MSE
- Our best: 0.0913 MSE (7% better than paper)
- Paper's GNN: 0.0039 MSE (using GAT + DRFP + mixture encodings)
- Target (0.0333) is between tabular and GNN performance

## Recommended Approach: FINAL EXPERIMENT
**Try self-attention mechanism on tabular features**

The paper's GNN success came from:
1. Graph Attention Networks (GAT)
2. Message-passing on molecular graphs
3. Learned mixture-aware encodings

We can approximate some of this with:
1. Self-attention on solvent features (like a simplified GAT)
2. Learned mixture encoding (instead of linear interpolation)
3. Cross-attention between solvent A and solvent B features

Implementation:
```python
class AttentionModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, data='single'):
        # Load both Spange and DRFP features
        # Apply self-attention to learn feature interactions
        # Use learned mixture encoding for full data
        # MLP head for prediction
```

This is a long shot (unlikely to close 3x gap) but worth trying as a final experiment.

## What NOT to Try
- More ensemble variations - already exhausted
- Hyperparameter tuning - diminishing returns
- Alternative tabular features alone - won't help

## Validation Notes
- CV scheme: Leave-one-solvent-out (24 folds) + Leave-one-ramp-out (13 folds)
- CV-LB correlation: 0.97 (strong)
- exp_012 is template compliant

## If Attention Doesn't Help
**ACCEPT exp_012 (LB 0.0913) AS FINAL RESULT**

The target of 0.0333 requires GNN-level approaches which are outside the scope of tabular ML.

## Submissions Remaining: 4
Save submissions unless attention experiment shows significant CV improvement (>10%).
