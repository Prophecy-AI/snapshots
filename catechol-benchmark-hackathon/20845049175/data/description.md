# Look-up tables

We also include a number of look-up tables in order to quickly find different parameterisations of the solvent molecules. These are:

* **acs_pca_descriptors_lookup.csv**: based on the PCA analysis from the ACS Green Chemistry Institute [Solvent Selection Tool](https://acsgcipr.org/tools/solvent-tool/).

* **drfps_catechol_lookup**: based on the differential reaction finger-print [DRFP](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2022/dd/d1dd00006c) of the reactions under different solvents.

* **fragprints_lookup**: based on the concatenation of 'fragments' and 'finerprints' of molecules, as per [Griffiths et al.](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2022/sc/d2sc04306h).

* **smiles_lookup.csv**: obtains the SMILES directly from the solvent names.

* **spange_descriptors_lookup**: based on the solvent properties as described in [Spange et al.](https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/cmtd.202000039), imputing any missing values using a multi-task GP.

## Prediction goal

The goal of the competition is to achieve the best cross-validation score when training on the full data but leaving-out (a) full experiments in the case of mixture solvents, and (b) a single solvent out in the case of no mixture solvents. The models should accurately predict the values of "SM", "Product 2", and "Product 3" in the left out data.

## Description

More details of the data-set:

## Data size and inputs

The data-set consists of 1227 data points on the allyl substituted catechol reaction, covering 24 solvents at different temperatures and residence times. The inputs of the model will consist of:

(1) A selection of two different solvents, Solvent A and Solvent B, with the corresponding amount of Solvent B in the mixture given by the percentage %B.

(2) The temperature in °C at which the reaction was carried out.

(3) The residence time of the reaction, i.e., how long the reactants were subject to the reaction conditions applied.

The outputs consist of the yield of the starting material and the two observed products. We also created a smaller data set of 656 data-points in which solvent mixtures are not considered, and only single solvent data, along with residence times and temperatures is considered.

## Evaluation

Submissions will be evaluated according to a cross-validation procedure. This public notebook (https://www.kaggle.com/code/josepablofolch/catechol-benchmark-hackathon-template) shows the structure any submitted notebook **must** follow. In order to ensure fair participation among all competitors, the submission must have the same last three cells as in the notebook template, with the only allowed change being the line where the model is defined. For the avoidance of doubt, the line `model = MLPModel()` can be replaced with a new model definition in the third to last and second to last cells, but everything else must remain the same.

## Submission File
Using the provided notebook, a single submission is created under the following format:

    fold, row, target_1, target_2, target_3
    0, 0, 0.98, 0.01, 0.01
    0, 1, 0.65, 0.30, 0.05
    0, 2, 0.40, 0.30, 0.30
    etc.

## abstract

Welcome to the Catechol Benchmark Hackathon competition! In this competition, we will have multiple teams trying to predict reaction outcomes of the rearrangement of allyl substituted catechol under different solvent and process conditions. 

![](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-user-content/o/inbox%2F4031506%2F61e0e8398db58dbed9147a2363bda5e9%2FProject2_rxn.png?generation=1758631749114140&alt=media)

The data-set consists of multiple transient flow ramps, which allow us to assess the amount of starting material and products after seeing the reaction at different temperatures and residence times (i.e. how long the chemicals reacted for). We also include many data-points for binary mixtures of solvents, allowing us to treat the usually discrete solvent selection problem as a semi-continuous one.

**Goal:** Build a machine learning model that achieves the best predictions on the collected data, as measured by a cross-validation procedure, which will demonstrate the ability of your model to predict on unseen solvent data.
