      "text": "Predicting reaction yields for test cases that contain solvents never seen during training requires a model that can **generalize from the chemical description of a solvent rather than memorising specific solvent\u2011yield pairs**.  The most robust approach is to encode the solvent as a molecular representation (e.g., SMILES or a set of physicochemical descriptors) and feed it to a neural architecture that learns joint reaction\u2011solvent embeddings.  Graph\u2011based models or transformer\u2011style encoders can process atom\u2011mapped reaction SMILES together with solvent SMILES, allowing the network to infer how solvent polarity, hydrogen\u2011bonding ability, or dielectric constant influence the activation free energy and thus the yield.  In a recent study, a model trained on >\u202f28\u202f000 neutral reactions and 295 solvents achieved MAE\u202f\u2248\u202f0.7\u202fkcal\u202fmol\u207b\u00b9 for solvation activation energies and could predict relative rate constants for **unseen solvents** using only the SMILES strings of the reaction and solvent\u202f([RSC](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2024/sc/d3sc05353a)).  \n\nBecause real\u2011world datasets are often limited, **large\u2011scale pre\u2011training and multi\u2011view learning** improve out\u2011of\u2011sample performance.  The ReaMVP framework first pre\u2011trains on millions of reactions with 3\u2011D geometric views, then fine\u2011tunes on the target yield dataset; this strategy was shown to give a \u201csignificant advantage in predicting out\u2011of\u2011sample data\u201d, including new solvent combinations\u202f([NCBI](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10895839)).  Complementary techniques such as **few\u2011shot/meta\u2011learning** (e.g., the Catechol Benchmark) and **active representation learning (RS\u2011Coreset)** can further adapt a pretrained model to a handful of experimental points in a novel solvent, reducing the data needed for accurate predictions\u202f([Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42004-025-01434-0)).  \n\nFinally, when experimental data are scarce, **physics\u2011based surrogate data** (e.g., COSMO\u2011RS solvation calculations) can be generated for a wide palette of solvents and used to augment the training set, ensuring the model sees a diverse solvent space before being asked to extrapolate to truly new solvents.  Combining solvent\u2011aware molecular encodings, large\u2011scale pre\u2011training, and optional physics\u2011based augmentation therefore enables reliable yield prediction even when the test set contains completely unseen solvents\u202f([Imperial](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/articles/2025/imperial-and-solve-chemistry-bring-chemical-reaction-data-to-machine-learning)).",

But existing datasets are patchy &ndash; for example, they typically only include certain solvents and certain temperatures. They are therefore not powerful enough to reliably predict the best way to produce a chemical.\nThe new dataset contains comprehensive data on one industrially relevant reaction, catechol rearrangement, that could be used to effectively train machine learning algorithms to predict which solvents and conditions will give the best yields. It could also make it possible to train models that find the highest\u2011yielding options within a shortlist of more sustainable solvents or at the lowest feasible temperature.\nThe project to acquire and test the new dataset was initiated by[Professor Kim Jelfs](https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/k.jelfs)in Imperial&rsquo;s[Department of Chemistry](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/chemistry/)and[Professor Ruth Misener](https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/r.misener)in the[Department of Computing](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing/), working as part of[AIChemy](https://aichemy.ac.uk/), an EPSRC AI hub for Chemistry.[SOLVE Chemistry](https://www.solvechemistry.com/)was funded to produce the first publicly available dataset to include dense sampling of a continuous solvent and temperature space using technology developed by the company.\n> The new dataset could be used to effectively train machine learning algorithms to predict which solvents and conditions give the best yields. It could help use more sustainable solvents and lower temperatures.\n> > Imperial researchers led by PhD student[Toby Boyne](https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/t.boyne23)then demonstrated some ways this data can be used to develop and test predictive algorithms. Mr Boyne said: &ldquo;Predicting the impacts of different solvents is already a significant challenge. By including a range of solvent classes, as well as mixtures of solvents, we hope this dataset inspires the machine learning community to develop models that better capture solvent effects, and are robust across a range of experimental conditions.&rdquo;\nTo gather the data, the researchers used automated flow chemistry techniques developed by SOLVE Chemistry, which was founded by Imperial graduates Dr Linden Schrecker and Dr Jose Pablo Folch from their EPSRC- and BASF-funded PhDs. This enabled them to gather the reaction data continuously as reactions evolved over time.\nIn the case of temperature and residence time, this allowed them to gather dense enough data points to represent the variables as continuous rather than discrete. This could make it easier for machine learning models to detect nonlinear relationships between, for example, temperature and yield.\nIn the case of solvent selection, which is traditionally a categorical variable, they obtained continuous data using solvent mixtures, which allows solvent conditions to be explored in a more varied design space. For example, instead of just testing pure water and pure ethanol, they ran reactions along continuous ramps of water-ethanol mixtures and other solvent blends.\n&ldquo;What makes a solvent good for one reaction may not be what makes it good for another reaction,&rdquo; explained SOLVE Chemistry co-founder and Chief Scientific Officer, Dr Jose Pablo Folch. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re creating a workflow that combines cutting-edge machine learning and unique data collection to quickly uncover solvent effects on reactions of commercial interest.&rdquo;\nThe team put together 1,220 data points, which for chemical data is substantial and has potential to enable an entire class of models that were not previously testable at scale in chemistry. Following their publication in NeurIPS, Gabriel Gibberd in the Department of Chemical Engineering, a graduate from Imperial's[Digital Chemistry](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/courses/postgraduate-taught/digital-chemistry/)MSc programme, has used the dataset to achieve an even greater machine learning performance, also accepted into NeurIPS.\n## Hackathon\nThe NeurIPS paper is accompanied by a public hackathon, designed to give researchers early access to the dataset and challenge them to build models that predict unseen reaction outcomes as accurately as possible. &ldquo;Whoever wins will have a solution that will catalyse the next frontier of research in this area,&rdquo; said Dr Linden Schrecker, SOLVE Chemistry&rsquo;s co-founder and CEO.\n[Join the Catechol Benchmark Hackathon](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/catechol-benchmark-hackathon/overview)\n## Future developments\nThe team aims to make the dataset a springboard for new research in both chemistry and machine learning. By providing a unique, well\u2011curated dataset that combines time\u2011series, temperature-series and continuous solvent spaces, they give machine learning developers a realistic but tractable test bed for ideas in few\u2011shot learning, active learning and representation learning.\nAs researchers compete in the hackathon and build on the open data and code, the expectation is that new modelling strategies will emerge that can then be transferred to other reactions, other materials systems and industrial workflows.\n## Further reading\n[The Catechol Benchmark: Time-series Solvent Selection Data for Few-shot Machine Learning (PDF)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.07619)\n[Catechol Benchmark dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aichemy/catechol-benchmark)\n[SoDaDE: Solvent Data-Driven Embeddings with Small Transformer Models (PDF)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.22302?)\n[AIChemy](https://aichemy.ac.uk/)\n## Share this article\n* [](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/articles/2025/imperial-and-solve-chemistry-bring-chemical-reaction-data-to-machine-learning/)\n* [](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/articles/2025/imperial-and-solve-chemistry-bring-chemical-reaction-data-to-machine-learning/)\n* Copy link\n## Related tags\n* [Artificial Intelligence](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/articles/?tags=Artificial%20Intelligence)\n* [Engineering Chemical Eng](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/articles/?tags=Engineering%20Chemical%20Eng)\n* [Engineering Computing](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/articles/?tags=Engineering%20Computing)\n* [Enterprise](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/articles/?tags=Enterprise)\n* [Entrepreneurship](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/articles/?tags=Entrepreneurship)\n## Study subjects\n* [Chemical engineering](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/subjects/chemical-engineering/)\n* [Chemistry](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/subjects/chemistry/)\n* [Computer science](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/subjects/computer-science/)\nArticle text (excluding photos or graphics) &copy; Imperial College London.\nPhotos and graphics subject to third ...",

Kinetic mechanisms often involve hundreds to tens of thousands of elementary reactions,<a href=\"#cit7\"><sup><span>7</span></sup></a> and a fast, high-throughput method to estimate reaction rates is thus needed. <span>Ab initio</span> methods like quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) can provide accurate predictions of rate constants, but their high computational cost has been a major limiting factor for large-scale, automated predictions. As more kinetic data become available, data-driven approaches such as linear group contribution,<a href=\"#cit8\"><sup><span>8\u201310</span></sup></a> decision tree based rate rules,<a href=\"#cit11\"><sup><span>11,12</span></sup></a> and machine learning (ML) models<a href=\"#cit13\"><sup><span>13\u201319</span></sup></a> have emerged as more popular choices for estimating kinetic parameters. Several ML models<a href=\"#cit15\"><sup><span>15\u201317</span></sup></a> have successfully predicted barrier heights and rate constants of diverse gas phase reactions only based on readily available 2D information (<span>e.g.</span> SMILES strings) of reactants and products. However, such data-driven models for liquid/solution phase reactions have been lightly investigated with limited applicability,<a href=\"#cit20\"><sup><span>20</span></sup></a> and most approaches rely on the <span>ab initio</span> methods with either implicit or explicit solvation models.<a href=\"#cit21\"><sup><span>21,22</span></sup></a></span></p><p>Solvents can have significant impacts on reaction rates and outcomes, and it is crucial to accurately predict these kinetic solvent effects. Recent research efforts have been devoted to employing ML (<span>e.g.</span> deep neural network) for free energy predictions of condensed phase reactions.<a href=\"#cit15\"><sup><span>15,18,19,23\u201328</span></sup></a> Many of these studies<a href=\"#cit18\"><sup><span>18,19,23\u201325,28</span></sup></a> combine the ML models with semi-empirical or lower-level QM/MM methods to obtain the energy predictions that match the accuracy of higher-level QM/MM methods. For example, G\u00f3mez-Flores <span>et al.</span><a href=\"#cit19\"><sup><span>19</span></sup></a> used a ML approach to predict the energy difference between the density functional tight-binding model and other higher level QM methods for a thiol-disulfide exchange reaction in water. In a study by Pan <span>et al.</span>,<a href=\"#cit18\"><sup><span>18</span></sup></a> a ML model was trained to reproduce <span>ab initio</span> QM/MM potentials in free energy simulations for the aqueous Menshutkin reaction between ammonia and chloromethane. Farrar and Grayson<a href=\"#cit28\"><sup><span>28</span></sup></a> employed ML models to predict DFT-quality activation barriers for various nitro-Michael addition reactions in toluene based on the features generated from semi-empirical methods. These approaches, however, require semi-empirical QM/MM steps that are less suitable for instantaneous, automatic rate predictions. Furthermore, their models are limited to a single solvent and need the 3D coordinates or QM features of reactants and transition states as inputs, which are not readily available.</p>\n <p>The ML models by Jorner <span>et al.</span><a href=\"#cit26\"><sup><span>26</span></sup></a> and by Heid and Green<a href=\"#cit15\"><sup><span>15</span></sup></a> are the few cases that can predict reaction properties in multiple solvents only based on the 2D structural information of molecules. Jorner <span>et al.</span><a href=\"#cit26\"><sup><span>26</span></sup></a> employed a Gaussian process regression model and compared several 2D structural features to predict the barrier height of 443 S<small><sub>N</sub></small>Ar reactions in different solvents. In their work, the best accuracy was reached by adopting the BERT<a href=\"#cit29\"><sup><span>29</span></sup></a> reaction fingerprint. Heid and Green,<a href=\"#cit15\"><sup><span>15</span></sup></a> on the other hand, used the condensed graph of reaction (CGR) as an input reaction representation for a graph convolutional neural network (GCNN). They applied the CGR GCNN model to the same S<small><sub>N</sub></small>Ar data set and were able to achieve better barrier height predictions compared to the other models that used the BERT fingerprint or different reaction representations. While these models can provide fast kinetic estimations for solution-phase reactions at a low computational cost, only one reaction family was considered with a relatively small training set. A larger data set that contains more diverse types of reactions and solvents is needed in order to train a more generalized model for kinetic solvent effect predictions. Moreover, both models used fixed descriptors to represent solvents, but prior studies<a href=\"#cit15\"><sup><span>15,30,31</span></sup></a> revealed that the learned molecular representations based on a graph convolutional approach outperform fixed molecular descriptors in many property prediction tasks.</p>\n <p>In this study, we present a ML model that can predict kinetic solvent effects for a wide range of neutral reactions and solvents only based on atom-mapped reaction SMILES and solvent SMILES strings.

The efficacy of such models depends heavily on the representation of chemical reactions, which has commonly been learned from SMILES or graphs of molecules using deep neural networks. However, the progression of chemical reactions is inherently determined by the molecular 3D geometric properties, which have been recently highlighted as crucial features in accurately predicting molecular properties and chemical reactions. Additionally, large-scale pre-training has been shown to be essential in enhancing the generalization capability of complex deep learning models. Based on these considerations, we propose the Reaction Multi-View Pre-training (ReaMVP) framework, which leverages self-supervised learning techniques and a two-stage pre-training strategy to predict chemical reaction yields. By incorporating multi-view learning with 3D geometric information, ReaMVP achieves state-of-the-art performance on two benchmark datasets. Notably, the experimental results indicate that ReaMVP has a significant advantage in predicting out-of-sample data, suggesting an enhanced generalization ability to predict new reactions. Scientific Contribution: This study presents the ReaMVP framework, which improves the generalization capability of machine learning models for predicting chemical reaction yields.

In the field of organic synthesis, chemists often synthesize a target molecule through several or a dozen reaction steps [<a href=\"#CR3\">3</a>]. Consequently, low-yield reactions in the intermediate steps can have a negative impact on the total yield of the synthesis route due to the cumulative effect of each step. The estimation of chemical reaction yields plays an important role in guiding synthetic chemists to choose appropriate molecular synthesis routes, particularly in the case of identifying highly active and selective catalysts efficiently. Traditionally, chemists depend on empirical predictions or specific wet experiments to determine yields, which require extensive domain knowledge and are both time-consuming and labor-intensive. Therefore, data-driven machine learning techniques are needed to provide an efficient alternative.</p>\n<p>It remains a great challenge to accurately predict chemical reaction yields due to the complexity of reaction space and the diverse factors that influence chemical experiments [<a href=\"#CR4\">4</a>, <a href=\"#CR5\">5</a>]. To develop machine learning-based approaches, it is crucial to establish effective methods for representing chemical reactions. Conventional studies typically rely on feature engineering to represent chemical reactions using fingerprints or descriptors. This involves creating customized descriptors based on domain expertise to capture molecular, atomic, vibrational, or physicochemical properties [<a href=\"#CR6\">6</a>\u2013<a href=\"#CR12\">12</a>]. Some researchers derived descriptors from circular substructures present in the simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES) [<a href=\"#CR13\">13</a>] strings of the reactions [<a href=\"#CR14\">14</a>]. Chemical reactions can be perceived as sequences or collections of molecules. Therefore, the traditional practice of concatenating molecular fingerprints or descriptors at the molecule level is commonly employed [<a href=\"#CR15\">15</a>\u2013<a href=\"#CR18\">18</a>]. However, this concatenation approach is typically suitable only for reactions with a fixed number of molecules, posing limitations on their ability to generalize to downstream tasks.</p>\n<p>In recent years, deep learning (DL) models have gained popularity and have led to significant advancements in the representation and prediction of chemical reactions. Some studies utilized SMILES as input and employed well-established models from the field of natural language processing (NLP) to encode the SMILES notations of chemical reactions into continuous vectors. These studies employed either pre-trained Transformer-based models [<a href=\"#CR19\">19</a>\u2013<a href=\"#CR21\">21</a>] or Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models [<a href=\"#CR22\">22</a>, <a href=\"#CR23\">23</a>] on large-scale datasets, and fine-tuned their models [<a href=\"#CR3\">3</a>, <a href=\"#CR24\">24</a>] with downstream tasks to capture task-specific representations of chemical reactions. Other studies incorporated molecular graph structures to represent chemical reactions. Recent approaches include adding [<a href=\"#CR25\">25</a>] or concatenating [<a href=\"#CR26\">26</a>] molecular features learned from graph neural networks, encoding the condensed graph of chemical reactions [<a href=\"#CR27\">27</a>], and learning organic reactivity based on generalized reaction templates [<a href=\"#CR28\">28</a>].</p>\n<p>While the YieldGNN model [<a href=\"#CR12\">12</a>] attempts to combine 2D chemical reaction graphs with 1D descriptors, most of the aforementioned studies have focused solely on a specific perspective of chemical information, namely, 1D sequences or 2D graphs. By contrast, multi-view learning methods for molecular representation learning [<a href=\"#CR29\">29</a>\u2013<a href=\"#CR33\">33</a>] have achieved success by incorporating multiple views of molecules with different dimensional inputs.</p>\n<p>However, due to the difficulty in extracting effective features from molecular geometry, only a few molecule prediction methods [<a href=\"#CR30\">30</a>, <a href=\"#CR34\">34</a>\u2013<a href=\"#CR37\">37</a>] have leveraged 3D spatial structure information of molecules, which is critical for determining molecular properties and reaction outcomes. Although these studies have demonstrated the potential of 3D geometric information in providing comprehensive and complementary insights into chemical reactions, to further enhance the accuracy of reaction prediction, there is a need to explore more effective and efficient algorithms for handling the high dimensionality of 3D molecular structures.</p>\n<p>In this study, we propose a large-scale <strong>R</strong>eaction <strong>M</strong>ulti-<strong>V</strong>iew <strong>P</strong>re-training framework, named ReaMVP, to represent chemical reactions and predict their yields. ReaMVP utilizes a two-stage approach that involves the pre-training of a sequence encoder and a conformer encoder.

In the second stage, ReaMVP further enhances the representation of chemical reactions through supervised learning using reaction data with known yields.

For example, we often need to adopt some new structures to investigate the classic reactions, such as Buchwald\u2013Hartwig coupling, for discovering novel molecules with new functions<sup><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s42004-025-01434-0#ref-CR3\">3</a></sup>. But the real performance caused by those new structures are usually unreported and also not easy to predict. In traditional optimization process, chemists usually need to consider a \u201creaction space\u201d which contains a set of reaction combinations with several critical conditions, such as different catalysts, ligands, additives, solvents and other components (Fig.\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s42004-025-01434-0#Fig1\">1A</a>). In the well-known Suzuki coupling dataset provided by Pfizer\u2019s group<sup><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s42004-025-01434-0#ref-CR4\">4</a></sup>, for example, the size of the reaction space is 5760\u2009=\u200915\u2009\u00d7\u200912\u2009\u00d7\u20098\u2009\u00d7\u20094.

Therefore, when studying a new reaction system, it is urgently needed to understand the patterns of reaction yield and explore high-yield reaction combinations. However, this process often needs to take a large amount of experimental time, and moreover, the performance heavily relies on the expertise of the experimenter. As a consequence, some potentially viable reaction conditions are very likely to be overlooked.

Step 2 (\u201c<i>representation learning</i>\u201d), update the representation learning model with the newly added experimental data. Step 3 (\u201c<i>data selection</i>\u201d), select the most informative reactions in the reaction space guided by our coreset method. After several iterations, the representation for reaction space becomes stable and then we can build the final yield prediction model upon it.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s42004-025-01434-0/figures/1\"><span>Full size image</span></a></p></figure></div><p>The emerging high-throughput experimentation (HTE) technology, which is able to run a large number of reactions in parallel<sup><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s42004-025-01434-0#ref-CR14\">14</a>,<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s42004-025-01434-0#ref-CR15\">15</a></sup>, has attracted a lot of attention for accelerating the traditional reaction optimization process<sup><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s42004-025-01434-0#ref-CR16\">16</a>,<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s42004-025-01434-0#ref-CR17\">17</a></sup>. HTE can significantly promote the experimental efficiency and reduce the workload for exploring a new reaction system. The favorable parallelization of HTE can also generate a sufficiently large amount of experimental data to support reaction optimization, and thus greatly decreases the chance of missing high-yield reaction combinations.</p><p>To effectively utilize the experimental data generated from HTE, several different machine learning (ML) based methodologies have been proposed. Machine learning is an active research subarea of Artificial Intelligence<sup><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s42004-025-01434-0#ref-CR18\">18</a></sup>. In general, the goal of machine learning is to learn some effective model from observed data, where the model can be applied to solve various tasks, e.g., classification and regression. In particular, machine learning techniques have been successfully applied to different fields of scientific research<sup><a href=\"#ref-CR19\">19</a>,<a href=\"#ref-CR20\">20</a>,<a href=\"#ref-CR21\">21</a>,<a href=\"#ref-CR22\">22</a>,<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s42004-025-01434-0#ref-CR23\">23</a></sup>. For example, we can exploit machine learning-assisted methods to address a variety of chemical tasks such as molecular design<sup><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s42004-025-01434-0#ref-CR24\">24</a>,<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s42004-025-01434-0#ref-CR25\">25</a></sup>, reaction prediction<sup><a href=\"#ref-CR26\">26</a>,<a href=\"#ref-CR27\">27</a>,<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s42004-025-01434-0#ref-CR28\">28</a></sup>, retrosynthetic analyses<sup><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s42004-025-01434-0#ref-CR29\">29</a>,<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s42004-025-01434-0#ref-CR30\">30</a></sup>, reaction condition optimization<sup><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s42004-025-01434-0#ref-CR31\">31</a>,<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s42004-025-01434-0#ref-CR32\">32</a></sup>, selectivity prediction<sup><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s42004-025-01434-0#ref-CR33\">33</a>,<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s42004-025-01434-0#ref-CR34\">34</a></sup>, etc. In the area of yield prediction, Doyle\u2019s group provided an open-source chemical reaction optimization tool based on the Bayesian method, and they validated their approach through the experiments involving Palladium-catalysed C-N coupling and C\u2013H functionalization system, Mitsunobu reaction and deoxyfluorination reaction of alcohols<sup><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s42004-025-01434-0#ref-CR6\">6</a></sup>. Recently, Denmark\u2019s group designed a machine learning tool to predict substrate-adaptive conditions for Palladium-catalyzed C\u2013N couplings, where the tool can be used to optimize reaction combinations within a large reaction space of 450,000 possible reactions<sup><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s42004-025-01434-0#ref-CR17\">17</a></sup>.</p><p>Most of the current studies on reaction yield prediction rely on large amounts of data provided by HTE equipment. HTE, while powerful, its high cost makes it unaffordable for most research laboratories in the world. Consequently, the limited data and budget unfortunately hinder many chemists from leveraging ML methods to predict reaction yield or guide reaction screening. Therefore, our major task in this paper is to design a method that can provide guidance for yield prediction and optimization with small-scale experimental data. Through this method, we aim to interpret the entire reaction space and then achieve an overview of the yields across the space, which could help us to discover more potential reaction pathways that might otherwise be overlooked.</p><p>Our idea is to design some effective sampling strategy to approximate the reaction space.

Initially, physics based modeling techniques such as DFT or force field methods were used to understand reaction mechanisms and predict <em>e.g.</em> the stereochemical outcome of reactions<sup><a href=\"#cit1\">1</a></sup> or suitable catalysts for their acceleration.<sup><a href=\"#cit2\">2</a></sup> More recently, machine leaning (ML) methods<sup><a href=\"#cit3\">3</a></sup> have been used to predict the likely products of reactions (forward synthesis prediction)<sup><a href=\"#cit4\">4,5</a></sup> and promising pathways for the synthesis of organic molecules with a range of complexity.<sup><a href=\"#cit6\">6\u20139</a></sup></p>\n<p>The prediction of yields of chemical reactions is a particularly challenging task because it is influenced not only by the variables of the reaction under study, but also by all possible side reactions. At the same time, it is an extremely important task due to the significant effort needed to optimize the yield of a reaction by variation of reaction conditions and catalysts. Doyle and coworkers<sup><a href=\"#cit10\">10\u201312</a></sup> sought to address this challenge for the case of predicting the effect of heterocyclic poisons on the yield of the widely used Buchwald\u2013Hartwig amination by training a ML model on a dataset of 4608 reactions from high-throughput experimentation (HTE). Using a random forest (RF) model and computed physics-based features such as NMR shifts or HOMO/LUMO energies, an <em>R</em><sup>2</sup> of 0.92 was achieved (<a href=\"#fig1\">Fig. 1 A</a>). More complex models such as neural networks did not provide higher predictivity.<sup><a href=\"#cit10\">10</a></sup> Fu <em>et al.</em><sup><a href=\"#cit13\">13</a></sup> used a dataset of 387 Suzuki\u2013Miyaura reactions<sup><a href=\"#cit14\">14</a></sup> and features from DFT calculations to train a deep neural network, resulting in a model with an <em>R</em><sup>2</sup> of 0.92. Both HTE datasets have subsequently been successfully used in a range of ML models for yield predictions.<sup><a href=\"#cit15\">15\u201317</a></sup> Bayesian optimizers<sup><a href=\"#cit18\">18,19</a></sup> and deep reinforcement learning<sup><a href=\"#cit20\">20</a></sup> were also successful in the iterative optimization of reaction conditions for a variety of reactions. As will be discussed in more detail below, the use of HTE datasets in ML predictions has some significant drawbacks in that these datasets represent a very narrow part of the reaction space, are very time- and resource intensive and present challenges with overfitting of the models.</p>\n<figure><h3>Fig. 1. Previous work on yield predictions using ML models: (A) HTE-generated datasets using random forest models<sup><a href=\"#cit18\">18</a></sup> (B) HTE (blue) and USPTO derived (red) datasets using the BERT model.<sup><a href=\"#cit22\">22</a></sup>.</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&amp;p=PMC3&amp;id=10189898_d2sc06041h-f1.jpg\"></a></p>\n</figure><p>In contrast, the use of legacy datasets from published scientific or patent literature for yield prediction has been less successful. The attempt to classify reaction yields as above or below 65% based on a training set of \u223c10<sup>6</sup> reactions from the Reaxys database using a large number of descriptors and ML methods gave an accuracy of 65 \u00b1 5%, <em>i.e.</em> a 35% error.<sup><a href=\"#cit21\">21</a></sup> The authors of that study attributed this finding to the deficiencies of \u201ccurrently available chemical descriptors\u201d, but it should also be noted that the reaction space represented in their dataset is vast. Schwaller <em>et al.</em><sup><a href=\"#cit22\">22</a></sup> developed a modification of the bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) model,<sup><a href=\"#cit23\">23</a></sup> which uses natural language processing to build a reaction SMILES encoder trained on a large corpus of reactions, followed by a classification or regression layer for a specific task. This approach was successful for product predictions<sup><a href=\"#cit5\">5</a></sup> as well as for reaction yield predictions of the Suzuki\u2013Miyaura (blue in <a href=\"#fig1\">Fig. 1B</a>) and Buchwald\u2013Hartwig reactions.<sup><a href=\"#cit22\">22</a></sup> While this approach achieves <em>R</em><sup>2</sup> values of 0.81 and 0.95, respectively, in line with other ML models when trained on these HTE datasets,<sup><a href=\"#cit10\">10,24</a></sup> training on a dataset of Suzuki\u2013Miyaura reactions from the US Patent database (USPTO)<sup><a href=\"#cit22\">22,25</a></sup> led to a maximum <em>R</em><sup>2</sup> score of 0.388 (red in <a href=\"#fig1\">Fig. 1B</a>). When the training set was limited to reactions run on a gram scale, the <em>R</em><sup>2</sup> value dropped further to 0.277, which was attributed to the strong bias of this dataset towards high-yielding reactions.<sup><a href=\"#cit22\">22</a></sup> Similarly, a recent study on the predictions of optimal conditions by Burke and Grzybowski showed that even when limiting the dataset to a single reaction, in their case 16\u2009748 Suzuki\u2013Miyaura reactions curated from the literature, a range of ML models did not perform better than a model based only on the popularity of a set of reaction conditions.<sup><a href=\"#cit26\">26</a></sup> Finally, Reymond and coworkers<sup><a href=\"#cit27\">27</a></sup> constructed a more qualitative \u201cdata-driven cheat-sheet\u201d for the recommendation of conditions for the Buchwald\u2013Hartwig reaction based on a dataset of 62\u2009000 examples from a variety of databases.</p>\n<p>Taken together, these previous findings highlight the challenges in using legacy datasets to train ML yield prediction models. As in other areas of ML, there is a lack of suitable datasets to train and validate the models. Although most of the chemical literature is summarized in commercial databases, they are proprietary. The USPTO, which was converted into a widely used dataset,<sup><a href=\"#cit4\">4</a></sup> and the recently introduced Open Reaction Database<sup><a href=\"#cit28\">28</a></sup> are exceptions. As a result, studies using commercial databases do not include the data the models were built with.<sup><a href=\"#cit27\">27,29</a></sup> Furthermore, databases such as Reaxys frequently do not contain complete reaction information and reflect the bias of the published literature towards high-yielding r...",
