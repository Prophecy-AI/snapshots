However, chemical datasets are often inaccessible to the machine learning community as they tend to require cleaning, thorough understanding of the chemistry, or are simply not available. In this paper, we introduce a novel dataset for yield prediction, providing the first-ever transient flow dataset for machine learning benchmarking, covering over 1200 process conditions. While previous datasets focus on discrete parameters, our experimental set-up allow us to sample a large number of continuous process conditions, generating new challenges for machine learning models. We focus on solvent selection, a task that is particularly difficult to model theoretically and therefore ripe for machine learning applications. We showcase benchmarking for regression algorithms, transfer-learning approaches, feature engineering, and active learning, with important applications towards solvent replacement and sustainable manufacturing.\n## 1Introduction\nMachine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) have showcased enormous potential in empowering the world of the natural sciences: from famous examples such as AlphaFold for protein predictions> [\n[> 1\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib1)> ]\n, to fusion reactor control> [\n[> 2\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib2)> ]\n, disease detection> [\n[> 3\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib3)> ]\n, battery design> [\n[> 4\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib4)> ]\n, and material discovery> [\n[> 5\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib5)> ]\n, among many more. However, we seldom see the machine learning community benchmark new methods in physical science datasets, mostly due to the difficulty in cleaning real-world data, the need for interdisciplinary understanding to correctly benchmark, and most importantly, how expensive the data can be to produce, resulting in many datasets being locked behind closed doors by large companies.\nAIchemy ([https://aichemy.ac.uk](https://aichemy.ac.uk)) is an interdisciplinary UK hub with the mission of transforming the chemistry-AI interface via aiding the collaboration of chemists and AI researchers, as well as addressing gaps in data standards, curation, and availability for AI use. In partnership with SOLVE Chemistry ([https://www.solvechemistry.com](https://www.solvechemistry.com)), we present a first important step into addressing the dataset gap with the introduction of a new and unique open dataset for benchmarking low-data machine learning algorithms for chemistry.\nSolvent selection is one of the biggest challenges for chemical manufacturing, with solvents often being the main source of waste in the manufacturing process> [\n[> 6\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib6)> ]\n. Increased regulation on solvents and a drive to making process manufacturing more sustainable led to an interest in the discovery of greener solvents and for improved solvent replacement tools. However, most of the solvent replacement tools focus purely on learning unsupervised representations of solvents, with the hope that experimentalists can find solvents with similar properties to replace those with environmental concerns. A much stronger approach would consider the interaction of a variety of different solvents with a reaction of interest to directly predict reaction yields, in such a way that the best possible solvent can be selected according to a yield-sustainability trade-off.\nMachine learning approaches have been shown to be a powerful tool for the prediction of chemical reaction conditions. Success has been reported in retro-synthesis> [\n[> 7\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib7)> , [> 8\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib8)> ]\n, condition recommendations> [\n[> 9\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib9)> ]\n, product predictions> [\n[> 10\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib10)> , [> 11\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib11)> ]\n, among others. While yield prediction has proven to be more difficult due to large inconsistencies in procedure and data reporting> [\n[> 12\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib12)> ]\n, we have still seen promising yield prediction results for smaller and more carefully curated datasets> [\n[> 13\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib13)> , [> 14\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib14)> , [> 15\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib15)> , [> 16\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib16)> ]\n. However, these datasets lack the continuous reaction conditions, such as temperature and residence time, that are required to scale-up processes to practical manufacturing conditions.\nIn this paper, we release the first machine-learning-ready transient flow dataset, a framework that allows for quick and efficient screening of continuous reaction conditions. We specifically provide yield data over the uni-molecular allyl substituted catechol reaction, shown in Figure[1](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#S1.F1), with dense measurements across the residence time, temperature, and solvent space. We further showcase how this type ofkinetic dataposes new challenges to current machine learning methods for chemistry, and identify how the challenges can potentially be tackled by the community.\n![Refer to caption](extracted/6524982/figures/Project2_rxn.png)Figure 1:Data was gathered on the rearrangement of allyl substituted catechol. By subjecting the reaction mixture to high temperatures, we begin a cascade reaction forming multiple rearrangement products. We investigate the yield of the reaction for a range of different solvents. Product 1 was not observed and reacted immediately to form Product 2 and later 3.\n### 1.1Related works\nReaction datasets are common in chemistry research, but their suitability for machine learning benchmarking tends to be poor. This can be a result of improper formatting or documentation, incomplete information about reaction conditions or the experimental set-up, or the lack of machine readability, leading to limited usage by the ML community. However, some effort has been made to address this, with the biggest example being the creation of the Open Reaction Database (ORD)> [\n[> 17\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib17)> ]\n, a repository containing over 2M different reactions, many of which come from US patent data (USPTO)> [\n[> 18\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib18)> ]\n. However, the dataset falls short in some aspects, in particular with respect to machine learning readiness and data inconsistencies across reactions.\nORDerly> [\n[> 12\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib12)> ]\nallows for easy cleaning and preparation of ORD data, showing the promise of the dataset for forward and retro-synthetic prediction using transformers; however, it also shows that yield prediction cannot be done well due to data inconsistencies.> Schwaller et\u00a0al.

Traditional machine learning approaches often treat solvent identity as a discrete categorical variable, which prevents systematic interpolation and extrapolation across the solvent space. This work introduces the \\textbf{Catechol Benchmark}, a high-throughput transient flow chemistry dataset comprising 1,227 experimental yield measurements for the rearrangement of allyl-substituted catechol in 24 pure solvents and their binary mixtures, parameterized by continuous volume fractions ($\\% B$). We evaluate various architectures under rigorous leave-one-solvent-out and leave-one-mixture-out protocols to test generalization to unseen chemical environments.\n> Our results demonstrate that classical tabular methods (e.g., Gradient-Boosted Decision Trees) and large language model embeddings (e.g., Qwen-7B) struggle with quantitative precision, yielding Mean Squared Errors (MSE) of 0.099 and 0.129, respectively. In contrast, we propose a hybrid GNN-based architecture that integrates Graph Attention Networks (GATs) with Differential Reaction Fingerprints (DRFP) and learned mixture-aware solvent encodings. This approach achieves an \\textbf{MSE of 0.0039} ($\\pm$ 0.0003), representing a 60\\% error reduction over competitive baselines and a $&gt;25\\times$ improvement over tabular ensembles. Ablation studies confirm that explicit molecular graph message-passing and continuous mixture encoding are essential for robust generalization. The complete dataset, evaluation protocols, and reference implementations are released to facilitate data-efficient reaction prediction and continuous solvent representation learning.

These complexes, which include metal-coordination, hydrogen-bonding, \u03c0-stacking, and other, weaker interactions, are representative of the types of noncovalent interactions that catechols undergo when binding to proteins in the body, such as in the biosynthesis of dopamine. The catechols studied include the neutral catechol and dinitrocatechol molecules, as well as the charged dopamine and DOPAC molecules. Calculations with twenty-one density functional theory methods with triple and quadruple-\u03b6 basis sets are evaluated against the CCSD(T) benchmarks to ascertain their accuracy. It is found that MN15, M06-2X-D3, \u03c9B97XD, \u03c9B97M-V, and CAM-B3LYP-D3 provide good accuracy when compared with CCSD(T)/CBS calculations for these systems and may be used for the study of relevant biological systems. The local DPLNO CCSD(T) method is also evaluated against the CCSD(T)/CBS energies for a subset of the complexes and found to agree within 1\u20133%, with a maximum difference of 0.26 kcal/mol.\nThis publi...",

However, we seldom see the machine learning community bench\u000220 mark new methods in physical science datasets, mostly due to the difficulty in cleaning real-world\n21 data, the need for interdisciplinary understanding to correctly benchmark, and most importantly, how\n22 expensive the data can be to produce, resulting in many datasets being locked behind closed doors by\n23 large companies.\n24 AIchemy (https://aichemy.ac.uk) is an interdisciplinary UK hub with the mission of transform\u000225 ing the chemistry-AI interface via aiding the collaboration of chemists and AI researchers, as well as\n26 addressing gaps in data standards, curation, and availability for AI use.

However, most of the solvent replacement tools\n34 focus purely on learning unsupervised representations of solvents, with the hope that experimentalists\n35 can find solvents with similar properties to replace those with environmental concerns. A much\n36 stronger approach would consider the interaction of a variety of different solvents with a reaction of\n37 interest to directly predict reaction yields, in such a way that the best possible solvent can be selected\n38 according to a yield-sustainability trade-off.\n39 Machine learning approaches have been shown to be a powerful tool for the prediction of chemical\n40 reaction conditions. Success has been reported in retro-synthesis [7, 8], condition recommendations\n41 [9], product predictions [10, 11], among others. While yield prediction has proven to be more difficult\n42 due to large inconsistencies in procedure and data reporting [12], we have still seen promising yield\n43 prediction results for smaller and more carefully curated datasets [13\u201316]. However, these datasets\n44 lack the continuous reaction conditions, such as temperature and residence time, that are required to\n45 scale-up processes to practical manufacturing conditions.\n46 In this paper, we release the first machine-learning-ready transient flow dataset, a framework that\n47 allows for quick and efficient screening of continuous reaction conditions. We specifically provide\n48 yield data over the uni-molecular allyl substituted catechol reaction, shown in Figure 1, with dense\n49 measurements across the residence time, temperature, and solvent space. We answer the call for\n50 more flow chemistry reaction data [17], further showcase how this type of kinetic data poses new\n51 challenges to current machine learning methods for chemistry, and identify potential solutions.\n52 1.1 Related works\n53 Reaction datasets are common in chemistry research, but their suitability for machine learning\n54 benchmarking tends to be poor. This can be a result of improper formatting or documentation,\n55 incomplete information about reaction conditions or the experimental set-up, or the lack of machine\n56 readability, leading to limited usage by the ML community. However, some effort has been made\n57 to address this, with the biggest example being the creation of the Open Reaction Database (ORD)\n58 [18], a repository containing over 2M different reactions, many of which come from US patent data\n59 (USPTO) [19]. However, the dataset falls short in some aspects, in particular with respect to machine\n60 learning readiness and data inconsistencies across reactions.\n61 ORDerly [12] allows for easy cleaning and preparation of ORD data, showing the promise of the\n62 dataset for forward and retro-synthetic prediction using transformers; however, it also shows that\n63 yield prediction cannot be done well due to data inconsistencies. Schwaller et al. [13] drew similar\n64 conclusions when using the USPTO dataset, stating that reaction conditions such as temperature,\n65 concentrations, and duration have a significant effect on yield. The assumption that every reaction in\n66 the dataset is optimized for reaction parameters proved too loose, resulting in inaccurate predictive\n67 models for yield, and highlighting the importance of creating datasets with full (including potentially\n68 sub-optimal) reaction conditions.\n69 More relevant to our work, Perera et al.

The datasets have been used in the benchmarking of Gaussian processes\n73 and Bayesian neural networks [14], deep learning models [13], language-model-based embeddings\n2\n74 [16], data augmentation techniques [23], and Bayesian optimisation [15].
