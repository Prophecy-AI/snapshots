      "text": "Multi\u2011task Gaussian processes (MT\u2011GPs) extend the standard GP surrogate used in Bayesian optimization by learning a **joint covariance** that couples several related prediction tasks\u202f\u2014\u202ffor reaction yield modeling this typically means a new reaction (the target task) and one or more historically measured reactions (auxiliary tasks).  The model shares a common kernel over the chemical\u2011reaction input space while simultaneously learning a free\u2011form covariance matrix that encodes how strongly each task is correlated with the others\u202f([NIPS\u202f2007](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/3189-multi-task-gaussian-process-prediction)).  When the auxiliary reaction is chemically similar, the MT\u2011GP can borrow statistical strength from its larger data set, allowing it to infer the behavior of **unseen compounds** in the target reaction with far fewer direct observations.  \n\nIn practice, the MT\u2011GP is trained on the auxiliary data and the limited data from the new reaction simultaneously.  Because the shared kernel captures common structure (e.g., how substituent electronic or steric features affect yield) and the task\u2011covariance matrix weights the relevance of each auxiliary task, predictions for the target reaction are corrected toward the patterns observed in the related chemistry\u202f([ACS\u202fCent\u202fSci\u202f2023](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acscentsci.3c00050)).  When the auxiliary task closely matches the main task, the surrogate\u2019s mean predictions become markedly more accurate and its uncertainty estimates tighter, which directly improves **generalization to compounds that were never measured**.  \n\nThis transfer learning effect has been demonstrated on real\u2011world medicinal\u2011chemistry campaigns such as Suzuki\u2011Miyaura and C\u2013N couplings, where MT\u2011GP\u2011driven Bayesian optimization reached high\u2011yield conditions in fewer experiments than single\u2011task GP approaches\u202f([ChemRxiv\u202f2023 preprint](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/63d54989bb08ed3ed71ac4fa/original/accelerated-chemical-reaction-optimization-using-multi-task-learning.pdf)).  By leveraging historical reaction data, MT\u2011GPs therefore provide a principled way to extrapolate to novel chemical space, enhancing the reliability of yield predictions for unseen compounds.",

(29) The probabilistic model is trained using experimental data and acts as a surrogate or \u201csimulation\u201d of the real chemical reaction. Given this probabilistic model, the acquisition function estimates the values of different potential experimental reaction conditions. The optimization algorithm is then used to find the set of experimental conditions that maximizes the acquisition function, and these experimental conditions are hence suggested as the next real experiment to run. The combination of the probabilistic model and the acquisition function enables exploitation of known high performance areas and exploration of new chemical space. By iteratively executing the suggested experimental conditions, retraining the model and optimizing the acquisition function, the BO protocol progressively identifies the best reaction conditions for the output of interest.</p><figure><h2>Figure 1</h2><figcaption><p>Figure 1. Schematic description of multitask Bayesian optimization to the context of reaction optimization. (a) Bayesian optimization consists of a probabilistic model (typically a Gaussian process) that predicts experiment outputs (e.g., yield) given experiment conditions; an acquisition function (AF) that predicts the value of potential new experiments; and an optimization algorithm (opt). (b) Multitask Bayesian optimization replaces the Gaussian process with a multitask Gaussian process trained simultaneously on an auxiliary task. In our case, this auxiliary task is a similar reaction to the one being optimized, utilizing previous experimental results. (c) When the auxiliary task for a multitask Gaussian process is similar to the main optimization task, predictions on the main task are improved significantly. (d) When the auxiliary task for a multitask Gaussian process is divergent to the main optimization task, predictions on the main task are similar to what is observed for the baseline single-task Gaussian process.</p></figcaption></figure><p>As shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>b, MTBO changes the probabilistic model in BO. Typically, a Gaussian process (GP) is used as the probabilistic model in BO due to the general applicability and efficiency of GPs in the small data regime. (30) MTBO replaces a GP with a multitask GP that can learn the correlations between different tasks to enable better predictions. In our case, the tasks are chemical transformations from the same reaction class with varying substrates. A formal definition of GPs and multitask GPs is in the <a href=\"#sec4\">Methods section</a>.</p><p>As a simple illustration of the benefits of multitask GPs, we created example functions with one input and one output, then trained both a GP and multitask GP on only three data points. In the multitask GP case, we also generated 25 data points from an auxiliary task. As shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>c, when the main and the auxiliary tasks are similar, the predictions from the multitask GP (shown as samples from the posterior of the GP) more accurately represent the underlying function than the predictions from the single-task GP. The multitask GP leverages covariance between the data in the two tasks to improve predictions on the main task, even with limited data for the main task\u2500this is shown formally in the <a href=\"#sec4\">Methods section</a>. As shown in <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure 1</a>d, when the main and the auxiliary tasks are divergent, predictions from the single-task and multitask GP are highly variable. However, this variability in the multitask GP is still useful because the BO algorithm will explore to better capture the underlying distribution of the main task.</p></div><div><h3> In Silico Case Studies: Suzuki\u2013Miyaura Couplings</h3><p>We first executed <i>in silico</i> MTBO studies using model chemical reactions as benchmarks. These models were generated using neural networks trained on literature experimental data that predict reaction yield; (28) more detail on these models can be found in the <a href=\"#sec4\">Methods section</a>. The model \u201cSuzuki B1\u201d was trained using Suzuki cross-coupling data from Baumgartner et al., (31) while the models \u201cSuzuki R1\u20134\u201d were trained using data from Reizman et al. (32)\u2500these specific transformations and the variables that affect these models are shown in <a href=\"#sch1\">Scheme 1</a>.</p><figure><h2>Scheme 1</h2><figcaption><div><p>Scheme 1.

In each case study, a conventional single-task Bayesian optimization (STBO) benchmark for the Suzuki B1 reaction serves as a comparison. For each MTBO study, 96 data points from the auxiliary task were utilized. The average best yield for each algorithm is shown with a 95% confidence interval over 20 repeated runs.</p><figure><h2>Figure 2</h2><figcaption><p>Figure 2.

However, these give very low yields (&lt;25%), which leads to further exploration of the chemical space, resulting in optimal conditions with P1-L1 (XPhos) and a higher yield than STBO. The additional strength shown by MTBO in this case study is the greater speed in obtaining optimal results.</p><p>In the second case study, when the auxiliary task is Suzuki R2, MTBO appears to perform poorly\u2500this is likely due to the low reactivity observed in Suzuki R2 and a noisy simulation benchmark (see <a href=\"#notes1\">Figure S8</a>). In this case, the best conditions from the training task also do not perform well on the main task, but the yield is moderate enough that it makes further exploration of the chemical space initially difficult in obtaining a better response. This suggests that MTBO may bias the training data in these circumstances when higher yields are possible but not expected, when given very low-yielding auxiliary tasks.</p><p>In the case studies where the auxiliary tasks were Suzuki R3\u20134, the reactivity of the substrates was much more similar in both the main and the training tasks, leading to similar optimal conditions being found.

New technologies such as high-throughput \nexperimentation and self-optimization have the potential to revolutionize synthetic approaches to \nchallenging target molecules in FBDD. Recent work has shown the effectiveness of Bayesian \noptimization (BO) for the self-optimization of chemical reactions, however, in all previous cases these \nalgorithmic procedures have started with no prior information about the reaction of interest. In this \nwork, we explore the use of multi-task Bayesian optimization (MTBO) in several in silico case studies \nby leveraging reaction data collected during related historical optimization campaigns to accelerate\nthe optimization of new reactions - this was performed for Suzuki-Miyaura and C\u2013N couplings. This \nmethodology was then translated to real-world, medicinal chemistry applications in the yield \noptimization of several pharmaceutical intermediates using an autonomous flow-based reactor \nplatform. The use of the MTBO algorithm was shown to be successful in determining optimal \nconditions (both continuous and categorical variables) of unseen experimental C\u2013H activation \nreactions with differing substrates, demonstrating up to a 98 % cost reduction when compared to \nindustry-standard process optimization techniques. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of the \nmethodology as an enabling tool in medicinal chemistry workflows, where efficient utilization of \nprecious starting materials is particularly important. This work represents a step-change in the \nutilization of previously obtained reaction data and machine learning with the ultimate goal of \naccelerated reaction optimization.\nIntroduction\nIn recent years, there has been an increased interest in the use of automated, self-optimizing \ncontinuous flow platforms for the optimization of chemical processes.[1-5] These platforms use\nautomated reactors and machine-learning algorithms to learn from previous experiments, and\nthereby choose future experiments that ultimately maximize yield and/or other process objectives. \nThe use of self-optimizing platforms has arisen from the desire for faster reaction optimization, \nimproved process sustainability and cheaper overall process development.[6-9] The use of these \nplatforms aims to enhance the capabilities of the researcher by removing the need for repetitive and \nlabor-intensive experimentation, allowing them to focus on more challenging tasks. By leveraging\nalgorithms, the platforms utilize only minimal reaction material but gain the most process information \npossible, making their deployment in fine chemical and pharmaceutical industries very attractive.[10, \n11]\n2\nRecent work has shown that Bayesian optimization is a particularly powerful tool for self\u0002optimization applications.[12-14] However, in all previous studies, each optimization begins with no a \npriori information about the chemical landscape for the reaction of interest. This protocol therefore \nrequires initial experimental iterations whereby the algorithm is learning about the experimental \ndesign space, without any prior information on where the optimal reaction conditions may be. This \ninitial exploration can be expensive in terms of both cost and time, particularly when there may \nalready be data on the broad chemical transformation of interest from previous optimization \ncampaigns. This also opens the methodology to some uncertainty over which initial design strategy to \nuse, such as forms of factorial design or Latin Hypercube sampling (LHS), which will affect the overall \nexperimental budget. General well-performing reaction conditions can also be identified for particular \nreaction classes, as highlighted in recent work by Angello et al.,\n[15] but do not give optimal conditions \nfor specific transformations and cannot account for important parameters such as reactor \nheterogeneity, solubility, reaction selectivity, differences in substrate functionality or further adjacent\nobjectives (E-factor, purification, downstream processing etc.).\nFor many medicinal chemistry applications, such as in developing chemistries for the synthesis \nof potential drug candidates, the use of efficient optimization techniques is paramount due to the \nminimal quantity and increased preciousness of intermediate reaction materials.[16, 17] This is a \nparticular problem in fragment-based drug discovery (FBDD),[18, 19] as challenging transformations are \noften required on highly functionalized molecules - including difficult C\u2013C forming reactions utilizing\nprecise C\u2013H activations which ideally must be executable in the presence of polar groups that are \nrequired for binding to the target protein.\n[20] The excessive material consumption when utilizing \nexisting algorithms may also be a reason that medicinal chemists are less attracted to these cutting\u0002edge optimization techniques than process chemists. Our hypothesis is that optimization strategies\nthat can utilize pre-existing chemical knowledge could mitigate unnecessary material use, accelerate \nprocess development and present the potential for broader applicability in new synthetic chemistry \nmethods.\nThis work shows the first real-world examples of leveraging previous reaction optimization \ndata for unseen chemical transformations using multi-task Bayesian optimization (MTBO), with our\nprior work on MTBO for chemistry only showcasing its use in a simulated setting.\n[21] The framework of \nMTBO, first introduced by Swerksy et al.,\n[22] replaces the standard probabilistic model in Bayesian \noptimization with a multi-task model. As these multi-task models can be trained on data from related \ntasks, we can therefore utilize data from previously conducted similar reactions - both from the \nlaboratory and from the literature. In this work, we first explore and benchmark the use of MTBO in \nsimulated studies, then exploit the methodology to optimize several pharmaceutically relevant C\u2013H\nactivation reactions using an autonomous flow reactor platform. These experimental case studies \nwere chosen to highlight the effectiveness of MTBO in a medicinal chemistry, particularly FBDD,\ncontext through efficient material usage. There are many reports of similar automated workflows in \nthe recent literature where a self-optimization protocol is utilized.\n[23, 24] Our reactor platform is \nequipped with a liquid handling robot and can optimize both continuous variables (residence time, \ntemperature etc.) and categorical variables (solvent, ligand etc.). This ability is seldom reported in the \nliterature (with some notable examples from several research groups[1, 25-27]), likely due to engineering \nand equipment challenges, but is very important in determining all relevant parameters that influence \nreaction outcomes. The MTBO algorithm utilized is integrated into the open-source reaction \noptimization package Summit[28] and represents a powerful data-driven optimization ...",

This al- lows for good \ufb02exibility when modelling inter-task dependencies while avoiding the need for large amounts of data for training. We show that under the assump- tion of noise-free observations and a block design, predictions for a given task only depend on its target values and therefore a cancellation of inter-task trans- fer occurs. We evaluate the bene\ufb01ts of our model on two practical applications: a compiler performance prediction problem and an exam score prediction task.

This study systematically evaluates the training and testing performance of four prominent surrogate models\u2014conventional Gaussian processes (cGP), Deep Gaussian processes (DGP), encoder-decoder neural networks for multi-output regression and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)\u2014applied to a hybrid dataset of experimental and computational properties of the 8-component HEA system Al-Co-Cr-Cu-Fe-Mn-Ni-V. We specifically assess their capabilities in predicting correlated material properties, including yield strength, hardness, modulus, ultimate tensile strength, elongation, and average hardness under dynamic/quasi-static conditions, alongside auxiliary computational properties. The comparison highlights the strengths of hierarchical deep modeling approaches in handling heteroscedastic, heterotopic, and incomplete data commonly encountered in materials science. Our findings illustrate that combined surrogate models such as DGPs infused with machine-learned priors outperform other surrogates by effectively capturing inter-property correlations and by assimilating prior knowledge. This enhanced predictive accuracy positions the combined surrogate models as powerful tools for robust and data-efficient materials design.\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n![](https://media.springernature.com/w215h120/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41529-025-00632-4/MediaObjects/41529_2025_632_Fig1_HTML.png)\n### [Corrosion resistance prediction of high-entropy alloys: framework and knowledge graph-driven method integrating composition, processing, and crystal structure](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41529-025-00632-4?fromPaywallRec=false)\nArticleOpen access04 July 2025\n![](https://media.springernature.com/w215h120/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41524-025-01560-2/MediaObjects/41524_2025_1560_Fig1_HTML.png)\n### [Elemental numerical descriptions to enhance classification and regression model performance for high-entropy alloys](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-025-01560-2?fromPaywallRec=false)\nArticleOpen access18 March 2025\n![](https://media.springernature.com/w215h120/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-023-31461-7/MediaObjects/41598_2023_31461_Fig1_HTML.png)\n### [Phase prediction and experimental realisation of a new high entropy alloy using machine learning](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-31461-7?fromPaywallRec=false)\nArticleOpen access23 March 2023\n## Introduction\nHigh-entropy alloys (HEAs) are multicomponent alloys with five or more principal elements in high concentrations that offer a vast compositional design space and often exhibit exceptional mechanical properties[1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-025-01811-2#ref-CR1),[2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-025-01811-2#ref-CR2). The exploration of this space is challenged by limited experimental data and complex composition-property relationships[1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-025-01811-2#ref-CR1),[3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-025-01811-2#ref-CR3). Accordingly, data-driven surrogate models have become invaluable in accelerating HEA discovery by predicting material properties[3](#ref-CR3),[4](#ref-CR4),[5](#ref-CR5),[6](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-025-01811-2#ref-CR6).\nSurrogate models serve as computationally efficient approximations of complex structure-property relationships and are widely used to accelerate materials discovery. Gaussian processes (GPs) provide calibrated uncertainty estimates, making them effective for sparse, high-fidelity datasets[7](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-025-01811-2#ref-CR7), while multi-task extensions and co-kriging allow for correlated output modeling[8](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-025-01811-2#ref-CR8). Deep Gaussian Processes (DGPs) extend this capability to hierarchical, nonlinear functions[9](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-025-01811-2#ref-CR9), offering a potential advantage in capturing complex material behavior. In contrast, tree-based methods like eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)[10](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-025-01811-2#ref-CR10)or encoder-decoder mapping of inputs to outputs[11](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-025-01811-2#ref-CR11)are often easier to scale and tune but lack native uncertainty quantification unless modified. As a result, model selection should be guided by data availability, dimensionality, and the need for uncertainty modeling in the optimization loop. Hybrid modeling strategies that combine the strengths of neural networks (for representation learning) and probabilistic models (for uncertainty quantification) offer a promising path forward\u2013leveraging expressive power while retaining decision-making confidence in sparse-data regimes.\nRecent studies have combined machine learning with high-throughput calculations and ...",

Our calculations demonstrate that ARGP regression improves the prediction error of a five-point GP regression by two orders of magnitude for an N2 dissociation curve and reproduces the energy surface of H2O with sub-chemical accuracy, using only 25 training points.",

The efficacy of such models depends heavily on the representation of chemical reactions, which has commonly been learned from SMILES or graphs of molecules using deep neural networks. However, the progression of chemical reactions is inherently determined by the molecular 3D geometric properties, which have been recently highlighted as crucial features in accurately predicting molecular properties and chemical reactions. Additionally, large-scale pre-training has been shown to be essential in enhancing the generalization capability of complex deep learning models. Based on these considerations, we propose the Reaction Multi-View Pre-training (ReaMVP) framework, which leverages self-supervised learning techniques and a two-stage pre-training strategy to predict chemical reaction yields. By incorporating multi-view learning with 3D geometric information, ReaMVP achieves state-of-the-art performance on two benchmark datasets. Notably, the experimental results indicate that ReaMVP has a significant advantage in predicting out-of-sample data, suggesting an enhanced generalization ability to predict new reactions. Scientific Contribution: This study presents the ReaMVP framework, which improves the generalization capability of machine learning models for predicting chemical reaction yields. By integrating sequential and geometric views and leveraging self-supervised learning techniques with a two-stage pre-training strategy, ReaMVP achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets. The framework demonstrates superior predictive ability for out-of-sample data and enhances the prediction of new reactions.\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n![](https://media.springernature.com/w215h120/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1186%2Fs13321-024-00818-z/MediaObjects/13321_2024_818_Fig1_HTML.png)\n### [Improving chemical reaction yield prediction using pre-trained graph neural networks](https://link.springer.com/10.1186/s13321-024-00818-z?fromPaywallRec=true)\nArticleOpen access01 March 2024\n![](https://media.springernature.com/w215h120/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1186%2Fs13321-024-00805-4/MediaObjects/13321_2024_805_Figa_HTML.png)\n### [Enhancing chemical synthesis: a two-stage deep neural network for predicting feasible reaction conditions](https://link.springer.com/10.1186/s13321-024-00805-4?fromPaywallRec=true)\nArticleOpen access24 January 2024\n![](https://media.springernature.com/w215h120/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-024-55082-4/MediaObjects/41467_2024_55082_Fig1_HTML.png)\n### [Multi-channel learning for integrating structural hierarchies into context-dependent molecular representation](https://link.springer.com/10.1038/s41467-024-55082-4?fromPaywallRec=true)\nArticleOpen access06 January 2025\n### Explore related subjects\nDiscover the latest articles, books and news in related subjects, suggested using machine learning.\n* [Biochemical Reaction Network](https://link.springer.com/subjects/biochemical-reaction-network)\n* [Process Chemistry](https://link.springer.com/subjects/process-chemistry)\n* [Reactive Precursor](https://link.springer.com/subjects/reactive-precursor)\n* [Reaction Kinetics](https://link.springer.com/subjects/reaction-kinetics)\n* [Reaction Mechanisms](https://link.springer.com/subjects/reaction-mechanisms)\n* [Structure Prediction](https://link.springer.com/subjects/structure-prediction)\n[Use our pre-submission checklist](https://beta.springernature.com/pre-submission?journalId=13321)\nAvoid common mistakes on your manuscript.\n## Introduction\nThe prediction of chemical reaction yields, which refer to the percentage of product formed in relation to the reactant consumed, is an important research topic in organic chemistry [[1](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13321-024-00815-2#ref-CR1),[2](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13321-024-00815-2#ref-CR2)]. In the field of organic synthesis, chemists often synthesize a target molecule through several or a dozen reaction steps [[3](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13321-024-00815-2#ref-CR3)]. Consequently, low-yield reactions in the intermediate steps can have a negative impact on the total yield of the synthesis route due to the cumulative effect of each step. The estimation of chemical reaction yields plays an important role in guiding synthetic chemists to choose appropriate molecular synthesis routes, particularly in the case of identifying highly active and selective catalysts efficiently. Traditionally, chemists depend on empirical predictions or specific wet experiments to determine yields, which require extensive domain knowledge and are both time-consuming and labor-intensive. Therefore, data-driven machine learning techniques are needed to provide an efficient alternative.\nIt remains a great challenge to accurately predict chemical reaction yields due to the complexity of reaction space and the diverse factors that influence chemical experiments [[4](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13321-024-00815-2#ref-CR4),[5](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13321-024-00815-2#ref-CR5)]. To develop machine learning-based approaches, it is crucial to establish effective methods for representing chemical reactions. Conventional studies typically rely on feature engineering to represent chemical reactions using fingerprints or descriptors. This involves creating customized descriptors based on domain expertise to capture molecular, atomic, vibrational, or physicochemical properties [[6](#ref-CR6),[7](#ref-CR7),[8](#ref-CR8),[9](#ref-CR9),[10](#ref-CR10),[11](#ref-CR11),[12](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13321-024-00815-2#ref-CR12)]. Some researchers derived descriptors from circular substructures present in the simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES) [[13](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13321-024-00815-2#ref-CR13)] strings of the reactions [[14](https:/...",

New technologies such as high-throughput experimentation and self-optimization have the potential to revolutionize synthetic approaches to challenging target molecules in FBDD. Recent work has shown the effectiveness of Bayesian optimization (BO) for the self-optimization of chemical reactions, however, in all previous cases these algorithmic procedures have started with no prior information about the reaction of interest. In this work, we explore the use of multi-task Bayesian optimization (MTBO) in several in silico case studies by leveraging reaction data collected during related historical optimization campaigns to accelerate the optimization of new reactions - this was performed for Suzuki-Miyaura and C\u2013N couplings. This methodology was then translated to real-world, medicinal chemistry applications in the yield optimization of several pharmaceutical intermediates using an autonomous flow-based reactor platform. The use of the MTBO algorithm was shown to be successful in determining optimal conditions (both continuous and categorical variables) of unseen experimental C\u2013H activation reactions with differing substrates, demonstrating up to a 98 % cost reduction when compared to industry-standard process optimization techniques. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of the methodology as an enabling tool in medicinal chemistry workflows, where efficient utilization of precious starting materials is particularly important. This work represents a step-change in the utilization of previously obtained reaction data and machine learning with the ultimate goal of accelerated reaction optimization.\n\n## Keywords\n\n[multi-task learning](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/search-dashboard?keywords=multi-task%20learning)\n\n[c-h activation](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/search-dashboard?keywords=c-h%20activation)\n\n[machine learning](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/search-dashboard?keywords=machine%20learning)\n\n## Comments\n\nYou are signed in as .
