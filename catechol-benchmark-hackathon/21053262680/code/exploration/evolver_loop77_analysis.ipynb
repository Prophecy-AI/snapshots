    "\n",
    "1. **Same feature space**: All models use Spange + DRFP + ACS PCA features\n",
    "2. **Same validation**: Leave-one-solvent-out / Leave-one-ramp-out\n",
    "3. **Same extrapolation problem**: Test solvents are fundamentally different from training\n",

    "## What the Benchmark Paper Did Differently\n",
    "\n",
    "The benchmark achieved 25x better performance by:\n",
    "1. **Graph representation**: Treating molecules as graphs, not feature vectors\n",
    "2. **Attention mechanism**: Learning which atoms/bonds matter for each prediction\n",
    "3. **Message passing**: Propagating information through molecular structure\n",

    "### Priority 1: Proper Graph Attention Network (GAT)\n",
    "- Use PyTorch Geometric's GATConv instead of GCNConv\n",
    "- Multi-head attention (4-8 heads)\n",
    "- Integrate DRFP as node features\n",

    "- Detect when we're extrapolating (high uncertainty)\n",
    "- Blend predictions toward training mean for extrapolation cases\n",
    "\n",
    "### Priority 3: Domain Adaptation\n",
    "- Use adversarial training to make train/test features indistinguishable\n",
