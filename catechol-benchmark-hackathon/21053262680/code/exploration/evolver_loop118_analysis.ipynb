    "- All major model families (MLP, LGBM, XGB, CatBoost, GP, Ridge, RF, GNN)\n",
    "- All major feature representations (Spange, DRFP, Morgan, Arrhenius, ChemBERTa)\n",
    "- All major distribution shift strategies (similarity weighting, conservative extrapolation, pseudo-labeling)\n",

    "1. **DO NOT** continue optimizing CV - it won't help\n",
    "2. **FOCUS ON** changing the CV-LB relationship\n",

    "   - GroupKFold-based training\n",

    "## Critical Reminder:\n",
    "- Only 3 submissions remaining\n",
    "- Each submission should test a FUNDAMENTALLY different approach\n",
    "- The goal is to CHANGE the CV-LB relationship, not improve CV"
