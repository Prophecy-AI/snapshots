    "# Loop 86 Analysis: Critical Assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Facts:\n",
    "1. **86 experiments completed**, all falling on the same CV-LB line\n",
    "2. **Best CV**: 0.008092 (exp_049 CatBoost+XGBoost)\n",
    "3. **Best LB**: 0.0877 (exp_030)\n",
    "4. **Target**: 0.0347\n",
    "5. **CV-LB relationship**: LB = 4.31 * CV + 0.0525 (R² = 0.95)\n",
    "6. **CRITICAL**: Intercept (0.0525) > Target (0.0347)\n",
    "\n",
    "## This Loop's Findings:\n",
    "- Pseudo-labeling: Made things WORSE (CV=0.008853 vs baseline 0.008092)\n",
    "- Self-training: 9.4% worse than baseline\n",
    "- Conservative predictions: Also made things worse\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Fundamental Problem:\n",
    "The CV-LB intercept (0.0525) is HIGHER than the target (0.0347). This means:\n",
    "- Even with PERFECT CV=0, expected LB would be 0.0525\n",
    "- Required CV to hit target = (0.0347 - 0.0525) / 4.31 = -0.0041 (IMPOSSIBLE!)"

    "\n",
    "### Priority 1: Ratio-Based Predictions\n",
    "Instead of predicting SM, P2, P3 directly, predict:\n",
    "- Conversion = 1 - SM\n",
    "- Selectivity_P2 = P2 / (P2 + P3)\n",
    "\n",
    "Then derive:\n",
    "- SM = 1 - Conversion\n",
    "- P2 = Conversion * Selectivity_P2\n",
    "- P3 = Conversion * (1 - Selectivity_P2)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this might work:**\n",
    "- Conversion and selectivity are more fundamental chemical quantities\n",
    "- They might generalize better to unseen solvents\n",
    "- Mass balance is automatically satisfied\n",
    "\n",
    "### Priority 2: Physics-Informed Loss\n",
    "Add penalty terms to the loss function:\n",
    "- Mass balance penalty: (SM + P2 + P3 - 1)^2\n",
    "- Monotonicity penalty: penalize if yield decreases with time\n",
    "\n",
    "### Priority 3: Adversarial Validation\n",
    "Train a classifier to distinguish train vs test solvents:\n",
    "- If classifier can distinguish, there's distribution shift\n",
    "- Features with high importance in classifier are causing the shift\n",
    "- Can guide feature selection or weighting"
