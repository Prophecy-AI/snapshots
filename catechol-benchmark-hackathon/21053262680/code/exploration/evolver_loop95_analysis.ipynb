    "## Why the Target is Unreachable with Current Approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **The intercept (0.0528) represents structural distribution shift**\n",
    "   - Even with perfect CV (0.0), the expected LB would be 0.0528\n",
    "   - This is 52% higher than the target (0.0347)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **All model families fall on the same line**\n",
    "   - MLP, LGBM, XGB, CatBoost, GP, Ridge, RF - all tested\n",
    "   - Different features (Spange, DRFP, ACS-PCA, fragprints) - all tested\n",
    "   - Different architectures - all tested\n",
    "   - Result: Same CV-LB relationship\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **The problem is NOT model quality**\n",
    "   - It's the REPRESENTATION of solvents\n",
    "   - Tabular features cannot capture molecular structure for unseen solvents\n",
    "   - The test solvents are structurally different from training solvents"

    "\n",
    "1. **Graph Attention Networks (GATs)** for molecular graph message-passing\n",
    "2. **Differential Reaction Fingerprints (DRFP)** as additional features\n",

    "1. **Model class mismatch**: Submission cells used different model class than CV computation\n",

    "1. **Verify model class consistency** in submission cells\n",
    "2. **Implement proper GAT architecture** as described in the benchmark paper\n",
    "3. **Integrate DRFP features** with the graph representation\n",
