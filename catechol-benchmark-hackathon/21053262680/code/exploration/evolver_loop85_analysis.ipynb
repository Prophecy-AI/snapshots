    "# Loop 85 Analysis: Critical Assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Facts:\n",
    "1. **85 experiments completed**, all falling on the same CV-LB line\n",
    "2. **Best CV**: 0.008092 (exp_049 CatBoost+XGBoost)\n",
    "3. **Best LB**: 0.0877 (exp_030)\n",
    "4. **Target**: 0.0347\n",
    "5. **CV-LB relationship**: LB = 4.29 * CV + 0.0528 (R² = 0.95)\n",
    "6. **CRITICAL**: Intercept (0.0528) > Target (0.0347)\n",
    "\n",
    "## This Loop's Findings:\n",
    "- ChemProp features: CV=0.011841 (46% WORSE than baseline)\n",
    "- Pseudo-labeling: Made things worse (blend factor 0 was best)\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Fundamental Problem:\n",
    "The CV-LB intercept (0.0528) is HIGHER than the target (0.0347). This means:\n",
    "- Even with PERFECT CV=0, expected LB would be 0.0528\n",
    "- Required CV to hit target = (0.0347 - 0.0528) / 4.29 = -0.0042 (IMPOSSIBLE!)\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Has Been Tried (and Failed):\n",
    "1. ✅ MLP variants (50+ experiments)\n",
    "2. ✅ LightGBM, XGBoost, CatBoost ensembles\n",
    "3. ✅ Gaussian Processes\n",
    "4. ✅ GNN from scratch (CV=0.024, 3x worse)\n",
    "5. ✅ ChemBERTa embeddings (CV=0.015, 2x worse)\n",
    "6. ✅ ChemProp features (CV=0.012, 46% worse)\n",
    "7. ✅ Pseudo-labeling (made things worse)\n",
    "8. ✅ Similarity weighting (LB=0.145, BACKFIRED)\n",
    "9. ✅ Yield normalization (no effect)\n",
    "10. ✅ Conservative predictions (no improvement)"

    "   - Importance weighting based on similarity to test distribution\n",
    "   - Domain-adversarial training\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Physics-Informed Constraints**\n",
    "   - Enforce mass balance: SM + Product2 + Product3 ≈ 1\n",
    "   - Enforce monotonicity: Yield should increase with time (at fixed T)\n",
    "   - Enforce Arrhenius: Temperature dependence should follow Arrhenius law\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Calibration / Post-Processing**\n",
    "   - Isotonic regression on predictions\n",
    "   - Platt scaling\n",
    "   - Temperature scaling\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Different Validation Strategy**\n",
    "   - The evaluator suggested GroupKFold(5) but this is incompatible with competition format\n",
    "   - However, we could try DIFFERENT WEIGHTING of single vs full data\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Ensemble of Fundamentally Different Approaches**\n",
