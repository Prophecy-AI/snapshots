    "# Loop 80 Analysis: Submission Failure Diagnosis\n",

    "**CRITICAL FINDING:** The GroupKFold(5) submission failed because the evaluation metric expects Leave-One-Out validation structure (24 folds for single solvent, 13 folds for full data), NOT GroupKFold(5).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **GroupKFold(5) is INCOMPATIBLE with the competition evaluation**\n",
    "   - The competition requires Leave-One-Out validation\n",
    "   - Submission must have 24 folds for single solvent, 13 folds for full data\n",
    "   - GroupKFold(5) produces only 5 folds → evaluation fails\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **The \"mixall\" kernel approach cannot be used directly**\n",
    "   - The kernel may work on Kaggle with different evaluation\n",
    "   - Our competition requires strict Leave-One-Out structure\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **CV-LB Relationship Analysis (from 12 submissions)**\n",
    "   - Linear fit: LB = 4.29 * CV + 0.0528 (R² = 0.95)\n",
    "   - Intercept (0.0528) > Target (0.0347)\n",
    "   - Required CV to hit target: -0.0042 (IMPOSSIBLE with current approaches)"
