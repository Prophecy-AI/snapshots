## What I Understood

The junior researcher implemented experiment 056 (logged as exp_057), which uses a **Per-Target Model Selection** approach inspired by the public kernel "catechol-strategy-to-get-0-11161" (LB 0.11161). The key innovation is using different model types for different targets:
- SM (hardest target): HistGradientBoostingRegressor
- Product 2, Product 3 (easier targets): ExtraTreesRegressor
- Weighted ensemble: 0.65 * ACS + 0.35 * Spange features

The hypothesis was that target-specific models might change the CV-LB relationship by better handling the different difficulty levels of each target.

## Strategic Assessment

### CV-LB Relationship Analysis

Based on 12 successful submissions with actual LB scores:

| Exp | CV | LB |
|-----|------|------|
| exp_010 | 0.008829 | 0.0932 |
| exp_011 | 0.008785 | 0.0932 |
| exp_014 | 0.009011 | 0.0913 |
| exp_025 | 0.009068 | 0.0893 |
| exp_026 | 0.008465 | 0.0893 |
| exp_030 | 0.008298 | 0.0887 |
| exp_031 | 0.009179 | 0.0877 |
| exp_032 | 0.008194 | 0.0877 |

**Key observations:**
- Best LB achieved: **0.0877** (exp_031, exp_032)
- Best CV achieved: **0.008092** (exp_049-053, but submissions failed)
- Target: **0.0347**
- Current exp_057 CV: **0.009263**

The CV-LB relationship is weaker than previously thought (R² ≈ 0.09), which is actually GOOD news - it means there's variance in LB that could be exploited with the right approach.

### Approach Fit

The per-target model selection approach is **strategically sound**:
1. **Addresses target heterogeneity**: SM is consistently the hardest target (highest variance, most outliers)
2. **Uses proven public kernel approach**: The original kernel achieved LB 0.11161
3. **Combines complementary features**: 0.65 * ACS + 0.35 * Spange provides diverse information

However, the CV (0.009263) is **worse than the best achieved** (0.008092), suggesting the approach may not be optimal for this dataset.

### Effort Allocation

**What's been tried:**
- ✓ Feature engineering (Spange, ACS, DRFP, fragprints, Arrhenius kinetics)
- ✓ Model selection (MLP, LGBM, XGB, CatBoost, GP, Ridge, HGB, ETR)
- ✓ Ensemble methods (weighted averaging, bagging)
- ✓ Per-target models
- ✓ Hyperparameter tuning

**What's NOT been tried or fully explored:**
1. **Solvent-specific error analysis**: Which solvents cause the most error? Are there patterns?
2. **Conservative predictions for outlier solvents**: Blend toward population mean when extrapolating
3. **Uncertainty-weighted predictions with proper implementation**: The IWCV attempt (exp_052) failed
4. **Stacking ensemble**: Use out-of-fold predictions as meta-features

### Assumptions Being Made

1. **Same model architecture works for all solvents** - NOT validated, likely FALSE
2. **Linear mixing of solvent features works for mixtures** - Partially validated
3. **The CV-LB gap is fixed** - NOT validated, different approaches might change it

### Blind Spots

1. **The public kernel achieved LB 0.11161, which is WORSE than our best LB 0.0877**. This suggests the per-target approach may not be optimal for this competition.

2. **The best LB (0.0877) was achieved with GP+MLP+LGBM ensemble (exp_032)**, not with per-target models. This approach should be revisited.

3. **Recent submissions (exp_049-055) have been failing** with "Evaluation metric raised an unexpected error". This is a critical issue that needs investigation.

## What's Working

1. **Correct submission format**: 24 folds for single, 13 folds for full - matches official template
2. **Per-target model selection**: Addresses the heterogeneity of targets
3. **Feature combination**: 0.65 * ACS + 0.35 * Spange provides diverse information
4. **Clean implementation**: Code follows official template structure

## Key Concerns

### CRITICAL: CV Regression from Best

**Observation**: Current CV (0.009263) is 14% worse than best CV (0.008092) achieved in earlier experiments.

**Why it matters**: The per-target approach from the public kernel may not be optimal for this dataset. The public kernel achieved LB 0.11161, which is worse than our best LB 0.0877.

**Suggestion**: Consider combining the best features from earlier experiments:
- Use the GP+MLP+LGBM ensemble from exp_032 (best LB 0.0877)
- But with the per-target weighting for the SM target

### HIGH: Gap to Target is Still Large

**Observation**: Best LB achieved is 0.0877, target is 0.0347. This is a 2.5x gap.

**Why it matters**: We need to find approaches that can close this gap significantly.

**Suggestion**: Focus on approaches that could fundamentally change the prediction quality:
1. **Solvent clustering**: Group solvents by chemical class and use class-specific models
2. **Outlier handling**: Identify and handle outlier solvents (HFIP, TFE, Water) differently
3. **Ensemble stacking**: Use out-of-fold predictions as meta-features

### MEDIUM: Public Kernel Performance

**Observation**: The public kernel "catechol-strategy-to-get-0-11161" achieved LB 0.11161, which is worse than our best LB 0.0877.

**Why it matters**: Copying this approach directly may not improve our score.

**Suggestion**: Analyze what made exp_032 (GP+MLP+LGBM) achieve the best LB and combine those insights with the per-target approach.

## Top Priority for Next Experiment

**SUBMIT THIS EXPERIMENT** - The submission format is correct and should be accepted. This will provide valuable LB feedback.

**THEN: Revisit the Best Performing Approach**

The best LB (0.0877) was achieved with exp_032 (GP+MLP+LGBM ensemble with weights 0.15/0.55/0.30). This approach should be revisited and potentially combined with:

1. **Per-target weighting**: Give more weight to models that perform well on specific targets
2. **Solvent-specific handling**: Identify outlier solvents and handle them differently
3. **Stacking ensemble**: Use out-of-fold predictions as meta-features

**Concrete next steps:**
1. Submit exp_057 to get LB feedback
2. If LB is worse than 0.0877, revert to exp_032 approach
3. Analyze per-solvent errors to identify which solvents cause the most error
4. Implement solvent-specific handling for outliers

## Summary

The junior researcher has implemented a well-structured per-target model selection approach based on a public kernel. The submission format is correct and should be accepted by the evaluation system.

However, the CV (0.009263) is worse than the best achieved (0.008092), and the public kernel this is based on achieved LB 0.11161, which is worse than our best LB 0.0877.

**The path forward should focus on:**
1. Submitting this experiment to get LB feedback
2. Revisiting the best-performing approach (GP+MLP+LGBM ensemble)
3. Analyzing per-solvent errors to identify patterns
4. Implementing targeted improvements for outlier solvents

**THE TARGET IS REACHABLE** - but it requires finding approaches that can close the 2.5x gap between current best LB (0.0877) and target (0.0347). This likely requires fundamentally different strategies beyond incremental improvements.
