    "### The Intercept Problem\n",
    "1. **CV-LB relationship**: LB = 4.31 * CV + 0.0525 (R² = 0.95)\n",
    "2. **Intercept (0.0525) > Target (0.0347)**: Even with CV=0, predicted LB would be 0.0525\n",
    "3. **ALL approaches fall on the same line**: MLP, LGBM, XGB, GP, CatBoost - all follow the same pattern\n",
    "4. **This is STRUCTURAL distribution shift**: The test solvents are fundamentally different from training\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We've Tried (51 experiments)\n",
    "- Model architectures: MLP, LGBM, XGBoost, GP, RF, GNN, ChemBERTa, CatBoost\n",
    "- Feature sets: Spange, DRFP, fragprints, ACS PCA, ChemBERTa embeddings\n",
    "- Ensemble strategies: weighted, adaptive, diverse\n",
    "- Feature engineering: polynomial, interaction, non-linear mixture\n",
    "- Regularization: dropout, weight decay, mean reversion\n",
    "- Uncertainty-based approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Could Change the Intercept\n",
    "1. **Graph Neural Networks with proper architecture** (not simple GNN)\n",
    "2. **3D geometric information** (conformer embeddings)\n",
    "3. **Multi-view pre-training** (ReaMVP-style)\n",
    "4. **Importance-weighted CV** (IWCV)\n",
    "5. **Domain adaptation techniques**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommendation\n",
    "The target (0.0347) appears to require a fundamentally different approach than what we've tried. The benchmark paper achieved MSE 0.0039 with GNNs, suggesting that graph-based methods with proper architecture could work.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, implementing a proper GNN from scratch in a competition setting is challenging. The most practical path forward is to:\n",
    "1. Submit exp_050 to verify the CV-LB relationship holds\n",
    "2. Try IWCV to potentially change the intercept\n",
    "3. Study the benchmark paper's GNN approach more carefully"
