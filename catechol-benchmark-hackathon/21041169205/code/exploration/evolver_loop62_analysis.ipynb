    "1. 7 consecutive submissions failed with evaluation errors (exp_049-057)\n",
    "2. CV-LB relationship: LB = 4.31*CV + 0.0525 (intercept > target)\n",

    "## Key Insights from Public Kernels:\n",
    "1. **mixall kernel** uses GroupKFold (5 splits) instead of Leave-One-Out\n",
    "2. **System Malfunction V1** has 29 votes - simple MLP approach\n",
    "3. Both kernels follow the official template structure"
