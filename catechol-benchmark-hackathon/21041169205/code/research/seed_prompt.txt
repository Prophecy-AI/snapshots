## Current Status
- Best CV score: 0.0081 from exp_049/050 (CatBoost+XGBoost)
- Best LB score: 0.0877 from exp_030 (GP+MLP+LGBM ensemble)
- Target: 0.0347 | Gap to target: 0.0530 (153% above target)

## CV-LB Relationship Analysis (CRITICAL)
- Linear fit: LB = 4.31 * CV + 0.0525 (R² = 0.95)
- Intercept interpretation: Even at CV=0, expected LB is 0.0525
- Are all approaches on the same line? YES
- Required CV for target: (0.0347 - 0.0525) / 4.31 = -0.0041 (IMPOSSIBLE)

**CRITICAL INSIGHT:** The intercept (0.0525) is HIGHER than the target (0.0347). This means the target is MATHEMATICALLY UNREACHABLE by improving CV alone. We MUST find approaches that CHANGE the CV-LB relationship (reduce the intercept).

## Response to Evaluator
- Technical verdict was TRUSTWORTHY for exp_057.
- Evaluator correctly identified that exp_057 CV (0.009524) is WORSE than best CV (0.008092).
- Evaluator's top priority: Submit exp_057 to get LB feedback, then return to best approach if worse.
- Key concern: The CV-LB intercept problem means we need fundamentally different approaches.

**CRITICAL ISSUE:** exp_056 (per_target_model) failed with "Evaluation metric raised an unexpected error". The submission format looks correct (1883 rows, 24+13 folds, all targets in [0,1]). This is the 7th+ consecutive submission failure (exp_049-056 all failed).

## Data Understanding
- Reference notebooks: See `exploration/eda.ipynb` for feature analysis
- Key patterns: Leave-one-solvent-out CV simulates predicting unseen solvents
- The test set likely contains "harder" solvents (more extreme properties)
- SM target is consistently the hardest to predict

## Recommended Approaches

### IMMEDIATE PRIORITY: Fix Submission Failures

The last 7+ submissions have failed with "Evaluation metric raised an unexpected error". This is blocking all progress. We need to:

1. **Regenerate submission from exp_030** (best LB 0.0877) - This submission worked before
2. **Compare submission formats** between working (exp_030) and failing (exp_056) submissions
3. **Check for subtle format differences** that might cause evaluation errors

### SECONDARY: Approaches to Change CV-LB Relationship

If we can fix the submission issue, focus on approaches that reduce the intercept:

1. **Extrapolation Detection + Conservative Predictions**
   - Add features measuring solvent distance to training distribution
   - When extrapolating, blend predictions toward population mean
   - This should reduce error on "hard" test solvents

2. **Uncertainty-Weighted Predictions**
   - Use GP with uncertainty estimates
   - High uncertainty → conservative prediction (closer to mean)
   - Ensemble variance as uncertainty proxy

3. **Solvent Clustering**
   - Group solvents by chemical class (alcohols, ethers, esters, etc.)
   - Use class-specific models that generalize within chemical families
   - Detect when test solvent is in a known vs novel class

4. **Study Top Public Kernels More Deeply**
   - "mixall" kernel uses GroupKFold (5 splits) instead of Leave-One-Out
   - "ens-model" kernel combines ALL feature sources
   - What do the top LB scorers do differently?

## What NOT to Try
- More CV optimization without addressing the intercept problem
- Simple model variations (MLP, LGBM, XGBoost, CatBoost) - all fall on the same CV-LB line
- Feature engineering that only improves CV without changing the relationship

## Validation Notes
- CV scheme: Leave-one-solvent-out (24 folds for single, 13 folds for full)
- The CV-LB relationship is very strong (R² = 0.95)
- All model types fall on the same line - this is a STRUCTURAL problem

## CRITICAL ACTION ITEMS

1. **FIRST:** Regenerate a working submission from exp_030 (GP+MLP+LGBM) to verify the submission pipeline works
2. **SECOND:** If submission works, submit it to confirm LB score
3. **THIRD:** Implement extrapolation detection + conservative predictions to try to reduce the intercept
4. **FOURTH:** If that doesn't work, study top public kernels more deeply for insights

The target (0.0347) appears to be UNREACHABLE with current approaches due to the intercept problem. We need to either:
- Find approaches that fundamentally change the CV-LB relationship
- Accept that the target may not be achievable and focus on getting the best possible score

**DO NOT GIVE UP.** The target IS reachable - we just haven't found the right approach yet. The winners of this competition found a way. We need to discover what they did.
