## Current Status
- Best CV score: 0.0081 from exp_049/exp_050/exp_053 (CatBoost+XGBoost)
- Best LB score: 0.0877 from exp_030 (GP Ensemble)
- Target: 0.0347 | Gap to target: 0.0530 (153%)

## CV-LB Relationship Analysis (CRITICAL)
- Linear fit: LB = 4.31 * CV + 0.0525 (R² = 0.9505)
- Intercept interpretation: Even at CV=0, expected LB is 0.0525
- Are all approaches on the same line? YES
- **CRITICAL**: Intercept (0.0525) > Target (0.0347)
- Required CV for target: (0.0347 - 0.0525) / 4.31 = -0.0041 (IMPOSSIBLE)

**This means standard CV optimization CANNOT reach the target. We need strategies that CHANGE THE RELATIONSHIP, not just improve CV.**

## Response to Evaluator
- Technical verdict was TRUSTWORTHY. The notebook structure appeared correct.
- Evaluator's top priority: Submit exp_063 to verify format fix works. **IT FAILED.**
- Key concerns raised: 
  1. 8 consecutive submissions have failed with "Evaluation metric raised an unexpected error"
  2. The intercept problem remains unsolved
- How I'm addressing:
  1. **IMMEDIATE**: Revert to exp_030 approach which WORKED
  2. After fixing submission issue, focus on strategies to reduce the intercept

## CRITICAL ISSUE: 8 Consecutive Submission Failures

**All submissions from exp_049 onwards have failed with "Evaluation metric raised an unexpected error".**

### Analysis of Successful vs Failed Submissions:
- **Last successful**: exp_035 (2026-01-15T02:21:57) - GP+MLP+LGBM ensemble
- **First failed**: exp_049 (2026-01-15T21:40:28) - CatBoost+XGBoost

### Key Observation:
Looking at the successful submissions (exp_030, exp_035), they:
1. Use GP+MLP+LGBM ensemble (not CatBoost/XGBoost)
2. Write to `/home/submission/submission.csv` in the final cell
3. Have CV calculation in a SEPARATE cell AFTER the final cell

The failed submissions (exp_049 onwards) use CatBoost/XGBoost and various notebook structures.

## IMMEDIATE PRIORITY: Revert to exp_030 Approach

**Create a new experiment that EXACTLY replicates exp_030:**
1. Copy the EXACT notebook structure from exp_030
2. Use GP+MLP+LGBM ensemble (the model that worked)
3. Write to `/home/submission/submission.csv` in the final cell
4. Keep CV calculation in a separate cell after the final cell

**Why this approach:**
- exp_030 achieved LB 0.0877 (our best score)
- exp_030 and exp_035 are the only submissions that worked in the last 8 attempts
- This is the safest way to get submissions working again

## Data Understanding
- Reference notebooks: See `exploration/evolver_loop67_analysis.ipynb` for CV-LB analysis
- Key patterns:
  1. All 67 experiments fall on the same CV-LB line (R² = 0.95)
  2. The intercept (0.0525) represents structural distribution shift
  3. 8 consecutive submissions failed with "Evaluation metric raised an unexpected error"

## Recommended Approaches

### STEP 1: Fix Submission Issue (IMMEDIATE)

**Replicate exp_030 EXACTLY:**
- Use GP+MLP+LGBM ensemble
- Use the EXACT notebook structure from exp_030
- Write to `/home/submission/submission.csv`
- This should work because exp_030 worked

### STEP 2: After Submission Works - Improve the Model

Once submissions are working again, try:
1. **Combine GP+MLP+LGBM with CatBoost/XGBoost**
   - The CatBoost/XGBoost models have better CV (0.0081 vs 0.0083)
   - But they fail to submit
   - Try adding them to the GP+MLP+LGBM ensemble

2. **Strategies to REDUCE THE INTERCEPT**
   - Extrapolation detection + conservative predictions
   - Uncertainty-weighted predictions
   - Physics-informed constraints

## What NOT to Try
- CatBoost/XGBoost as standalone models (they fail to submit)
- Any approach that deviates from the exp_030 notebook structure
- More CV optimization without fixing the submission issue first

## Validation Notes
- CV scheme: Leave-One-Out (24 folds for single, 13 for full) - official scheme
- CV-LB gap: ~4.3x multiplier + 0.0525 intercept
- The intercept is the main barrier to reaching the target

## CRITICAL REMINDER

The target (0.0347) IS reachable. The benchmark achieved MSE 0.0039 on this exact dataset. The solution exists - we just need to find what we're doing differently.

**FIX THE SUBMISSION ISSUE FIRST** by reverting to exp_030 approach. We cannot make progress if we can't submit.
