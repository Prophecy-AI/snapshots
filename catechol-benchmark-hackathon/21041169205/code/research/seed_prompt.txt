## Current Status
- Best CV score: 0.0081 from exp_049/050/053 (but these had submission errors)
- Best verified LB score: 0.0877 from exp_030 and exp_067
- Target: 0.0347 | Gap to target: 0.0530

## CV-LB Relationship Analysis (CRITICAL)
- Linear fit: LB = 4.36 * CV + 0.0520 (R² = 0.9558)
- Intercept interpretation: Even at CV=0, expected LB is 0.0520
- Are all approaches on the same line? YES
- **CRITICAL**: Intercept (0.0520) > Target (0.0347)
- Required CV for target: (0.0347 - 0.0520) / 4.36 = -0.004 (IMPOSSIBLE)

**This means standard CV optimization CANNOT reach the target. We MUST change the CV-LB relationship.**

## Response to Evaluator
- Technical verdict was TRUSTWORTHY. The exp_071 implementation was sound but the approach was flawed.
- Evaluator's top priority: Fix the blend target (nearest neighbor instead of global mean). AGREE.
- Key concerns raised: Blending toward global mean is WRONG for outlier solvents. HFIP's fold had MSE=0.200280 because predictions were pulled toward the mean, but HFIP's actual behavior is very different.
- The evaluator correctly identified that the strategic direction (reducing CV-LB intercept) is correct, but the implementation needs to be fixed.

## Data Understanding
- Reference notebooks: See `exploration/evolver_loop74_analysis.ipynb` for CV-LB analysis
- Key patterns:
  1. All model types (MLP, LGBM, XGB, GP) fall on the same CV-LB line
  2. The intercept (0.0520) represents EXTRAPOLATION ERROR to unseen solvents
  3. Outlier solvents (HFIP, Cyclohexane, Water) have DIFFERENT behavior, not "average" behavior
  4. The extrapolation detection in exp_071 HURT performance by blending toward global mean

## Recommended Approaches

### PRIORITY 1: Nearest Neighbor Blending (Instead of Global Mean)
The evaluator's top recommendation. For outlier solvents, blend toward NEAREST training solvent's predictions instead of global mean. This preserves chemical similarity.

Implementation:
```python
def get_nearest_training_mean(self, test_solvent, training_solvents, solvent_predictions):
    """Get mean prediction for k nearest training solvents."""
    test_features = SPANGE_DF.loc[test_solvent].values
    distances = []
    for train_solvent in training_solvents:
        train_features = SPANGE_DF.loc[train_solvent].values
        dist = np.linalg.norm(test_features - train_features)
        distances.append((train_solvent, dist))
    
    distances.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])
    nearest = distances[:3]  # k=3 nearest neighbors
    
    # Return mean of nearest solvents' predictions
    nearest_preds = [solvent_predictions[s] for s, _ in nearest]
    return np.mean(nearest_preds, axis=0)
```

### PRIORITY 2: Disable Extrapolation Detection for Full Data
The full data CV went from 0.008488 to 0.040984 (383% worse) with extrapolation detection.
Only apply extrapolation detection to single solvents, not mixtures.

### PRIORITY 3: Use Higher Blend Threshold
blend_threshold=1.0 was too aggressive. Try blend_threshold=2.0 or higher so only the most extreme outliers are affected with smaller blend weights.

### PRIORITY 4: Revert to exp_030 as Baseline
If nearest neighbor blending doesn't work, revert to exp_030 (GP+MLP+LGBM ensemble, CV=0.0083, LB=0.0877) as our best verified model.

## What NOT to Try
- Blending toward global mean (proven to hurt performance in exp_071)
- Deep residual networks (exp_004 failed badly)
- DRFP-only features with PCA (exp_002 was much worse)
- Aggressive extrapolation detection with low threshold

## Validation Notes
- CV scheme: Leave-one-solvent-out for single solvents (24 folds), leave-one-ramp-out for full data (13 folds)
- CV-LB gap: ~4.36x multiplier + 0.0520 intercept
- The intercept is the key problem - we need to reduce it, not just improve CV

## Key Insight
The target (0.0347) is BELOW the intercept (0.0520). This means:
1. Standard ML optimization CANNOT reach the target
2. We need approaches that CHANGE THE CV-LB RELATIONSHIP
3. The GNN benchmark achieved MSE 0.0039 - the target IS reachable
4. Nearest neighbor blending might change the relationship by making predictions more chemically sensible for outlier solvents

## Submission Strategy
With only 4 remaining submissions:
1. Try nearest neighbor blending approach first
2. If CV improves, submit to check if it changes the CV-LB relationship
3. If not, revert to exp_030 (best verified model)
