      "text": "Predicting reaction yields across solvents that were never seen during training is a classic out\u2011of\u2011distribution problem.  The most reliable approaches combine a rich, chemically\u2011aware representation of both the reacting partners **and** the solvent with learning strategies that force the model to capture generalizable patterns rather than memorising specific solvent\u2013reaction pairs.\n\n**1. Multi\u2011view, geometry\u2011aware pre\u2011training.**  The ReaMVP framework shows that self\u2011supervised pre\u2011training on large reaction corpora using *two complementary views* \u2013 a sequential SMILES view and a 3D\u2011geometric view of all molecules (reactants, products and solvent) \u2013 dramatically improves generalisation to unseen solvents.  After a two\u2011stage pre\u2011training, a simple regression head can predict yields with state\u2011of\u2011the\u2011art accuracy and, crucially, retains a \u201csignificant advantage in predicting out\u2011of\u2011sample data\u201d, i.e. new solvent chemistries ([PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10895839), [Springer](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13321-024-00815-2)).  \n\n**2. Transformer\u2011based reaction\u2011SMILES models.**  Encoder\u2011only transformer architectures trained on reaction SMILES (with a regression layer) have achieved \u201coutstanding prediction performance\u201d on high\u2011throughput yield datasets.  Because the model treats the whole reaction string \u2013 including a tokenised solvent SMILES \u2013 as a language sequence, it can learn solvent\u2011dependent patterns without explicit descriptors and can be fine\u2011tuned on a small set of novel solvents to further reduce domain shift ([RXN\u2011yields](https://rxn4chemistry.github.io/rxn_yields)).  \n\n**3. Graph neural networks with explicit solvent descriptors.**  Recent benchmarks on continuous solvent effects (e.g., catechol rearrangement) demonstrate that GNNs that ingest *both* the reaction graph and a vector of solvent physicochemical properties (or quantum\u2011chemical solvent descriptors) can learn a smooth mapping from solvent structure to yield.  This approach is reinforced by studies that predict experimental solvent effects on reaction rates using quantum\u2011chemistry\u2011derived features, confirming that solvent\u2011specific electronic and solvation descriptors are highly predictive ([arXiv\u202f2512.19530](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19530), [Chem\u202fSci\u202f2024](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2024/sc/d3sc05353a)).  \n\n**4. Practical tricks for unseen solvents.**  \u2022\u202f*Domain\u2011adaptation / fine\u2011tuning*: train the base model on the known solvents, then update only the final layers with a handful of reactions in the new solvent.  \n\u2022\u202f*Data augmentation*: generate virtual solvent variants by perturbing molecular descriptors or by using quantum\u2011chemical solvation models to enlarge the solvent space.  \n\u2022\u202f*Meta\u2011learning*: treat each solvent as a \u201ctask\u201d and learn an initialization that can quickly adapt to a new solvent with few examples.  \n\nTogether, these techniques\u2014geometry\u2011aware multi\u2011view pre\u2011training, transformer or GNN encoders that ingest solvent information, and targeted adaptation strategies\u2014constitute the current best practice for robust yield prediction when the test set contains completely novel solvents with different molecular structures.",

In the field of organic synthesis, chemists often synthesize a target molecule through several or a dozen reaction steps [<a href=\"#CR3\">3</a>]. Consequently, low-yield reactions in the intermediate steps can have a negative impact on the total yield of the synthesis route due to the cumulative effect of each step. The estimation of chemical reaction yields plays an important role in guiding synthetic chemists to choose appropriate molecular synthesis routes, particularly in the case of identifying highly active and selective catalysts efficiently. Traditionally, chemists depend on empirical predictions or specific wet experiments to determine yields, which require extensive domain knowledge and are both time-consuming and labor-intensive. Therefore, data-driven machine learning techniques are needed to provide an efficient alternative.</p>\n<p>It remains a great challenge to accurately predict chemical reaction yields due to the complexity of reaction space and the diverse factors that influence chemical experiments [<a href=\"#CR4\">4</a>, <a href=\"#CR5\">5</a>]. To develop machine learning-based approaches, it is crucial to establish effective methods for representing chemical reactions. Conventional studies typically rely on feature engineering to represent chemical reactions using fingerprints or descriptors. This involves creating customized descriptors based on domain expertise to capture molecular, atomic, vibrational, or physicochemical properties [<a href=\"#CR6\">6</a>\u2013<a href=\"#CR12\">12</a>]. Some researchers derived descriptors from circular substructures present in the simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES) [<a href=\"#CR13\">13</a>] strings of the reactions [<a href=\"#CR14\">14</a>]. Chemical reactions can be perceived as sequences or collections of molecules. Therefore, the traditional practice of concatenating molecular fingerprints or descriptors at the molecule level is commonly employed [<a href=\"#CR15\">15</a>\u2013<a href=\"#CR18\">18</a>]. However, this concatenation approach is typically suitable only for reactions with a fixed number of molecules, posing limitations on their ability to generalize to downstream tasks.</p>\n<p>In recent years, deep learning (DL) models have gained popularity and have led to significant advancements in the representation and prediction of chemical reactions. Some studies utilized SMILES as input and employed well-established models from the field of natural language processing (NLP) to encode the SMILES notations of chemical reactions into continuous vectors. These studies employed either pre-trained Transformer-based models [<a href=\"#CR19\">19</a>\u2013<a href=\"#CR21\">21</a>] or Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models [<a href=\"#CR22\">22</a>, <a href=\"#CR23\">23</a>] on large-scale datasets, and fine-tuned their models [<a href=\"#CR3\">3</a>, <a href=\"#CR24\">24</a>] with downstream tasks to capture task-specific representations of chemical reactions. Other studies incorporated molecular graph structures to represent chemical reactions. Recent approaches include adding [<a href=\"#CR25\">25</a>] or concatenating [<a href=\"#CR26\">26</a>] molecular features learned from graph neural networks, encoding the condensed graph of chemical reactions [<a href=\"#CR27\">27</a>], and learning organic reactivity based on generalized reaction templates [<a href=\"#CR28\">28</a>].</p>\n<p>While the YieldGNN model [<a href=\"#CR12\">12</a>] attempts to combine 2D chemical reaction graphs with 1D descriptors, most of the aforementioned studies have focused solely on a specific perspective of chemical information, namely, 1D sequences or 2D graphs. By contrast, multi-view learning methods for molecular representation learning [<a href=\"#CR29\">29</a>\u2013<a href=\"#CR33\">33</a>] have achieved success by incorporating multiple views of molecules with different dimensional inputs.</p>\n<p>However, due to the difficulty in extracting effective features from molecular geometry, only a few molecule prediction methods [<a href=\"#CR30\">30</a>, <a href=\"#CR34\">34</a>\u2013<a href=\"#CR37\">37</a>] have leveraged 3D spatial structure information of molecules, which is critical for determining molecular properties and reaction outcomes. Although these studies have demonstrated the potential of 3D geometric information in providing comprehensive and complementary insights into chemical reactions, to further enhance the accuracy of reaction prediction, there is a need to explore more effective and efficient algorithms for handling the high dimensionality of 3D molecular structures.</p>\n<p>In this study, we propose a large-scale <strong>R</strong>eaction <strong>M</strong>ulti-<strong>V</strong>iew <strong>P</strong>re-training framework, named ReaMVP, to represent chemical reactions and predict their yields.

In the second stage, ReaMVP further enhances the representation of chemical reactions through supervised learning using reaction data with known yields.

Multiple platforms, including tools for reaction prediction and synthesis planning based on machine learning, successfully became part of the organic chemists\u2019 daily laboratory, assisting in domain-specific synthetic problems. Unlike reaction prediction and retrosynthetic models, reaction yields models have been less investigated, despite the enormous potential of accurately predicting them. Reaction yields models, describing the percentage of the reactants that is converted to the desired products, could guide chemists and help them select high-yielding reactions and score synthesis routes, reducing the number of attempts. So far, yield predictions have been predominantly performed for high-throughput experiments using a categorical (one-hot) encoding of reactants, concatenated molecular fingerprints, or computed chemical descriptors. Here, we extend the application of natural language processing architectures to predict reaction properties given a text-based representation of the reaction, using an encoder transformer model combined with a regression layer. We demonstrate outstanding prediction performance on two high-throughput experiment reactions sets. An analysis of the yields reported in the open-source USPTO data set shows that their distribution differs depending on the mass scale, limiting the dataset applicability in reaction yields predictions.\nThis repository complements our studies on[predicting chemical reaction yields](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2632-2153/abc81d)(published in Machine Learning: Science and Technology) and[data augmentation and uncertainty estimation for yield predictions](https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv.13286741)(presented at the Machine Learning for Molecules Workshop at NeurIPS 2020).\n## Install[](#Install)\nAs the library is based on the chemoinformatics toolkit[RDKit](http://www.rdkit.org)it is best installed using the[Anaconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)package manager. Once you have conda, you can simply run:\n```\n`conda create -n yields python=3.6 -y\nconda activate yields\nconda install -c rdkit rdkit=2020.03.3.0 -y\nconda install -c tmap tmap -y`\n```\n```\n`git clone https://github.com/rxn4chemistry/rxn\\_yields.git\ncd rxn\\_yields\npip install -e .`\n```\n**NOTE:**\nIf you are fine-tuning your own models. Make sure that the pretrained model (from which you start training) is loaded from a folder with the same structure as for our[rxnfp models](https://github.com/rxn4chemistry/rxnfp/tree/master/rxnfp/models/transformers/bert_pretrained).\n## Approach - predicting yields from reaction SMILES[](#Approach---predicting-yields-from-reaction-SMILES)\nTransformer models have recently revolutionised Natural Language Processing and were also successfully applied to task in chemistry, using a text-based representation of molecules and chemical reactions called Simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES).\nSequence-2-Sequence transformers as in[Attention is all you need](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/7181-attention-is-all-you-need)were used for:\n* Chemical Reaction Prediction\n* [Molecular Transformer: A Model for Uncertainty-Calibrated Chemical Reaction](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acscentsci.9b00576)\n* [Carbohydrate Transformer: Predicting Regio- and Stereoselective Reactions Using Transfer Learning](http://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv.11935635)\n* Multi-step retrosynthesis\n* [Predicting retrosynthetic pathways using a combined linguistic model and hyper-graph exploration strategy](http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9sc05704h)\n* [Unassisted Noise-Reduction of Chemical Reactions Data Sets](https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Unassisted_Noise-Reduction_of_Chemical_Reactions_Data_Sets/12395120/1)\nEncoder Transformers like[BERT](https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkZmKmWOWH)and[ALBERT](https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1eA7AEtvS)for:\n* Reaction fingerprints and classification\n* [Mapping the Space of Chemical Reactions using Attention-Based Neural Networks](https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Data-Driven_Chemical_Reaction_Classification_with_Attention-Based_Neural_Networks/9897365)\n* Atom rearrangements during chemical reactions\n* [Unsupervised Attention-Guided Atom-Mapping](https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Unsupervised_Attention-Guided_Atom-Mapping/12298559)\nThose studies show that Transformer models are able to learn organic chemistry and chemical reactions from SMILES.\nHere we asked the question, how well a**BERT**model would perform when applied to a**yield prediction**task:\n![](https://rxn4chemistry.github.io/rxn_yields/images/pipeline.jpg)\n**Figure:**Pipeline and task description.\nTo do so, we started with the reaction fingerprint models from the[rxnfp](https://rxn4chemistry.github.io/rxnfp/)library and added a fine-tuning regression head through[SimpleTransformers.ai](https://simpletransformers.ai). As we don't need to change the hyperparameters of the base model, we only tune the learning rate for the training and the dropout probability.\nWe explored two high-throughput experiment (HTE) data sets and then also the yields data found in the USPTO data base.\n## Buchwald-Hartwig HTE data set[](#Buchwald-Hartwig-HTE-data-set)\n### Canonical reaction representation[](#Canonical-reaction-representation)\nOne of the best studied reaction yield is the one that was published by Ahneman et al. in[Predicting reaction performance in C\u2013N cross-coupling using machine learning](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6385/186.full), where the authors have used DFT-computed descriptors as inputs to different machine learning descriptors. There best model was a random forest model. More recently,[one-hot encodings](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/362/6416/eaat8603)and[multi-fingerprint features (MFF)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451929420300851)as input representations were investigated. Here, we show competitive results starting simply from a text-based reaction SMILES input to our models.\n![](https://rxn4chemistry.github.io/rxn_yields/images/buchwald_hartwig.jpg)\n**Figure:**a) Summary of the results on the Buchwald\u2013Hartwig data set. b) Example regression plot for the first random-split.\n### Augmentated reaction representations[](#Augmentated-reaction-representations)\nWe were able to further improve the results on this data set using data augmentation on reaction SMILES (molecule order permuations and SMILES randomisations). This extension will be presented at the NeurIPS 2020[Machine Learning for Molecules Workshop](https://nips.cc/Conferences/2020/ScheduleMultitrack?event=16136).\n![](https://rxn4chemistry.github.io/rxn_yields/images/rxn_randomizations.png)\n**Figure:**The two different data augmentation techniques investigated in the NeurIPS workshop paper.\n#### Results[](#Results)\n![](https://rxn4chemistry.github.io/rxn_yields/images/results_augm.png)\n**Figure:**a) Results on the 70/30 random splits, averaged over 10 splits. b) Comparison of DFT descriptors + RF, canonical SMILES and data augmented randomized SMILES on reduced training sets. c) Out-of-sample test sets\nOn random splits 70/30 in a), the data augmented Yield-BERT models perform better than ...",

Traditional machine learning approaches often treat solvent identity as a discrete categorical variable, which prevents systematic interpolation and extrapolation across the solvent space. This work introduces the \\textbf{Catechol Benchmark}, a high-throughput transient flow chemistry dataset comprising 1,227 experimental yield measurements for the rearrangement of allyl-substituted catechol in 24 pure solvents and their binary mixtures, parameterized by continuous volume fractions ($\\% B$). We evaluate various architectures under rigorous leave-one-solvent-out and leave-one-mixture-out protocols to test generalization to unseen chemical environments.\n> Our results demonstrate that classical tabular methods (e.g., Gradient-Boosted Decision Trees) and large language model embeddings (e.g., Qwen-7B) struggle with quantitative precision, yielding Mean Squared Errors (MSE) of 0.099 and 0.129, respectively. In contrast, we propose a hybrid GNN-based architecture that integrates Graph Attention Networks (GATs) with Differential Reaction Fingerprints (DRFP) and learned mixture-aware solvent encodings. This approach achieves an \\textbf{MSE of 0.0039} ($\\pm$ 0.0003), representing a 60\\% error reduction over competitive baselines and a $&gt;25\\times$ improvement over tabular ensembles. Ablation studies confirm that explicit molecular graph message-passing and continuous mixture encoding are essential for robust generalization. The complete dataset, evaluation protocols, and reference implementations are released to facilitate data-efficient reaction prediction and continuous solvent representation learning.

Despite the recent advance in machine learning, a scarcity of reliable data has hindered the development of predictive models that are generalizable for diverse reactions and solvents. In this work, we generate a large set of data with the COSMO-RS method for over 28\u2006000 neutral reactions and 295 solvents and train a machine learning model to predict the solvation free energy and solvation enthalpy of activation (\u0394\u0394 _G_\u2021solv, \u0394\u0394 _H_\u2021solv) for a solution phase reaction. On unseen reactions, the model achieves mean absolute errors of 0.71 and 1.03 kcal mol\u22121 for \u0394\u0394 _G_\u2021solv and \u0394\u0394 _H_\u2021solv, respectively, relative to the COSMO-RS calculations. The model also provides reliable predictions of relative rate constants within a factor of 4 when tested on experimental data. The presented model can provide nearly instantaneous predictions of kinetic solvent effects or relative rate constants for a broad range of neutral closed-shell or free radical reactions and solvents only based on atom-mapped reaction SMILES and solvent SMILES strings.\n\n![Graphical abstract: Machine learning from quantum chemistry to predict experimental solvent effects on reaction rates](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/Image/Get?imageInfo.ImageType=GA&imageInfo.ImageIdentifier.ManuscriptID=D3SC05353A&imageInfo.ImageIdentifier.Year=2024)\n\n- This article is part of the themed collections:\n[#MyFirstChemSci 2024](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/journals/articlecollectionlanding?sercode=sc&themeid=26a1e262-5929-453c-b3a7-f61b43147ce2) and [Most popular 2024 physical, theoretical and computational chemistry articles](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/journals/articlecollectionlanding?sercode=sc&themeid=777d3e88-b794-457a-8932-5995aa89df7b)\n\nThis article is Open Access\n\n![](https://www.rsc-cdn.org/pubs-core/2022.0.171/content/NewImages/Ajax-GA-Loader.gif)\nPlease wait while we load your content...\nSomething went wrong.

The new\u00a0materials which are\u00a0formed as the result of a chemical reaction are called products.\u00a0Chemical equations are a short-hand way of expressing that change in\u00a0matter\u00a0using chemical symbols. A chemical reaction is considered balanced when\u00a0there\u00a0are equal numbers of each kind of atom on both sides of the equation.\u00a0Because\u00a0chemists believe in the law of conservation of mass,\u00a0equations must be\u00a0balanced in order to correctly show the changes which have occurred.\n\nFor example, when sodium\u00a0metal is placed in a container\u00a0with chlorine gas a chemical change occurs, as can be noted by the\u00a0disappearance of the metal and the yellow-green gas and the appearance of a\u00a0white crystalline solid called sodium chloride in the container. Sparks\u00a0fly,\u00a0heat is given off. The properties of the new material are quite\u00a0different from\u00a0the properties of the starting materials.\n\nSome of the clues which\u00a0signify that a chemical change\u00a0has occurred are:\n\n- The formation of new materials, recognizable by\u00a0different colors\n- The\u00a0disappearance of starting materials\n- A\u00a0change in energy as evidenced by production of\u00a0light or sound\n- An\u00a0increase or decrease in the temperature\n\nThe chemical equation for the above reaction would be:\n\nNa( _s_)\u00a0\\+ Cl2( _g_) \u2192 NaCl( _s_)\n\nIn order to balance the\u00a0equation, a coefficient can be placed in front of both the Na( _s_) and the NaCl( _s_) which\u00a0corrects the unbalance between the atoms.\n\n2Na( _s_)\u00a0+\u00a0Cl2( _g_) \u2192 2NaCl( _s_)\n\nThere are generally five different types of chemical changes that occur in matter. There are other ways to subgroup these changes in matter, but most chemical reactions can be placed into one of the following five groups:\n\n- Combination or synthesis reactions\n- Decomposition reactions\n- Single replacement or single displacement reactions\n- Double replacement (displacement) or metathesis reactions\n- Combustion reactions\n\nSynthesis reactions have two or more reactants combining to produce a single product which is a compound. A new compound is created by the direct combination of reactants. The reaction of hydrogen gas with oxygen gas to produce water is such a reaction.\n\nDecomposition reactions are the chemical opposite of synthesis reactions. In decomposition reactions one reactant, which must be a compound, comes apart to form simpler substances which may be elements or compounds. Most decomposition reactions require energy to proceed. Such reactions are also classified as endothermic. An example of a decomposition reaction is the heating of solid calcium carbonate, CaCO3( _s_) to form solid calcium oxide, CaO( _s_) and carbon dioxide gas, CO2( _g_).\n\nDisplacement reactions are sometimes called replacement reactions. Single displacement reactions always have an element and a compound as reactants. The element which was a reactant ends up in a compound which is a product. The element that was produced in the reaction was originally in the compound. Many of these reactions must occur in solution, but not always. If copper metal is placed in a solution of silver nitrate in a beaker, a single replacement reaction occurs. Silver metal forms in the beaker while the solution which was originally colorless begins to take on the blue color characteristic of copper(II) ion. The copper metal has taken the place of the silver ion in the solution; the silver ion becomes silver metal in the beaker. The balanced equation for this reaction is\n\nCu( _s_) \\+ 2AgNO3( _aq_) \u2192 Cu(NO3)2( _aq_) \\+ 2Ag( _s_)\n\nDouble replacement reactions, which are sometimes called metathesis reactions, are characterized by having two compounds as reactants and two compounds as products. The reactants are both ionic compounds in solution. In this type of reaction, the cations of the reactants exchange anions; the products are new compounds one of which must be insoluble, a gas or a weak electrolyte such as water. If all products are soluble ionic compounds, there will be no reaction. For example, if aqueous solutions of silver nitrate and sodium chloride are mixed, a double replacement reaction occurs producing soluble sodium nitrate and insoluble silver chloride. In equation form,\n\nAgNO3( _aq_) \\+ NaCl( _aq_) \u2192 NaNO3( _aq_) \\+ AgCl( _s_)\n\nThe last type of reaction is the combustion reaction which involves the reaction of oxygen with either an element or a compound, which is usually a hydrocarbon. If the reaction is between an element and oxygen, and only the oxide of the element is formed, the reaction may also be considered to be a synthesis reaction. Typical combustion reactions of organic compounds can be recognized by the products of carbon dioxide and water. Reactants such as alcohols, carbohydrates, ketones, alkanes, alkenes and aromatics will produce water and carbon dioxide as products if the combustion is complete. If insufficient oxygen is present for complete combustion, carbon monoxide will be formed. In any case, oxygen is always a reactant.\n\nEthanol, C2H5OH( _l_), burns in oxygen to produce water and carbon dioxide according to the balanced equation:\n\nC2H5OH( _l_) \\+ 3O2( _g_)2CO2( _g_) \\+ 3H2O( _l_)\n\n#### Question\n\nIn the following list of equations, how many are replacement reactions?\n\n2H2 \\+ O2 \u2192 2 H2O\n\nZn + CuCl2 \u2192 Cu + ZnCl2\n\nHCl + NaOH \u2192 NaCl + H2O\n\nCuCO3 \u2192 CuO + CO2\n\nCH4 \\+ 2O2 \u2192 CO2 \\+ 2H2O\n\n1. none\n2. one\n3. two\n4. three\n\nReveal Answer\n\nThe correct answer is C. Both the second and third equations are types of replacement reactions. The second equation is a single replacement while the third equation is a double replacement reaction.\n\n### Predicting Products of Reactions\n\nThe products of reactions\u00a0can be predicted by recognizing\u00a0the pattern of reactants in the equation.\u00a0Synthesis reactions have two or more reactants and a\u00a0single product. Synthesis reactions are simply the direct combination\u00a0of the\u00a0reactants.\n\n2Na + Br2 \u2192 2NaBr\n\nDecomposition reactions have\u00a0a single reactant and\u00a0several products. Decomposition reactions break down the initial\u00a0compound into\u00a0simpler substances which may not be the elements of the compound. For\u00a0example, \u00a0heating CuCO3 produces carbon dioxide and CuO\u00a0not Cu, C and O2.\u00a0Take time to learn some well known\u00a0decomposition reactions and\u00a0don\u2019t assume that\u00a0the elements are directly produced by heating a compound.\u00a0Some\u00a0typical\u00a0decomposition reactions:\n\n1. Metallic\u00a0carbonates, when heated, form metallic oxides and CO2( _g_). Ex. CaCO3( _s_) \u2192 CaO( _s_)\u00a0\\+ \u00a0CO2( _g_)\n2. Most metallic\u00a0hydroxides, when heated, decompose into metallic oxides and water. Ex. Ca(OH)2( _s_) \u2192 CaO( _s_) H2O( _g_)\n3. Metallic\u00a0chlorates, when heated, decompose into metallic chlorides and oxygen. Ex. 2KClO3( _s_) \u2192 2KCl( _s_) \\+ 3O2( _g_)\n4. Some acids,\u00a0when heated, decompose into nonmetallic oxides and water. Ex. H2SO4( _l_) \u2192 H2O( _l_)\u00a0\\+ \u00a0SO3( _g_)\n5. Some oxides,\u00a0when heated, decompose.

The data was provided by DeepMatter and was collected in their DigitalGlassware cloud platform. The reaction probe has 12 sensors to measure properties of interest, including temperature, pressure, and colour. Colour was a good predictor of product formation for this reaction and machine learning models were able to learn which of the properties were important. Predictions for the current product formation (in terms of % yield) had a mean absolute error of 1.2%. For predicting 30, 60 and 120\u00a0min ahead the error rose to 3.4, 4.1 and 4.6%, respectively. The work here presents an example into the insight that can be obtained from applying machine learning methods to sensor data in synthetic chemistry.</p></div></div><ul><li></li><li></li></ul><div><h2>Keywords</h2><p><span>Buchwald-Hartwig cross-coupling</span></p><p><span>Long short-term memory neural network</span></p><p><span>Reaction monitoring</span></p><p><span>Time series data</span></p></div><section><header><h2>Cited by (0)</h2></header></section><p><span>\u00a9 2022 The Author(s).
