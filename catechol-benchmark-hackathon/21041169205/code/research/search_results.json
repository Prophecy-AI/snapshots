      "text": "Predicting reaction yields for solvents that have never been seen before requires a model that can both **generalize beyond the training distribution** and **interpret the physicochemical influence of the solvent** on the reaction.  The most effective strategy reported so far combines a **knowledge\u2011constrained graph neural network (GNN)** with **multi\u2011view, geometry\u2011aware pre\u2011training** and **fine\u2011grained cross\u2011modal fusion** of solvent descriptors.  A GNN that embeds steric and electronic information at the atomic level\u2014e.g., the knowledge\u2011based graph model that digitises local environments\u2014has been shown to retain interpretability while achieving strong extrapolative performance on scaffold\u2011based splits and on new catalysts, suggesting it can also handle novel solvents when solvent\u2011specific features are supplied as node or edge attributes ([Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39283-x)).  \n\nBuilding on this, the **Reaction Multi\u2011View Pre\u2011training (ReaMVP)** framework demonstrates that incorporating both **SMILES\u2011based sequential views and 3\u2011D geometric views** of all reaction components, together with self\u2011supervised pre\u2011training, markedly improves out\u2011of\u2011sample yield prediction, including for unseen reaction conditions such as new solvents ([NCBI](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10895839)).  Complementary work (YieldFCP) shows that linking the SMILES sequence with 3\u2011D solvent geometry through a **cross\u2011modal projector** enables atomic\u2011level interaction modeling, further boosting performance in real\u2011world datasets where solvent variation is common ([ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949747725000028)).  \n\nFinally, transformer\u2011based models like **Egret**, which employ reaction\u2011condition\u2011aware contrastive learning, have proven sensitive to subtle changes in reaction conditions\u2014including solvent identity\u2014by learning condition\u2011specific embeddings that can be transferred to new solvents ([SPJ](https://spj.science.org/doi/10.34133/research.0292)).  Consequently, the best current approach is to (1) represent reactants, products, and solvents as graphs enriched with steric/electronic descriptors, (2) pre\u2011train the GNN on large, multi\u2011view datasets that include 3\u2011D solvent geometries, and (3) fine\u2011tune with contrastive or cross\u2011modal objectives that force the model to distinguish solvent effects.

Due to the high-dimensional relationship between molecular structure and synthetic function, it is challenging to achieve the predictive modelling of synthetic transformation with the required extrapolative ability and chemical interpretability. To meet the gap between the rich domain knowledge of chemistry and the advanced molecular graph model, herein we report a knowledge-based graph model that embeds the digitalized steric and electronic information. In addition, a molecular interaction module is developed to enable the learning of the synergistic influence of reaction components. In this study, we demonstrate that this knowledge-based graph model achieves excellent predictions of reaction yield and stereoselectivity, whose extrapolative ability is corroborated by additional scaffold-based data splittings and experimental verifications with new catalysts. Because of the embedding of local environment, the model allows the atomic level of interpretation of the steric and electronic influence on the overall synthetic performance, which serves as a useful guide for the molecular engineering towards the target synthetic function. This model offers an extrapolative and interpretable approach for reaction performance prediction, pointing out the importance of chemical knowledge-constrained reaction modelling for synthetic purpose.\n\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n\n### [Knowledge graph-enhanced molecular contrastive learning with functional prompt](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-023-00654-0?fromPaywallRec=false)\n\nArticleOpen access04 May 2023\n\n### [A generalized-template-based graph neural network for accurate organic reactivity prediction](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-022-00526-z?fromPaywallRec=false)\n\nArticle15 September 2022\n\n### [A meta-learning approach for selectivity prediction in asymmetric catalysis](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58854-8?fromPaywallRec=false)\n\nArticleOpen access16 April 2025\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe chemical comprehension and accurate prediction of reactivity and selectivity provide the foundation for the rational and efficient exploration of massive synthetic space[1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39283-x#ref-CR1), [2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39283-x#ref-CR2).\u00a0This establishment of the structure\u2013performance relationship (SPR) has been focused on the reaction mechanism study and elucidation of the determining transition state model[3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39283-x#ref-CR3). Using the transition state model, chemists can elucidate the origins of the observed reactivity/selectivity trend and make synthetic judgments based on chemical theory and empirical experience[4](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39283-x#ref-CR4). This classic knowledge-driven strategy has reached remarkable success in synthetic chemistry and continues to provide strong support for the discovery of new catalysts, reagents, and reaction[5](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39283-x#ref-CR5). Despite the advantage of offering qualitative guidance in the synthetic universe, it is challenging for the knowledge-driven strategy to handle the high-dimensional SPR without a clear mechanistic basis and analytic equation. The seemingly subtle change in catalyst, additive, or even solvent may result in significant perturbation of the overall synthetic performance[6](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39283-x#ref-CR6), [7](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39283-x#ref-CR7). This is why laborious and repetitive condition optimization is still inevitably required, limiting the efficiency of synthetic development[8](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39283-x#ref-CR8).\n\nThe data-driven approach has recently emerged as a powerful strategy for SPR establishment[9](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39283-x#ref-CR9), [10](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39283-x#ref-CR10). By harnessing the interrelationship within the synthetic data, modern machine learning (ML) algorithms can create powerful models for synthetic prediction.

However, the ML prediction and design of synthetic transformation are still far from mature. One of the major bottlenecks is the availability of the molecular encoding approach and the ML framework that are suitable for SPR prediction (Fig.\u00a0[1a](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39283-x#Fig1)). Quantum chemical descriptors[27](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39283-x#ref-CR27) are known for their solid physical basis and high descriptive ability, but their application typically requires a sophisticated understanding of the underlying reaction mechanism, and the descriptor generation can be time- and resource-consuming for large-scale screening. The string- and topological structure-based encodings (i.e., SMILES, molecular fingerprints, etc.)[33](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39283-x#ref-CR33), [34](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39283-x#ref-CR34) do not require expert knowledge of the studied transformation and can be efficiently generated, while it is difficult to trace the physical organic origins of the synthetic performance. In addition, the extrapolation problem presents additional challenges for SPR prediction[35](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39283-x#ref-CR35), [36](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39283-x#ref-CR36).

The efficacy of such models depends heavily on the representation of chemical reactions, which has commonly been learned from SMILES or graphs of molecules using deep neural networks. However, the progression of chemical reactions is inherently determined by the molecular 3D geometric properties, which have been recently highlighted as crucial features in accurately predicting molecular properties and chemical reactions. Additionally, large-scale pre-training has been shown to be essential in enhancing the generalization capability of complex deep learning models. Based on these considerations, we propose the Reaction Multi-View Pre-training (ReaMVP) framework, which leverages self-supervised learning techniques and a two-stage pre-training strategy to predict chemical reaction yields. By incorporating multi-view learning with 3D geometric information, ReaMVP achieves state-of-the-art performance on two benchmark datasets. Notably, the experimental results indicate that ReaMVP has a significant advantage in predicting out-of-sample data, suggesting an enhanced generalization ability to predict new reactions. Scientific Contribution: This study presents the ReaMVP framework, which improves the generalization capability of machine learning models for predicting chemical reaction yields.

In the field of organic synthesis, chemists often synthesize a target molecule through several or a dozen reaction steps [<a href=\"#CR3\">3</a>]. Consequently, low-yield reactions in the intermediate steps can have a negative impact on the total yield of the synthesis route due to the cumulative effect of each step. The estimation of chemical reaction yields plays an important role in guiding synthetic chemists to choose appropriate molecular synthesis routes, particularly in the case of identifying highly active and selective catalysts efficiently. Traditionally, chemists depend on empirical predictions or specific wet experiments to determine yields, which require extensive domain knowledge and are both time-consuming and labor-intensive. Therefore, data-driven machine learning techniques are needed to provide an efficient alternative.</p>\n<p>It remains a great challenge to accurately predict chemical reaction yields due to the complexity of reaction space and the diverse factors that influence chemical experiments [<a href=\"#CR4\">4</a>, <a href=\"#CR5\">5</a>]. To develop machine learning-based approaches, it is crucial to establish effective methods for representing chemical reactions. Conventional studies typically rely on feature engineering to represent chemical reactions using fingerprints or descriptors. This involves creating customized descriptors based on domain expertise to capture molecular, atomic, vibrational, or physicochemical properties [<a href=\"#CR6\">6</a>\u2013<a href=\"#CR12\">12</a>]. Some researchers derived descriptors from circular substructures present in the simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES) [<a href=\"#CR13\">13</a>] strings of the reactions [<a href=\"#CR14\">14</a>]. Chemical reactions can be perceived as sequences or collections of molecules. Therefore, the traditional practice of concatenating molecular fingerprints or descriptors at the molecule level is commonly employed [<a href=\"#CR15\">15</a>\u2013<a href=\"#CR18\">18</a>]. However, this concatenation approach is typically suitable only for reactions with a fixed number of molecules, posing limitations on their ability to generalize to downstream tasks.</p>\n<p>In recent years, deep learning (DL) models have gained popularity and have led to significant advancements in the representation and prediction of chemical reactions. Some studies utilized SMILES as input and employed well-established models from the field of natural language processing (NLP) to encode the SMILES notations of chemical reactions into continuous vectors. These studies employed either pre-trained Transformer-based models [<a href=\"#CR19\">19</a>\u2013<a href=\"#CR21\">21</a>] or Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models [<a href=\"#CR22\">22</a>, <a href=\"#CR23\">23</a>] on large-scale datasets, and fine-tuned their models [<a href=\"#CR3\">3</a>, <a href=\"#CR24\">24</a>] with downstream tasks to capture task-specific representations of chemical reactions. Other studies incorporated molecular graph structures to represent chemical reactions. Recent approaches include adding [<a href=\"#CR25\">25</a>] or concatenating [<a href=\"#CR26\">26</a>] molecular features learned from graph neural networks, encoding the condensed graph of chemical reactions [<a href=\"#CR27\">27</a>], and learning organic reactivity based on generalized reaction templates [<a href=\"#CR28\">28</a>].</p>\n<p>While the YieldGNN model [<a href=\"#CR12\">12</a>] attempts to combine 2D chemical reaction graphs with 1D descriptors, most of the aforementioned studies have focused solely on a specific perspective of chemical information, namely, 1D sequences or 2D graphs. By contrast, multi-view learning methods for molecular representation learning [<a href=\"#CR29\">29</a>\u2013<a href=\"#CR33\">33</a>] have achieved success by incorporating multiple views of molecules with different dimensional inputs.</p>\n<p>However, due to the difficulty in extracting effective features from molecular geometry, only a few molecule prediction methods [<a href=\"#CR30\">30</a>, <a href=\"#CR34\">34</a>\u2013<a href=\"#CR37\">37</a>] have leveraged 3D spatial structure information of molecules, which is critical for determining molecular properties and reaction outcomes. Although these studies have demonstrated the potential of 3D geometric information in providing comprehensive and complementary insights into chemical reactions, to further enhance the accuracy of reaction prediction, there is a need to explore more effective and efficient algorithms for handling the high dimensionality of 3D molecular structures.</p>\n<p>In this study, we propose a large-scale <strong>R</strong>eaction <strong>M</strong>ulti-<strong>V</strong>iew <strong>P</strong>re-training framework, named ReaMVP, to represent chemical reactions and predict their yields.

      "text": "<div><div><section><h2>Abstract</h2><p>Deep learning (DL)-driven efficient synthesis planning may profoundly transform the paradigm for designing novel pharmaceuticals and materials. However, the progress of many DL-assisted synthesis planning (DASP) algorithms has suffered from the lack of reliable automated pathway evaluation tools. As a critical metric for evaluating chemical reactions, accurate prediction of reaction yields helps improve the practicality of DASP algorithms in the real-world scenarios. Currently, accurately predicting yields of interesting reactions still faces numerous challenges, mainly including the absence of high-quality generic reaction yield datasets and robust generic yield predictors. To compensate for the limitations of high-throughput yield datasets, we curated a generic reaction yield dataset containing 12 reaction categories and rich reaction condition information. Subsequently, by utilizing 2 pretraining tasks based on chemical reaction masked language modeling and contrastive learning, we proposed a powerful bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT)-based reaction yield predictor named Egret. It achieved comparable or even superior performance to the best previous models on 4 benchmark datasets and established state-of-the-art performance on the newly curated dataset. We found that reaction-condition-based contrastive learning enhances the model\u2019s sensitivity to reaction conditions, and Egret is capable of capturing subtle differences between reactions involving identical reactants and products but different reaction conditions. Furthermore, we proposed a new scoring function that incorporated Egret into the evaluation of multistep synthesis routes. Test results showed that yield-incorporated scoring facilitated the prioritization of literature-supported high-yield reaction pathways for target molecules. In addition, through meta-learning strategy, we further improved the reliability of the model\u2019s prediction for reaction types with limited data and lower data quality. Our results suggest that Egret holds the potential to become an essential component of the next-generation DASP tools.</p></section><div><section><h2>Introduction</h2><p>Efficient chemical synthesis is crucial to satisfying the future demands for pharmaceuticals, materials, and energy [<a href=\"#B1\">1</a>]. Corey and Wipke [<a href=\"#B2\">2</a>] first proposed the concept of computer-aided synthesis planning (CASP) in the 1960s. CASP programs take the target molecule as input and return a series of single-step reactions that decompose the target molecule into a set of commercially available starting compounds or simple precursors that can be easily synthesized [<a href=\"#B3\">3</a>]. A feasible synthesis plan may dramatically accelerate the synthesis of desired molecules [<a href=\"#B4\">4</a>]. In recent years, with the development of data science, deep learning (DL) algorithms, and computing power, DL-assisted synthesis planning (DASP) has gained considerable interest [<a href=\"#B5\">5</a>\u2013<a href=\"#B17\">17</a>]. Modern DASP programs can quickly plan multiple potential retrosynthetic pathways for a given target molecule according to the constraints set by the user for the retrosynthetic search (such as the overall search time and number of single-step expansion steps) [<a href=\"#B18\">18</a>]. However, these theoretically feasible reaction pathways often become impractical because of such factors as incomplete conversion of reactants, side reactions, or inadequate purification [<a href=\"#B19\">19</a>]. Therefore, retrosynthetic route planning is only a major component of a successful DASP system [<a href=\"#B20\">20</a>]. To provide feasible suggestions that can be implemented by chemists in the laboratory, it is necessary to identify the optimal reaction conditions for the retrosynthetic route [<a href=\"#B21\">21</a>] and evaluate the quality of the overall synthesis route, and reaction yield is one of the most scientific and intuitive metrics for screening reaction conditions and evaluating synthesis pathway [<a href=\"#B22\">22</a>,<a href=\"#B23\">23</a>].</p><p>Reaction yield refers to the percentage of reactants that are successfully converted to the desired product [<a href=\"#B24\">24</a>]. Models that can reliably predict actual yields not only serve as scoring functions of DASP but also help chemists evaluate the overall yield of complex reaction pathways, giving priority to high-yield reactions to save time and cost in wet experiments [<a href=\"#B25\">25</a>]. However, because of the complexity of molecular structures, the multidimensionality of chemical reactions, and the limited availability of data, it is still a great challenge to predict the yields of chemical reactions under specific conditions [<a href=\"#B26\">26</a>]. The current yield prediction models are mainly built on high-throughput experimental (HTE) datasets, and Buchwald\u2013Hartwig reactions [<a href=\"#B26\">26</a>\u2013<a href=\"#B28\">28</a>] and Suzuki\u2013Miyaura reactions [<a href=\"#B29\">29</a>,<a href=\"#B30\">30</a>] are the 2 most well-studied HTE yield datasets (Fig. <a href=\"#F1\">1</a>A and B). Early studies utilized computed physicochemical descriptors [<a href=\"#B26\">26</a>], one-hot encoding of reactions [<a href=\"#B27\">27</a>], or structure-based molecular fingerprints [<a href=\"#B28\">28</a>] to predict the yields for these 2 datasets. Recently, the DL fingerprint rxnfp developed by Schwaller et\u00a0al. [<a href=\"#B31\">31</a>] and the differential reaction fingerprint drfp developed by Probst et\u00a0al. [<a href=\"#B32\">32</a>] have substantially outperformed previous methods. Rxnfp and drfp respectively achieved the best performance on test sets of Buchwald\u2013Hartwig dataset and Suzuki\u2013Miyaura dataset (70:30 random split), with coefficient of determination (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup>) scores of 0.95 and 0.85. However, by studying previous experimental results, we found that most of the aforementioned methods did not achieve the ideal predictive performance on the out-of-sample test sets of Buchwald\u2013Hartwig reactions containing additional additives. This indicates the limitations of using HTE datasets for yield prediction. HTE datasets usually involve specific classes of reactions and focus on a narrow chemical space. When using yield prediction models to explore unknown chemical spaces, this performance degradation problem will be prevalent because the unknown chemical space to be predicted can be very large [<a href=\"#B33\">33</a>]. Yield prediction models trained on HTE datasets cannot be applied in the real-world scenarios aimed at predicting the yields for a broad variety of reactions. Therefore, curating generic reaction yield datasets that are not limited to specific reaction classes is the first step to promote the practical application of yield prediction models.</p><div><figure><figcaption><span>Fig.\u00a01</span>.

Reaction Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) is a simplified chemical language for representing chemical reactions [<a href=\"#B34\">34</a>]. Therefore, SMILES-based yield prediction can be viewed as a natural language processing (NLP) problem, extracting molecular features directly from reaction SMILES without relying on any manually generated feature.

In this work,\nwe develop an Attributed Graph Neural Network model that integrates both structural properties\nas well as chemical properties of molecules for predicting reaction success.\n1 INTRODUCTION\nPredicting the Performance of chemical reactions is a fundamental problem in organic chemistry.\nThe ability to predict whether a reaction will be successful or not can save significant time and effort\nof organic chemists and expedite the process of generating chemical compounds. Existing methods\nstill depend on handcrafted reaction rules [2, 6] or heuristically extracted reaction templates [3, 9],\nand therefore, are not well generalizable to unseen reactions. Another major challenge is the\navailability of data on both failed and successful experiments. Existing research in the literature\nhas mainly focused on successful experiments (i.e., reactions with a high yield), thus making it\nhard for a machine learning model to infer what makes a reaction successful. Recently, machine\nlearning models have been proposed to predict the reaction performance based on molecular\nfeatures [8, 10]. Ahneman et al. [1] advanced the field by proposing a regression model based on\nthe synthetic reaction data obtained from high-throughput experiments [1, 7? ]. However, these\nmethods only consider features such as molecular, atomic, and vibrational properties and do not\nuse any information about the complex structure of molecular graphs. We argue that in order\nto solve this problem effectively, an intelligent AI system should have two key capabilities: (1)\nUnderstanding the molecular graph structure of the input reactants to identify complex interactions\nbetween reaction components, and (2) Incorporating domain knowledge of organic chemists in the\nform of molecular, atomic, and vibrations characteristics of reactants to learn the rules that organic\nchemists use for predicting reaction success. To this end, we propose an framework which combines\nAttributed Graph Neural Network (AGNN) and chemical properties about reaction compounds\nto predict reaction performance. The chemical properties are incorporated into the model both\ndirectly (via the domain module) and indirectly (via attributed graphs of molecules).\n2 MODEL DESIGN\n2.1 Problem formulation\nWe define a chemical reaction as a combination of molecular graphs (\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc5f,\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc59,\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc60,\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc4f,\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc5d ), where\n\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc5f, \ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc59, \ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc60, \ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc4f, and \ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc5d represent the reactant, ligand, solvent, base, and the products [5] graph,\nrespectively. A molecular graph is described as \ud835\udc3a = (\ud835\udc49 , \ud835\udc38), where \ud835\udc49 = \ud835\udc4e1, \ud835\udc4e2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b is the set\nof atoms and \ud835\udc38 = \ud835\udc4f1, \ud835\udc4f2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc5a is the set of associated bonds of varying types (single, double,\nAuthors\u2019 address: Mandana Saebi, msaebi@nd.edu; Bozhao Nan, bnan@nd.edu; John Herr, ; Jessica Wahlers, jwahlers@nd.\nedu; Olaf Wiest, owiest@nd.edu; Nitesh V.

Note that\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc5f normally consists of two or more connected components since reactants\ncontain multiple molecules. Given a reaction (\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc5f,\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc59,\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc60,\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc4f,\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc5d ), our objective is to predict the\nreaction yield (i.e., reaction performance) based on molecular properties and interactions between\nthe molecular graphs of reactants. We treat this problem as a regression task. For this work, we\nfocus on Pd-catalyzed Buchwald-Hartwig reaction [1] (as shown in Figure 1 and Suzuki\u2013Miyaura\nreactions (as shown in Figure 2) because of their broad value in pharmaceutical synthesis. Below\nwe detail our model design.\n2.2 Model Architecture\nOur model incorporates the domain knowledge about molecular properties and the complex\ninteraction between molecular graphs using an attributed graph neural network (AGNN). An\noverview of the model is shown in Figure 3. The top module represents the AGNN which learns the\nstructural features and the bottom module captures the chemical properties. We detail the process\nof feature selection in subsection 4.1.\nMolecular Graph Neural Networks. We propose AGNN for capturing the complex interactions\nbetween molecular components. GNNs have been shown to be very successful in capturing the\n, Vol. 1, No. 1, Article . Publication date: June 2021.\nGraph Neural Networks for Predicting Chemical Reaction Performance 3\nhigher-order interactions between neighboring components of a graph [11]. During a reaction,\nparticular components of two molecules interact with each other, resulting in changes in atoms\nand bonds. Under favorable experimental conditions (temperature, pressure) these interactions\ntransfer the reactants into the final product. Predicting the efficiency of these complex interactions\nrelies on understating the substructures that are likely to interact.\nWe use Weisfeiler-Lehman Network (WLN) ?? for the GNN component to capture these sub\u0002structural features. We then apply attention mechanism to capture the global context and improve\nmodel performance.\nFor each reaction, we extract structural features by aggregating atom and bond features over\nthe higher-order neighborhoods by passing the molecules through the GNN and attention layer.\nWe concatenate structural features to the domain-features to obtain the final reaction features. We\nobtain two yield scores from the structural features and domain-based features, and then feed the\ntwo scores to a linear layer to generate the final reaction yield predictions. Our model is in part\ninspired by [4]. However, in this work we focus on prediction reaction yield by combining both\nstructural graph-based features as well as chemical properties.\n3 DATA\n3.1 Buchwald\u2013Hartwig reactions\nWe use two datasets that contain a collection of Buchwald\u2013Hartwig reactions:\n3.1.1 B-H. reactions from Ahneman et al.[1].
