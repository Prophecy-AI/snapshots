      "text": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) improve generalization for reaction\u2011yield prediction because they operate directly on the molecular graphs that encode the true topology of reactants, products and catalysts, rather than on a flat list of pre\u2011computed descriptors used by tabular models. By processing each atom as a node and each bond as an edge, GNNs learn **permutation\u2011invariant** and **hierarchical** representations that capture local steric and electronic environments and the way these environments interact across the whole reaction\u202f([PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8750748)). This structural encoding lets the model share parameters across chemically similar sub\u2011structures, so patterns learned from one set of reactions can be transferred to unseen scaffolds, giving higher extrapolative power than tabular approaches that treat each descriptor independently.\n\nIn practice, GNN variants such as message\u2011passing neural networks (MPNN) have achieved the strongest predictive performance on diverse cross\u2011coupling datasets, reaching an\u202fR\u00b2\u202fof\u202f0.75, whereas tabular baselines lag behind\u202f([RSC](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2025/cp/d5cp01072a)). Adding chemically informed features\u2014digitalized steric and electronic properties\u2014and a molecular\u2011interaction module further boosts extrapolation to new catalysts and scaffolds, something tabular models struggle with because those features are either omitted or cannot be combined in a relational way\u202f([Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39283-x)). Moreover, GNNs can be coupled with uncertainty\u2011aware learning, providing calibrated confidence estimates that help identify out\u2011of\u2011distribution reactions, a capability rarely available in traditional tabular regressors\u202f([J. Cheminformatics](https://jcheminf.biomedcentral.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/s13321-021-00579-z.pdf)).\n\nTogether, the ability to **directly model molecular graphs**, **share learned chemistry across reactions**, and **incorporate domain\u2011specific knowledge** enables GNNs to generalize more robustly to novel reaction spaces than tabular models that rely on fixed, often incomplete, feature vectors.",

Among different ML techniques, graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for capturing complex relationships in data by representing datapoints as graphs. Applying GNNs for predicting yields in chemical reactions is one of the emerging areas of focus. However, handling heterogeneous datasets remains a key challenge. In this study, we utilized diverse datasets encompassing various transition metal-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions including Suzuki, Sonogashira, Cadiot\u2013Chodkiewicz, Ullmann-type, and Buchwald\u2013Hartwig coupling reactions. To predict reaction yields, we implement multiple GNN architectures, including message passing neural networks (MPNN), residual graph convolutional networks (ResGCN), graph sample and aggregate (GraphSAGE), graph attention networks (GAT and GATv2), graph convolutional networks (GCN), and graph isomorphism networks (GIN). The comparative analysis of these architectures reveals that MPNN achieve the highest predictive performance, with an <em>R</em><small><sup>2</sup></small> value of 0.75. Additionally, to enhance the interpretability of our models, we employed the integrated gradients method to determine the contribution of each input descriptor to the model's yield prediction. This study highlights the potential of effective and explainable graph-based models to predict the yields of chemical reactions.

Due to the high-dimensional relationship between molecular structure and synthetic function, it is challenging to achieve the predictive modelling of synthetic transformation with the required extrapolative ability and chemical interpretability. To meet the gap between the rich domain knowledge of chemistry and the advanced molecular graph model, herein we report a knowledge-based graph model that embeds the digitalized steric and electronic information. In addition, a molecular interaction module is developed to enable the learning of the synergistic influence of reaction components. In this study, we demonstrate that this knowledge-based graph model achieves excellent predictions of reaction yield and stereoselectivity, whose extrapolative ability is corroborated by additional scaffold-based data splittings and experimental verifications with new catalysts. Because of the embedding of local environment, the model allows the atomic level of interpretation of the steric and electronic influence on the overall synthetic performance, which serves as a useful guide for the molecular engineering towards the target synthetic function. This model offers an extrapolative and interpretable approach for reaction performance prediction, pointing out the importance of chemical knowledge-constrained reaction modelling for synthetic purpose.\n\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n\n### [Knowledge graph-enhanced molecular contrastive learning with functional prompt](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-023-00654-0?fromPaywallRec=false)\n\nArticleOpen access04 May 2023\n\n### [A generalized-template-based graph neural network for accurate organic reactivity prediction](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-022-00526-z?fromPaywallRec=false)\n\nArticle15 September 2022\n\n### [A meta-learning approach for selectivity prediction in asymmetric catalysis](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58854-8?fromPaywallRec=false)\n\nArticleOpen access16 April 2025\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe chemical comprehension and accurate prediction of reactivity and selectivity provide the foundation for the rational and efficient exploration of massive synthetic space[1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39283-x#ref-CR1), [2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39283-x#ref-CR2).\u00a0This establishment of the structure\u2013performance relationship (SPR) has been focused on the reaction mechanism study and elucidation of the determining transition state model[3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39283-x#ref-CR3). Using the transition state model, chemists can elucidate the origins of the observed reactivity/selectivity trend and make synthetic judgments based on chemical theory and empirical experience[4](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39283-x#ref-CR4). This classic knowledge-driven strategy has reached remarkable success in synthetic chemistry and continues to provide strong support for the discovery of new catalysts, reagents, and reaction[5](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39283-x#ref-CR5). Despite the advantage of offering qualitative guidance in the synthetic universe, it is challenging for the knowledge-driven strategy to handle the high-dimensional SPR without a clear mechanistic basis and analytic equation. The seemingly subtle change in catalyst, additive, or even solvent may result in significant perturbation of the overall synthetic performance[6](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39283-x#ref-CR6), [7](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39283-x#ref-CR7). This is why laborious and repetitive condition optimization is still inevitably required, limiting the efficiency of synthetic development[8](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39283-x#ref-CR8).\n\nThe data-driven approach has recently emerged as a powerful strategy for SPR establishment[9](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39283-x#ref-CR9), [10](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39283-x#ref-CR10). By harnessing the interrelationship within the synthetic data, modern machine learning (ML) algorithms can create powerful models for synthetic prediction.

However, the ML prediction and design of synthetic transformation are still far from mature. One of the major bottlenecks is the availability of the molecular encoding approach and the ML framework that are suitable for SPR prediction (Fig.\u00a0[1a](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39283-x#Fig1)). Quantum chemical descriptors[27](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39283-x#ref-CR27) are known for their solid physical basis and high descriptive ability, but their application typically requires a sophisticated understanding of the underlying reaction mechanism, and the descriptor generation can be time- and resource-consuming for large-scale screening. The string- and topological structure-based encodings (i.e., SMILES, molecular fingerprints, etc.)[33](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39283-x#ref-CR33), [34](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39283-x#ref-CR34) do not require expert knowledge of the studied transformation and can be efficiently generated, while it is difficult to trace the physical organic origins of the synthetic performance. In addition, the extrapolation problem presents additional challenges for SPR prediction[35](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39283-x#ref-CR35), [36](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39283-x#ref-CR36). Current synthetic models still lack sufficient guidance for developing new catalysts and transformations.\n\n**Fig. 1: Machine learning prediction of synthetic performance and molecular property.**\n\n**a** Representative strategy of synthetic prediction by concatenating the molecular encodings of reactant 1 (orange), reactant 2 (blue), additive (green), and product (yellow). **b** Previous work of quantum chemistry-augmente...",

We use uncertainty\u0002aware learning and inference in the model to make accu\u0002rate predictions of yields and determine the confdence of \npredictions.\nMethods\nData representation\nWe suppose that a chemical reaction consists of a num\u0002ber of reactants and a single product. Tis chemical \nreaction is labeled with its reaction yield. Each instance \nis represented as (R,P, y), where R = {GR,1, ... , GR,m}\nand P = {GP} are the set of m reactants and the resulting \nproduct in the reaction, respectively, and y is the reac\u0002tion yield. Te number of reactants m can be diferent for \neach reaction.\nEach molecule in R and P is defned as an undirected \ngraph G = (V, E), where V and E represent the set of \nnodes and the set of edges, respectively. Te node fea\u0002ture vectors vj \u2208 V and edge feature vectors ej,k \u2208 E\nare associated with heavy atoms (e.g., C, N, O, and F) \nand their bonds (e.g., single, double, triple, and \naromatic), respectively. Hydrogen atoms are treated \nimplicitly. Te number of heavy atoms and bonds in each \nmolecule is the same as the number of node feature vec\u0002tors and edge feature vectors in the corresponding graph \nrepresentation, respectively. Figure\u00a01 illustrates an exam\u0002ple of the graph representation of a molecule.\nFor the j-th atom, vj = (vj,1, ... , vj,p) is a vec\u0002tor indicating the atom type, formal charge, degree, \nhybridization, number of hydrogens, valence, chiral\u0002ity, whether it accepts or donates electrons, whether it \nis aromatic, whether it is in a ring, and associated ring \nsizes. For the bond between the j-th and k-th atoms, \nej,k = (ej,k,1, ... , ej,k,q) is a vector indicating the bond \ntype, stereochemistry, whether it is in a ring, and whether \nit is conjugated.\nPrediction model\nTo predict the reaction yield y, we introduce a predictive \ndistribution for y conditioned on the set of reactants R\nand product P, denoted by p\u03b8 (y|R,P), which is modeled \nas a normal distribution as follows:\nwhere \u00b5 and \u03c32\n are the mean and variance of the distri\u0002bution, respectively. We parameterize the predictive dis\u0002tribution p\u03b8 using a neural network f that produces \u00b5 and \n\u03c32\n as a function of R and P with a set of parameters \u03b8:\nTo construct the neural network f, we adapt the architec\u0002ture presented by Saebi et al. [7] to process two sets of \nmolecular graphs with advanced neural network mod\u0002ules. Figure\u00a0 2 illustrates the architecture used in this \nstudy.

However, the progress of many DL-assisted synthesis planning (DASP) algorithms has suffered from the lack of reliable automated pathway evaluation tools. As a critical metric for evaluating chemical reactions, accurate prediction of reaction yields helps improve the practicality of DASP algorithms in the real-world scenarios. Currently, accurately predicting yields of interesting reactions still faces numerous challenges, mainly including the absence of high-quality generic reaction yield datasets and robust generic yield predictors. To compensate for the limitations of high-throughput yield datasets, we curated a generic reaction yield dataset containing 12 reaction categories and rich reaction condition information. Subsequently, by utilizing 2 pretraining tasks based on chemical reaction masked language modeling and contrastive learning, we proposed a powerful bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT)-based reaction yield predictor named Egret. It achieved comparable or even superior performance to the best previous models on 4 benchmark datasets and established state-of-the-art performance on the newly curated dataset. We found that reaction-condition-based contrastive learning enhances the model\u2019s sensitivity to reaction conditions, and Egret is capable of capturing subtle differences between reactions involving identical reactants and products but different reaction conditions. Furthermore, we proposed a new scoring function that incorporated Egret into the evaluation of multistep synthesis routes. Test results showed that yield-incorporated scoring facilitated the prioritization of literature-supported high-yield reaction pathways for target molecules. In addition, through meta-learning strategy, we further improved the reliability of the model\u2019s prediction for reaction types with limited data and lower data quality. Our results suggest that Egret holds the potential to become an essential component of the next-generation DASP tools.</p></section><div><section><h2>Introduction</h2><p>Efficient chemical synthesis is crucial to satisfying the future demands for pharmaceuticals, materials, and energy [<a href=\"#B1\">1</a>]. Corey and Wipke [<a href=\"#B2\">2</a>] first proposed the concept of computer-aided synthesis planning (CASP) in the 1960s. CASP programs take the target molecule as input and return a series of single-step reactions that decompose the target molecule into a set of commercially available starting compounds or simple precursors that can be easily synthesized [<a href=\"#B3\">3</a>]. A feasible synthesis plan may dramatically accelerate the synthesis of desired molecules [<a href=\"#B4\">4</a>]. In recent years, with the development of data science, deep learning (DL) algorithms, and computing power, DL-assisted synthesis planning (DASP) has gained considerable interest [<a href=\"#B5\">5</a>\u2013<a href=\"#B17\">17</a>]. Modern DASP programs can quickly plan multiple potential retrosynthetic pathways for a given target molecule according to the constraints set by the user for the retrosynthetic search (such as the overall search time and number of single-step expansion steps) [<a href=\"#B18\">18</a>]. However, these theoretically feasible reaction pathways often become impractical because of such factors as incomplete conversion of reactants, side reactions, or inadequate purification [<a href=\"#B19\">19</a>]. Therefore, retrosynthetic route planning is only a major component of a successful DASP system [<a href=\"#B20\">20</a>]. To provide feasible suggestions that can be implemented by chemists in the laboratory, it is necessary to identify the optimal reaction conditions for the retrosynthetic route [<a href=\"#B21\">21</a>] and evaluate the quality of the overall synthesis route, and reaction yield is one of the most scientific and intuitive metrics for screening reaction conditions and evaluating synthesis pathway [<a href=\"#B22\">22</a>,<a href=\"#B23\">23</a>].</p><p>Reaction yield refers to the percentage of reactants that are successfully converted to the desired product [<a href=\"#B24\">24</a>]. Models that can reliably predict actual yields not only serve as scoring functions of DASP but also help chemists evaluate the overall yield of complex reaction pathways, giving priority to high-yield reactions to save time and cost in wet experiments [<a href=\"#B25\">25</a>]. However, because of the complexity of molecular structures, the multidimensionality of chemical reactions, and the limited availability of data, it is still a great challenge to predict the yields of chemical reactions under specific conditions [<a href=\"#B26\">26</a>]. The current yield prediction models are mainly built on high-throughput experimental (HTE) datasets, and Buchwald\u2013Hartwig reactions [<a href=\"#B26\">26</a>\u2013<a href=\"#B28\">28</a>] and Suzuki\u2013Miyaura reactions [<a href=\"#B29\">29</a>,<a href=\"#B30\">30</a>] are the 2 most well-studied HTE yield datasets (Fig. <a href=\"#F1\">1</a>A and B). Early studies utilized computed physicochemical descriptors [<a href=\"#B26\">26</a>], one-hot encoding of reactions [<a href=\"#B27\">27</a>], or structure-based molecular fingerprints [<a href=\"#B28\">28</a>] to predict the yields for these 2 datasets. Recently, the DL fingerprint rxnfp developed by Schwaller et\u00a0al. [<a href=\"#B31\">31</a>] and the differential reaction fingerprint drfp developed by Probst et\u00a0al. [<a href=\"#B32\">32</a>] have substantially outperformed previous methods. Rxnfp and drfp respectively achieved the best performance on test sets of Buchwald\u2013Hartwig dataset and Suzuki\u2013Miyaura dataset (70:30 random split), with coefficient of determination (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup>) scores of 0.95 and 0.85. However, by studying previous experimental results, we found that most of the aforementioned methods did not achieve the ideal predictive performance on the out-of-sample test sets of Buchwald\u2013Hartwig reactions containing additional additives. This indicates the limitations of using HTE datasets for yield prediction. HTE datasets usually involve specific classes of reactions and focus on a narrow chemical space. When using yield prediction models to explore unknown chemical spaces, this performance degradation problem will be prevalent because the unknown chemical space to be predicted can be very large [<a href=\"#B33\">33</a>]. Yield prediction models trained on HTE datasets cannot be applied in the real-world scenarios aimed at predicting the yields for a broad variety of reactions. Therefore, curating generic reaction yield datasets that are not limited to specific reaction classes is the first step to promote the practical application of yield prediction models.</p><div><figure><figcaption><span>Fig.\u00a01</span>.

As a result, predicting the success of a reaction is a non-trivial task, which often requires running several experiments in the lab. This process is is expensive, time consuming, and inefficient. As a result, in recent years, researchers have explored the use of machine learning algorithms to predict reaction success. These methods mainly rely on chemical properties of the molecules involved in the reactions. Despite their promising success, none of existing methods explored the use of structural properties of molecules in predicting reaction success. In this work, we develop an Attributed Graph Neural Network model that integrates both structural properties as well as chemical properties of molecules for predicting reaction success. Our model shows remarkable performance on two hand-crafted datasets obtained from high-throughput experiments, as well as one real-world dataset.\n## Keywords\n[Deep Learning](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/search-dashboard?keywords=Deep%20Learning)\n[Graph Neural Networks](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/search-dashboard?keywords=Graph%20Neural%20Networks)\n[Yield prediction](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/search-dashboard?keywords=Yield%20prediction)\n## Comments\nYou are signed in as .
