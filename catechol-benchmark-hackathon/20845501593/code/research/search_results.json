Traditional machine learning approaches often treat solvent identity as a discrete categorical variable, which prevents systematic interpolation and extrapolation across the solvent space. This work introduces the \\textbf{Catechol Benchmark}, a high-throughput transient flow chemistry dataset comprising 1,227 experimental yield measurements for the rearrangement of allyl-substituted catechol in 24 pure solvents and their binary mixtures, parameterized by continuous volume fractions ($\\% B$). We evaluate various architectures under rigorous leave-one-solvent-out and leave-one-mixture-out protocols to test generalization to unseen chemical environments.\n> Our results demonstrate that classical tabular methods (e.g., Gradient-Boosted Decision Trees) and large language model embeddings (e.g., Qwen-7B) struggle with quantitative precision, yielding Mean Squared Errors (MSE) of 0.099 and 0.129, respectively. In contrast, we propose a hybrid GNN-based architecture that integrates Graph Attention Networks (GATs) with Differential Reaction Fingerprints (DRFP) and learned mixture-aware solvent encodings. This approach achieves an \\textbf{MSE of 0.0039} ($\\pm$ 0.0003), representing a 60\\% error reduction over competitive baselines and a $&gt;25\\times$ improvement over tabular ensembles. Ablation studies confirm that explicit molecular graph message-passing and continuous mixture encoding are essential for robust generalization. The complete dataset, evaluation protocols, and reference implementations are released to facilitate data-efficient reaction prediction and continuous solvent representation learning.

The percentage of products obtained relative to the reactants consumed is referred to as the chemical reaction yield. The prediction of the chemical reaction yields provides clues for exploring high-yield chemical reactions without the need for conducting direct experiments. This is crucial for accelerating synthesis planning in organic chemistry by significantly reducing time and cost. Machine learning has been actively utilized for the fast and accurate prediction of chemical reaction yields in a data-driven manner [<a href=\"#CR1\">1</a>\u2013<a href=\"#CR8\">8</a>].</p>\n<p>Recently, deep learning has shown remarkable performance in predicting chemical reaction yields by effectively modeling the intricate relationships between chemical reactions and their yields using neural networks. Schwaller et al. [<a href=\"#CR6\">6</a>, <a href=\"#CR7\">7</a>] represented a chemical reaction as a series of simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES) strings and built a bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) as the prediction model. Kwon et al. [<a href=\"#CR8\">8</a>] represented a chemical reaction as a set of molecular graphs and built a graph neural network (GNN) that operates directly on the molecular graphs as the prediction model. The use of GNNs led to a significant improvement in the predictive performance owing to their high expressive power on molecular graphs [<a href=\"#CR9\">9</a>, <a href=\"#CR10\">10</a>].</p>\n<p>Despite its effectiveness, the predictive performance of a GNN can suffer when it is trained on an insufficient training dataset in terms of quantity or diversity. For example, a GNN may not generalize well to query reactions involving substances that are not considered in the training dataset. Although the performance can be significantly improved by securing a large-scale training dataset, this is difficult in practice because of the high cost associated with conducting direct experiments to acquire the yields for a large number of chemical reactions.</p>\n<p>To alleviate this issue, a promising solution is to pre-train a GNN on a large-scale molecular database and use it to adapt to chemical reaction yield prediction. Various pre-training methods have been studied in the literature, which can be categorized into contrastive learning and pre-text task approaches [<a href=\"#CR11\">11</a>, <a href=\"#CR12\">12</a>]. The contrastive learning approach pre-trains a GNN by learning molecular representations such that different views of the same molecule are mapped close together, and views of different molecules are mapped far apart [<a href=\"#CR13\">13</a>\u2013<a href=\"#CR18\">18</a>]. Most existing methods based on this approach have utilized data augmentation techniques to generate different views of each molecule. Data augmentation may potentially alter the properties of the molecules being represented [<a href=\"#CR19\">19</a>, <a href=\"#CR20\">20</a>]. The pre-text task approach acquires the pseudo-labels of molecules and pre-trains a GNN to predict them [<a href=\"#CR21\">21</a>\u2013<a href=\"#CR25\">25</a>]. Existing methods have attempted to define appropriate pre-text tasks in various ways to effectively learn molecular representations. The process of acquiring pseudo-labels can be costly and time-consuming depending on how the pre-text task is defined. Since both approaches have their own advantages and drawbacks, it is important to choose the most suitable pre-training method that best aligns with the objective of a specific downstream task that needs to be addressed.</p>\n<p>In this study, we propose a novel pre-training method, <strong>MolDescPred</strong>, to improve the performance in predicting chemical reaction yields. <strong>MolDescPred</strong> is based on the pre-text task approach to pre-train a GNN. Given a molecular database containing a substantial number of molecules, we calculate the molecular descriptors for the molecules and reduce their dimensionality by applying principal component analysis (PCA). Each molecule is then pseudo-labeled with a vector of its principal component scores. The GNN is then pre-trained to predict the pseudo-label of its input molecule. For chemical reaction yield prediction, a prediction model is initialized using the pre-trained GNN and then is fine-tuned with a training dataset composed of chemical reactions and their corresponding yields. Through experiments on benchmark datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to existing methods, especially when the training dataset is insufficient.</p></section><section><h2>Method</h2>\n<section><h3>Problem definition</h3>\n<p>For chemical reaction yield prediction, we aim to build an accurate prediction model <em>f</em> which takes a chemical reaction <span></span> as the input to predict the yield <em>y</em> by learning from the training dataset <span></span>.

      "text": "Graph Neural Networks for Predicting Chemical Reaction\nPerformance\nMANDANA SAEBI, BOZHAO NAN, JOHN HERR, JESSICA WAHLERS, OLAF WIEST,\nand NITESH V. CHAWLA, University of Notre Dame\nChemical reactions are a complex process, as they involve interaction between several molecu\u0002lar compounds. As a result, predicting the success of a reaction is a non-trivial task, which often\nrequires running several experiments in the lab. This process is is expensive, time consuming, and\ninefficient. As a result, in recent years, researchers have explored the use of machine learning al\u0002gorithms to predict reaction success. These methods mainly rely on chemical properties of the\nmolecules involved in the reactions. Despite their promising success, none of existing methods\nexplored the use of structural properties of molecules in predicting reaction success. In this work,\nwe develop an Attributed Graph Neural Network model that integrates both structural properties\nas well as chemical properties of molecules for predicting reaction success.\n1 INTRODUCTION\nPredicting the Performance of chemical reactions is a fundamental problem in organic chemistry.\nThe ability to predict whether a reaction will be successful or not can save significant time and effort\nof organic chemists and expedite the process of generating chemical compounds. Existing methods\nstill depend on handcrafted reaction rules [2, 6] or heuristically extracted reaction templates [3, 9],\nand therefore, are not well generalizable to unseen reactions. Another major challenge is the\navailability of data on both failed and successful experiments. Existing research in the literature\nhas mainly focused on successful experiments (i.e., reactions with a high yield), thus making it\nhard for a machine learning model to infer what makes a reaction successful. Recently, machine\nlearning models have been proposed to predict the reaction performance based on molecular\nfeatures [8, 10]. Ahneman et al. [1] advanced the field by proposing a regression model based on\nthe synthetic reaction data obtained from high-throughput experiments [1, 7? ]. However, these\nmethods only consider features such as molecular, atomic, and vibrational properties and do not\nuse any information about the complex structure of molecular graphs. We argue that in order\nto solve this problem effectively, an intelligent AI system should have two key capabilities: (1)\nUnderstanding the molecular graph structure of the input reactants to identify complex interactions\nbetween reaction components, and (2) Incorporating domain knowledge of organic chemists in the\nform of molecular, atomic, and vibrations characteristics of reactants to learn the rules that organic\nchemists use for predicting reaction success. To this end, we propose an framework which combines\nAttributed Graph Neural Network (AGNN) and chemical properties about reaction compounds\nto predict reaction performance. The chemical properties are incorporated into the model both\ndirectly (via the domain module) and indirectly (via attributed graphs of molecules).\n2 MODEL DESIGN\n2.1 Problem formulation\nWe define a chemical reaction as a combination of molecular graphs (\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc5f,\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc59,\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc60,\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc4f,\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc5d ), where\n\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc5f, \ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc59, \ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc60, \ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc4f, and \ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc5d represent the reactant, ligand, solvent, base, and the products [5] graph,\nrespectively. A molecular graph is described as \ud835\udc3a = (\ud835\udc49 , \ud835\udc38), where \ud835\udc49 = \ud835\udc4e1, \ud835\udc4e2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b is the set\nof atoms and \ud835\udc38 = \ud835\udc4f1, \ud835\udc4f2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc5a is the set of associated bonds of varying types (single, double,\nAuthors\u2019 address: Mandana Saebi, msaebi@nd.edu; Bozhao Nan, bnan@nd.edu; John Herr, ; Jessica Wahlers, jwahlers@nd.\nedu; Olaf Wiest, owiest@nd.edu; Nitesh V.

Note that\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc5f normally consists of two or more connected components since reactants\ncontain multiple molecules. Given a reaction (\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc5f,\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc59,\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc60,\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc4f,\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc5d ), our objective is to predict the\nreaction yield (i.e., reaction performance) based on molecular properties and interactions between\nthe molecular graphs of reactants. We treat this problem as a regression task. For this work, we\nfocus on Pd-catalyzed Buchwald-Hartwig reaction [1] (as shown in Figure 1 and Suzuki\u2013Miyaura\nreactions (as shown in Figure 2) because of their broad value in pharmaceutical synthesis.

During a reaction,\nparticular components of two molecules interact with each other, resulting in changes in atoms\nand bonds. Under favorable experimental conditions (temperature, pressure) these interactions\ntransfer the reactants into the final product. Predicting the efficiency of these complex interactions\nrelies on understating the substructures that are likely to interact.\nWe use Weisfeiler-Lehman Network (WLN) ?? for the GNN component to capture these sub\u0002structural features. We then apply attention mechanism to capture the global context and improve\nmodel performance.\nFor each reaction, we extract structural features by aggregating atom and bond features over\nthe higher-order neighborhoods by passing the molecules through the GNN and attention layer.\nWe concatenate structural features to the domain-features to obtain the final reaction features. We\nobtain two yield scores from the structural features and domain-based features, and then feed the\ntwo scores to a linear layer to generate the final reaction yield predictions. Our model is in part\ninspired by [4]. However, in this work we focus on prediction reaction yield by combining both\nstructural graph-based features as well as chemical properties.\n3 DATA\n3.1 Buchwald\u2013Hartwig reactions\nWe use two datasets that contain a collection of Buchwald\u2013Hartwig reactions:\n3.1.1 B-H. reactions from Ahneman et al.[1].

Among different ML techniques, graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for capturing complex relationships in data by representing datapoints as graphs. Applying GNNs for predicting yields in chemical reactions is one of the emerging areas of focus. However, handling heterogeneous datasets remains a key challenge. In this study, we utilized diverse datasets encompassing various transition metal-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions including Suzuki, Sonogashira, Cadiot\u2013Chodkiewicz, Ullmann-type, and Buchwald\u2013Hartwig coupling reactions. To predict reaction yields, we implement multiple GNN architectures, including message passing neural networks (MPNN), residual graph convolutional networks (ResGCN), graph sample and aggregate (GraphSAGE), graph attention networks (GAT and GATv2), graph convolutional networks (GCN), and graph isomorphism networks (GIN). The comparative analysis of these architectures reveals that MPNN achieve the highest predictive performance, with an <em>R</em><small><sup>2</sup></small> value of 0.75. Additionally, to enhance the interpretability of our models, we employed the integrated gradients method to determine the contribution of each input descriptor to the model's yield prediction. This study highlights the potential of effective and explainable graph-based models to predict the yields of chemical reactions.

Among different ML techniques, graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for capturing complex relationships in data by representing datapoints as graphs. Applying GNNs for predicting yields in chemical reactions is one of the emerging areas of focus. However, handling heterogeneous datasets remains a key challenge. In this study, we utilized diverse datasets encompassing various transition metal-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions including Suzuki, Sonogashira, Cadiot\u2013Chodkiewicz, Ullmann-type, and Buchwald\u2013Hartwig coupling reactions. To predict reaction yields, we implement multiple GNN architectures, including message passing neural networks (MPNN), residual graph convolutional networks (ResGCN), graph sample and aggregate (GraphSAGE), graph attention networks (GAT and GATv2), graph convolutional networks (GCN), and graph isomorphism networks (GIN). The comparative analysis of these architectures reveals that MPNN achieve the highest predictive performance, with an <em>R</em><small><sup>2</sup></small> value of 0.75. Additionally, to enhance the interpretability of our models, we employed the integrated gradients method to determine the contribution of each input descriptor to the model's yield prediction. This study highlights the potential of effective and explainable graph-based models to predict the yields of chemical reactions. This work contributes to the application of machine learning in catalysis, providing valuable insights for optimizing catalytic reactions and contributing to innovations in sustainable chemistry and organic synthesis.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n</div>\n</article>\n</section>\n<div>\n<div>\n<h2>Article information</h2>\n<dl>\n<p>\n</p><dt>DOI</dt>\n<dd><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1039/D5CP01072A\">https://doi.org/10.1039/D5CP01072A</a></dd>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n</p><dt><strong>Article type</strong></dt>\n<dd>Paper</dd>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n</p><dt>Submitted</dt>\n<dd>19 Mar 2025</dd>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n</p><dt>Accepted</dt>\n<dd>02 Jun 2025</dd>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n</p><dt>First published</dt>\n<dd>02 Jun 2025</dd>\n<p></p>\n</dl>\n<div>\n<p>\n</p><h3>\n</h3>\n<p></p>\n<div>\n<p><i><strong>Phys.

The \nreactants and products in a chemical reaction are represented as a set of molecular graphs. The predictive distribution \nof the yield is modeled as a graph neural network that directly processes a set of graphs with permutation invariance. \nUncertainty-aware learning and inference are applied to the model to make accurate predictions and to evaluate their \nuncertainty. We demonstrate the efectiveness of the proposed method on benchmark datasets with various settings. \nCompared to the existing methods, the proposed method improves the prediction and uncertainty quantifcation \nperformance in most settings.\nKeywords: Chemical reaction yield prediction, Uncertainty-aware prediction, Graph neural network, Deep learning\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2022.

Tis enables the estimation of \nthe overall yield of a complex synthetic pathway and the \ndetection of low-yield reactions that negatively afect \nthe overall yield. It also provides clues for designing new \nreactions that provide higher yields to save on the time \nand cost required for experimental syntheses.\nMachine learning has achieved remarkable success in \nthe data-driven prediction of chemical reaction yields \n[1, 3\u20137]. Te main concept is to construct a prediction \nmodel that predicts the yield of a chemical reaction by \nlearning from previously accumulated data compris\u0002ing a number of chemical reactions annotated with \ntheir experimentally measured yields. Te successful \napplication of a prediction model enables fast and ef\u0002cient estimation of chemical reaction yields without \nperforming experimental syntheses, which are costly and \ntime-consuming.\nEarly studies represented each chemical reaction as a \nfxed-size vector of handcrafted features, such as molecu\u0002lar fngerprints and chemical property descriptors, and \nconstructed an of-the-shelf prediction model on top of \nthe vector representation [3\u20135, 8]. Te limitation of this \napproach is that the choice of adequate features relies \non chemical knowledge and intuition, and some inher\u0002ent information to the original reaction may be lost \nin the representation. With advances in deep learning \n[9], recent studies have applied deep neural networks \nconstructed on a more informative representation of a \nchemical reaction. Schwaller et\u00a0al.

We use uncertainty\u0002aware learning and inference in the model to make accu\u0002rate predictions of yields and determine the confdence of \npredictions.\nMethods\nData representation\nWe suppose that a chemical reaction consists of a num\u0002ber of reactants and a single product. Tis chemical \nreaction is labeled with its reaction yield. Each instance \nis represented as (R,P, y), where R = {GR,1, ... , GR,m}\nand P = {GP} are the set of m reactants and the resulting \nproduct in the reaction, respectively, and y is the reac\u0002tion yield. Te number of reactants m can be diferent for \neach reaction.\nEach molecule in R and P is defned as an undirected \ngraph G = (V, E), where V and E represent the set of \nnodes and the set of edges, respectively. Te node fea\u0002ture vectors vj \u2208 V and edge feature vectors ej,k \u2208 E\nare associated with heavy atoms (e.g., C, N, O, and F) \nand their bonds (e.g., single, double, triple, and \naromatic), respectively. Hydrogen atoms are treated \nimplicitly. Te number of heavy atoms and bonds in each \nmolecule is the same as the number of node feature vec\u0002tors and edge feature vectors in the corresponding graph \nrepresentation, respectively. Figure\u00a01 illustrates an exam\u0002ple of the graph representation of a molecule.\nFor the j-th atom, vj = (vj,1, ... , vj,p) is a vec\u0002tor indicating the atom type, formal charge, degree, \nhybridization, number of hydrogens, valence, chiral\u0002ity, whether it accepts or donates electrons, whether it \nis aromatic, whether it is in a ring, and associated ring \nsizes. For the bond between the j-th and k-th atoms, \nej,k = (ej,k,1, ... , ej,k,q) is a vector indicating the bond \ntype, stereochemistry, whether it is in a ring, and whether \nit is conjugated.\nPrediction model\nTo predict the reaction yield y, we introduce a predictive \ndistribution for y conditioned on the set of reactants R\nand product P, denoted by p\u03b8 (y|R,P), which is modeled \nas a normal distribution as follows:\nwhere \u00b5 and \u03c32\n are the mean and variance of the distri\u0002bution, respectively. We parameterize the predictive dis\u0002tribution p\u03b8 using a neural network f that produces \u00b5 and \n\u03c32\n as a function of R and P with a set of parameters \u03b8:\nTo construct the neural network f, we adapt the architec\u0002ture presented by Saebi et al. [7] to process two sets of \nmolecular graphs with advanced neural network mod\u0002ules. Figure\u00a0 2 illustrates the architecture used in this \nstudy. Te architectural details of each component are \npresented next.\nA message passing neural network (MPNN) [12] is \nused as the GNN component of f to process each molec\u0002ular graph G in R and P. Te GNN is designed to take G\nas the input and return the graph representation vector r\nas the output:\nIn the GNN, we apply multiple message passing steps \nusing an edge network as a message function and a gated \nrecurrent unit (GRU) network as an update function to \ngenerate node representation vectors. We then apply a \nset2set model [13] as a readout function for g...",
