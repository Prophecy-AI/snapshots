      "finding": "Generalizing reaction\u2011prediction models to solvents that were not present in the training set requires a combination of data\u2011efficient sampling, rich solvent representations, and out\u2011of\u2011distribution (OOD) learning strategies.  Recent work shows that **active\u2011learning loops coupled with descriptor\u2011based selectors** can build compact yet chemically diverse training sets that span the relevant solvent\u2011reaction space, dramatically reducing the amount of data needed while still capturing the key solute\u2011solvent interactions that govern rates and selectivity\u3010nature.com\u3011.  In parallel, generating a large, systematic solvent database (e.g.,\u202f\u2248\u202f30\u202f000 reactions across\u202f\u2248\u202f300 solvents using COSMO\u2011RS calculations) and training models on **atom\u2011mapped reaction SMILES together with explicit solvent SMILES** yields low mean\u2011absolute errors on unseen reactions and reliable relative rate predictions, demonstrating that a simple string\u2011based encoding can be highly transferable when the underlying data are",
