      "title": "ANSWER",
      "text": "Predicting reaction yields when only a handful of experiments are available requires models that can learn strong priors from large\u2011scale data and then adapt quickly to new chemistry.  Recent work frames the problem as a **low\u2011data or few\u2011shot learning task**, leveraging transfer\u2011learning, meta\u2011learning, and active\u2011learning strategies rather than plain supervised regression on a fixed fingerprint set\u202f([ACS\u202fJCIM](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jcim.3c00577)).\n\nA particularly effective class of models are **attention\u2011based meta\u2011learners** such as MetaRF, which combine a random\u2011forest backbone with an attention mechanism that weights training examples according to their relevance to the target reaction, enabling accurate yield predictions from only a few trials\u202f([Journal\u202fof\u202fCheminformatics](https://jcheminf.biomedcentral.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/s13321-023-00715-x.pdf)).  Complementary approaches fine\u2011tune **reaction\u2011transformer** architectures (originally trained on millions of USPTO reactions) on the small experimental set; data\u2011augmentation of reaction SMILES and **test\u2011time augmentation** provide both higher accuracy and calibrated uncertainty estimates, helping to flag predictions on out\u2011of\u2011distribution molecules\u202f([IBM\u202fResearch\u202f2021](https://research.ibm.com/publications/low-data-regime-yield-predictions-with-uncertainty-estimation-using-deep-learning-approaches)).  **Deep active\u2011learning pipelines** such as DeepReac+ iteratively select the most informative reactions to test, reducing the number of required experiments while continuously improving the model\u202f([RSC\u202f2021](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlepdf/2021/sc/d1sc02087k)).  When combined with **physics\u2011based or mechanistic descriptors** (e.g., activation\u2011energy estimates) these data\u2011driven methods further improve generalization to unseen substrates\u202f([Chem\u202fSci\u202f2021](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2021/sc/d0sc04896h)).\n\nIn practice, the best workflow starts with a pretrained transformer or MetaRF model, augments the limited data with chemically plausible reaction variants, applies uncertainty\u2011aware fine\u2011tuning, and uses active\u2011learning loops to query the most informative new experiments.  This blend of **transfer learning, meta\u2011learning, attention mechanisms, and uncertainty\u2011driven active learning** consistently yields the most reliable predictions for new molecules under severe data constraints.",

In this paper, we focus on the reaction yield prediction \nproblem, which assists chemists in selecting high-yield reactions in a new chemical space only with a few experi\u2011\nmental trials. To attack this challenge, we frst put forth MetaRF, an attention-based random forest model specially \ndesigned for the few-shot yield prediction, where the attention weight of a random forest is automatically optimized \nby the meta-learning framework and can be quickly adapted to predict the performance of new reagents while given \na few additional samples. To improve the few-shot learning performance, we further introduce a dimension-reduction \nbased sampling method to determine valuable samples to be experimentally tested and then learned. Our methodol\u2011\nogy is evaluated on three diferent datasets and acquires satisfactory performance on few-shot prediction. In high\u0002throughput experimentation (HTE) datasets, the average yield of our methodology\u2019s top 10 high-yield reactions is \nrelatively close to the results of ideal yield selection.\nKeywords Few-shot, Yield prediction, Random forest, Meta-learning\nIntroduction\nComputer-aided synthesis planning (CASP)\u00a0 [1], which \naims to assist chemists in synthesizing new molecule \ncompounds, has been rapidly transformed by artifcial \nintelligence methods. Given the availability of large-scale \nreaction datasets, such as the United States Patent and \nTrademark Ofce (USPTO) [2], Reaxys [3], and SciFinder \n[4], CASP has become an increasingly popular topic in \npharmaceutical discovery and organic chemistry with \nmany impressive breakthroughs achieved [5]. Te current \nCASP systems can be divided into two critical aspects, \nretrosynthetic planning and forward-reaction prediction \n[6]. Retrosynthetic planning, including template-based \nand template-free methods, can help generate possible \nsynthetic routes of target molecules [7]. Forward-reac\u0002tion prediction is mainly used to evaluate the strategies \nproposed by retrosynthetic planning and increase the \nlikelihood of experimental success [8]. However, with\u0002out considering reaction yield or reaction conditions, the \nsynthetic strategies proposed in the CASP systems would \nbe difcult to be implemented. It still remains a big chal\u0002lenge to predict the reaction yield. Due to the complexity \nof chemical experiments, few solid theories can help pre\u0002dict the reaction yield of a new chemical reaction given \na specifc condition, let alone optimize a reaction con\u0002dition, which heavily depends on expertise, knowledge, \nintuition, numerous practices, extensive literature read\u0002ing and even the luck of chemists [5, 9].\n*Correspondence:\nGuangyong Chen\ngychen@zhejianglab.com\n1\n Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Chinese \nUniversity of Hong Kong, New Territories, Hong Kong SAR 2\n Zhejiang Lab, Zhejiang, China\n3\n College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University, Zhejiang, China\nChen\u00a0et\u00a0al. Journal of Cheminformatics (2023) 15:43 Page 2 of 12\nSome pioneer eforts have been contributed to pre\u0002dict the reaction yield, and then fnd the optimal reac\u0002tion condition. Note that the optimal reaction selection \nproblem can be naturally treated as a classical out-of-dis\u0002tribution (OOD) problem, since the optimal reaction is \noften not included in the training set. Ahneman et\u00a0al. [10] \nreported that the random forest model achieved the best \nperformance on OOD yield prediction due to its good \ngeneralization ability. Zuranski et\u00a0 al. [11] reviewed and \nexamined the OOD performance of diferent machine \nlearning algorithms and reaction embedding techniques. \nDong et\u00a0 al. [12] used the XGBoost model and achieved \nsatisfactory OOD performance. Zhu et\u00a0 al. [13] demon\u0002strated that regression-based machine learning had great \napplication potential in OOD yield prediction.\n[R2\u20134] Studying the experimental results in previ\u0002ous work, we found that the predicting performance \nwill deteriorate dramatically when there exists relatively \nlarge diference between training and testing data. For \ninstance, in the experiments of [10, 14, 15], when the \ntesting data do not contain any new reagents that are \ndiferent from the training set (testing data is randomly \nselected from the whole dataset, and the rest of the data \nis used as training set), the R2\n of random forest model \nis 0.92. When the testing data includes new additives \nthat are not contained in the training data (testing data \nincludes reactions with some additives, while training \ndata includes reactions with other additives), the R2\n of \nrandom forest model will drop to 0.19 in the worst case \n(the size of training set is almost same). Tis performance \ndeterioration problem will be very common when using \nyield prediction model to explore new reaction chemi\u0002cal space, as the size of unknown chemical space to be \npredicted can be huge. Enlarging training set with huge \namount of data may solve this performance deteriora\u0002tion problem, but it is not practical due to the high cost \nof experimental data and huge size of unknown chemical \nspace.\nIn this paper, we follow a more relaxed but practical \nsetting, where we are allowed to add a few data of new \nreagents or conditions into the training set. Considering \nthe limited amount of reaction condition data, few-shot \nyield prediction has great potential in solving this prob\u0002lem. Few-shot yield prediction adds very few reaction \nsamples(e.g. around fve samples) from new reagents or \nconditions into training data. It is reasonable to hypoth\u0002esize that using data of a new reagent can improve pre\u0002diction results. Questions yet to be explored are how to \nuse these new samples, which sample to select, and how \nmuch data from the new reagent leads to a satisfactory \nresult.\nTo bridge this gap, we proposed MetaRF, an atten\u0002tion-based random forest model with a meta-learning \ntechnique applied to determine attention weights adap\u0002tively. Te random forest has been proved as an ensem\u0002ble method with outstanding performance on datasets \nwith small sample size [16, 17]. Since the size of reaction \ncondition datasets are relatively small (e.g. 781 reactions \nin Buchwald-Hartwig electronic laboratory notebooks \ndataset [18]), random forest models have shown excellent \nperformance on reaction yield predictio...",

This journal is\nMethods\nData preprocessing 1) Dataset A:\nThe original work contains 4140 experiments of Buchwald-Hartwig cross-coupling reaction. 1 However, when we examined the original data file, it was found that the experiments containing additive 7 were absent so there were only 3960 experiments. Among them, the yield of five experiments is recorded as \"NA\" and should be removed. Thus, Dataset A consists of the remaining 3955 experiments.\n2) Dataset B: The original work contains 5760 experiments of Suzuki-Miyaura coupling reaction. 2 However, when we examined the original data file, it was found that the solvent of some experiments containing substrate 2d is \"THF_V2\" which is confusing. In addition, Suzuki-Miyaura coupling reaction can also take place between substrate 2d and substrate 2a/2b/2c but this kind of data is absent. The resulting incomplete reaction space isn't suitable for the proper simulation of active learning loop. For example, if a data point selected by some sampling strategy isn't included in the dataset, it can't be \"labeled\" in the simulation, which is not consistent with the fact.

Figure 1A is the overview of our proposed predictive model DeepReac. The input can include organic and inorganic components. The former is encoded into dense vectors via Molecule GAT module while the latter is first mapped into sparse one-hot vectors and then embedded to dense vectors via an embedding layer. These vectors are then represented as a reaction graph, where each node corresponds to a component and different components can interact with each other through edges. The reaction graph is feed into Reaction GAT module to model node interactions. A capsule layer is applied on the output of Reaction GAT module to estimate the reaction performance such as yield and stereoselectivity.

Models based on machine learning have emerged as a promising alternative to address these problems, but these models currently lack the precision to give crucial information on the magnitude of barrier heights, influence of solvents and catalysts and extent of regio- and chemoselectivity. Here, we construct hybrid models which combine the traditional transition state modelling and machine learning to accurately predict reaction barriers. We train a Gaussian Process Regression model to reproduce high-quality experimental kinetic data for the nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction and use it to predict barriers with a mean absolute error of 0.77 kcal mol\u22121 for an external test set. The model was further validated on regio- and chemoselectivity prediction on patent reaction data and achieved a competitive top-1 accuracy of 86%, despite not being trained explicitly for this task. Importantly, the model gives error bars for its predictions that can be used for risk assessment by the end user. Hybrid models emerge as the preferred alternative for accurate reaction prediction in the very common low-data situation where only 100\u2013150 rate constants are available for a reaction class. With recent advances in deep learning for quickly predicting barriers and transition state geometries from density functional theory, we envision that hybrid models will soon become a standard alternative to complement current machine learning approaches based on ground-state physical organic descriptors or structural information such as molecular graphs or fingerprints.\n\n* * *\n\n## Introduction\n\nAccurate prediction of chemical reactions is an important goal both in academic and industrial research. [1\u20133](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2021/sc/d0sc04896h#cit1) Recently, machine learning approaches have had tremendous success in quantitative prediction of reaction yields based on data from high-throughput experimentation [4,5](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2021/sc/d0sc04896h#cit4) and enantioselectivities based on carefully selected universal training sets. [6](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2021/sc/d0sc04896h#cit6) At the same time, traditional quantitative structure\u2013reactivity relationship (QSRR) methods based on linear regression have seen a renaissance with interpretable, holistic models that can generalize across reaction types. [7](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2021/sc/d0sc04896h#cit7) In parallel with these developments of quantitative prediction methods, deep learning models trained on reaction databases containing millions of patent and literature data have made quick qualitative yes/no feasibility prediction routine for almost any reaction type. [8](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2021/sc/d0sc04896h#cit8)\n\nIn the pharmaceutical industry, prediction tools have great potential to accelerate synthesis of prospective drugs ( [Fig. 1a](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2021/sc/d0sc04896h#imgfig1)). [9](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2021/sc/d0sc04896h#cit9) Quick prediction is essential in the discovery phase, especially within the context of automation and rapid synthesis of a multitude of candidates for initial activity screening. [3,10,11](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2021/sc/d0sc04896h#cit3) In these circumstances, a simple yes/no as provided by classification models is usually sufficient. More accurate prediction is necessary in the later drug development process, where the synthesis route and formulation of one or a few promising drug candidates is optimized. Here, regression models that give the reaction activation energy can be used to predict both absolute reactivity and selectivity ( [Fig. 1b](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2021/sc/d0sc04896h#imgfig1)). Prediction of absolute reactivity can be used to assess feasibility under process-relevant conditions, while prediction of selectivity is key to reducing purification steps. Predictive tools therefore hold great promise for accelerating route and process development, ultimately delivering medicines to patients both faster and at lower costs.\n\n|     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| [![image file: d0sc04896h-f1.tif](https://pubs.rsc.org/image/article/2021/SC/d0sc04896h/d0sc04896h-f1.gif)](https://pubs.rsc.org/image/article/2021/SC/d0sc04896h/d0sc04896h-f1_hi-res.gif) |\n|  | **Fig. 1**(a) Example of synthetic route to a drug compound.

Since rising to prominence in the early 90s, DFT has enjoyed extraordinary success in rationalizing reactivity and selectivity across the reaction spectrum by modelling the full reaction mechanism. [12](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2021/sc/d0sc04896h#cit12) The success of DFT can be traced in part due to a fortuitous cancellation of errors, which makes it particularly suited for properties such as enantioselectivity, which depends on the relative energies of two structurally very similar transition states (TSs). However, this cancellation of errors does not generally extend to the prediction of the absolute magnitude of reactions barriers (activation free energies, \u0394G\u2021). In particular, DFT struggles with one very important class of reactions: ionic reactions in solution. Plata and Singleton even sug...",

Multiple platforms, including tools for reaction prediction and synthesis planning based on machine learning, have successfully become part of the organic chemists\u2019 daily laboratory work, assisting in domain-specific synthetic problems. Unlike reaction prediction and retrosynthetic models, the prediction of reaction yields has received less attention in spite of the enormous potential of accurately predicting reaction conversion rates. Reaction yields models, describing the percentage of the reactants converted to the desired products, could help chemists navigate reaction space, optimize reactions, and accelerate the design of more effective routes. Here, we investigate high-throughput experimentation data sets and show how data augmentation on chemical reactions can improve yield predictions\u2019 accuracy, even when only small training sets are available. Previous work used molecular fingerprints, physics-based or categorical descriptors of the precursors. In our work, we fine-tune natural language processing-inspired reaction transformer models on different augmented data sets to predict yields solely using a text-based representation of chemical reactions. When the augmented training sets contain 2.5% or more of the data, our models outperform previous models, including those using physics-based descriptors as inputs. Moreover, we demonstrate the use of test-time augmentation to generate uncertainty estimates, which correlate with the prediction errors.\n## Related\nPaper\n### [Will OLED displays challenge liquid crystal displays in notebook computer applications?](https://research.ibm.com/publications/will-oled-displays-challenge-liquid-crystal-displays-in-notebook-computer-applications)\nRonald Troutman\nSynthetic Metals\nPaper\n### [Effect of oxygen on the electrical transport in RuO2](https://research.ibm.com/publications/effect-of-oxygen-on-the-electrical-transport-in-ruolessinfgreater2lessinfgreater)\nL.

Despite their significance, finding suitable reaction conditions\nleading to a high yield, for instance, remains a challenging and time-consuming\ntask which usually requires screening over many sets of conditions.\nTo help select promising reaction conditions in the vast space of\nreagent combinations, machine learning is an emerging technique with\na lot of promise. In this work, we assess whether the reaction yield\nof C\u2013N couplings can be predicted from databases of chemical\nreactions. We test the generalizability of models both on challenging\ndata splits and on a dedicated experimental test set. We find that,\nprovided the chemical space represented by the training set is not\nleft, the models perform well. However, the applicability domain is\nquickly left even for simple reactions of the same type, as, for instance,\npresent in our plate test set. The results show that yield prediction\nfor new reactions is possible from the algorithmic side but in practice\nis hindered by the available data. Most importantly, more data that\ncover the diversity in reagents are needed for a general-purpose prediction\nof reaction yields. Our findings also expose a challenge to this field\nin that it appears to be extremely deceiving to judge models based\non literature data with test sets which are split off the same literature\ndata, even when challenging splits are considered.\n\n## 1\\. Introduction\n\nChemistry is in the midst\nof a data-driven shift.[1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9878668/#ref1) \u2212 [3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9878668/#ref3) Many areas of the broader field experience a surge\nin development\naimed at utilizing data, from machine learning (ML) models replacing\naspects of computational chemistry and property calculations[4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9878668/#ref4) to retrosynthetic planning[5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9878668/#ref5), [6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9878668/#ref6) to\noptimizing reaction conditions.[7](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9878668/#ref7), [8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9878668/#ref8) The latter example is\na problem particularly suitable for these new approaches due to the\nquickly exploding space of possibilities. The optimization of reaction\nconditions is a frequently encountered problem in academia and industry,[9](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9878668/#ref9) often posing a bottleneck to efficient, fast,\nand productive retrosynthesis. Screening over many sets of reaction\nconditions is still required to find, for example, acceptable yields.\nWith all the knowledge stored in reaction databases populated over\nthe last decades, ML is a promising route to improve the state of\nthe art for reaction condition optimizations.\n\nSeveral concepts\ncan be designed to harness data-driven technology\nfor the purpose of optimizing reaction conditions.

      "text": "## Abstract\nArtificial intelligence is driving one of the most important revolutions in organic chemistry. Multiple platforms, including tools for reaction prediction and synthesis planning based on machine learning, have successfully become part of the organic chemists\u2019 daily laboratory, assisting in domain-specific synthetic problems. Unlike reaction prediction and retrosynthetic models, the prediction of reaction yields has received less attention in spite of the enormous potential of accurately predicting reaction conversion rates. Reaction yields models, describing the percentage of the reactants converted to the desired products, could guide chemists and help them select high-yielding reactions and score synthesis routes, reducing the number of attempts. So far, yield predictions have been predominantly performed for high-throughput experiments using a categorical (one-hot) encoding of reactants, concatenated molecular fingerprints, or computed chemical descriptors. Here, we extend the application of natural language processing architectures to predict reaction properties given a text-based representation of the reaction, using an encoder transformer model combined with a regression layer. We demonstrate outstanding prediction performance on two high-throughput experiment reactions sets. An analysis of the yields reported in the open-source USPTO data set shows that their distribution differs depending on the mass scale, limiting the data set applicability in reaction yields predictions.\n## Related\nPaper\n### [Transfer learning enables the molecular transformer to predict regio- and stereoselective reactions on carbohydrates](https://research.ibm.com/publications/transfer-learning-enables-the-molecular-transformer-to-predict-regio-and-stereoselective-reactions-on-carbohydrates)\nPaper\n### [Comparison of computational methods for the electrochemical stability window of solid-state electrolyte materials](https://research.ibm.com/publications/comparison-of-computational-methods-for-the-electrochemical-stability-window-of-solid-state-electrolyte-materials)\nPoster\n### [Molecular transformer-aided biocatalysed synthesis planning](https://research.ibm.com/publications/molecular-transformer-aided-biocatalysed-synthesis-planning)\nShort paper\n### [Simulating fluid flow at pore scale with carbon dioxide in digital rock](https://research.ibm.com/publications/simulating-fluid-flow-at-pore-scale-with-carbon-dioxide-in-digital-rock)\n[View all publications](https://research.ibm.com/publications)",
