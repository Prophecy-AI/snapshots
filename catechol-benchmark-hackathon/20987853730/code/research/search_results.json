Recent work shows that **active\u2011learning loops coupled with descriptor\u2011based selectors** can build compact yet chemically diverse training sets that span the relevant solvent\u2011reaction space, dramatically reducing the amount of data needed while still capturing the key solute\u2011solvent interactions that govern rates and selectivity\u3010nature.com\u3011.  In parallel, generating a large, systematic solvent database (e.g.,\u202f\u2248\u202f30\u202f000 reactions across\u202f\u2248\u202f300 solvents using COSMO\u2011RS calculations) and training models on **atom\u2011mapped reaction SMILES together with explicit solvent SMILES** yields low mean\u2011absolute errors on unseen reactions and reliable relative rate predictions, demonstrating that a simple string\u2011based encoding can be highly transferable when the underlying data are diverse\u3010pubs.rsc.org\u3011.\n\nTo bridge the gap when only a few examples of a new solvent are available, **few\u2011shot/transfer\u2011learning approaches** have proven effective.  Benchmarks on the \u201cCatechol\u201d dataset show that regression models, when fine\u2011tuned with a handful of solvent\u2011specific points, outperform models trained from scratch, especially when combined with **feature\u2011engineering of solvent fingerprints** (e.g., generalized chemical fingerprints) and **active\u2011learning\u2011driven selection of informative samples**\u3010arxiv.org\u3011.  Graph\u2011neural\u2011network (GNN) architectures that encode solvent conditions as separate node or edge attributes further improve OOD robustness, as they can learn hierarchical representations of both molecular structure and reaction environment and have been benchmarked across three OOD levels (structure, condition, mechanism)\u3010arxiv.org\u3011.\n\nIn practice, the most reliable pipeline therefore mixes:  \n\n1. **Diverse, high\u2011quality solvent\u2013reaction data** (e.g., COSMO\u2011RS\u2011derived energetics or experimental kinetic datasets).  \n2. **Rich solvent descriptors** (SMILES, fingerprint vectors, or learned embeddings) incorporated directly into the model input.  \n3. **Active learning or uncertainty\u2011driven sampling** to target the most informative solvent\u2011reaction pairs.  \n4. **Transfer/few\u2011shot fine\u2011tuning** of a pretrained GNN or transformer model when a new solvent is introduced.  \n\nTogether, these techniques give the best chance of achieving accurate, out\u2011of\u2011distribution predictions for unseen chemical solvents in reaction\u2011prediction tasks.",

      "text": "### Subjects\n\n## Abstract\n\nSolvent effects influence all stages of the chemical processes, modulating the stability of intermediates and transition states, as well as altering reaction rates and product ratios. However, accurately modelling these effects remains challenging. Here, we present a general strategy for generating reactive machine learning potentials to model chemical processes in solution. Our approach combines active learning with descriptor-based selectors and automation, enabling the construction of data-efficient training sets that span the relevant chemical and conformational space. We apply this strategy to investigate a Diels-Alder reaction in water and methanol. The generated machine learning potentials enable us to obtain reaction rates that are in agreement with experimental data and analyse the influence of these solvents on the reaction mechanism. Our strategy offers an efficient approach to the routine modelling of chemical reactions in solution, opening up avenues for studying complex chemical processes in an efficient manner.\n\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n\n## Introduction\n\n(Bio)chemical and industrially relevant reactions occur predominantly in the liquid phase[1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR1), [2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR2). The influence of solvent on reaction rates was first documented by Berthelot and Pean de Saint-Gilles in 1862[3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR3) and later formalised by Menschutkin in 1890[4](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR4). Since then, experimental and computational techniques have been developed to elucidate and quantify the origin of solvent effects on reactivity and selectivity[5](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR5). From an atomistic point of view, solvent effects arise from the interactions between solute and solvent molecules, which, although generally weak, have a significant impact on the overall reaction dynamics.\n\nIn computational chemistry, solvent effects are modelled using implicit or explicit solvent models. The former represents solvents as a polarisable continuum, offering computational simplicity and efficiency. However, it fails to capture the contributions arising from solute-solvent interactions, including entropy and pre-organisation effects[6](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR6). On the other hand, explicit solvent models provide an atomistic representation of the solvent but at a much higher computational cost since they require the use of ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD). This cost becomes significant when attempting to compute free energies, where extensive sampling is required to obtain statistically meaningful ensembles. Hybrid approaches, such as quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM), can alleviate this computational cost by describing only the reactive part at a QM level while the environment is described classically. However, the inclusion of mobile solvent molecules into the QM part creates additional technical difficulties, such as discontinuities at the boundary between the QM and MM regions[7](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR7), [8](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR8).\n\nIn recent years, machine learning-based potentials (MLPs) have emerged as powerful surrogates for existing modelling techniques, representing complex potential energy surfaces (PES) with an accuracy comparable to QM methods but at a significantly lower computational cost[9](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR9), [10](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR10). Since the pioneering work of Behler and Parinello (BP) on neural network-based potentials (NNP)[9](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR9), several MLP approaches have been developed, including models directly derived from BP, such as DeepMD[11](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR11) and ANI[12](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR12), message-passing NN models[13](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR13), such as PhysNet[14](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR14), SchNet[15](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR15), and MACE[16](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR16), kernel-based approaches, such as Gaussian Approximation Potential (GAP) and gradient-domain ML (GDML)[17](http://www.nature.com/www.nature.com#ref-CR17), [18](http://www.nature.com/www.nature.com#ref-CR18), [19](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR19), and linear regression-based models, such as linear Atomic Cluster Expansion (ACE)[20](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR20), [21](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR21). These MLPs have been successfully applied to study organic molecules[12](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR12), [22](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR22), material properties[23](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR23), [24](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR24) and simple chemical reactions in the gas phase and interfaces[25](http://www.nature.com/www.nature.com#ref-CR25), [26](http://www.nature.com/www.nature.com#ref-CR26), [27](http://www.nature.com/www.nature.com#ref-CR27), [28](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR28). While there are prominent examples of using MLPs to correct QM/MM computed free energies[29](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR29), modelling solvent implicitly[30](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR30), [31](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR31), or replacing the QM part to have a more efficient approach, ML/MM[32](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR32), only a handful of examples exist where chemical processes have been modelled in explicit solvent fully using MLPs. Such examples include urea decomposition in water[33](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR33), 1,3-dipolar cycloadditions in water[34](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR34), Strecker-cyanohydrin synthesis of glycine in water[35](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR35), and reactions in alkali carbonate-hydroxide electrolytes[36](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR36). In all these cases, NNPs are used, requiring thousands of AIMD configurations. For a comprehensive overview of relevant works, we refer the reader to a recent review by Isayev and Roitberg, ref. [37](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR37), and SI \u00a7 [S1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#MOESM1).\n\nOne of the main challenges limiting the application of MLPs to study chemical reactions in solution is the quality and size of the training data set, which needs to incorporate diverse configurations to effectively capture solute-solvent interaction at the minima and TS regions. Unlike solid-state systems, where particles are packed in highly ordered arrangements, molecules in solution are often flexible, resulting in a larger conformational space that needs to be sampled to accurately describe their PES. Moreover, the reliable description of reaction barriers and non-covalent interactions requires accurate reference electronic structure methods, further increasing the computational cost[38](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR38). The complexity of the training data can be reduced in \u0394-ML models[39](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR39), which predict the differences between semi-empirical baseline and QM PES rather than the absolute energies. However, even in these approache...",

It encompasses the long-standing task of computer-aided retrosynthesis, but is far more reaching and ambitious in its goals. In this review, we summarize several areas where predictive chemistry models hold the potential to accelerate the deployment, development, and discovery of organic reactions and advance synthetic chemistry.\n\n* * *\n\nThis review outlines several organic chemistry tasks for which predictive machine learning models have been and can be applied.

Overview of the three main categories of predictive chemistry tasks discussed throughout this review: reaction deployment, development, and discovery.

As new algorithmic methods are developed, intended either for chemical problems or for the more widespread applications of image and language processing, the scope of synthetic problems able to be addressed by computational assistance expands. We encourage all synthetic and computational chemists to familiarize themselves with these applications and methods to identify (a) tools that can be directly incorporated into their R&D workflows, (b) additional applications where similar tools may be impactful, and (c) opportunities for developing novel algorithms.\n\nThis review will highlight progress towards building machine learning models that support synthetic chemistry in each of the areas of reaction deployment, development, and discovery. The progression through these three topics is meant to reflect an increasing degree of extrapolation from known reactivity to new reactivity. Throughout, we emphasize the major questions that models have been built to address, the myriad of approaches that have been developed to help address them, and some goals where further development is still needed. At times, we will go into some technical depth to describe and distinguish different models built for the same task, but these details may not be relevant for every reader.\n\n## Preliminaries on machine learning and molecular representation\n\nThere are numerous reviews for machine learning in chemistry that provide an introduction to the field.

Several ML models<a href=\"#cit15\"><sup><span>15\u201317</span></sup></a> have successfully predicted barrier heights and rate constants of diverse gas phase reactions only based on readily available 2D information (<span>e.g.</span> SMILES strings) of reactants and products. However, such data-driven models for liquid/solution phase reactions have been lightly investigated with limited applicability,<a href=\"#cit20\"><sup><span>20</span></sup></a> and most approaches rely on the <span>ab initio</span> methods with either implicit or explicit solvation models.<a href=\"#cit21\"><sup><span>21,22</span></sup></a></span></p><p>Solvents can have significant impacts on reaction rates and outcomes, and it is crucial to accurately predict these kinetic solvent effects. Recent research efforts have been devoted to employing ML (<span>e.g.</span> deep neural network) for free energy predictions of condensed phase reactions.<a href=\"#cit15\"><sup><span>15,18,19,23\u201328</span></sup></a> Many of these studies<a href=\"#cit18\"><sup><span>18,19,23\u201325,28</span></sup></a> combine the ML models with semi-empirical or lower-level QM/MM methods to obtain the energy predictions that match the accuracy of higher-level QM/MM methods. For example, G\u00f3mez-Flores <span>et al.</span><a href=\"#cit19\"><sup><span>19</span></sup></a> used a ML approach to predict the energy difference between the density functional tight-binding model and other higher level QM methods for a thiol-disulfide exchange reaction in water.

Farrar and Grayson<a href=\"#cit28\"><sup><span>28</span></sup></a> employed ML models to predict DFT-quality activation barriers for various nitro-Michael addition reactions in toluene based on the features generated from semi-empirical methods. These approaches, however, require semi-empirical QM/MM steps that are less suitable for instantaneous, automatic rate predictions. Furthermore, their models are limited to a single solvent and need the 3D coordinates or QM features of reactants and transition states as inputs, which are not readily available.</p>\n <p>The ML models by Jorner <span>et al.</span><a href=\"#cit26\"><sup><span>26</span></sup></a> and by Heid and Green<a href=\"#cit15\"><sup><span>15</span></sup></a> are the few cases that can predict reaction properties in multiple solvents only based on the 2D structural information of molecules. Jorner <span>et al.</span><a href=\"#cit26\"><sup><span>26</span></sup></a> employed a Gaussian process regression model and compared several 2D structural features to predict the barrier height of 443 S<small><sub>N</sub></small>Ar reactions in different solvents. In their work, the best accuracy was reached by adopting the BERT<a href=\"#cit29\"><sup><span>29</span></sup></a> reaction fingerprint. Heid and Green,<a href=\"#cit15\"><sup><span>15</span></sup></a> on the other hand, used the condensed graph of reaction (CGR) as an input reaction representation for a graph convolutional neural network (GCNN). They applied the CGR GCNN model to the same S<small><sub>N</sub></small>Ar data set and were able to achieve better barrier height predictions compared to the other models that used the BERT fingerprint or different reaction representations.

      "text": "A Machine Learning Approach to Predict Chemical\nReactions\nMatthew A. Kayala Pierre Baldi\u2217\nInstitute of Genomics and Bioinformatics\nSchool of Information and Computer Sciences\nUniversity of California, Irvine\nIrvine, CA 92697\n{mkayala,pfbaldi}@ics.uci.edu\nAbstract\nBeing able to predict the course of arbitrary chemical reactions is essential to the\ntheory and applications of organic chemistry. Previous approaches are not high\u0002throughput, are not generalizable or scalable, or lack sufficient data to be effective.\nWe describe single mechanistic reactions as concerted electron movements from\nan electron orbital source to an electron orbital sink. We use an existing rule-based\nexpert system to derive a dataset consisting of 2,989 productive mechanistic steps\nand 6.14 million non-productive mechanistic steps. We then pose identifying pro\u0002ductive mechanistic steps as a ranking problem: rank potential orbital interactions\nsuch that the top ranked interactions yield the major products. The machine learn\u0002ing implementation follows a two-stage approach, in which we first train atom\nlevel reactivity filters to prune 94.0% of non-productive reactions with less than a\n0.1% false negative rate. Then, we train an ensemble of ranking models on pairs of\ninteracting orbitals to learn a relative productivity function over single mechanis\u0002tic reactions in a given system. Without the use of explicit transformation patterns,\nthe ensemble perfectly ranks the productive mechanisms at the top 89.1% of the\ntime, rising to 99.9% of the time when top ranked lists with at most four non\u0002productive reactions are considered. The final system allows multi-step reaction\nprediction. Furthermore, it is generalizable, making reasonable predictions over\nreactants and conditions which the rule-based expert system does not handle.\n1 Introduction\nDetermining the major products of chemical reactions given the input reactants and conditions is\na fundamental problem in organic chemistry. Reaction prediction is a necessary component of\nretro-synthetic analysis or virtual library generation for drug design[1, 2] and has the potential to\nincrease our understanding of biochemical catalysis and metabolism[3]. There are a broad range\nof approaches to reaction prediction falling around at least three main poles: physical simulations\nof transition states using various quantum mechanical and other approximations[4, 5, 6], rule-based\nexpert systems[2, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11], and inductive machine learning methods[12]. However, none of\nthese approaches can successfully emulate the remarkable abilities of a human chemist.\n1.1 Previous approaches and representations\nThe very concept of a \u201creaction\u201d can be ambiguous, as it corresponds to a macroscopic abstraction,\nhence simplification, of a very complex underlying microscopic reality, ultimately driven by the\n\u2217To whom correspondence should be addressed\n1\nlaws of quantum and statistical mechanics. However, even for relatively small systems, it is impos\u0002sible to find exact solutions to the Schr\u00a8odinger equation. Thus in practice, energies are calculated\nwith varyingly accurate approximations, ranging from ab-initio Hartree-Fock approaches or density\nfunctional theory to semi-empirical methods or mechanical force fields[6]. This leads to modeling\nreactions as minimum energy paths between stable atom configurations on a high-dimensional po\u0002tential energy surface, where the path through the lowest energy transition state, i.e., saddle point, is\nthe most favorable[4, 5]. By explicitly modeling energies, these approaches can be highly accurate\nand generalize to a diverse range of chemistries but require careful initialization and are computa\u0002tionally expensive (see [13] for a representative example). This branch of computational chemistry\nprovides invaluable tools for in-depth analysis but is currently not suitable for high-throughput re\u0002activity tasks and is far from being able to recapitulate the knowledge and ability of human experts.\nIn contrast, most rule-based expert systems for high-throughput reactivity tasks use a much more\nabstract representation, in the form of general transformations over molecular graphs[2, 7, 8, 9, 10].\nReactions are predicted when a match is found in a library of allowable graph transformations. These\ngeneral transformations model only net molecular changes for processes that in reality involve a\nsequence of transition states, as shown in Figure 1. These rule-based approaches suffer from at least\nfour drawbacks: (1) they use a representation that is too high-level, in that an overall transformation\nobfuscates the underlying physical reality; (2) they require the manual curation of large amounts of\nexpert knowledge; (3) they become unmanageable at larger scales, in that adding a new graph pattern\noften involves having to update a large proportion of existing transformations with exceptions; and\n(4) they lack generality, in that particular chemistries must explicitly be encoded to be predicted.\n[C;X3H0:1]=[C;X3:2].[H:3][Br:4]>>[Br:4][C:1][C:2][H:3]\nFigure 1: Overall transformation of an alkene (hydrocarbon with double bond) with hydro\u0002bromic acid (HBr) and corresponding mechanistic reactions. (a) shows the overall transform as\na SMIRKS[14] string pattern and as a graph representation. In a molecular graph, vertices represent\natoms, with carbons at unlabeled vertices. The number of edges between two vertices represents\nbond order. +/\u2212 symbols represent formal charge. Standard valences are filled using implicit\nhydrogens. (b) shows the two mechanistic reactions composing the overall transformation as arrow\u0002pushing diagrams[15, 16]. Dots represent non-bonded (lone pair) electrons, while arrows represent\nconcerted electron movement. In the first step, electrons in the electron-rich carbon-carbon double\nbond attack the hydrogen and break the electron-poor hydrogen-bromine single bond, producing an\nanionic bromide (Br\u2212) and a carbocation (C+). In the second step, electrons from the charged,\nelectron-rich bromide attack the electron-poor carbocation, yielding the final alkyl halide.\nSomewhere between low-level QM treatment and abstract graph-based overall transformations, one\ncan consider reactions at the mechanistic level. A mechanistic, or elementary, reaction is a con\u0002certed electron movement through a single transition state[15, 16]. These mechanistic reactions can\nbe composed to yield overall transformations. For example, Figure 1 shows the overall transfor\u0002mation of an alkene interacting with hydrobromic acid to yield an alkyl halide, along with the two\nelementary reactions which compose the transformation. A mechanistic reaction is described as an\nidealized molecular orbital (MO) interaction between an electron source (donor) MO and an electron\nsink (acceptor) MO. MOs represent regions of the molecule with high (source) or low (sink) electron\n2\ndensity. In general, potential electron sources are composed of lone pairs of electrons and bonds, and\npotential electron sinks are composed of empty atomic orbitals and bonds. Bonds can act as either\na source or a sink depending on the context. Because of space constraints, we cannot fully describe\nsubtle chemical details that must be handled, such as chaining for resonance rearrangement. For\ndetails, see texts[15, 16] on mechanisms. Note that by considering all possible pairings of source\nand sink MOs, this representation allows the exhaustive enumeration of all potential mechanistic\nreactions over an arbitrary set of molecules.\nRecent work by Chen and Baldi[11] introduces a rule-based expert system (Reaction Explorer) in\nwhich each rearrangement pattern encompasses an elementary reaction. Here, the elementary reac\u0002tions represent \u201cproductive\u201d mechanistic steps, i.e. those reactions which lead to the overall major\nproducts. Thus, elementary reactions which are not the most kinetically favorable, but which even\u0002tually lead to the overall thermodynamic transformation product may be considered \u201cproduc...",

In recent years, with the development of artificial intelligence (AI), especially ML, researchers\u2019 interest in ML-assisted retrosynthesis planning has rapidly increased, bringing development and opportunities to the field. In this review, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of ML-assisted retrosynthesis planning. We first discuss the formal definition and the objective of retrosynthesis planning, and organize a modular framework which includes four modules: data preparation, data preprocessing, pathway generation and evaluation, and pathway verification. Then, we sequentially review the current status of the first three modules (except pathway verification) in the ML-assisted retrosynthesis planning framework, including ideas, methods, and latest progress. Following that, we specifically discuss large language models in retrosynthesis planning. Finally, we summarize the extant challenges that are faced by current ML-assisted retrosynthesis planning research and offer a perspective on future research directions and development.\n* Previousarticlein issue\n* Nextarticlein issue\n## Keywords\nRetrosynthesis planning\nMachine learning\nArtificial intelligence\nSynthetic pathway\nChemoinformatics\nRecommended articles\n## Cited by (0)\n\u00a92024 The Authors.\n## Recommended articles\nNo articles found.",

With the accumulated drug molecules identified through \u201cAI4drug discovery\u201d, the next imperative lies in AI-driven design for high-throughput chemical synthesis processes, with the estimation of properties of unseen reactions with unexplored molecules. To this end, the existing ML approaches for kinetics property prediction are required to be Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) generalizable. In this paper, we categorize the OOD kinetic property prediction into three levels (structure, condition, and mechanism), revealing unique aspects of such problems. Under this framework, we create comprehensive datasets to benchmark (1) the state-of-the-art ML approaches for reaction prediction in the OOD setting and (2) the state-of-the-art graph OOD methods in kinetics property prediction problems. Our results demonstrated the challenges and opportunities in OOD kinetics property prediction. Our datasets and benchmarks can further support research in this direction. The github repository for code and data can be found in[https://github.com/zihao-wang/ReactionOOD](https://github.com/zihao-wang/ReactionOOD).\n## 1Introduction\nIn recent years, graph machine learning has been widely used in scientific discovery> (Wang et\u00a0al., [> 2023\n](#bib.bib40)> ; Zhang et\u00a0al., [> 2023\n](#bib.bib45)> )\nand gained particular success in chemistry> (Gilmer et\u00a0al., [> 2017\n](#bib.bib10)> ; Jumper et\u00a0al., [> 2021\n](#bib.bib19)> ; Mullowney et\u00a0al., [> 2023\n](#bib.bib26)> )\n.\nThe underlying rationale is the long-standing structure-property relationship> (Mihali\u0107 and Trinajsti\u0107, [> 1992\n](#bib.bib25)> )\nin chemistry.\nFor example, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) can efficiently encode information at both the molecular structure level and the atom level within a molecule, which reveal compelling properties of the molecule> (Gilmer et\u00a0al., [> 2017\n](#bib.bib10)> )\n.\nSuch methods yield efficient, cheap, but still effective predictions of the properties ofunseen moleculesbefore expensive experiments or computations, which can serve as valuable reference information for drug discovery> (Mullowney et\u00a0al., [> 2023\n](#bib.bib26)> )\n.\nOne of thenextquestions to be answered after the discovery of a proper but unseen molecule isHow to efficiently obtain unseen molecules through chemical synthesis.In contrast to the molecule property estimation problem that concerns asinglemolecule, chemical synthesis processes involve the proper arrangement of various reactions that encompassmultiplemolecules under optimal conditions. Therefore, the very first step of achieving a high-throughput synthesis of unseen molecules is to estimate the properties of chemical reactions> (Warr, [> 2014\n](#bib.bib41)> )\n, especially kinetics properties that describe the \u201crate\u201d of reactions.\nThis prediction task is expected to be Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) generalizable so that the kinetic properties of OOD reactions with unseen molecules can be well predicted.\nRecently, machine learning methods have been applied to predict the kinetic properties of reactions> (Heid and Green, [> 2021\n](#bib.bib14)> )\n. In existing studies, chemical reactions are assumed to be Independently and Identically Distributed (IID), and models are trained and tested within random splits> (Heid and Green, [> 2021\n](#bib.bib14)> ; Stuyver and Coley, [> 2022\n](#bib.bib35)> ; Heid et\u00a0al., [> 2023\n](#bib.bib15)> )\n. However, results from such IID assumptions provide little credible insight into the performances of existing ML methods in OOD reaction property prediction.\nMeanwhile, existing theoretical and empirical studies for OOD generalization on graphs> (Ji et\u00a0al., [> 2022\n](#bib.bib17)> ; Gui et\u00a0al., [> 2022\n](#bib.bib11)> )\n, are restricted to problems with a single graph. How OOD methods perform reaction properties prediction with multiple molecules is still unknown.\nTo fill this gap, this paper discusses the out-of-distribution generalization issue when applying machine learning methods to the prediction of chemical reaction properties. We propose three levels of OOD shifts for ML-based reaction prediction: Structure OOD, Mechanism OOD, and Conditional OOD. Then, we reorganize recent reaction kinetic databases> (Johnson et\u00a0al., [> 2022\n](#bib.bib18)> )\nand create a comprehensive dataset in three levels of OOD. Furthermore, we empirically justify the performance of state-of-the-art kinetic property prediction produced by state-of-the-art OOD methods for general and graph inputs. Our results demonstrated that there remain huge ID-OOD performance gaps under different distribution shifts in chemical reactions for existing OOD methods.\n## 2Related works\nIncreasing efforts have been made to devise machine learning approaches for various aspects of chemical reaction systems> (Davies, [> 2019\n](#bib.bib6)> ; Stocker et\u00a0al., [> 2020\n](#bib.bib33)> ; Meuwly, [> 2021\n](#bib.bib23)> ; Strieth-Kalthoff et\u00a0al., [> 2022\n](#bib.bib34)> )\n, such as reaction classification> (Schwaller et\u00a0al., [> 2021b\n](#bib.bib30)> ; Bur\u00e9s and Larrosa, [> 2023\n](#bib.bib3)> )\n, reaction optimization> (Felton et\u00a0al., [> 2021\n](#bib.bib8)> )\n, atom mapping> (Schwaller et\u00a0al., [> 2021a\n](#bib.bib29)> )\n, and the most fundamentally, reaction property prediction> (Heid and Green, [> 2021\n](#bib.bib14)> )\n. With the burst of chemical reaction data> (von Rudorff et\u00a0al., [> 2020\n](#bib.bib39)> ; Spiekermann et\u00a0al., [> 2022\n](#bib.bib32)> ; Johnson et\u00a0al., [> 2022\n](#bib.bib18)> ; Choi, [> 2023\n](#bib.bib5)> ; Stuyver et\u00a0al., [> 2023\n](#bib.bib36)> ; Zhao et\u00a0al., [> 2023\n](#bib.bib46)> )\n, the Graph Neural Network (GNN) based methods> (Heid and Green, [> 2021\n](#bib.bib14)> ; Stuyver and Coley, [> 2022\n](#bib.bib35)> ; Heid et\u00a0al., [> 2023\n](#bib.bib15)> )\nare demonstrated its clear advantage over traditional methods by leveraging the structure of reactants and products.\nOut-of-distribution shift is one of the long-standing problems in machine learning> (Vapnik, [> 1991\n](#bib.bib38)> ; Quinonero-Candela et\u00a0al., [> 2008\n](#bib.bib27)> ; Shen et\u00a0al., [> 2021\n](#bib.bib31)> )\n. Recently, OOD generalizable graph neural networks have been discussed extensively> (Bevilacqua et\u00a0al., [> 2021\n](#bib.bib2)> ; Zhu et\u00a0al., [> 2021\n](#bib.bib47)> ; Wu et\u00a0al., [> 2022b\n](#bib.bib43)> , [> a\n](#bib.bib42)> ; Chen et\u00a0al., [> 2022\n](#bib.bib4)> )\n. When it comes to scientific discovery, out-of-distribution generalization capabilities enable machine learning methods to find more reliable discoveries from existing observations. A thorough investigation of the intersection of OOD and drug discovery can be found at> Ji et\u00a0al. (\n[> 2022\n](#bib.bib17)> )\nand> Gui et\u00a0al. (\n[> 2022\n](#bib.bib11)> )\n. However, as we will identify in the incoming parts, the out-of-distribution shifts for chemical reactions are radically different from those with existing graph OOD settings> (Gui et\u00a0al., [> 2022\n](#bib.bib11)> )\n, and existing OOD methods do not perform well.\n## 3Preliminary\n### 3.1Chemical reactions and kinetic property prediction\nA chemical reaction\u211c\u211c\\\\mathfrak{R}fraktur\\_Ris described by the reactantsr1,\u2026,rmsubscript\ud835\udc5f1\u2026subscript\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5ar\\_{1},\\\\dots,r\\_{m}italic\\_r start\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT , \u2026, italic\\_r start\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic\\_m end\\_POSTSUBSCRIPT, productsp1,\u2026,pnsubscript\ud835\udc5d1\u2026sub...",
