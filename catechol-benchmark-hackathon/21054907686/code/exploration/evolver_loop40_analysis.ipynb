    "The CV-LB relationship has intercept (0.0525) > target (0.0347).\n",
    "This means even CV=0 would give LB=0.0525, which is WORSE than target.\n",

    "1. Why is the intercept so high?\n",
    "2. What fundamentally different approach could change the CV-LB relationship?\n",
    "3. What have we NOT tried that could work?"
