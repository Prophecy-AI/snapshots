This public notebook (https://www.kaggle.com/code/josepablofolch/catechol-benchmark-hackathon-template) shows the structure any submitted notebook must follow. In order to ensure fair participation among all competitors, the submission must have the same last three cells as in the notebook template, with the only allowed change being the line where the model is defined. For the avoidance of doubt, the line model = MLPModel() can be replaced with a new model definition in the third to last and second to last cells, but everything else must remain the same.\n\nAs a clarification, pre-training on any of the solvent mixture data to predict the full solvent data does count as data contamination.\n\nHyper-parameter optimisation of the models across the whole task is allowed, however the same hyper-parameters must be used across every fold, unless there is a clear explainable rationale behind changing them. For example, using a different model for alcohols vs esters is allowed, but arbitrarily changing the hyper-parameters based on the best fit per fold counts as data contamination. If you are wondering if your method is allowed, ask yourself the question: if I had to select the model hyper-parameters for a new solvent, would the method I used be able to without knowing the experiment results?\n\nThe use of different hyper-parameters for different tasks (e.g. for the full solvent predictions vs mixed solvent prediction) and for different objectives (e.g. for SM vs Product 1) is allowed, since they still count as hyper-parameters for the whole dataset and they could be used to predict a new unseen solvent.",
