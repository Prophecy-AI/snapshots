## Current Status
- Best CV score: 0.008785 from exp_011 (2-model ensemble: MLP[32,16] + LightGBM)
- Best LB score: 0.0932 from exp_007 ([32,16] MLP alone)
- CV-LB gap: ~10x ratio (increasing from 8.86x to 10.19x as models improve)
- Target: 0.0333 (2.8x better than best LB - UNREACHABLE with current approach)
- Submissions: 0 remaining today (reset at 00:00 UTC)

## Response to Evaluator

**Technical verdict was TRUSTWORTHY.** Agree - the CV methodology is sound and results are valid.

**Evaluator's top priority: Ensure notebook compliance before next submission.** 
STRONGLY AGREE. This is critical. The competition template requires the last 3 cells to be EXACTLY as specified, with only the model definition line changeable. Current notebooks do NOT follow this structure and may be disqualified.

**Key concerns raised:**
1. **Notebook compliance** - CRITICAL. Must fix before any submission.
2. **CV-LB decorrelation** - Valid. exp_009 had better CV (0.009192) but worse LB (0.0936) than exp_007 (CV 0.009262, LB 0.0932). The CV-LB ratio is increasing (8.86x → 10.19x), meaning CV improvements translate less to LB improvements.
3. **Target unreachable** - Agree. The target of 0.0333 requires GNN-level performance (benchmark achieved 0.0039). Our tabular MLP/LightGBM approach has a ceiling around 0.09 LB.

## Data Understanding

Reference notebooks:
- `exploration/eda.ipynb` - Initial data exploration
- `exploration/evolver_loop8_lb_feedback.ipynb` - CV-LB correlation analysis (0.97 correlation)
- `exploration/evolver_loop10_lb_feedback.ipynb` - CV-LB breakdown analysis
- `exploration/evolver_loop12_analysis.ipynb` - Latest strategic assessment

Key patterns:
1. **Simplification trend**: Simpler models generalize better ([256,128,64] → [64,32] → [32,16])
2. **Optimal architecture**: [32,16] MLP is the sweet spot for LB performance
3. **Ensemble benefit**: Ensembles improve CV but may not improve LB due to decorrelation
4. **Feature combination**: Spange + DRFP (high-variance) + Arrhenius kinetics features work well
5. **TTA for mixtures**: Averaging predictions from both orderings helps

## Recommended Approaches

**PRIORITY 1: Notebook Compliance (CRITICAL)**
- Create a compliant notebook that follows the EXACT template structure
- Last 3 cells must be identical to template, only model definition line changes
- Model class must have `train_model(X_train, y_train)` and `predict(X)` methods
- Test with the SimpleEnsemble class from exp_011

**PRIORITY 2: Prepare Multiple Submission Candidates**
Since we have 0 submissions today, prepare compliant notebooks for:
1. exp_011 (2-model ensemble): CV 0.008785 - best CV, simpler ensemble
2. exp_007 ([32,16] alone): CV 0.009262, LB 0.0932 - proven best LB
3. Ensemble with different weights (0.5/0.5, 0.7/0.3) - test variations

**PRIORITY 3: Explore Ensemble Weight Optimization**
- Current weights: MLP 0.6, LightGBM 0.4
- Try: MLP 0.5, LightGBM 0.5 (equal weighting)
- Try: MLP 0.7, LightGBM 0.3 (more MLP emphasis)
- Try: MLP 0.55, LightGBM 0.45 (slight adjustment)

**PRIORITY 4: Consider Alternative Ensemble Compositions**
- Try: [32,16] MLP + [64,32] MLP (no LightGBM) - pure MLP ensemble
- Try: [32,16] MLP + Ridge Regression - simpler ensemble
- Try: [32,16] MLP + XGBoost - different tree model

## What NOT to Try

1. **Deeper/more complex architectures** - Already proven to hurt LB (exp_004 failed badly)
2. **Larger ensembles (>3 models)** - exp_010 (3-model) was worse than exp_011 (2-model) on CV
3. **DRFP with PCA** - exp_002 showed this hurts performance significantly
4. **Chasing the target (0.0333)** - Unreachable with tabular approaches; requires GNNs
5. **Further simplification beyond [32,16]** - exp_009 ([16]) had worse LB despite better CV

## Validation Notes

**CV Scheme:**
- Single solvent: Leave-one-solvent-out (24 folds, 656 samples)
- Full data: Leave-one-ramp-out (13 folds, 1227 samples)
- Overall MSE: Weighted average by sample count

**CV-LB Calibration:**
- CV-LB correlation: 0.97 (strong but breaking down at low CV)
- Linear fit: LB = 3.99 * CV + 0.056
- Average ratio: 9.43x (but increasing to 10.19x for best models)
- For exp_011 (CV 0.008785): Predicted LB = 0.083-0.091

**Decision Framework for Tomorrow:**
1. When submissions reset, submit exp_011 (2-model ensemble) first
2. If LB < 0.0932: Continue with ensemble approach
3. If LB >= 0.0932: Fall back to exp_007 ([32,16] alone)
4. Use remaining submissions to test weight variations

## Key Insight

The CV-LB decorrelation means we're at the optimization ceiling for tabular approaches. The [32,16] MLP (LB 0.0932) may already be the best achievable. Ensembles improve CV but the LB improvement is uncertain. Focus on:
1. **Reliability** - Ensure notebook compliance
2. **Stability** - Use proven models
3. **Diversity** - Prepare multiple candidates

The target of 0.0333 is NOT achievable with our current approach. The GNN benchmark achieved 0.0039 MSE using graph neural networks with attention mechanisms. To beat the target, we would need to implement GNNs, which is outside the scope of the current tabular approach.

## Experiments to Run Now (No Submissions Needed)

1. **Create compliant notebook** for SimpleEnsemble (exp_011)
2. **Test different ensemble weights** (0.5/0.5, 0.7/0.3, 0.55/0.45)
3. **Try pure MLP ensemble** ([32,16] + [64,32] without LightGBM)
4. **Prepare fallback** - compliant notebook for [32,16] alone

When submissions reset at 00:00 UTC, submit the best candidate and iterate based on LB feedback.
