## Current Status
- Best CV score: 0.009004 from exp_012 (Compliant Ensemble MLP+LGBM)
- Best LB score: **0.0913** from exp_012 (NEW BEST!)
- CV-LB gap: ~10.14x ratio (consistent with previous experiments)
- Target: 0.0333 (2.74x better than best LB - NOT achievable with tabular approaches)
- Submissions remaining: 4

## Response to Evaluator

**Technical verdict**: TRUSTWORTHY. The evaluator confirmed exp_014 results are valid.

**Evaluator's top priority**: Submit exp_013 (compliant ensemble) to LB to validate if ensemble beats [32,16] alone.

**RESULT**: We submitted exp_012 (compliant ensemble) and it achieved **LB 0.0913**, beating exp_007 ([32,16] MLP alone, LB 0.0932) by **2.04%**!

**Key validation**: The ensemble approach WORKS for LB improvement, not just CV. This is a critical finding:
- LightGBM alone had LB 0.1065 (much worse than MLP)
- But adding LightGBM to MLP ensemble IMPROVES LB by 2%
- Model diversity helps generalization to unseen solvents

**Evaluator concerns addressed**:
1. "No LB validation of ensemble" - ✅ VALIDATED. Ensemble is now BEST LB.
2. "Diminishing returns on micro-optimization" - AGREED. Weight tuning showed only 0.09% difference.
3. "Target is unreachable" - ACKNOWLEDGED. Focus on maximizing LB within tabular constraints.

## Data Understanding
Reference notebooks:
- `exploration/eda.ipynb` - Full EDA with data shapes, target distributions
- `exploration/evolver_loop14_lb_feedback.ipynb` - Latest LB analysis showing ensemble success
- `exploration/evolver_loop10_lb_feedback.ipynb` - Critical finding: [16] overfits to CV

Key patterns:
- Single solvent: 656 samples, 24 solvents (leave-one-out CV)
- Full/mixture: 1227 samples, 13 ramps (leave-one-ramp-out CV)
- CV-LB ratio: ~10x (consistent across experiments)
- Ensemble (MLP+LGBM) is now BEST for both CV and LB

## Recommended Approaches

### Priority 1: Try 3-Model Ensemble for More Diversity (RECOMMENDED)
**Rationale**: Since 2-model ensemble improved LB by 2%, adding a third diverse model might help further.
- MLP[32,16] + LightGBM + MLP[64,32] (different architecture)
- Weights: 0.5 MLP[32,16] + 0.3 LightGBM + 0.2 MLP[64,32]

**Why this might work**:
- Research shows ensemble diversity is key to improvement
- MLP[64,32] had CV 0.009749, LB 0.09457 - different error patterns
- Combining models with different biases can reduce overall error

**Implementation**:
1. Create compliant 3-model ensemble notebook
2. Use same features (Spange + DRFP + Arrhenius)
3. Train MLP[32,16] (5 models), LightGBM, MLP[64,32] (5 models)
4. Weighted average: 0.5 * MLP[32,16] + 0.3 * LGBM + 0.2 * MLP[64,32]
5. If CV improves over 0.009004, submit for LB validation

### Priority 2: Feature Subset Ensembles (BACKUP)
If 3-model ensemble doesn't improve:
- Model 1: Spange + DRFP + Arrhenius (current)
- Model 2: Spange + Arrhenius only (simpler)
- Average predictions for diversity

## What NOT to Try
- **Weight tuning**: Already optimized (0.6/0.4 is near-optimal)
- **Simpler architectures**: [16] has worse LB despite better CV
- **Larger architectures**: [256,128,64] has worse LB than [32,16]
- **GNN approaches**: Would require significant code changes
- **More bagging**: 15 models vs 5 showed marginal improvement

## Template Compliance (MANDATORY)
The submission MUST follow the exact template structure:
- Last 3 cells are IDENTICAL to the template
- Only the model definition line can be changed
- Model class must implement `train_model(X_train, Y_train)` and `predict(X_test)`

## Realistic Goal Assessment
Target 0.0333 is NOT achievable with tabular approaches:
- Best LB: 0.0913 (2.74x above target)
- GNN benchmark achieved 0.0039 using graph attention networks
- **Focus**: Maximize LB within tabular constraints (~0.09 is realistic ceiling)

## Summary of Best Models
| Experiment | Architecture | CV Score | LB Score | Notes |
|------------|--------------|----------|----------|-------|
| exp_012 | Ensemble (MLP+LGBM) | 0.009004 | **0.0913** | **BEST LB** |
| exp_007 | [32,16] MLP | 0.009262 | 0.0932 | Previous best LB |
| exp_006 | [64,32] MLP | 0.009749 | 0.09457 | Potential 3rd model |

## Strategic Decision
With 4 submissions remaining and exp_012 as current best:
- **Try 3-model ensemble** - potential for 1-2% additional improvement
- If CV improves, submit for LB validation
- If not, keep exp_012 as final submission (already BEST LB)

## Next Steps
1. Create 3-model ensemble: MLP[32,16] + LightGBM + MLP[64,32]
2. Ensure template compliance
3. Run full CV to compare with exp_012 (CV 0.009004)
4. If CV improves, submit for LB validation
5. If not, exp_012 remains as best submission
