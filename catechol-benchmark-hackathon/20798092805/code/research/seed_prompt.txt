## Current Status
- Best CV score: 0.009004 from exp_013 (Compliant Ensemble: MLP[32,16] + LightGBM)
- Best LB score: 0.0932 from exp_007 ([32,16] MLP alone)
- CV-LB gap: ~9.43x average ratio (increasing from 8.85x to 10.17x as models improve)
- Target: 0.0333 (2.8x better than best LB - UNREACHABLE with current tabular approach)
- Submissions: 0 remaining today (reset at 00:00 UTC)

## Response to Evaluator

**Technical verdict was TRUSTWORTHY.** Agree - the CV methodology is sound, template compliance is achieved, and results are valid.

**Evaluator's top priority: Strategic decision on which model to submit.**
AGREE. The evaluator correctly identified the key decision point. Given the CV-LB decorrelation at low CV scores (exp_009 had better CV but worse LB than exp_007), the choice between:
- Option A: Submit exp_013 ensemble (CV 0.009004, predicted LB ~0.0918)
- Option B: Submit exp_007 [32,16] alone (CV 0.009262, known LB 0.0932)

**My decision**: Submit exp_013 ensemble FIRST when submissions reset. Reasoning:
1. The linear fit predicts LB = 0.0918 (1.5% improvement over 0.0932)
2. Even with CV-LB decorrelation, the ensemble has a reasonable chance of improving
3. If it fails, we still have exp_007 as a reliable fallback
4. We need to test the ensemble hypothesis to learn from it

**Key concerns raised:**
1. **CV-LB decorrelation** - Valid. The ratio increased from 8.85x to 10.17x (15% increase). This means CV improvements translate less to LB improvements at low CV scores. However, the correlation is still 0.9675 (p=0.0004), so CV is still a useful signal.
2. **Target unreachable** - Agree. To beat 0.0333, we need CV < 0.00353 (60.8% improvement from current 0.009004). This is unrealistic with tabular ML. The GNN benchmark achieved 0.0039 MSE - we cannot match this.
3. **Notebook compliance** - RESOLVED. exp_013 follows the exact template structure.

## Data Understanding

Reference notebooks:
- `exploration/eda.ipynb` - Initial data exploration
- `exploration/evolver_loop8_lb_feedback.ipynb` - CV-LB correlation analysis (0.97 correlation)
- `exploration/evolver_loop10_lb_feedback.ipynb` - CV-LB breakdown analysis
- `exploration/evolver_loop13_analysis.ipynb` - Latest strategic assessment

Key patterns:
1. **Simplification trend**: Simpler models generalize better ([256,128,64] → [64,32] → [32,16])
2. **Optimal architecture**: [32,16] MLP is the sweet spot for LB performance
3. **Ensemble benefit**: Ensembles improve CV but may not improve LB due to decorrelation
4. **Feature combination**: Spange + DRFP (high-variance) + Arrhenius kinetics features work well
5. **TTA for mixtures**: Averaging predictions from both orderings helps
6. **CV-LB ratio increasing**: From 8.85x to 10.17x as models improve - diminishing returns

## Recommended Approaches

**PRIORITY 1: Prepare for Tomorrow's Submissions**
Since we have 0 submissions today, prepare multiple compliant notebooks:
1. exp_013 ensemble (already done) - CV 0.009004
2. exp_007 [32,16] alone in compliant format - CV 0.009262, known LB 0.0932
3. Ensemble with different weights (0.7/0.3, 0.5/0.5) - test variations

**PRIORITY 2: Test Different Ensemble Weights (CV only)**
Run experiments with different MLP/LightGBM weights to find optimal combination:
- Current: MLP 0.6, LightGBM 0.4 (CV 0.009004)
- Try: MLP 0.7, LightGBM 0.3 (more MLP emphasis)
- Try: MLP 0.5, LightGBM 0.5 (equal weighting)
- Try: MLP 0.55, LightGBM 0.45 (slight adjustment)

**PRIORITY 3: Analyze Prediction Errors**
Identify which solvents have highest error:
- Are there patterns in the errors?
- Can we target specific solvents for improvement?
- This could inform feature engineering or model adjustments

**PRIORITY 4: Try Alternative Ensemble Compositions**
- Pure MLP ensemble: [32,16] + [64,32] (no LightGBM)
- Different tree model: XGBoost instead of LightGBM
- Simpler ensemble: [32,16] MLP + Ridge Regression

## What NOT to Try

1. **Deeper/more complex architectures** - Already proven to hurt LB (exp_004 failed badly)
2. **Larger ensembles (>3 models)** - exp_010 (3-model) was worse than exp_011 (2-model) on CV
3. **DRFP with PCA** - exp_002 showed this hurts performance significantly
4. **Chasing the target (0.0333)** - Unreachable with tabular approaches; requires GNNs
5. **Further simplification beyond [32,16]** - exp_009 ([16]) had worse LB despite better CV
6. **Hyperparameter tuning** - Diminishing returns at this stage

## Validation Notes

**CV Scheme:**
- Single solvent: Leave-one-solvent-out (24 folds, 656 samples)
- Full data: Leave-one-ramp-out (13 folds, 1227 samples)
- Overall MSE: Weighted average by sample count

**CV-LB Calibration:**
- CV-LB correlation: 0.9675 (p=0.0004) - still strong
- Linear fit: LB = 3.99 * CV + 0.0558
- Average ratio: 9.43x (but increasing to 10.17x for best models)
- For exp_013 (CV 0.009004): Predicted LB = 0.0918 (1.5% better than 0.0932)

**Decision Framework for Tomorrow:**
1. When submissions reset, submit exp_013 (ensemble) first
2. If LB < 0.0932: Continue with ensemble approach, try weight variations
3. If LB >= 0.0932: Fall back to exp_007 ([32,16] alone)
4. Use remaining submissions to test best candidates

## Key Insight

**The target of 0.0333 is NOT achievable with our current approach.**

Analysis shows:
- To beat target 0.0333, we need CV < 0.00353 (using 9.43x ratio)
- Current best CV is 0.009004 - need 60.8% CV improvement
- The linear fit suggests we need negative CV (impossible)
- The GNN benchmark achieved 0.0039 MSE - tabular ML cannot match this

**Realistic goal**: Maximize reliability of best achievable LB (~0.09)

The CV-LB decorrelation means we're at the optimization ceiling for tabular approaches. The [32,16] MLP (LB 0.0932) may already be the best achievable. Ensembles improve CV but the LB improvement is uncertain. Focus on:
1. **Reliability** - Ensure notebook compliance (DONE)
2. **Stability** - Use proven models
3. **Diversity** - Prepare multiple candidates for tomorrow

## Experiments to Run Now (No Submissions Needed)

1. **Create compliant notebook for exp_007 [32,16] alone** - fallback option
2. **Test different ensemble weights** (0.7/0.3, 0.5/0.5, 0.55/0.45)
3. **Analyze prediction errors by solvent** - identify patterns
4. **Try XGBoost instead of LightGBM** in ensemble
5. **Try pure MLP ensemble** ([32,16] + [64,32])

When submissions reset at 00:00 UTC, submit exp_013 first and iterate based on LB feedback.
