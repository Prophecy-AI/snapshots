## Current Status
- Best CV score: 0.009004 from exp_012 (2-model ensemble: MLP[32,16] + LightGBM)
- Best LB score: **0.0913** from exp_012 (BEST ACHIEVED)
- CV-LB gap: ~10.14x ratio (consistent across all experiments)
- Target: 0.0333 (2.74x better than best LB)
- Submissions remaining: 4

## Response to Evaluator

**Technical verdict**: TRUSTWORTHY. The evaluator confirmed exp_015 (3-model ensemble) results are valid.

**Evaluator's top priority**: "No Further Experiments Needed" - The exploration is complete.

**My response**: I largely AGREE with the evaluator's assessment. The analysis shows:
1. **3-model ensemble confirmed NOT helpful**: CV 0.009011 vs 2-model's 0.009004 (0.07% worse)
2. **Target is mathematically unreachable**: Linear fit shows LB = 4.05*CV + 0.0551 (R²=0.948)
   - Even CV=0 would give LB=0.0551 > target 0.0333
   - Required CV to hit target: -0.0054 (impossible)

**However**, I want to try ONE more experiment before concluding: a different feature combination that hasn't been tested. This is a low-probability attempt, but worth trying given we have 4 submissions remaining.

## Data Understanding

Reference notebooks:
- `exploration/evolver_loop15_analysis.ipynb` - Final assessment showing target is unreachable
- `exploration/evolver_loop14_lb_feedback.ipynb` - Ensemble LB validation
- `exploration/evolver_loop10_lb_feedback.ipynb` - [16] overfits to CV finding

Key patterns:
- CV-LB ratio: ~10x (stable across 8 submissions)
- Linear fit: LB = 4.05*CV + 0.0551 (R²=0.948)
- Intercept 0.0551 > target 0.0333 → target unreachable with tabular ML

## Recommended Approaches

### Priority 1: Per-Target Models (FINAL EXPERIMENT)
**Rationale**: We've been training a single model for all 3 targets (Product 2, Product 3, SM). Different targets may have different optimal architectures or features.

**Implementation**:
1. Train separate MLP[32,16] + LightGBM ensembles for each target
2. Use same features (Spange + DRFP + Arrhenius)
3. Allow different hyperparameters per target if needed
4. Combine predictions

**Why this might help**:
- SM (starting material) may have different dynamics than products
- Product 2 and Product 3 may respond differently to temperature/time
- Per-target optimization could reduce overall error

**Expected outcome**: Marginal improvement at best (1-2% CV improvement). Unlikely to bridge 2.74x gap to target.

### Priority 2: Accept Current Best (IF PER-TARGET FAILS)
If per-target models don't improve:
- exp_012 (LB 0.0913) is the best achievable result
- Stop experimenting
- Save remaining submissions

## What NOT to Try
- **More ensemble variations**: 3-model confirmed worse than 2-model
- **Weight tuning**: Already optimized (0.6/0.4)
- **Architecture changes**: [32,16] is optimal for LB
- **Different feature sets alone**: ACS PCA (5 features) is less informative than Spange (13 features)
- **GNN approaches**: Would require complete redesign outside template constraints

## Template Compliance (MANDATORY)
The submission MUST follow the exact template structure:
- Last 3 cells are IDENTICAL to the template
- Only the model definition line can be changed
- Model class must implement `train_model(X_train, Y_train)` and `predict(X_test)`

## Realistic Goal Assessment
**Target 0.0333 is NOT achievable with tabular approaches:**
- Best LB: 0.0913 (2.74x above target)
- Linear model shows even CV=0 gives LB=0.0551
- GNN benchmark achieved 0.0039 using graph attention networks

**Focus**: Try per-target models as final experiment. If no improvement, accept exp_012 as final result.

## Summary of Best Models

| Experiment | Architecture | CV Score | LB Score | Notes |
|------------|--------------|----------|----------|-------|
| exp_012 | 2-model ensemble | 0.009004 | **0.0913** | **BEST LB** |
| exp_007 | MLP [32,16] | 0.009262 | 0.0932 | Best single model |
| exp_015 | 3-model ensemble | 0.009011 | - | Worse than 2-model |

## Strategic Decision

**ONE FINAL EXPERIMENT**: Per-target models
- If CV improves significantly (>1%), submit for LB validation
- If not, accept exp_012 as final submission

**After this experiment**: STOP. The exploration will be complete regardless of outcome.

## Next Steps
1. Create per-target ensemble: separate MLP[32,16] + LightGBM for each of 3 targets
2. Run full CV
3. Compare with exp_012 (CV 0.009004)
4. If improvement > 1%, submit for LB validation
5. Otherwise, conclude experimentation
