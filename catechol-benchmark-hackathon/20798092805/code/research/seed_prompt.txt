## Current Status
- Best CV score: 0.0097 from exp_006 (Simpler [64,32] with dropout 0.1)
- Best LB score: 0.0946 from exp_006 (NEW BEST!)
- CV-LB gap: ~9.17x ratio (consistent across 5 submissions)
- Target: 0.0333 (need 64.8% LB improvement from current best)
- Submissions: 5/5 used, 2 remaining

## Response to Evaluator

**Technical verdict was TRUSTWORTHY.** The simpler model experiment executed correctly.

**Evaluator's top priority: SUBMIT TO LB AND CONTINUE SIMPLIFYING IF SUCCESSFUL.**
DONE. exp_006 submitted and achieved BEST LB (0.0946). The simpler model hypothesis is VALIDATED:
- CV improved 6.7% (0.0104 → 0.0097)
- LB improved 2.4% (0.0969 → 0.0946)
- Both improved in same direction!

**Key concerns raised and how I'm addressing them:**
1. **LB validation needed** - DONE. exp_006 achieved best LB 0.0946.
2. **Even simpler architectures unexplored** - NOW TOP PRIORITY. Try [32,16], [32], or linear.
3. **Per-target models** - BACKUP if simpler models plateau.
4. **Random Forest** - NEW PRIORITY based on web research showing RF excels at OOD prediction.

**Critical insight from exp_006 LB feedback:**
- Simpler model achieved BOTH better CV AND better LB
- The CV-LB ratio increased slightly (9.75x vs 9.17x avg) but absolute LB still improved
- This confirms: model capacity should be LIMITED for leave-one-solvent-out generalization

## Data Understanding

Reference notebooks:
- `exploration/evolver_loop7_lb_feedback.ipynb` - Latest LB feedback analysis
- `exploration/evolver_loop6_lb_feedback.ipynb` - CV-LB ratio analysis
- `exploration/eda.ipynb` - Initial data exploration

Key patterns:
1. **Simpler models generalize better** - VALIDATED by both CV and LB improvement
2. **CV-LB ratio is ~9.17x consistently** (std: 0.43) across all 5 submissions
3. **Best feature combination**: Spange + DRFP (high-variance) + Arrhenius kinetics
4. **To beat target 0.0333, need CV < 0.0036** (63% improvement from current 0.0097)
5. **Research insight**: Random Forests excel at OOD yield prediction due to good generalization

## Recommended Approaches

### Priority 1: Even Simpler MLP Architectures (HIGH CONFIDENCE)
**Why:** If [64,32] beats [256,128,64], optimal may be even simpler. The trend is clear.
**How:**
- Try [32, 16] architecture (half the capacity of current best)
- Try single hidden layer [32] or [64]
- Try linear model (no hidden layers) as ultimate simplicity test
- Keep same features (Spange + DRFP + Arrhenius)
- Keep dropout low (0.1) and weight decay low (1e-5)
**Expected outcome:** May find optimal simplicity level. If linear works well, it confirms overfitting hypothesis.

### Priority 2: Random Forest Baseline (NEW - HIGH POTENTIAL)
**Why:** Web research shows RF achieves BEST OOD performance for yield prediction due to good generalization.
**How:**
- Use sklearn RandomForestRegressor
- Same features (Spange + DRFP + Arrhenius)
- Per-target regressors (3 separate RF models)
- Tune n_estimators, max_depth, min_samples_leaf
- RF is inherently robust to overfitting on small datasets
**Expected outcome:** May have fundamentally different CV-LB relationship. Could be breakthrough.

### Priority 3: Ensemble of Simpler Models (IF TIME PERMITS)
**Why:** Combining diverse simple models may reduce variance without overfitting.
**How:**
- Ensemble: Linear + [32] + [64,32] + RF
- Simple averaging or weighted by validation performance
- Each model is simple but diverse
**Expected outcome:** May capture different aspects of the data.

### Priority 4: Per-Target Models (BACKUP)
**Why:** Competition allows different hyperparameters per target. SM, Product 2, Product 3 may have different optimal patterns.
**How:**
- Train 3 separate models, each optimized for its target
- Can use different architectures per target
- May capture target-specific patterns better
**Expected outcome:** May improve overall score by specializing.

## What NOT to Try

1. **Larger ensembles** - Diminishing returns proven (15 models only 0.3% better than 5)
2. **Deep architectures** - exp_004 proved this hurts badly (5x worse)
3. **Residual connections** - Not appropriate for this tabular data
4. **Complex feature engineering** - Current features are working well
5. **More epochs** - Already at 200-300, diminishing returns
6. **Higher dropout** - Simpler model with lower dropout (0.1) works better
7. **Complex ensembles (XGBoost + CatBoost + NN)** - Overly complex, likely to overfit

## Validation Notes

- CV scheme: Leave-one-solvent-out (24 folds for single, 13 folds for mixtures)
- CV-LB ratio: ~9.17x consistently (std: 0.43)
- **CRITICAL:** Simpler models have BETTER CV AND BETTER LB. Continue simplifying.
- To beat target 0.0333, need CV < 0.0036 (63% improvement from current 0.0097)

## Competition Constraints (CRITICAL)

The competition template requires:
1. **Last 3 cells must match template exactly**
2. Only the model definition line can change
3. Model must have `train_model(X_train, Y_train)` and `predict(X_test)` methods
4. Same hyperparameters across all folds (unless explainable rationale)

## Submission Strategy

With 2 submissions remaining:
1. **Next experiment:** Try BOTH simpler MLP [32,16] AND Random Forest
2. **Submit the better one** based on CV
3. **Final submission:** Best approach based on all experiments

## Reality Check

The target (0.0333) is very challenging:
- Current best LB: 0.0946
- Need: 64.8% improvement (0.0946 → 0.0333)
- With 9.17x ratio, need CV ~0.0036 (63% improvement from 0.0097)

**Key insight:** The simpler model direction is VALIDATED. Continue simplifying aggressively.
- If [64,32] beats [256,128,64], try [32,16] or even linear
- Random Forest may have fundamentally different (better) CV-LB relationship
- The optimal model may be MUCH simpler than expected

**Strategic priority:**
1. Test even simpler architectures ([32,16], linear)
2. Test Random Forest (research shows it excels at OOD)
3. Submit the best performer
4. The breakthrough may come from extreme simplicity or RF
