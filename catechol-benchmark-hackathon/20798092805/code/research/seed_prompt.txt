## Current Status
- Best CV score: 0.008785 from exp_011 (Simple Ensemble: MLP[32,16] + LightGBM)
- Best LB score: 0.0932 from exp_007 ([32,16] MLP alone)
- CV-LB gap: ~10x ratio (increasing as CV improves)
- Target: 0.0333 (2.8x better than best LB - NOT achievable with tabular approaches)
- Submissions remaining: 5

## Response to Evaluator

**Technical verdict**: TRUSTWORTHY. The evaluator confirmed exp_014 results are valid.

**Evaluator's top priority**: Submit exp_013 (compliant ensemble) to LB to validate if ensemble beats [32,16] alone.

**I AGREE with this recommendation.** The key insight is:
- exp_009 ([16]) has BETTER CV (0.009192) but WORSE LB (0.09364) than exp_007 ([32,16], LB 0.0932)
- This proves CV-LB decorrelation at low CV scores
- We cannot trust CV improvements to translate to LB improvements
- We MUST validate the ensemble on LB before committing to final strategy

**Key concerns raised by evaluator**:
1. "No LB validation of ensemble" - CRITICAL. Addressing by recommending submission.
2. "Diminishing returns on micro-optimization" - AGREED. Weight tuning (0.09% difference) is noise.
3. "Target is unreachable" - ACKNOWLEDGED. Focus on maximizing LB within tabular constraints.

## Data Understanding
Reference notebooks:
- `exploration/eda.ipynb` - Full EDA with data shapes, target distributions
- `exploration/evolver_loop14_analysis.ipynb` - CV-LB analysis showing decorrelation
- `exploration/evolver_loop10_lb_feedback.ipynb` - Critical finding: [16] overfits to CV

Key patterns:
- Single solvent: 656 samples, 24 solvents (leave-one-out CV)
- Full/mixture: 1227 samples, 13 ramps (leave-one-ramp-out CV)
- CV-LB ratio: 8.86x → 10.19x (INCREASING as CV improves)
- [32,16] MLP is optimal for LB, not [16] or larger architectures

## Recommended Approaches

### Priority 1: Submit exp_012 (Compliant Ensemble) for LB Validation
**CRITICAL**: We have 5 submissions remaining. Use one to validate the ensemble.
- exp_012 is the compliant version of exp_011 (CV 0.009004)
- Linear fit predicts LB ~0.0918 (1.5% better than exp_007's 0.0932)
- BUT: LightGBM alone had LB 0.10649 - adding it might HURT LB
- We need empirical validation before committing

### Priority 2: Create Compliant MLP-Only Notebook (Backup)
If exp_012 ensemble is WORSE than exp_007 on LB:
- Create template-compliant version of [32,16] MLP alone
- exp_007 has PROVEN best LB (0.0932)
- This is the safe fallback option

### Priority 3: Explore Higher-Impact Approaches (If Time Permits)
Only if ensemble validation shows promise:
1. **Different ensemble compositions**: Try MLP[32,16] + MLP[64,32] (no LightGBM)
2. **Feature engineering**: Additional physics-informed features
3. **Regularization tuning**: Different dropout/weight decay combinations

## What NOT to Try
- **Weight tuning**: 0.6/0.4 vs 0.7/0.3 showed only 0.09% difference (noise)
- **Simpler architectures**: [16] has worse LB despite better CV
- **Larger architectures**: [256,128,64] has worse LB than [32,16]
- **GNN approaches**: Would require significant code changes and may not fit template
- **More ensemble models**: 15 models vs 5 showed marginal improvement

## Validation Notes
- CV scheme: Leave-one-solvent-out (24 folds) + Leave-one-ramp-out (13 folds)
- CV-LB correlation: 0.97 overall, but DECORRELATES at low CV scores
- Critical insight: exp_009 ([16]) has best CV but worse LB than exp_007 ([32,16])
- Trust LB over CV for final model selection

## Template Compliance (MANDATORY)
The submission MUST follow the exact template structure:
- Last 3 cells are IDENTICAL to the template
- Only the model definition line can be changed
- Model class must implement `train_model(X_train, Y_train)` and `predict(X_test)`

## Realistic Goal
Target 0.0333 is NOT achievable with tabular approaches:
- Best LB: 0.0932 (2.8x above target)
- GNN benchmark achieved 0.0039 using graph attention networks
- Focus on maximizing LB within tabular constraints (~0.09 is realistic ceiling)

## Summary of Best Models
| Experiment | Architecture | CV Score | LB Score | Notes |
|------------|--------------|----------|----------|-------|
| exp_007 | [32,16] MLP | 0.009262 | 0.0932 | **BEST LB** |
| exp_009 | [16] MLP | 0.009192 | 0.0936 | Best CV but worse LB |
| exp_012 | Ensemble (MLP+LGBM) | 0.009004 | ??? | **NEEDS LB VALIDATION** |

## Next Steps
1. **SUBMIT exp_012** to get LB feedback
2. If ensemble LB < 0.0932: Use ensemble for final submission
3. If ensemble LB > 0.0932: Create compliant [32,16] MLP for final submission
4. Use remaining submissions strategically for any promising variations
