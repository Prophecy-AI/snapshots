      "text": "Predicting reaction yields for solvents that have never been seen before is a classic few\u2011shot problem: the model must learn a robust relationship between molecular/solvent descriptors and yield from only a handful of experimental points, and then extrapolate safely to a new region of chemical space.  Recent benchmark work that deliberately samples continuous process conditions\u2014including solvent composition\u2014shows that standard regression models quickly over\u2011fit, whereas **few\u2011shot learning strategies (e.g., meta\u2011learning, prototypical networks) and active\u2011learning loops that query the most informative solvent\u2011yield pairs** give markedly better out\u2011of\u2011distribution performance ([arxiv](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1)).  The key is to treat solvent selection as a time\u2011series task and to encode each solvent with physicochemical descriptors (polarity, dielectric constant, Hansen parameters, etc.) that can be shared across reactions.\n\nWhen only a few experimental yields are available, the most reliable approach is to **leverage large synthetic or related datasets through transfer learning**.  A natural\u2011language\u2011processing model that was first trained on 10\u202fM COSMO\u2011RS\u2011generated activity\u2011coefficient data and then fine\u2011tuned on \u224820\u202fk experimental points was able to predict limiting activity coefficients\u2014and, by extension, solvent effects on yield\u2014with half the error of traditional thermodynamic models ([ar5iv](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2206.07048)).  A similar strategy was applied to a small literature set of nickel\u2011catalyzed C\u2013O couplings (\u22481\u202fk reactions), where a simple graph\u2011based or random\u2011forest model, pre\u2011trained on broader reaction databases and subsequently regularized with dropout or shallow tree depth, achieved competitive yield predictions despite the limited data ([HAL](https://hal.sorbonne-universite.fr/hal-03790865v1/preview/Predicting_reaction_yields___JACS_Format_changes.pdf)).  **Active transfer learning**\u2014starting from a baseline model, selecting the most uncertain solvent\u2011reaction combinations, and experimentally measuring those yields\u2014further improves extrapolation, as demonstrated for Pd\u2011cross\u2011couplings where a small ensemble of decision trees maintained interpretability while expanding applicability to unseen nucleophiles ([RSC](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlepdf/2022/sc/d1sc06932b)).\n\nFinally, **hybrid mechanistic\u2011ML models and uncertainty quantification** help flag predictions that lie beyond the model\u2019s confidence envelope.  Combining mechanistic activation\u2011energy calculations with data\u2011driven corrections yields accurate yields even with sparse data, and Bayesian approaches (Gaussian processes, Monte\u2011Carlo dropout) quantify aleatoric uncertainty, guiding where additional experiments are most valuable ([RSC 2021](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2021/sc/d0sc04896h); [ChemRxiv 2024](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/article-details/672ce7dff9980725cf764d24)).  In practice, the workflow that works best under severe data scarcity is: (1) encode solvents with rich, physics\u2011based descriptors; (2) pre\u2011train a flexible model on large synthetic or related reaction data; (3) fine\u2011tune on the few available experimental yields; (4) employ active (or Bayesian) learning to iteratively add the most informative solvent experiments; and (5) use a simple, regularized model or a mechanistic\u2011ML hybrid to retain interpretability and reliable extrapolation.",

However, chemical datasets are often inaccessible to the machine learning community as they tend to require cleaning, thorough understanding of the chemistry, or are simply not available. In this paper, we introduce a novel dataset for yield prediction, providing the first-ever transient flow dataset for machine learning benchmarking, covering over 1200 process conditions. While previous datasets focus on discrete parameters, our experimental set-up allow us to sample a large number of continuous process conditions, generating new challenges for machine learning models. We focus on solvent selection, a task that is particularly difficult to model theoretically and therefore ripe for machine learning applications. We showcase benchmarking for regression algorithms, transfer-learning approaches, feature engineering, and active learning, with important applications towards solvent replacement and sustainable manufacturing.\n## 1Introduction\nMachine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) have showcased enormous potential in empowering the world of the natural sciences: from famous examples such as AlphaFold for protein predictions> [\n[> 1\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib1)> ]\n, to fusion reactor control> [\n[> 2\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib2)> ]\n, disease detection> [\n[> 3\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib3)> ]\n, battery design> [\n[> 4\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib4)> ]\n, and material discovery> [\n[> 5\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib5)> ]\n, among many more. However, we seldom see the machine learning community benchmark new methods in physical science datasets, mostly due to the difficulty in cleaning real-world data, the need for interdisciplinary understanding to correctly benchmark, and most importantly, how expensive the data can be to produce, resulting in many datasets being locked behind closed doors by large companies.\nAIchemy ([https://aichemy.ac.uk](https://aichemy.ac.uk)) is an interdisciplinary UK hub with the mission of transforming the chemistry-AI interface via aiding the collaboration of chemists and AI researchers, as well as addressing gaps in data standards, curation, and availability for AI use. In partnership with SOLVE Chemistry ([https://www.solvechemistry.com](https://www.solvechemistry.com)), we present a first important step into addressing the dataset gap with the introduction of a new and unique open dataset for benchmarking low-data machine learning algorithms for chemistry.\nSolvent selection is one of the biggest challenges for chemical manufacturing, with solvents often being the main source of waste in the manufacturing process> [\n[> 6\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib6)> ]\n. Increased regulation on solvents and a drive to making process manufacturing more sustainable led to an interest in the discovery of greener solvents and for improved solvent replacement tools. However, most of the solvent replacement tools focus purely on learning unsupervised representations of solvents, with the hope that experimentalists can find solvents with similar properties to replace those with environmental concerns. A much stronger approach would consider the interaction of a variety of different solvents with a reaction of interest to directly predict reaction yields, in such a way that the best possible solvent can be selected according to a yield-sustainability trade-off.\nMachine learning approaches have been shown to be a powerful tool for the prediction of chemical reaction conditions. Success has been reported in retro-synthesis> [\n[> 7\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib7)> , [> 8\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib8)> ]\n, condition recommendations> [\n[> 9\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib9)> ]\n, product predictions> [\n[> 10\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib10)> , [> 11\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib11)> ]\n, among others. While yield prediction has proven to be more difficult due to large inconsistencies in procedure and data reporting> [\n[> 12\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib12)> ]\n, we have still seen promising yield prediction results for smaller and more carefully curated datasets> [\n[> 13\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib13)> , [> 14\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib14)> , [> 15\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib15)> , [> 16\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib16)> ]\n. However, these datasets lack the continuous reaction conditions, such as temperature and residence time, that are required to scale-up processes to practical manufacturing conditions.\nIn this paper, we release the first machine-learning-ready transient flow dataset, a framework that allows for quick and efficient screening of continuous reaction conditions. We specifically provide yield data over the uni-molecular allyl substituted catechol reaction, shown in Figure[1](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#S1.F1), with dense measurements across the residence time, temperature, and solvent space. We further showcase how this type ofkinetic dataposes new challenges to current machine learning methods for chemistry, and identify how the challenges can potentially be tackled by the community.\n![Refer to caption](extracted/6524982/figures/Project2_rxn.png)Figure 1:Data was gathered on the rearrangement of allyl substituted catechol. By subjecting the reaction mixture to high temperatures, we begin a cascade reaction forming multiple rearrangement products. We investigate the yield of the reaction for a range of different solvents. Product 1 was not observed and reacted immediately to form Product 2 and later 3.\n### 1.1Related works\nReaction datasets are common in chemistry research, but their suitability for machine learning benchmarking tends to be poor. This can be a result of improper formatting or documentation, incomplete information about reaction conditions or the experimental set-up, or the lack of machine readability, leading to limited usage by the ML community. However, some effort has been made to address this, with the biggest example being the creation of the Open Reaction Database (ORD)> [\n[> 17\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib17)> ]\n, a repository containing over 2M different reactions, many of which come from US patent data (USPTO)> [\n[> 18\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib18)> ]\n.

Phase equilibria calculations of mixtures require activity coefficients. However, experimental data on activity coefficients is often limited due to high cost of experiments. For an accurate and efficient prediction of activity coefficients, machine learning approaches have been recently developed. However, current machine learning approaches still extrapolate poorly for activity coefficients of unknown molecules. In this work, we introduce the SMILES-to-Properties-Transformer (SPT), a natural language processing network to predict binary limiting activity coefficients from SMILES codes. To overcome the limitations of available experimental data, we initially train our network on a large dataset of synthetic data sampled from COSMO-RS (10 Million data points) and then fine-tune the model on experimental data (20\u20098702087020\\\\,870 data points). This training strategy enables SPT to accurately predict limiting activity coefficients even for unknown molecules, cutting the mean prediction error in half compared to state-of-the-art models for activity coefficient predictions such as COSMO-RS, UNIFACDortmund, and improving on recent machine learning approaches.\n\n_Keywords_\u2002thermodynamic properties \u00a0\u22c5\u22c5\\\\cdot\nmachine learning \u00a0\u22c5\u22c5\\\\cdot\nactivity coefficients \u00a0\u22c5\u22c5\\\\cdot\nSMILES\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nWith over 500\u2009000500000500\\\\,000 molecules registered even in the CAS Common Chemicals database (CAS, [2022](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org#bib.bib9)), the chemical design space of molecules is substantially larger than our capacity to measure their thermodynamic property data. This gap further increases when considering that properties usually depend on temperature and pressure, and even more for mixtures due to combinatorics and dependency on mixture composition. Binary activity coefficients are of particular interest in chemical engineering, as activity coefficients govern the phase equilibria in distillation and extraction, the key separations of many chemical processes. However, even large property databases, such as the Dortmund Datenbank (DDB), only hold experimental data for the activity coefficients of 31\u20090003100031\\\\,000 binary systems, a tiny fraction of all possible molecular combinations(Dortmund Datenbank, [2022](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org#bib.bib14)).\n\nTo overcome the inherent lack of experimental data, predictive thermodynamic property models have been developed over recent decades for many molecular properties, e.g., COSMO-RS (Klamt, [1995](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org#bib.bib22)), COSMO-SAC (Lin and Sandler, [2002](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org#bib.bib25)), SAFT-\u03b3\ud835\udefe\\\\gamma Mie (Lafitte et\u00a0al., [2013](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org#bib.bib23)), and UNIFAC (Fredenslund et\u00a0al., [1975](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org#bib.bib16)). These models can predict thermodynamic properties with increasing accuracy and are therefore particularly beneficial for molecule mixtures with missing experimental data. However, despite the vital advantages of predictive thermodynamic models, these models come with shortcomings. E.g., calculating the surface charges of molecules for COSMO models is time-consuming, whilst UNIFAC is limited to known functional groups parametrized to experimental data. Moreover, these physically-based predictive models are still less accurate than experiments(Brouwer and Schuur, [2019](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org#bib.bib6)).\n\nComputationally efficient alternatives to physically-based predictive models are data-driven models using machine learning. Machine learning is currently a rising topic in chemical engineering, as summarized in multiple recent reviews (Alshehri and You, [2022](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org#bib.bib2); Haghighatlari and Hachmann, [2019](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org#bib.bib17); Dobbelaere et\u00a0al., [2021](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org#bib.bib13)) that identify challenges in many areas such as optimal decision making, introduction and enforcing of physics, information and knowledge representation, and safety and trust (Schweidtmann et\u00a0al., [2021](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org#bib.bib33)). The application of machine learning has also already led to recent advances in thermodynamic property prediction. Alshehri et\u00a0al. ( [2021](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org#bib.bib3)) developed a data-driven model to predict 25 pure component properties based on a Gaussian process. The developed model surpasses classical group contribution models in accuracy. Chen et\u00a0al. ( [2021a](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org#bib.bib10)) use a transformer-convolutional model to predict the sigma profiles of pure components with high accuracy.\n\nTo predict activity coefficients, matrix completion methods have been recently proposed that represent the limiting activity coefficient of binary mixtures as a matrix. In matrix completion methods, all mixtures are sorted into a solvent-by-solute matrix. Known mixtures are used to learn embeddings for each solvent/solute, which then can be used to fill the matrix by interpolating towards unknown combinations. Jirasek et\u00a0al. ( [2020](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org#bib.bib19)) proposed a matrix completion method to predict limiting activity coefficients of binary mixtures at 298.15 K that exceeded the accuracy achieved by UNIFAC. Recently, Damay et\u00a0al. ( [2021](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org#bib.bib12)) extended the method of Jirasek et\u00a0al. ( [2020](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org#bib.bib19)) to capture temperature dependencies. The proposed model has a higher accuracy for the temperature-dependent prediction of limiting activity coefficients than UNIFAC. Chen et\u00a0al. ( [2021b](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org#bib.bib11)) developed an approach to extend the UNIFAC-Il model (Nebig and Gmehling, [2010](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org#bib.bib27)) for predicting limiting activity coefficients in ionic liquids by combining matrix completion with convolutional networks. These proposed approaches exceed the accuracy of the widely employed UNIFAC model in predicting limiting activity coefficients. Moreover, matrix completion approaches do not require any characterization of the molecules to train the model and predict thermodynamic properties, as the model solely learns from the correlations within the matrix. However, their lack of molecular characterization prevents matrix completion methods from extrapolating beyond the space of molecules available for training. Recently, Sanchez Medina et\u00a0al. ( [2022](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org#bib.bib31)) developed a graph neural network to predict limiting activity coefficients at constant temperature. In principle, this graph neural network is capable of extrapolating to unknown solvents and solutes, but the extrapolatory capabilities of the network were not tested. Thus, it is still unclear ho...",

Kammeraad, ab Ziping Xu, b Ambuj Tewari, bc\nTim Cernak *ad and Paul M. Zimmerman *a\nTransfer and active learning have the potential to accelerate the development of new chemical reactions,\nusing prior data and new experiments to inform models that adapt to the target area of interest. This article\nshows how specifically tuned machine learning models, based on random forest classifiers, can expand the\napplicability of Pd-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions to types of nucleophiles unknown to the model. First,\nmodel transfer is shown to be effective when reaction mechanisms and substrates are closely related, even\nwhen models are trained on relatively small numbers of data points. Then, a model simplification scheme is\ntested and found to provide comparative predictivity on reactions of new nucleophiles that include unseen\nreagent combinations. Lastly, for a challenging target where model transfer only provides a modest benefit\nover random selection, an active transfer learning strategy is introduced to improve model predictions.\nSimple models, composed of a small number of decision trees with limited depths, are crucial for\nsecuring generalizability, interpretability, and performance of active transfer learning.\nIntroduction\nComputers are becoming increasingly capable of performing\nhigh-level chemical tasks.1\u20134 Machine learning approaches have\ndemonstrated viable retrosynthetic analyses,5\u20137 product predic\u0002tion,8\u201311 reaction condition suggestion,12\u201316 prediction of ster\u0002eoselectivity,17\u201320 regioselectivity,19,21\u201324 and reaction yield25,26\nand optimization of reaction conditions.27\u201330 These advances\nallow computers to assist synthesis planning for functional\nmolecules using well-established chemistry. For machine\nlearning to aid the development of new reactions, a model\nbased on established chemical knowledge must be able to\ngeneralize its predictions to reactivity that lies outside of the\ndataset. However, because most supervised learning algorithms\nlearn how features (e.g. reaction conditions) within a particular\ndomain relate to an outcome (e.g. yield), the model is not ex\u0002pected to be accurate outside its domain. This situation\nrequires chemists to consider other machine learning methods\nfor navigating new reactivity.\nExpert knowledge based on known reactions plays a central\nrole in the design of new reactions. The assumption that\nsubstrates with chemically similar reaction centers have trans\u0002ferable performance provides a plausible starting point for\nexperimental exploration. This concept of chemical similarity,\ntogether with literature data, guides expert chemists in the\ndevelopment of new reactions. Transfer learning, which\nassumes that data from a nearby domain, called the source\ndomain, can be leveraged to model the problem of interest in\na new domain, called the target domain,31 emulates a tactic\ncommonly employed by human chemists.\nTransfer learning is a promising strategy when limited data\nis available in the domain of interest, but a sizeable dataset is\navailable in a related domain.31,32 Models are \ue103rst created using\nthe source data, then transferred to the target domain using\nvarious algorithms.19,33\u201335 For new chemical targets where no\nlabeled data is available, the head start in predictivity a source\nmodel can provide becomes important. However, when a shi\ue09d\nin distribution of descriptor values occurs (e.g., descriptors\noutside of the original model ranges) in the target data, making\npredictions becomes challenging. For such a situation, the\nobjective of transfer learning becomes training a model that is\nas predictive in the target domain as possible.31,36 Toward this\nend, cross-validation is known to improve generalizability by\nproviding a procedure to avoid over\ue103tting on the training data.37\nThe reduction of generalization error, however, may not be\nsufficient outside the source domain. Accordingly, new\nmethods that enhance the applicability of a transferred model\nto new targets would be bene\ue103cial for reaction condition\nprediction.\nAnother machine learning method that can help tackle data\nscarcity is active learning.

As a result,\nexploration is guided into the most informative areas and\navoids collection of unnecessary data.38,39 Active learning is\ntherefore well-suited for reaction development, which greatly\nbene\ue103ts from efficient exploration and where chemists conduct\nthe next batch of reactions based on previous experimental\nresults. Based on this analogy, reaction optimization27,28 and\nreaction condition identi\ue103cation40 have been demonstrated to\nbene\ue103t from active learning. However, these prior works initiate\nexploration with randomly selected data points (Fig. 1A) which\ndoes not leverage prior knowledge, and therefore does not\nre\ue104ect how expert chemists initiate exploration.

Toward\nthis goal, model transfer and its combination with active\nlearning were evaluated. Taking advantage of diverse campaigns,\nthis study will show that transferred models can be effective in\napplying prior reaction conditions to a new substrate type under\ncertain conditions. Next, the source model's ability to predict\nreaction conditions with new combinations of reagents will also\nbe evaluated.

Models based on machine learning have emerged as a promising alternative to address these problems, but these models currently lack the precision to give crucial information on the magnitude of barrier heights, influence of solvents and catalysts and extent of regio- and chemoselectivity. Here, we construct hybrid models which combine the traditional transition state modelling and machine learning to accurately predict reaction barriers. We train a Gaussian Process Regression model to reproduce high-quality experimental kinetic data for the nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction and use it to predict barriers with a mean absolute error of 0.77 kcal mol\u22121 for an external test set. The model was further validated on regio- and chemoselectivity prediction on patent reaction data and achieved a competitive top-1 accuracy of 86%, despite not being trained explicitly for this task. Importantly, the model gives error bars for its predictions that can be used for risk assessment by the end user. Hybrid models emerge as the preferred alternative for accurate reaction prediction in the very common low-data situation where only 100\u2013150 rate constants are available for a reaction class. With recent advances in deep learning for quickly predicting barriers and transition state geometries from density functional theory, we envision that hybrid models will soon become a standard alternative to complement current machine learning approaches based on ground-state physical organic descriptors or structural information such as molecular graphs or fingerprints.\n\n* * *\n\n## Introduction\n\nAccurate prediction of chemical reactions is an important goal both in academic and industrial research. [1\u20133](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2021/sc/d0sc04896h#cit1) Recently, machine learning approaches have had tremendous success in quantitative prediction of reaction yields based on data from high-throughput experimentation [4,5](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2021/sc/d0sc04896h#cit4) and enantioselectivities based on carefully selected universal training sets. [6](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2021/sc/d0sc04896h#cit6) At the same time, traditional quantitative structure\u2013reactivity relationship (QSRR) methods based on linear regression have seen a renaissance with interpretable, holistic models that can generalize across reaction types. [7](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2021/sc/d0sc04896h#cit7) In parallel with these developments of quantitative prediction methods, deep learning models trained on reaction databases containing millions of patent and literature data have made quick qualitative yes/no feasibility prediction routine for almost any reaction type. [8](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2021/sc/d0sc04896h#cit8)\n\nIn the pharmaceutical industry, prediction tools have great potential to accelerate synthesis of prospective drugs ( [Fig. 1a](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2021/sc/d0sc04896h#imgfig1)). [9](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2021/sc/d0sc04896h#cit9) Quick prediction is essential in the discovery phase, especially within the context of automation and rapid synthesis of a multitude of candidates for initial activity screening. [3,10,11](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2021/sc/d0sc04896h#cit3) In these circumstances, a simple yes/no as provided by classification models is usually sufficient. More accurate prediction is necessary in the later drug development process, where the synthesis route and formulation of one or a few promising drug candidates is optimized. Here, regression models that give the reaction activation energy can be used to predict both absolute reactivity and selectivity ( [Fig. 1b](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2021/sc/d0sc04896h#imgfig1)). Prediction of absolute reactivity can be used to assess feasibility under process-relevant conditions, while prediction of selectivity is key to reducing purification steps. Predictive tools therefore hold great promise for accelerating route and process development, ultimately delivering medicines to patients both faster and at lower costs.\n\n|     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| [![image file: d0sc04896h-f1.tif](https://pubs.rsc.org/image/article/2021/SC/d0sc04896h/d0sc04896h-f1.gif)](https://pubs.rsc.org/image/article/2021/SC/d0sc04896h/d0sc04896h-f1_hi-res.gif) |\n|  | **Fig. 1**(a) Example of synthetic route to a drug compound.

Since rising to prominence in the early 90s, DFT has enjoyed extraordinary success in rationalizing reactivity and selectivity across the reaction spectrum by modelling the full reaction mechanism. [12](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2021/sc/d0sc04896h#cit12) The success of DFT can be traced in part due to a fortuitous cancellation of errors, which makes it particularly suited for properties such as enantioselectivity, which depends on the relative energies of two structurally very similar transition states (TSs). However, this cancellation of errors does not generally extend to the prediction of the absolute magnitude of reactions barriers (activation free energies, \u0394G\u2021). In particular, DFT struggles with one very important class of reactions: ionic reactions in solution. Plata and Singleton even sug...",

Previous\nwork focused on two categories of datasets: High-Throughput Experimentation data,\nas an ideal case study and datasets extracted from proprietary databases, which are\nknown to have a strong reporting bias towards high yields. However, predicting yields\nusing published reaction data remains elusive. To fill the gap, we built a dataset on\n1\nnickel-catalyzed cross-couplings extracted from organic reaction publications, including\nscope and optimization information. We demonstrate the importance of including\noptimization data as a source of failed experiments and emphasize how publication\nconstraints shape the exploration of the chemical space by the synthetic community.\nWhile machine learning models still fail to perform out-of-sample predictions, this work\nshows that adding chemical knowledge enables fair predictions in a low-data regime.\nEventually, we hope that this unique public database will foster further improvements\nof machine learning methods for reaction yield prediction in a more realistic context.\nIntroduction\nMachine learning (ML) algorithms learn complex functions from data. As it can leverage\nexisting data to perform in silico approximations of costly experimental processes, ML\napplications have sparked strong interest in chemical sciences. While ML has already made a\nsignificant impact in drug development, 1,2 synthetizability assessment of small molecules 3 or\nComputer Aided Synthesis Planning, 4the ability of ML to predict a reaction yield from its\nexperimental conditions remains a major challenge 5that is intensively studied. 6,7 Advances\non reaction yield prediction would have a major impact on organic synthesis by significantly\nreducing cost, time and resources necessary to synthesize new chemicals.\nProgress in ML is markedly driven by the increasing access to data. Thus, currently\navailable datasets shape the evolution of ML for reaction yield prediction. Despite this,\nthere are very few publicly available and easily operable datasets of chemical reactions with\nassociated yields (Table S1). One of those few public datasets is the United State Patent\nand Trademark Office (USPTO) dataset, 8that covers a wide range of chemical reactions\nextracted from patents. USPTO data is extremely diverse and suffers from a selection bias\nas only successful reactions tend to be reported in patents. ML has shown poor performance\npredicting yields on this dataset (R2 < 0.2).7In addition, two sets of High Throughput\nExperimentation (HTE) data, one of a Suzuki-Miyaura coupling, 9 and one of a palladium\u00022\ncatalyzed Buchwald-Hartwig cross-coupling, 10 are available in the literature. State-of-the-art\nmodeling performs extremely well on those high-quality datasets (R2 > 0.8),7,10 but the\nextremely focused chemical reaction space covered by HTE limits the predictions to a narrow\nscope of experimental conditions and reactants.\nWhile these datasets have enabled rapid progress of ML for yield prediction, there is a\nneed for publicly available datasets 11,12 more representative of published reaction data or\nused by chemists in their everyday work. To the best of our knowledge, the most recent\nworks on predicting reaction yields 5,13 rely on datasets extracted from Reaxys or Sci-Findern,\nwhich are not representative of the whole information contained in published reaction data.\nThe main hurdle to gather a machine readable reaction database is the difficulty to automate\ndata extraction from publications. One of the solution to overcome this issue would be\na change toward a numerical data storage in the chemistry community, an option being\nthe use of electronic laboratory notebooks 14 (ELN) interfaced with open-access database. 15\nNevertheless, the implementation of such tools requires significant time and investment. It\nalso requires to convince the chemistry community of the merits of gathering data in a\nmachine-readable format. Thus, we believe that showing the potentiality of a dataset derived\nfrom published reaction data to predict reaction yield would encourage chemists to embrace\nthe new technologies available. Such a change would benefit the whole chemistry community.\nTo address this, we built a literature-mined, open-access reaction dataset that focuses on\nthe Ni-catalyzed C\u2013O bond activation to form C\u2013C and C\u2013N bonds: the NiCOlit dataset. 16 It\ngathers more than two thousand peer-reviewed reactions with detailed experimental conditions.\nAs a singular literature representative dataset, NiCOlit stands as a benchmark for machine\nlearning prediction of chemical yields found in published reaction data.\n3\nFigure 1: (A) Chemical space of NiCOlit, (B) Diversity of NiCOlit in terms of coupling\npartners, substrates and ligands combinations, the color map is proportional to the number of\nreactions encountered for each combination.

Experimental determination of solubility is a time- and resource-intensive process and existing methods for in silico estimation of solubility are limited by their generality, speed, and accuracy. This work presents two models derived from the fastprop and chemprop architectures and trained on BigSolDB which are capable of predicting solubility at arbitrary temperatures for any small molecule in organic solvent. Both extrapolate to unseen solutes 2-3 times more accurately than the current state-of-the-art model and we demonstrate that they are approaching the aleatoric limit (0.5-1 logS), suggesting that further improvements in prediction accuracy require more accurate datasets. These models, collectively referred to as fastsolv, are open source, freely accessible via a Python package and web interface, highly reproducible, and up to 50 times faster than the next best alternative.\n\n## Keywords\n\n[solubility](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/search-dashboard?keywords=solubility)\n\n[deep learning](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/search-dashboard?keywords=deep%20learning)\n\n[aleatoric uncertainty](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/search-dashboard?keywords=%20aleatoric%20uncertainty)\n\n[QSPR](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/search-dashboard?keywords=QSPR)\n\n[machine learning](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/search-dashboard?keywords=machine%20learning)\n\n## Supplementary weblinks\n\n**Title**\n\n**Description**\n\n**Actions**\n\n**Title**\n\n![](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/_nuxt/img/Weblink.b642c15.svg)\n\nWeb interface for fastsolv\n\n**Description**\n\nWeb interface for fastsolv solubility model\n\n**Actions**\n\n[**View**](http://fastsolv.mit.edu/)\n\n**Title**\n\n![](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/_nuxt/img/Weblink.b642c15.svg)\n\nGitHub repository\n\n**Description**\n\nGitHub repository containing code to reproduce model results\n\n**Actions**\n\n[**View**](https://github.com/JacksonBurns/fastsolv)\n\n**Title**\n\n![](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/_nuxt/img/Weblink.b642c15.svg)\n\nPyPI package\n\n**Description**\n\nPackaged distribution of fastsolv model\n\n**Actions**\n\n[**View**](https://www.piwheels.org/project/fastsolv/)\n\n**Title**\n\n![](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/_nuxt/img/Weblink.b642c15.svg)\n\nModel checkpoints\n\n**Description**\n\nModel checkpoint files deposited on Zenodo\n\n**Actions**\n\n[**View**](https://zenodo.org/records/13943074)\n\n## Comments\n\nYou are signed in as .

However, even large property databases, such as the Dortmund Datenbank (DDB), only hold experimental data for the activity coefficients of 31000 binary systems, a tiny fraction of all possible molecular combinations.<a href=\"#cit2\"><sup><span>2</span></sup></a></span></p><p>To overcome the inherent lack of experimental data, predictive thermodynamic property models have been developed over recent decades for many molecular properties, <span>e.g.</span>, COSMO-RS,<a href=\"#cit3\"><sup><span>3</span></sup></a> COSMO-SAC,<a href=\"#cit4\"><sup><span>4</span></sup></a> SAFT-\u03b3 Mie,<a href=\"#cit5\"><sup><span>5</span></sup></a> and UNIFAC.<a href=\"#cit6\"><sup><span>6</span></sup></a> These models can predict thermodynamic properties with increasing accuracy and are therefore particularly beneficial for molecule mixtures with missing experimental data. However, despite the vital advantages of predictive thermodynamic models, these models come with shortcomings. For example, calculating the surface charges of molecules for COSMO models is time-consuming, whilst UNIFAC is limited to known functional groups parametrized to experimental data. Moreover, these physically based predictive models are still less accurate than experiments.<a href=\"#cit7\"><sup><span>7</span></sup></a></p>\n <p>Computationally efficient alternatives to physically based predictive models are data-driven models using machine learning. Machine learning is currently a rising topic in chemical engineering, as summarized in multiple recent reviews<a href=\"#cit8\"><sup><span>8\u201310</span></sup></a> that identify challenges in many areas such as optimal decision making, introduction and enforcing of physics, information and knowledge representation, and safety and trust.<a href=\"#cit11\"><sup><span>11</span></sup></a> The application of machine learning has also already led to recent advances in thermodynamic property prediction. Alshehri <span>et al.</span><a href=\"#cit12\"><sup><span>12</span></sup></a> developed a data-driven model to predict 25 pure component properties based on a Gaussian process. The developed model surpasses classical group contribution models in accuracy. Chen <span>et al.</span><a href=\"#cit13\"><sup><span>13</span></sup></a> use a transformer-convolutional model to predict the sigma profiles of pure components with high accuracy.</p>\n <p>To predict activity coefficients, matrix completion methods have been recently proposed that represent the limiting activity coefficient of binary mixtures as a matrix. In matrix completion methods, all mixtures are sorted into a solvent-by-solute matrix. Known mixtures are used to learn embeddings for each solvent/solute, which then can be used to fill the matrix by interpolating towards unknown combinations. Jirasek <span>et al.</span><a href=\"#cit14\"><sup><span>14</span></sup></a> proposed a matrix completion method to predict the limiting activity coefficients of binary mixtures at 298.15 K that exceeded the accuracy achieved by UNIFAC. Recently, Damay <span>et al.</span><a href=\"#cit15\"><sup><span>15</span></sup></a> extended the method of Jirasek <span>et al.</span><a href=\"#cit14\"><sup><span>14</span></sup></a> to capture temperature dependencies. The proposed model has a higher accuracy for the temperature-dependent prediction of limiting activity coefficients than UNIFAC. Chen <span>et al.</span><a href=\"#cit16\"><sup><span>16</span></sup></a> developed an approach to extend the UNIFAC-Il model<a href=\"#cit17\"><sup><span>17</span></sup></a> for predicting limiting activity coefficients in ionic liquids by combining matrix completion with convolutional networks. These proposed approaches exceed the accuracy of the widely employed UNIFAC model in predicting limiting activity coefficients. Moreover, matrix completion approaches do not require any characterization of the molecules to train the model and predict thermodynamic properties, as the model solely learns from the correlations within the matrix. However, their lack of molecular characterization prevents matrix completion methods from extrapolating beyond the space of molecules available for training. Recently, Sanchez Medina <span>et al.</span><a href=\"#cit18\"><sup><span>18</span></sup></a> developed a graph neural network to predict limiting activity coefficients at constant temperature. In principle, this graph neural network is capable of extrapolating to unknown solvents and solutes, but the extrapolatory capabilities of the network were not tested. Thus, it is still unclear how well machine learning methods can extrapolate out of the realm of training data onto unknown solutes and solvents.</p>\n <p>Here, we present a SMILES-to-property-transformer (SPT), a data-driven model with high accuracy for interpolation and extrapolation that can predict temperature-dependent limiting activity coefficients from nearly arbitrary SMILES, based on natural language processing and a transformer architecture.<a href=\"#cit19\"><sup><span>19</span></sup></a> Due to their ability to learn structural relationships, transformer models have recently shown to be successful in predicting the pure component properties of various molecules and pharmaceuticals.<a href=\"#cit20\"><sup><span>20,21</span></sup></a> However, transformer models require large amounts of training data, which is typically unavailable for thermodynamic properties from experiments.

Here, we demonstrate an on-demand synthesis platform based on a three-component reaction that delivers drug-like molecules. Miniaturization and automation enable the execution and analysis of 50,000 distinct reactions on a 3-microliter scale from 193 different substrates, producing the largest public reaction outcome dataset. With machine learning, we accurately predict the result of unknown reactions and analyze the impact of dataset size on model training, both enabling accurate outcome predictions even for unseen reactants and providing a sufficiently large dataset to critically evaluate emerging machine learning approaches to chemical reactivity.\n## INTRODUCTION\nAccurately predicting the outcome of organic reactions through data-driven methods remains an unmet challenge, chiefly due to the paucity of large, unbiased datasets that cover a meaningful range of molecular properties and structural diversity (1,2). Molecular assembly processes involving three or more components are uniquely suited to generating large libraries of organic molecules from a modest number of building blocks, rendering them ideal for producing the experimental data needed for evaluating and improving computational approaches to the prediction of reaction outcomes. For example, well-studied multicomponent reactions including Ugi condensations (3,4) constitute the basis for work at the forefront of miniaturized library generation (5).\nInspired by such processes, our group has reported Synthetic Fermentation\u2014the assembly of preformed building blocks into functionally and stereochemically rich oligomers without the need for exogenous reagents (6,7). We recognized that similar processes could be leveraged to yield more drug-like molecules through three-component couplings, enabling a miniaturized approach to the production of hundreds of thousands of compounds from a limited selection of starting materials. This approach presented the opportunity to generate an extensive dataset comprising the outcome of tens of thousands of unique reactant combinations, thereby establishing an ideal training set for machine learning\u2013assisted predictions of successful reactant combinations. The use of high-throughput experimentation to provide tailored datasets relevant to the prediction problem at hand has become a standard practice in the field (8\u201311), but it has remained limited to a few thousand reactions in total and rarely more than a few dozen different substates (12). Despite progress toward predicting the reaction outcome for unknown substrates (11\u201313), extrapolation on multiple reactant dimensions remains a substantial challenge. In addition, the small number of test data points in extrapolative settings often hampers rigorous evaluation of model predictions. Assembling a dataset on the order of tens of thousands of reactions would enable testing of unconfirmed hypotheses in the field, including what quantity of data is necessary for predictive models and the dependence of extrapolation ability on model type and dataset size.\nIn this study, we report an on-demand reaction platform that uses three-component assembly to conduct 50,000 reactions on the microliter scale, each using a unique combination of substrates. Analyzing all reaction mixtures using liquid chromatography\u2013high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS), we track the formation of eight different products for each combination, resulting in a reaction outcome dataset of unprecedented size comprising \\~40,000 reactant combinations, each with distinct products. Using machine learning, we accurately predict the reaction outcome for unseen reactant combinations and untested substrates. By investigating model performance at different dataset sizes, we can derive general conclusions for data efficiency of machine learning models in reaction prediction and the importance of training data generation.\n## RESULTS\n### Reaction development and automation\nIn this implementation of Synthetic Fermentation, we devised a three-component reaction where a potassium acyltrifluoroborate (KAT) initiator (**I**) reacts with 1 equiv of an isoxazolidine monomer (**M**) bearing a protecting group that reveals an \u03b1-keto acid. This reacts with a thiohydrazide (TH) or aminobenzenethiol (ABT) terminator (**T**) to give the final product ([Fig. 1A](#F1-61)and figs. S1 and S2). Notably, the reaction proceeds in aqueous buffer without additional reagents or catalysts and yields benign by-products. The reaction conditions and concentrations are ideal for dilution with buffer and direct-to-biology screens (6,14). To establish the synthetic scope and training set, we curated a building block collection initially comprising 78 initiators, 74 monomers, and 41 terminators (figs. S3 to S5). While some specialized building blocks were introduced to cover a broad set of motifs, most were readily made and have been previously reported (6,7,14\u201318). Three different initiator types (aliphatic, aromatic, and heteroaromatic), four different monomer types (\u03b1/\u03b2-substituted vis-\u00e0-vis the nitrogen, cis-substituted, and quaternary), and two terminator types (ABT and TH) give rise to an on-demand library of \\~236,000 products ([Fig. 1B](#F1-61)) that we call \u201cPRIME library\u201d\u2014i.e., the reactions to produce these structures can be executed immediately from the initially available stock of 193 ...",
