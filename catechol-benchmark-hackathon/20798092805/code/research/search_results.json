      "text": "Predicting reaction yields from solvent properties and other experimental conditions is essentially a regression problem that benefits from models able to capture both complex, nonlinear relationships and, when available, temporal or textual information about the reaction.  In recent studies, **long short\u2011term memory (LSTM) neural networks** have proved highly effective for time\u2011series sensor data collected during reactions; in a Buchwald\u2011Hartwig coupling dataset, an LSTM learned which sensor signals (e.g., colour, temperature, pressure) were most informative and achieved a mean absolute error of just\u202f1.2\u202f% for instantaneous yield predictions ([sciencedirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1093326322002352)).  When reactions are represented by SMILES strings, **encoder\u2011transformer architectures** combined with a regression head outperform traditional fingerprint\u2011based models, delivering \u201coutstanding\u201d performance on high\u2011throughput Suzuki\u2011Miyaura and Buchwald\u2011Hartwig datasets ([rxn4chemistry](https://rxn4chemistry.github.io/rxn_yields)).\n\nBeyond generic deep nets, **active representation\u2011learning methods** such as the RS\u2011Coreset framework can compress large reaction spaces while preserving the most predictive features, enabling accurate yield forecasts even with limited training data ([nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42004-025-01434-0)).  Because real\u2011world yield data are heavily skewed toward low\u2011yield reactions, treating the task as an **imbalanced regression problem** and applying simple cost\u2011sensitive reweighting markedly improves predictions for the high\u2011yield region that chemists care most about ([nd.edu](https://lucyinstitute.nd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/3589335.3651470.pdf)).  Benchmarks on the new Catechol solvent\u2011selection dataset also show that **few\u2011shot transfer learning, feature engineering, and active\u2011learning loops** can further boost performance when only a few solvent\u2011property measurements are available ([arxiv](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1)).\n\nIn practice, the most successful pipelines combine (1) chemically informed descriptors of solvents and conditions (e.g., physicochemical parameters, one\u2011hot encoded reagents), (2) a deep sequence model (LSTM for time\u2011series or transformer for SMILES) to capture nonlinear interactions, and (3) a training strategy that accounts for yield imbalance (cost\u2011sensitive loss or reweighting).  Classical regressors such as random forests or gradient\u2011boosted trees are still useful baselines, but the state\u2011of\u2011the\u2011art results consistently favor these deep\u2011learning\u2011centric approaches.",

      "text": "<div><div>\n \n <div><h2>Introduction</h2><div><p>The optimization of chemical reaction is a fundamental task that has numerous important applications in synthetic chemistry<sup><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s42004-025-01434-0#ref-CR1\">1</a>,<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s42004-025-01434-0#ref-CR2\">2</a></sup>. For example, we often need to adopt some new structures to investigate the classic reactions, such as Buchwald\u2013Hartwig coupling, for discovering novel molecules with new functions<sup><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s42004-025-01434-0#ref-CR3\">3</a></sup>. But the real performance caused by those new structures are usually unreported and also not easy to predict. In traditional optimization process, chemists usually need to consider a \u201creaction space\u201d which contains a set of reaction combinations with several critical conditions, such as different catalysts, ligands, additives, solvents and other components (Fig.\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s42004-025-01434-0#Fig1\">1A</a>). In the well-known Suzuki coupling dataset provided by Pfizer\u2019s group<sup><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s42004-025-01434-0#ref-CR4\">4</a></sup>, for example, the size of the reaction space is 5760\u2009=\u200915\u2009\u00d7\u200912\u2009\u00d7\u20098\u2009\u00d7\u20094. As an important optimization objective, reaction yield has been widely studied for evaluating experimental performance<sup><a href=\"#ref-CR5\">5</a>,<a href=\"#ref-CR6\">6</a>,<a href=\"#ref-CR7\">7</a>,<a href=\"#ref-CR8\">8</a>,<a href=\"#ref-CR9\">9</a>,<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s42004-025-01434-0#ref-CR10\">10</a></sup>, since it can reflect the quality of a reaction and reveal the underlying principles in chemistry. Therefore, when studying a new reaction system, it is urgently needed to understand the patterns of reaction yield and explore high-yield reaction combinations. However, this process often needs to take a large amount of experimental time, and moreover, the performance heavily relies on the expertise of the experimenter. As a consequence, some potentially viable reaction conditions are very likely to be overlooked. For example, Buchwald\u2019s group recommended only a limited range of conditions on Buchwald\u2013Hartwig coupling in their early research<sup><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s42004-025-01434-0#ref-CR11\">11</a>,<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s42004-025-01434-0#ref-CR12\">12</a></sup>, but they further discovered a series of important new combinations in the following study<sup><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s42004-025-01434-0#ref-CR13\">13</a></sup>.</p><div><figure><figcaption><b>Fig. 1: Reaction yield prediction framework for small-scale data.</b></figcaption><div><div><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s42004-025-01434-0/figures/1\"></a></div><p><b>A</b> Traditional yield optimization. <b>B</b> The overall framework of our model with RS-coreset.

HTE can significantly promote the experimental efficiency and reduce the workload for exploring a new reaction system. The favorable parallelization of HTE can also generate a sufficiently large amount of experimental data to support reaction optimization, and thus greatly decreases the chance of missing high-yield reaction combinations.</p><p>To effectively utilize the experimental data generated from HTE, several different machine learning (ML) based methodologies have been proposed. Machine learning is an active research subarea of Artificial Intelligence<sup><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s42004-025-01434-0#ref-CR18\">18</a></sup>. In general, the goal of machine learning is to learn some effective model from observed data, where the model can be applied to solve various tasks, e.g., classification and regression. In particular, machine learning techniques have been successfully applied to different fields of scientific research<sup><a href=\"#ref-CR19\">19</a>,<a href=\"#ref-CR20\">20</a>,<a href=\"#ref-CR21\">21</a>,<a href=\"#ref-CR22\">22</a>,<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s42004-025-01434-0#ref-CR23\">23</a></sup>. For example, we can exploit machine learning-assisted methods to address a variety of chemical tasks such as molecular design<sup><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s42004-025-01434-0#ref-CR24\">24</a>,<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s42004-025-01434-0#ref-CR25\">25</a></sup>, reaction prediction<sup><a href=\"#ref-CR26\">26</a>,<a href=\"#ref-CR27\">27</a>,<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s42004-025-01434-0#ref-CR28\">28</a></sup>, retrosynthetic analyses<sup><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s42004-025-01434-0#ref-CR29\">29</a>,<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s42004-025-01434-0#ref-CR30\">30</a></sup>, reaction condition optimization<sup><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s42004-025-01434-0#ref-CR31\">31</a>,<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s42004-025-01434-0#ref-CR32\">32</a></sup>, selectivity prediction<sup><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s42004-025-01434-0#ref-CR33\">33</a>,<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s42004-025-01434-0#ref-CR34\">34</a></sup>, etc. In the area of yield prediction, Doyle\u2019s group provided an open-source chemical reaction optimization tool based on the Bayesian method, and they validated their approach through the experiments involving Palladium-catalysed C-N coupling and C\u2013H functionalization system, Mitsunobu reaction and deoxyfluorination reaction of alcohols<sup><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s42004-025-01434-0#ref-CR6\">6</a></sup>. Recently, Denmark\u2019s group designed a machine learning tool to predict substrate-adaptive conditions for Palladium-catalyzed C\u2013N couplings, where the tool can be used to optimize reaction combinations within a large reaction space of 450,000 possible reactions<sup><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s42004-025-01434-0#ref-CR17\">17</a></sup>.</p><p>Most of the current studies on reaction yield prediction rely on large amounts of data provided by HTE equipment.

Multiple platforms, including tools for reaction prediction and synthesis planning based on machine learning, successfully became part of the organic chemists\u2019 daily laboratory, assisting in domain-specific synthetic problems. Unlike reaction prediction and retrosynthetic models, reaction yields models have been less investigated, despite the enormous potential of accurately predicting them. Reaction yields models, describing the percentage of the reactants that is converted to the desired products, could guide chemists and help them select high-yielding reactions and score synthesis routes, reducing the number of attempts. So far, yield predictions have been predominantly performed for high-throughput experiments using a categorical (one-hot) encoding of reactants, concatenated molecular fingerprints, or computed chemical descriptors. Here, we extend the application of natural language processing architectures to predict reaction properties given a text-based representation of the reaction, using an encoder transformer model combined with a regression layer. We demonstrate outstanding prediction performance on two high-throughput experiment reactions sets. An analysis of the yields reported in the open-source USPTO data set shows that their distribution differs depending on the mass scale, limiting the dataset applicability in reaction yields predictions.\nThis repository complements our studies on[predicting chemical reaction yields](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2632-2153/abc81d)(published in Machine Learning: Science and Technology) and[data augmentation and uncertainty estimation for yield predictions](https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv.13286741)(presented at the Machine Learning for Molecules Workshop at NeurIPS 2020).\n## Install[](#Install)\nAs the library is based on the chemoinformatics toolkit[RDKit](http://www.rdkit.org)it is best installed using the[Anaconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)package manager.

ACM, New\nYork, NY, USA, 4 pages. https://doi.org/10.1145/3589335.3651470\n1 INTRODUCTION\nRecent advancements in machine learning have introduced a para\u0002digm shift in the field of computational chemistry [5]. These break\u0002throughs have led to a diverse array of machine learning models\nthat now play critical roles in assisting chemists across a broad spec\u0002trum of tasks, including but not limited to retrosynthesis, product\nprediction, and drug discovery. Among this multifaceted landscape,\nthe prediction of reaction yields [1, 12, 13, 15, 17] emerges as an\nissue of paramount importance in the domain of synthesis planning,\nwhere complex molecules are synthesized through a sequence of\nreaction steps. Based on the empirical categorization, yields above\n67% are classified as high yields and those below 33% are classified\nas low yields [17]. In this context, the occurrence of a low-yield\nreaction within this sequence can drastically impact the feasibility\nand overall efficiency of the synthesis process. As a result, chemists\noften prioritize the accurate prediction of high-yield reactions.\nWhile the introduction of numerous yield prediction models\nhas indeed showcased improved performance across the entire\nyield range, the challenge of effectively enhancing performance for\nhigh-yield reactions remains an open problem [9]. In real-world\nscenarios, yield data often exhibits a highly imbalanced distribution,\nwith high yield values being much rarer than lower ones, despite\ntheir greater importance to chemists in synthesis planning. In this\npaper, we argue that the increased difficulty in predicting high-yield\nreactions stems from its limited availability of data samples, often due\nto unreacted starting materials and inherent ambiguities in the reac\u0002tion processes. Despite the presence of such data imbalance, existing\nyield prediction methods continue to treat different yield ranges\nequally with the false assumption of a balanced data distribution.\nTo gain a deeper insight into the field\u2019s actual progress, we\nconduct extensive experiments to benchmark six state-of-the-art\nyield prediction methods on three real-world datasets. Surprisingly,\nthe results become less impressive than claimed when we take\ndata imbalance into account. We discover that the overall good\nperformance across the entire yield spectrum primarily results from\n790\nWWW \u201924 Companion, May 13\u201317, 2024, Singapore, Singapore Yihong Ma et al.\nenhancing performance in areas with sufficient data, typically the\nlow-yield range, while overlooking the significant performance gap in\nunderrepresented high-yield regions. This finding has motivated us to\nrevisit reaction yield prediction and reformulate it as an imbalanced\nregression problem, a well-established topic in machine learning.\nUnlike imbalanced classification, reaction yield prediction in\u0002volves regression rather than classification, and there has been\nlimited exploration of addressing data imbalance in the regression\ncontext [11]. Most prior research on imbalanced regression has\ndirectly adapted the SMOTE algorithm [3] to regression settings\n[2, 14]. However, the continuous nature of target labels in regres\u0002sion tasks makes these adaptations less practical. A more intuitive\nsolution is to apply cost-sensitive re-weighting strategies [4, 7, 16]\nthat can be seamlessly combined with various regression models.\nWe demonstrate that incorporating these simple methods can sig\u0002nificantly enhance the performance of existing yield prediction\nmodels on underrepresented high-yield regions without sacrificing\nthe overall performance too much. We believe these findings have\nthe potential to redirect the future research direction in reaction\nyield prediction, benefiting both chemistry and machine learning\ncommunities.

However, chemical datasets are often inaccessible to the machine learning community as they tend to require cleaning, thorough understanding of the chemistry, or are simply not available. In this paper, we introduce a novel dataset for yield prediction, providing the first-ever transient flow dataset for machine learning benchmarking, covering over 1200 process conditions. While previous datasets focus on discrete parameters, our experimental set-up allow us to sample a large number of continuous process conditions, generating new challenges for machine learning models. We focus on solvent selection, a task that is particularly difficult to model theoretically and therefore ripe for machine learning applications. We showcase benchmarking for regression algorithms, transfer-learning approaches, feature engineering, and active learning, with important applications towards solvent replacement and sustainable manufacturing.\n## 1Introduction\nMachine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) have showcased enormous potential in empowering the world of the natural sciences: from famous examples such as AlphaFold for protein predictions> [\n[> 1\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib1)> ]\n, to fusion reactor control> [\n[> 2\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib2)> ]\n, disease detection> [\n[> 3\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib3)> ]\n, battery design> [\n[> 4\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib4)> ]\n, and material discovery> [\n[> 5\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib5)> ]\n, among many more. However, we seldom see the machine learning community benchmark new methods in physical science datasets, mostly due to the difficulty in cleaning real-world data, the need for interdisciplinary understanding to correctly benchmark, and most importantly, how expensive the data can be to produce, resulting in many datasets being locked behind closed doors by large companies.\nAIchemy ([https://aichemy.ac.uk](https://aichemy.ac.uk)) is an interdisciplinary UK hub with the mission of transforming the chemistry-AI interface via aiding the collaboration of chemists and AI researchers, as well as addressing gaps in data standards, curation, and availability for AI use. In partnership with SOLVE Chemistry ([https://www.solvechemistry.com](https://www.solvechemistry.com)), we present a first important step into addressing the dataset gap with the introduction of a new and unique open dataset for benchmarking low-data machine learning algorithms for chemistry.\nSolvent selection is one of the biggest challenges for chemical manufacturing, with solvents often being the main source of waste in the manufacturing process> [\n[> 6\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib6)> ]\n. Increased regulation on solvents and a drive to making process manufacturing more sustainable led to an interest in the discovery of greener solvents and for improved solvent replacement tools. However, most of the solvent replacement tools focus purely on learning unsupervised representations of solvents, with the hope that experimentalists can find solvents with similar properties to replace those with environmental concerns. A much stronger approach would consider the interaction of a variety of different solvents with a reaction of interest to directly predict reaction yields, in such a way that the best possible solvent can be selected according to a yield-sustainability trade-off.\nMachine learning approaches have been shown to be a powerful tool for the prediction of chemical reaction conditions. Success has been reported in retro-synthesis> [\n[> 7\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib7)> , [> 8\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib8)> ]\n, condition recommendations> [\n[> 9\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib9)> ]\n, product predictions> [\n[> 10\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib10)> , [> 11\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib11)> ]\n, among others. While yield prediction has proven to be more difficult due to large inconsistencies in procedure and data reporting> [\n[> 12\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib12)> ]\n, we have still seen promising yield prediction results for smaller and more carefully curated datasets> [\n[> 13\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib13)> , [> 14\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib14)> , [> 15\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib15)> , [> 16\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib16)> ]\n. However, these datasets lack the continuous reaction conditions, such as temperature and residence time, that are required to scale-up processes to practical manufacturing conditions.\nIn this paper, we release the first machine-learning-ready transient flow dataset, a framework that allows for quick and efficient screening of continuous reaction conditions. We specifically provide yield data over the uni-molecular allyl substituted catechol reaction, shown in Figure[1](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#S1.F1), with dense measurements across the residence time, temperature, and solvent space. We further showcase how this type ofkinetic dataposes new challenges to current machine learning methods for chemistry, and identify how the challenges can potentially be tackled by the community.\n![Refer to caption](extracted/6524982/figures/Project2_rxn.png)Figure 1:Data was gathered on the rearrangement of allyl substituted catechol. By subjecting the reaction mixture to high temperatures, we begin a cascade reaction forming multiple rearrangement products. We investigate the yield of the reaction for a range of different solvents. Product 1 was not observed and reacted immediately to form Product 2 and later 3.\n### 1.1Related works\nReaction datasets are common in chemistry research, but their suitability for machine learning benchmarking tends to be poor. This can be a result of improper formatting or documentation, incomplete information about reaction conditions or the experimental set-up, or the lack of machine readability, leading to limited usage by the ML community. However, some effort has been made to address this, with the biggest example being the creation of the Open Reaction Database (ORD)> [\n[> 17\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib17)> ]\n, a repository containing over 2M different reactions, many of which come from US patent data (USPTO)> [\n[> 18\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib18)> ]\n. However, the dataset falls short in some aspects, in particular with respect to machine learning readiness and data inconsistencies across reactions.\nORDerly> [\n[> 12\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib12)> ]\nallows for easy cleaning and preparation of ORD data, showing the promise of the dataset for forward and retro-synthetic prediction using transformers; however, it also shows that yield prediction cannot be done well due to data inconsistencies.> Schwaller et\u00a0al. [\n[> 13\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib13)> ]\ndrew similar conclusions when using the USPTO dataset, stating that reaction conditions such as temperature, concentrations, and duration have a significant effect on yield.

To facilitate molecular design, we integrated an interpretable\nheat-mapping algorithm named PIXIE (Predictive Insights and Xplainability\nfor Informed chemical space Exploration). PIXIE visualizes the influence\nof molecular substructures on predicted yields by leveraging fingerprint\nbit importances, providing synthetic chemists with a powerful tool\nfor the rational design of molecules. While heat mapping is an established\ntechnique, its integration with a machine-learning model tailored\nto the chemical space of C2-carboxylated 1,3-azoles represents a significant\nadvancement. This approach not only enables targeted exploration of\nthis underrepresented chemical space, fostering the discovery of new\nbioactive compounds, but also demonstrates the potential of combining\nthese methods for broader applications in other chemical domains.\n\n## 1\\. Introduction\n\nWhile carbon dioxide (CO2) is a key driver of climate\nchange,[1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#ref1) \u2212 [3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#ref3) it is also recognized as a versatile carbon source\nin organic chemistry due to its role as a C1 building block and its\nabundant availability and production.[4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#ref4) \u2212 [8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#ref8) Consequently, synthesis protocols that transform CO2 into\nvaluable molecules are of great interest.[5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#ref5) \u2212 [7](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#ref7), [9](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#ref9) \u2212 [14](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#ref14) Among these valuable molecules are 1,3-azoles, a prominent subgroup\nwithin the broader class of azoles.[15](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#ref15) 1,3-Azoles\nand their C2-carboxylated derivatives are already known to be relevant\nas anticoagulants, herbicides, fungicides, and aroma compounds.[16](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#ref16) \u2212 [18](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#ref18) C2-carboxylated 1,3-azoles could also enable new applications as\nprodrugs and propesticides, as well as in treatments for Bartter\u2019s\ndisease or breast cancer.[15](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#ref15)\n\nDespite\ntheir advantages, only about 20,000 C2-carboxylated azoles\nare commercially available, compared to almost 2.5 million C2-unsubstituted\n1,3-azoles (CAS SciFinder search in 07/2024; [Figure](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#fig1) [1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#fig1)).[15](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#ref15), [19](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#ref19) This highlights significant\npotential for expanding the chemical space of these compounds since\naccess to a broader variety of molecules facilitate the discovery\nof new bioactive compounds and, therefore, drugs.\n\n### Figure 1.\n\n[Open in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/figure/fig1/)\n\nNumber (in millions)\nof commercially available compounds that feature\na 1,3-azole substructure (with X = NR, O, S), excluding compounds\nwith a molecular weight exceeding 900 Da, as well as compounds containing\nmetal ions or isotopes.\n\nFelten et al. developed a mild, functional-group-tolerant\nsynthesis\nprotocol for the carboxylation of 1,3-azoles, followed by a subsequent\namide coupling reaction ( [Figure](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#fig2) [2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#fig2)).[19](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#ref19) The results of this\nprotocol were reported as liquid chromatography area percent (LCAP)\nyields. One data set from the study comprises 288 LCAP yields, obtained\nby combinatorially pairing 24 1,3-azoles (ten thiazoles, nine oxazoles,\nfive imidazoles) with 12 amines, see [Figure](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#fig2) [2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#fig2).

We also demonstrate that the model\nimplicitly learns a continuous numerical embedding of solvent and\nreagent species that captures their functional similarity.\n## Short abstract\nMachine learning model predicts conditions for organic synthesis\nreactions and quantifies solvent and reagent similarity.\n## Introduction\nRetrosynthetic planning\nis the process of proposing pathways to\nsynthesize target molecules from available starting chemicals, and\nhas demonstrated its importance and success in the chemical industry.[1](#ref1),[2](#ref2)While retrosynthesis traditionally requires extensive training and\nexpertise of a chemist, recent years have seen renewed interest in\ncomputer-assisted synthetic planning (CASP).[3](#ref3)\u2212[7](#ref7)With the application of powerful machine learning\ntechniques to large data sets of organic reactions like Reaxys[8](#ref8)and the USPTO database,[9](#ref9)there have been major advances both in searching for possible retrosynthetic\npathways[10](#ref10)\u2212[16](#ref16)and in evaluating the feasibility of the proposed reactions.[5](#ref5),[17](#ref17)\u2212[22](#ref22)\nWhile existing tools have been demonstrated to predict the\nlikelihood\nof success of reactions with good accuracy,[20](#ref20)one obstacle to experimentally validating computer-proposed reactions\nis the specification of reaction conditions, including chemical context\n(catalyst, reagent, solvent) and other operating conditions (e.g.,\ntemperature, pressure). In some cases, small changes in reaction conditions\ncan lead to drastically different reaction outcomes. Therefore, recent\nwork on reaction outcome prediction has started to include reaction\nconditions to improve the accuracy and specificity of predictions.[20](#ref20),[21](#ref21)More importantly, reaction conditions are necessary to evaluate\nopportunities for one-pot synthesis, telescoping in flow, and amenab...",
