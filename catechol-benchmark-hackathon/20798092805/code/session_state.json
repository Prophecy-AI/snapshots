      "query": "What machine learning techniques work best for predicting chemical reaction yields from solvent properties and reaction conditions?",
      "finding": "Predicting reaction yields from solvent properties and other experimental conditions is essentially a regression problem that benefits from models able to capture both complex, nonlinear relationships and, when available, temporal or textual information about the reaction.  In recent studies, **long short\u2011term memory (LSTM) neural networks** have proved highly effective for time\u2011series sensor data collected during reactions; in a Buchwald\u2011Hartwig coupling dataset, an LSTM learned which sensor signals (e.g., colour, temperature, pressure) were most informative and achieved a mean absolute error of just\u202f1.2\u202f% for instantaneous yield predictions ([sciencedirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1093326322002352)).  When reactions are represented by SMILES strings, **encoder\u2011transformer architectures** combined with a regression head outperform traditional fingerprint\u2011based models, delivering \u201coutstanding\u201d performance on high\u2011throughput Suzuki\u2011Miyaura and Buchwald\u2011Hartwig",

Recent chemistry\u2011focused work shows that the most reliable GP\u2011based BO pipelines combine **domain\u2011specific kernels** with rigorous model\u2011selection via **leave\u2011one\u2011out (LOO) cross\u2011validation**.  ChemBO, for example, implements a GP with several molecular kernels and introduces a novel **optimal\u2011transport\u2011based kernel** that directly encodes graph\u2011level information of reactants and products, dramatically improving prediction accuracy on very small organic\u2011molecule datasets\u202f([arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.01425)).  The open\u2011source GAUCHE library makes these kernels (graph, string, and bit\u2011vector kernels) readily available and integrates them with standard BO loops, allowing chemists to plug\u2011in the most expressive kernel for their reaction representation\u202f(",
