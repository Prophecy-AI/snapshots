      "strategy": "# Seed Prompt: Chemical Reaction Yield Prediction\n\n## Data Understanding\n**Reference notebooks for data characteristics:**\n- `exploration/eda.ipynb` - Contains full EDA: data shapes, target distributions, CV structure, solvent counts\n- Single solvent data: 656 samples, 24 unique solvents (leave-one-solvent-out CV = 24 folds)\n- Full/mixture data: 1227 samples, 13 unique ramps (leave-one-ramp-out CV = 13 folds)\n- Targets: SM, Product 2, Product 3 (yields in range 0-1, can slightly exceed 1)\n- Temperature range: 175-225\u00b0C, Residence Time: ~2-15 min\n\n## CRITICAL: Submission Structure Requirements\nThe submission MUST follow the exact template structure from the competition. Only the model definition line can be changed in the last three cells. The model class must implement:\n- `train_model(X_train, Y_train)` method\n- `predict(X_test)` method returning predictions\n\nThe utils.py file provides: `load_data()`, `load_features()`, `generate_leave_one_out_splits()`, `generate_leave_one_ramp_out_splits()`\n\n## STATE-OF-THE-ART APPROACH (MSE ~0.0039)\nRecent research (arXiv 2512.19530) achieved MSE of 0.0039 on this exact dataset using:\n- **Graph Attention Networks (GAT)** with molecular graph message-passing\n- **Differential Reaction Fingerprints (DRFP)** - 2048 features available in drfps_catechol_lookup.csv\n- **Mixture-aware solvent encodings** - continuous representation of solvent mixtures\n- Key insight: Explicit molecular graph message-passing and continuous mixture encoding are essential\n\n## Physics-Informed Feature Engineering (HIGHLY EFFECTIVE)\n\n### Arrhenius Kinetics Features\nChemical reaction rates follow Arrhenius kinetics. Transform raw features:\n- `inv_temp = 1000 / (Temperature + 273.15)` - Inverse temperature in Kelvin\n- `log_time = ln(Residence Time)` - Logarithm of time  \n- `interaction = inv_temp * log_time` - Kinetic interaction term\n\nThese physics-informed features significantly improve predictions by encoding the underlying chemistry.\n\n### Additional Feature Engineering\n- `Reaction_Energy = Temperature * Residence Time`\n- `B_Conc_Temp = SolventB% * Temperature` (for mixture data)\n- Polynomial features of temperature and time\n\n## Solvent Featurization\nAvailable pre-computed featurizations (use `load_features()` from utils):\n1. **spange_descriptors** (13 features) - Compact, interpretable: dielectric constant, ET(30), alpha, beta, pi*, SA, SB, SP, SdP, N, n, f(n), delta\n2. **acs_pca_descriptors** (5 features) - PCA-based from ACS Green Chemistry, very compact\n3. **drfps_catechol** (2048 features) - Differential reaction fingerprints, HIGH-DIMENSIONAL BUT POWERFUL\n4. **fragprints** (2133 features) - Fragment + fingerprint concatenation, high-dimensional\n\nFor mixed solvents, use weighted average: `features = A * (1-pct) + B * pct`\n\n**Recommendation:** DRFP features (2048-dim) showed best results in GNN benchmarks. Consider combining with Arrhenius features.\n\n## Chemical Symmetry (CRITICAL FOR MIXTURES)\n\n### Training Data Augmentation\nFor mixed solvents, a mixture of \"Solvent A + Solvent B\" is physically identical to \"Solvent B + Solvent A\". \n- Train on BOTH (A,B) and (B,A flipped) versions to double training data\n- This respects the physical symmetry of mixtures\n\n### Test Time Augmentation (TTA)\nDuring inference for mixed solvents:\n1. Predict with input as (A, B)\n2. Predict with input as (B, A) flipped\n3. Final prediction = (Pred1 + Pred2) / 2\n\nThis mathematically guarantees symmetry and reduces variance.\n\n## Model Architectures\n\n### Graph Neural Networks (BEST PERFORMANCE)\nGNNs with attention mechanisms achieve state-of-the-art:\n- Graph Attention Networks (GAT) for molecular graphs\n- Message-passing to capture solute-solvent interactions\n- Combine with DRFP features for best results\n\n### Neural Networks (MLP) - Strong Baseline\nArchitecture that works well:\n- Input BatchNorm\n- Hidden layers: [128, 128, 64] with BatchNorm, ReLU, Dropout(0.2)\n- Output: 3 neurons with Sigmoid activation (yields are 0-1)\n- Loss: MSELoss or HuberLoss (more robust to outliers)\n- Optimizer: Adam with lr=5e-4, weight_decay=1e-5\n- Scheduler: ReduceLROnPlateau (factor=0.5, patience=20)\n- Epochs: 300\n- Batch size: 32\n- Gradient clipping: max_norm=1.0\n\n### Gradient Boosting (LightGBM/XGBoost)\nAlternative approach with per-target regressors:\n- 3 separate models (one per target)\n- LightGBM: lr=0.03, max_depth=6, early_stopping=100 rounds\n- XGBoost: n_estimators=1500, lr=0.015, max_depth=6\n- Can achieve MSE as low as 0.001 on some folds\n\n### Gaussian Processes\nFor small datasets with LOO-CV, GPs with chemistry-aware kernels can be effective:\n- Use GAUCHE library for molecular kernels\n- Tune hyperparameters via LOO marginal likelihood\n- Good uncertainty quantification\n\n### Ensemble/Bagging\nBagging multiple models (e.g., 7 MLPs) and averaging predictions improves robustness.\nConsider stacking different model types (MLP + LightGBM + GP).\n\n## Advanced Techniques\n\n### Multi-Task Learning\nThe 3 targets (SM, Product 2, Product 3) are chemically related. Consider:\n- Shared hidden layers with task-specific heads\n- Multi-output models that learn correlations\n\n### Feature Concatenation\nCombine multiple featurizations:\n- DRFP (2048) + Arrhenius features (3) = powerful combination\n- Or: Spange (13) + ACS PCA (5) + Arrhenius features (3) = 21 features (compact)\n- Use PCA to reduce high-dimensional fingerprints if needed\n\n### Regularization\n- L2 regularization (weight_decay)\n- Dropout (0.2-0.3)\n- Early stopping based on validation loss\n\n## Post-Processing\n- Clip predictions to [0, 1] range\n- Optional: Normalize rows to sum to 1 (chemical constraint that yields should sum to ~1)\n\n## Imbalanced Regression Consideration\nYield data is often skewed toward low-yield reactions. Consider:\n- Cost-sensitive reweighting to improve high-yield predictions\n- HuberLoss instead of MSELoss for robustness to outliers\n- SMOGN or similar techniques for regression imbalance\n\n## Validation Strategy\nThe competition uses specific CV splits:\n- Single solvent: `generate_leave_one_out_splits()` - leaves one solvent out (24 folds)\n- Full data: `generate_leave_one_ramp_out_splits()` - leaves one solvent ramp out (13 folds)\n\nThis tests generalization to UNSEEN solvents, making it challenging. The model must learn transferable representations.\n\n## Key Techniques Summary (Priority Order)\n1. **DRFP features** (2048-dim differential reaction fingerprints) - PROVEN BEST\n2. **Physics-informed features** (Arrhenius kinetics: 1/T, ln(t), interaction) - PROVEN EFFECTIVE\n3. **Chemical symmetry** (data augmentation + TTA for mixtures) - PROVEN EFFECTIVE\n4. **Graph Neural Networks** with attention - STATE-OF-THE-ART\n5. **Bagging/ensemble** (average 5-7 models) - PROVEN EFFECTIVE\n6. **Robust loss** (HuberLoss)\n7. **Proper architecture** (BatchNorm, Dropout, Sigmoid output)\n8. **Learning rate scheduling** (ReduceLROnPlateau)\n\n## Reference Scores\n- Baseline MLP: ~0.1 MSE\n- With Arrhenius + Symmetry + Bagging: ~0.098 MSE (public kernel)\n- LightGBM best folds: ~0.001-0.004 MSE\n- **GNN + DRFP + mixture encoding: ~0.0039 MSE** (state-of-the-art)\n- **Target to beat: 0.0333**\n\n## Implementation Notes\n- Use torch.set_default_dtype(torch.double) for numerical stability\n- The model must work with pandas DataFrames (X_train, Y_train)\n- Predictions should be torch tensors or numpy arrays with shape [N, 3]\n- Order of targets: Product 2, Product 3, SM (check TARGET_LABELS in utils.py)\n- For DRFP features, they are sparse - consider sparse matrix handling\n",

      "feedback": "## What I Understood\n\nThe junior researcher implemented a baseline MLP model with physics-informed features (Arrhenius kinetics: 1/T, ln(t), interaction term), chemical symmetry handling (data augmentation + TTA for mixtures), and model bagging (3 MLPs). The approach follows best practices identified in the research phase, including Spange descriptors for solvent featurization, HuberLoss for robustness, and proper architecture (BatchNorm, Dropout, Sigmoid output). The local CV score of 0.011081 is significantly better than the target of 0.0333.\n\n## Technical Execution Assessment\n\n**Validation**: The CV methodology is sound - leave-one-solvent-out for single solvent data (24 folds) and leave-one-ramp-out for mixture data (13 folds). This correctly tests generalization to unseen solvents. Per-fold MSE varies from 0.0003 to 0.034, which is expected given different solvent difficulties.\n\n**Leakage Risk**: None detected. The model is trained fresh for each fold, features are computed correctly per-fold, and there's no global fitting of scalers or encoders on test data.\n\n**Score Integrity**: Verified. I independently recalculated the MSE from the submission file and actuals:\n- Single Solvent MSE: 0.010429 \u2713\n- Full Data MSE: 0.011429 \u2713\n- Overall MSE: 0.011081 \u2713\n\n**Code Quality**: The implementation is clean and follows good practices. Seeds are not explicitly set for reproducibility, but this is a minor issue. The code executed successfully.\n\nVerdict: **TRUSTWORTHY** (with one critical compliance issue below)\n\n## Strategic Assessment\n\n**Approach Fit**: Excellent. The physics-informed features (Arrhenius kinetics) directly encode the underlying chemistry of reaction rates. The symmetry handling for mixtures is chemically correct. Using Spange descriptors (13 features) is a reasonable starting point.\n\n**Effort Allocation**: Good initial baseline. The researcher correctly prioritized:\n1. Physics-informed feature engineering (high leverage)\n2. Chemical symmetry handling (domain-specific insight)\n3. Robust architecture (BatchNorm, Dropout, HuberLoss)\n\n**Assumptions**: \n- Linear mixing of solvent features for mixtures (reasonable approximation)\n- Spange descriptors capture relevant solvent properties (validated in literature)\n- 3 models for bagging (could be increased)\n\n**Blind Spots**:\n1. **DRFP features (2048-dim)** - The strategy notes mention these achieved state-of-the-art results (MSE ~0.0039) but haven't been tried yet\n2. **More bagging** - Reference kernel uses 7 models, current uses 3\n3. **More epochs** - Reference uses 300 epochs, current uses 200\n4. **LightGBM/XGBoost** - Alternative model families that achieved MSE as low as 0.001 on some folds\n\n**Trajectory**: Very promising! The score of 0.011 is already 3x better than the target (0.0333). However, the state-of-the-art is reportedly 0.0039, suggesting significant room for improvement.\n\n## What's Working\n\n1. **Physics-informed features** - The Arrhenius kinetics features (1/T, ln(t), interaction) are highly effective\n2. **Chemical symmetry handling** - Data augmentation + TTA for mixtures is correctly implemented\n3. **Robust architecture** - BatchNorm, Dropout, HuberLoss, Sigmoid output all contribute to stability\n4. **Clean implementation** - Code is well-organized and follows the model interface requirements\n\n## Key Concerns\n\n### \ud83d\udea8 CRITICAL: Notebook Structure Non-Compliance\n\n**Observation**: The current notebook does NOT follow the competition template structure. The competition explicitly requires:\n- The last 3 cells must be EXACTLY as in the template\n- Only the model definition line (`model = MLPModel()`) can be changed\n- The template cells have specific \"DO NOT CHANGE\" comments\n\nThe current notebook has:\n- Different cell organization\n- Additional MSE calculation code\n- Different variable names (submission_single vs submission_single_solvent)\n\n**Why it matters**: This submission will likely be INVALID according to competition rules. The competition states: \"In order to ensure fair participation among all competitors, the submission must have the same last three cells as in the notebook template.\"\n\n**Suggestion**: Restructure the notebook to:\n1. Define all model classes and featurizers in earlier cells\n2. Use the EXACT last 3 cells from the template\n3. Only change the model definition line to `model = BaselineMLP(data='single')` and `model = BaselineMLP(data='full')`\n\n### Medium Priority: Unexplored High-Leverage Improvements\n\n**Observation**: The strategy notes mention DRFP features (2048-dim) achieved MSE of 0.0039 in GNN benchmarks, but these haven't been tried.\n\n**Why it matters**: There's potentially a 3x improvement available (0.011 \u2192 0.004) by using better features.\n\n**Suggestion**: Try DRFP features either alone or combined with Arrhenius features. May need dimensionality reduction (PCA) to handle the 2048 dimensions.\n\n### Low Priority: Suboptimal Hyperparameters\n\n**Observation**: Using 3 models and 200 epochs vs. reference kernel's 7 models and 300 epochs.\n\n**Why it matters**: More bagging and training could improve stability and performance.\n\n**Suggestion**: Increase to 5-7 models and 250-300 epochs for the final submission.\n\n## Top Priority for Next Experiment\n\n**RESTRUCTURE THE NOTEBOOK TO COMPLY WITH COMPETITION TEMPLATE**\n\nThis is non-negotiable. The current notebook structure will result in an invalid submission. The model implementation is excellent, but it needs to be packaged correctly:\n\n1. Move all model/featurizer class definitions to earlier cells\n2. Copy the EXACT last 3 cells from the template\n3. Only modify the model definition lines:\n   - Cell -3: `model = BaselineMLP(data='single', n_models=3)`\n   - Cell -2: `model = BaselineMLP(data='full', n_models=3)`\n\nOnce compliance is fixed, consider trying DRFP features for potentially significant improvement.\n",
