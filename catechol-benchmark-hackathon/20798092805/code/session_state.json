      "strategy": "# Seed Prompt: Chemical Reaction Yield Prediction\n\n## Data Understanding\n**Reference notebooks for data characteristics:**\n- `exploration/eda.ipynb` - Contains full EDA: data shapes, target distributions, CV structure, solvent counts\n- Single solvent data: 656 samples, 24 unique solvents (leave-one-solvent-out CV = 24 folds)\n- Full/mixture data: 1227 samples, 13 unique ramps (leave-one-ramp-out CV = 13 folds)\n- Targets: SM, Product 2, Product 3 (yields in range 0-1, can slightly exceed 1)\n- Temperature range: 175-225\u00b0C, Residence Time: ~2-15 min\n\n## CRITICAL: Submission Structure Requirements\nThe submission MUST follow the exact template structure from the competition. Only the model definition line can be changed in the last three cells. The model class must implement:\n- `train_model(X_train, Y_train)` method\n- `predict(X_test)` method returning predictions\n\nThe utils.py file provides: `load_data()`, `load_features()`, `generate_leave_one_out_splits()`, `generate_leave_one_ramp_out_splits()`\n\n## STATE-OF-THE-ART APPROACH (MSE ~0.0039)\nRecent research (arXiv 2512.19530) achieved MSE of 0.0039 on this exact dataset using:\n- **Graph Attention Networks (GAT)** with molecular graph message-passing\n- **Differential Reaction Fingerprints (DRFP)** - 2048 features available in drfps_catechol_lookup.csv\n- **Mixture-aware solvent encodings** - continuous representation of solvent mixtures\n- Key insight: Explicit molecular graph message-passing and continuous mixture encoding are essential\n\n## Physics-Informed Feature Engineering (HIGHLY EFFECTIVE)\n\n### Arrhenius Kinetics Features\nChemical reaction rates follow Arrhenius kinetics. Transform raw features:\n- `inv_temp = 1000 / (Temperature + 273.15)` - Inverse temperature in Kelvin\n- `log_time = ln(Residence Time)` - Logarithm of time  \n- `interaction = inv_temp * log_time` - Kinetic interaction term\n\nThese physics-informed features significantly improve predictions by encoding the underlying chemistry.\n\n### Additional Feature Engineering\n- `Reaction_Energy = Temperature * Residence Time`\n- `B_Conc_Temp = SolventB% * Temperature` (for mixture data)\n- Polynomial features of temperature and time\n\n## Solvent Featurization\nAvailable pre-computed featurizations (use `load_features()` from utils):\n1. **spange_descriptors** (13 features) - Compact, interpretable: dielectric constant, ET(30), alpha, beta, pi*, SA, SB, SP, SdP, N, n, f(n), delta\n2. **acs_pca_descriptors** (5 features) - PCA-based from ACS Green Chemistry, very compact\n3. **drfps_catechol** (2048 features) - Differential reaction fingerprints, HIGH-DIMENSIONAL BUT POWERFUL\n4. **fragprints** (2133 features) - Fragment + fingerprint concatenation, high-dimensional\n\nFor mixed solvents, use weighted average: `features = A * (1-pct) + B * pct`\n\n**Recommendation:** DRFP features (2048-dim) showed best results in GNN benchmarks. Consider combining with Arrhenius features.\n\n## Chemical Symmetry (CRITICAL FOR MIXTURES)\n\n### Training Data Augmentation\nFor mixed solvents, a mixture of \"Solvent A + Solvent B\" is physically identical to \"Solvent B + Solvent A\". \n- Train on BOTH (A,B) and (B,A flipped) versions to double training data\n- This respects the physical symmetry of mixtures\n\n### Test Time Augmentation (TTA)\nDuring inference for mixed solvents:\n1. Predict with input as (A, B)\n2. Predict with input as (B, A) flipped\n3. Final prediction = (Pred1 + Pred2) / 2\n\nThis mathematically guarantees symmetry and reduces variance.\n\n## Model Architectures\n\n### Graph Neural Networks (BEST PERFORMANCE)\nGNNs with attention mechanisms achieve state-of-the-art:\n- Graph Attention Networks (GAT) for molecular graphs\n- Message-passing to capture solute-solvent interactions\n- Combine with DRFP features for best results\n\n### Neural Networks (MLP) - Strong Baseline\nArchitecture that works well:\n- Input BatchNorm\n- Hidden layers: [128, 128, 64] with BatchNorm, ReLU, Dropout(0.2)\n- Output: 3 neurons with Sigmoid activation (yields are 0-1)\n- Loss: MSELoss or HuberLoss (more robust to outliers)\n- Optimizer: Adam with lr=5e-4, weight_decay=1e-5\n- Scheduler: ReduceLROnPlateau (factor=0.5, patience=20)\n- Epochs: 300\n- Batch size: 32\n- Gradient clipping: max_norm=1.0\n\n### Gradient Boosting (LightGBM/XGBoost)\nAlternative approach with per-target regressors:\n- 3 separate models (one per target)\n- LightGBM: lr=0.03, max_depth=6, early_stopping=100 rounds\n- XGBoost: n_estimators=1500, lr=0.015, max_depth=6\n- Can achieve MSE as low as 0.001 on some folds\n\n### Gaussian Processes\nFor small datasets with LOO-CV, GPs with chemistry-aware kernels can be effective:\n- Use GAUCHE library for molecular kernels\n- Tune hyperparameters via LOO marginal likelihood\n- Good uncertainty quantification\n\n### Ensemble/Bagging\nBagging multiple models (e.g., 7 MLPs) and averaging predictions improves robustness.\nConsider stacking different model types (MLP + LightGBM + GP).\n\n## Advanced Techniques\n\n### Multi-Task Learning\nThe 3 targets (SM, Product 2, Product 3) are chemically related. Consider:\n- Shared hidden layers with task-specific heads\n- Multi-output models that learn correlations\n\n### Feature Concatenation\nCombine multiple featurizations:\n- DRFP (2048) + Arrhenius features (3) = powerful combination\n- Or: Spange (13) + ACS PCA (5) + Arrhenius features (3) = 21 features (compact)\n- Use PCA to reduce high-dimensional fingerprints if needed\n\n### Regularization\n- L2 regularization (weight_decay)\n- Dropout (0.2-0.3)\n- Early stopping based on validation loss\n\n## Post-Processing\n- Clip predictions to [0, 1] range\n- Optional: Normalize rows to sum to 1 (chemical constraint that yields should sum to ~1)\n\n## Imbalanced Regression Consideration\nYield data is often skewed toward low-yield reactions. Consider:\n- Cost-sensitive reweighting to improve high-yield predictions\n- HuberLoss instead of MSELoss for robustness to outliers\n- SMOGN or similar techniques for regression imbalance\n\n## Validation Strategy\nThe competition uses specific CV splits:\n- Single solvent: `generate_leave_one_out_splits()` - leaves one solvent out (24 folds)\n- Full data: `generate_leave_one_ramp_out_splits()` - leaves one solvent ramp out (13 folds)\n\nThis tests generalization to UNSEEN solvents, making it challenging. The model must learn transferable representations.\n\n## Key Techniques Summary (Priority Order)\n1. **DRFP features** (2048-dim differential reaction fingerprints) - PROVEN BEST\n2. **Physics-informed features** (Arrhenius kinetics: 1/T, ln(t), interaction) - PROVEN EFFECTIVE\n3. **Chemical symmetry** (data augmentation + TTA for mixtures) - PROVEN EFFECTIVE\n4. **Graph Neural Networks** with attention - STATE-OF-THE-ART\n5. **Bagging/ensemble** (average 5-7 models) - PROVEN EFFECTIVE\n6. **Robust loss** (HuberLoss)\n7. **Proper architecture** (BatchNorm, Dropout, Sigmoid output)\n8. **Learning rate scheduling** (ReduceLROnPlateau)\n\n## Reference Scores\n- Baseline MLP: ~0.1 MSE\n- With Arrhenius + Symmetry + Bagging: ~0.098 MSE (public kernel)\n- LightGBM best folds: ~0.001-0.004 MSE\n- **GNN + DRFP + mixture encoding: ~0.0039 MSE** (state-of-the-art)\n- **Target to beat: 0.0333**\n\n## Implementation Notes\n- Use torch.set_default_dtype(torch.double) for numerical stability\n- The model must work with pandas DataFrames (X_train, Y_train)\n- Predictions should be torch tensors or numpy arrays with shape [N, 3]\n- Order of targets: Product 2, Product 3, SM (check TARGET_LABELS in utils.py)\n- For DRFP features, they are sparse - consider sparse matrix handling\n",

      "finding": "Predicting reaction yields from solvent properties and other experimental conditions is essentially a regression problem that benefits from models able to capture both complex, nonlinear relationships and, when available, temporal or textual information about the reaction.  In recent studies, **long short\u2011term memory (LSTM) neural networks** have proved highly effective for time\u2011series sensor data collected during reactions; in a Buchwald\u2011Hartwig coupling dataset, an LSTM learned which sensor signals (e.g., colour, temperature, pressure) were most informative and achieved a mean absolute error of just\u202f1.2\u202f% for instantaneous yield predictions ([sciencedirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1093326322002352)).  When reactions are represented by SMILES strings, **encoder\u2011transformer architectures** combined with a regression head outperform traditional fingerprint\u2011based models, delivering \u201coutstanding\u201d performance on high\u2011throughput Suzuki\u2011Miyaura and Buchwald\u2011Hartwig",
