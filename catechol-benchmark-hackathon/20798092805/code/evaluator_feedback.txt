## What I Understood

The junior researcher conducted experiment 014 to test whether adjusting ensemble weights (MLP 0.7, LightGBM 0.3) would improve upon the baseline (0.6/0.4). The hypothesis was that since the [32,16] MLP has the best LB score (0.0932), giving it more weight might improve generalization. The result was slightly worse (CV 0.009012 vs 0.009004), confirming that the 0.6/0.4 weighting is near-optimal. This was a reasonable micro-optimization experiment, though the marginal difference (0.09%) is within noise.

## Technical Execution Assessment

**Validation**: Sound. The CV methodology correctly implements:
- Leave-one-solvent-out (24 folds) for single solvent data (656 samples)
- Leave-one-ramp-out (13 folds) for mixture data (1227 samples)
- Weighted average MSE calculation verified in notebook output

**Leakage Risk**: None detected. Each model is trained fresh per fold. StandardScaler is fit only on training data. Feature lookups (Spange, DRFP) are intrinsic molecular properties.

**Score Integrity**: Verified in notebook output:
- MLP 0.7, LightGBM 0.3: CV 0.009012
- Baseline (0.6/0.4): CV 0.009004 (from exp_013)
- Difference: 0.09% (within noise)

**Code Quality**: 
- Notebook executed successfully (~1.2 hours)
- Proper random seed setting
- Clean implementation

Verdict: **TRUSTWORTHY** - Results are valid and reproducible.

## Strategic Assessment

**Approach Fit**: This was a reasonable micro-optimization, but the 0.09% difference is within noise. The experiment confirms the 0.6/0.4 weighting is near-optimal, but this level of tuning is unlikely to move the needle on LB.

**Effort Allocation**: This experiment represents diminishing returns. The team has spent significant effort on:
1. Architecture simplification: [256,128,64] → [64,32] → [32,16] → [16] ✓ (valuable)
2. Feature engineering: Spange + DRFP + Arrhenius ✓ (valuable)
3. Ensemble composition: MLP + LightGBM ✓ (valuable)
4. Weight tuning: 0.6/0.4 vs 0.7/0.3 ✗ (marginal)

The weight tuning is the least impactful of these. The real bottleneck is the fundamental CV-LB gap (~9-10x).

**Critical Insight - The CV-LB Decorrelation**:

| Experiment | CV Score | LB Score | Ratio (LB/CV) |
|------------|----------|----------|---------------|
| exp_000 | 0.011081 | 0.09816 | 8.86x |
| exp_005 | 0.010430 | 0.09691 | 9.29x |
| exp_006 | 0.009749 | 0.09457 | 9.70x |
| exp_007 | 0.009262 | 0.09316 | **10.06x** (BEST LB) |
| exp_009 | 0.009192 | 0.09364 | 10.19x |

**Key observation**: The CV-LB ratio has been INCREASING as CV improves. Better local CV does NOT reliably predict better LB anymore. The [32,16] model (exp_007) has the best LB score (0.09316) despite not having the best CV.

**Assumptions Being Made**:
1. "Better CV ensemble will generalize better" - UNCERTAIN. The CV-LB decorrelation suggests this may not hold.
2. "The 0.6/0.4 weighting is optimal" - VALIDATED by this experiment.
3. "Template compliance is sufficient" - YES, exp_013 is compliant.

**Blind Spots**:
1. **No LB validation of the ensemble** - The compliant ensemble (exp_013) has not been submitted to LB yet.
2. **The target is unreachable** - Target 0.0333 is 2.8x better than best LB (0.09316). This is not achievable with tabular approaches.
3. **Submission strategy unclear** - With 5 submissions remaining, what's the plan?

## What's Working

1. **Template compliance achieved** ✅ - exp_013 follows the exact required structure
2. **Systematic experimentation** ✅ - The team has thoroughly explored the model space (14 experiments)
3. **Good documentation** ✅ - Experiment notes are detailed and informative
4. **Correct identification of optimal architecture** ✅ - [32,16] MLP is the sweet spot
5. **Ensemble approach is sound** ✅ - MLP + LightGBM provides model diversity

## Key Concerns

### HIGH PRIORITY: No LB Validation of Ensemble
**Observation**: The compliant ensemble (exp_013, CV 0.009004) has not been submitted to LB.

**Why it matters**: Given the CV-LB decorrelation, we don't know if the ensemble will outperform the [32,16] model alone (LB 0.09316). The [16] model had better CV but WORSE LB than [32,16].

**Suggestion**: Submit exp_013 to LB when submissions reset. This is the most important next step.

### MEDIUM PRIORITY: Diminishing Returns on Micro-Optimization
**Observation**: The 0.7/0.3 vs 0.6/0.4 experiment showed only 0.09% difference - within noise.

**Why it matters**: Time spent on micro-optimizations like weight tuning is unlikely to improve LB. The fundamental bottleneck is the CV-LB gap.

**Suggestion**: Stop micro-optimizing. Focus on strategic decisions about final submission.

### LOW PRIORITY: Target is Unreachable
**Observation**: Target is 0.0333, best LB is 0.09316 (2.8x gap).

**Why it matters**: The tabular approach has reached its ceiling. GNN architectures would be needed to approach the target.

**Suggestion**: Accept the current ceiling and focus on maximizing the final submission quality.

## Top Priority for Next Experiment

**STRATEGIC DECISION: Submit exp_013 to LB and Decide Final Strategy**

The team has done excellent work optimizing within the constraints of tabular ML. The key question now is: **Does the ensemble (exp_013) beat the [32,16] model (exp_007) on LB?**

**When submissions reset:**
1. **Submit exp_013** (compliant ensemble, CV 0.009004) to LB
2. **Compare to exp_007** (LB 0.09316)
3. **If ensemble is better**: Use ensemble for final submission
4. **If ensemble is worse**: Create compliant version of [32,16] alone for final submission

**Why this matters**: The CV-LB decorrelation means we can't trust CV improvements to translate to LB. We need LB validation before committing to a final strategy.

**Reality Check**: The target of 0.0333 is not achievable with the current approach. The best realistic outcome is ~0.093 on LB. The team has done excellent work - the [32,16] model (LB 0.09316) is competitive for tabular approaches. The GNN benchmark (0.0039) suggests graph-based approaches are needed to reach the target.

**Key Learning from This Experiment Series**:
1. Simpler models generalize better for this problem ([32,16] > [64,32] > [256,128,64])
2. CV-LB correlation breaks down as models improve
3. Template compliance is mandatory - always verify before submission
4. Ensemble weight tuning provides marginal benefit (0.09%)
5. The fundamental bottleneck is leave-one-solvent-out generalization, not model architecture
