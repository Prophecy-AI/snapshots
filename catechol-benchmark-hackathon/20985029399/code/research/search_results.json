      "text": "Gaussian\u202fProcess Regression (GPR) is especially attractive for chemistry when only a few hundred high\u2011quality measurements are available, because it provides calibrated uncertainty estimates that can guide experiment selection.  The most effective strategies combine **problem\u2011specific kernels**, **solvent descriptors**, and **data\u2011efficient learning schemes**.  \n\n1. **Kernel design that respects molecular and solvent structure** \u2013 Graph\u2011based kernels (e.g., the molecular\u2011graph kernel used to predict aqueous solvation free energies) capture the topology of the solute while allowing explicit solvent contributions to be added as separate features such as dielectric constant, polarity or Hansen parameters\u202f([RSC\u202f2021](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2021/cp/d1cp04475c)).  The GAUCHE library extends this idea with >30 bespoke kernels for SMILES strings, fingerprints and graphs, and includes utilities for encoding solvent\u2011related descriptors, making it straightforward to build a GP that jointly models solute structure and solvent environment\u202f([arXiv\u202f2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04450);\u202f[GAUCHE docs\u202f2023](https://leojklarner.github.io/gauche)).  \n\n2. **Small\u2011data tricks** \u2013 Multi\u2011task or hierarchical GPs share statistical strength across related reactions or solvents, while transfer\u2011learning / few\u2011shot approaches (e.g., the \u201cCatechol Benchmark\u201d for solvent selection) demonstrate that a modest set of solvent\u2011feature vectors can be leveraged to fine\u2011tune a pre\u2011trained GP, dramatically reducing the number of required experiments\u202f([arXiv\u202f2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v2)).  Active\u2011learning loops that query the points with highest predictive variance further concentrate measurements on the most informative solvent\u2013solute combinations.  \n\n3. **Practical workflow** \u2013 Start by assembling a feature matrix that concatenates a molecular representation (graph or fingerprint) with a compact set of solvent descriptors (dielectric constant, dipolarity, hydrogen\u2011bonding parameters).  Fit a GP using a kernel that multiplies a graph kernel by a radial\u2011basis\u2011function kernel on the solvent features; libraries such as GAUCHE provide ready\u2011made implementations and Bayesian\u2011optimization tools to suggest the next experiment.  The ChemRev overview of GPR highlights that these choices\u2014kernel engineering, uncertainty\u2011driven sampling, and hierarchical modelling\u2014consistently improve predictive accuracy on datasets of <\u202f200 points\u202f([ACS\u202fChemRev\u202f2021](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.chemrev.1c00022)).  \n\nTogether, these approaches let practitioners extract maximal information from small chemistry datasets while explicitly accounting for solvent effects.",

In this work, we present a machine learning (ML) model that can learn and predict the aqueous solvation free energy of an organic molecule using the Gaussian process regression method based on a new molecular graph kernel. To investigate the performance of the ML model for electrostatic interaction, the nonpolar interaction contribution of the solvent and the conformational entropy of the solute in the solvation free energy, three data sets with implicit or explicit water solvent models, and contribution of the conformational entropy of the solute are tested. We demonstrate that our ML model can predict the solvation free energy of molecules at chemical accuracy with a mean absolute error of less than 1 kcal mol\u22121 for subsets of the QM9 dataset and the Freesolv database. To solve the general data scarcity problem for a graph-based ML model, we propose a dimension reduction algorithm based on the distance between molecular graphs, which can be used to examine the diversity of the molecular data set. It provides a promising way to build a minimum training set to improve prediction for certain test sets where the space of molecular structures is predetermined.\n\n![Graphical abstract: Graphical Gaussian process regression model for aqueous solvation free energy prediction of organic molecules in redox flow batteries](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/Image/Get?imageInfo.ImageType=GA&imageInfo.ImageIdentifier.ManuscriptID=D1CP04475C&imageInfo.ImageIdentifier.Year=2021)\n\nYou have access to this article\n\n![](https://www.rsc-cdn.org/pubs-core/2022.0.159/content/NewImages/Ajax-GA-Loader.gif)\nPlease wait while we load your content...\nSomething went wrong.

This is true for <i>materials</i>\u2014crystals, glasses, nanostructures, composites\u2014as well as for <i>molecules</i>, from the simplest industrial feedstocks to entire proteins. And with the often-quoted role of chemistry as the \u201ccentral science\u201d, (1,2) its emphasis on atomistic understanding has a bearing on many neighboring disciplines: candidate drug molecules are made by synthetic chemists based on an atomic-level knowledge of reaction mechanisms; functional materials for technological applications are characterized on a range of length scales, which begins with increasingly accurate information about where exactly the atoms are located relative to one another in three-dimensional space.</p><p>Research progress in structural chemistry has largely been driven by advances in experimental characterization techniques, from landmark studies in X-ray and neutron crystallography to novel electron microscopy techniques which make it possible to visualize individual atoms directly. Complementing these new developments, detailed and realistic structural insight is also increasingly gained from computer simulations. Today, chemists (together with materials scientists) are heavy users of large-scale supercomputing facilities, and the computationally guided discovery of previously unknown molecules and materials has come within reach. (3\u22128)</p><p>Computations based on the quantum mechanics of electronic structure, currently most commonly within the framework of density-functional theory (DFT), are widely used to study structures of molecules and materials and to predict a range of atomic-scale properties. (9\u221211) Two approaches are of note here. One is the prediction of atomically resolved physical quantities, e.g., isotropic chemical shifts, \u03b4<sub>iso</sub>, that can be used to simulate NMR spectra with a large degree of realism (12)\u2014thereby making it possible to corroborate or falsify a candidate structural model or to deconvolute experimentally measured spectra. The other central task is the determination of atomistic structure itself, achieved through molecular dynamics (MD), structural optimization, and other quantum-mechanically driven techniques. Many implementations of DFT exist and are widely used, and their consistency has been demonstrated in a comprehensive community-wide exercise. (13)</p><p>Electronic-structure computations are expensive, in terms of both their absolute resource requirements and their scaling behavior with the number of atoms, <i>N</i>. For DFT, the scaling is typically in the most common implementations; see ref (14) for the current status of a linear-scaling implementation. Routine use is therefore limited to a few thousand atoms at most for DFT single-point evaluations, to a few hundred atoms for DFT-driven \u201cab initio\u201d MD, and to even fewer for high-level wave function theory methods such as coupled cluster (CC) theory or quantum Monte Carlo (QMC). The latter techniques offer an accuracy far beyond standard DFT, and they are beginning to become accessible not only for isolated molecules but also for condensed phases. However, running MD with these methods requires substantial effort and is currently largely limited to proof-of-principle simulations. (15\u221217) For studies that predict atomistic properties, such as NMR shifts, derived from the wave function, a new electronic-structure computation has to be carried out every time a new structure is considered, again incurring large computational expense.</p><p>In the past decade, machine learning (ML) techniques have become a popular alternative, aiming to make the same type of predictions using an approximate or surrogate model, while requiring only a small fraction of the computational costs. There is practical interest in being able to access much more realistic descriptions of structurally complex systems (e.g., disordered and amorphous phases) than currently feasible, as well as a wider chemical space (e.g., scanning large databases of candidate materials rather than just a few selected ones). There is also a fundamental interest in the question of how one might \u201cteach\u201d chemical and physical properties to a computer algorithm which is inherently chemically agnostic and in the relationship of established chemical rules with the outcome of purely data-driven techniques. (19) We may direct the reader to high-level overviews of ML methods in the physical sciences by Butler et al., (20) Himanen et al., (21) and Batra et al., (22) to more detailed discussions of various technical aspects, (23\u221226) and to a physics-oriented review that places materials science in the context of many other topics for which ML is currently being used. (27)</p><p>The use of ML in computational chemistry, materials science, and also condensed-matter physics is often focused on the regression (fitting) of atomic properties, that is, the functional dependence of a given quantity on the local structural environment. For the case of force fields and interatomic potentials, there are a number of general overview articles (28\u221231) and examples of recent benchmark studies. (32,33) There are also specialized articles that offer more detailed introductions. (34\u221238)</p><p>In the present work, we review the application of Gaussian process regression (GPR) to computational chemistry, with an emphasis on the development of the methodology over the past decade. <a href=\"#fig1\">Figure </a><a href=\"#fig1\">1</a> provides an overview of the central concepts. Given early successes, there is significant emphasis on the construction of accurate, linear-scaling force-field models and the new chemical and physical insights that can be gained by using them. We also survey, more broadly, methodology and emerging applications concerning the \u201clearning\u201d of general atomistic properties that are of interest for chemical and materials research. Quantum-mechanical properties, including the eletronic energy, are inherently nonlocal, but the degree to which local approximations, taking account of the immediate neighborhood of an atom, can be used will be of central importance. It is hoped that the present work\u2014indeed the entire thematic issue in which it appears\u2014will provide guidance and inspiration for research in this quickly evolving field and that it will help advance the transition of the methodology from relatively specialized to much more widely used.</p></div><div><div><p><h2>2.

However, chemical datasets are often inaccessible to the machine learning community as they tend to require cleaning, thorough understanding of the chemistry, or are simply not available. In this paper, we introduce a novel dataset for yield prediction, providing the first-ever transient flow dataset for machine learning benchmarking, covering over 1200 process conditions. While previous datasets focus on discrete parameters, our experimental set-up allow us to sample a large number of continuous process conditions, generating new challenges for machine learning models. We focus on solvent selection, a task that is particularly difficult to model theoretically and therefore ripe for machine learning applications. We showcase benchmarking for regression algorithms, transfer-learning approaches, feature engineering, and active learning, with important applications towards solvent replacement and sustainable manufacturing.\n## 1Introduction\nMachine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) have showcased enormous potential in empowering the world of the natural sciences: from famous examples such as AlphaFold for protein predictions> [\n> jumper2021highly\n> ]\n, to fusion reactor control> [\n> degrave2022magnetic\n> ]\n, disease detection> [\n> zhou2023foundation\n> ]\n, battery design> [\n> folch2023combining\n> ]\n, and material discovery> [\n> raccuglia2016machine\n> ]\n, among many more. However, we seldom see the machine learning community benchmark new methods in physical science datasets, mostly due to the difficulty in cleaning real-world data, the need for interdisciplinary understanding to correctly benchmark, and most importantly, how expensive the data can be to produce, resulting in many datasets being locked behind closed doors by large companies.\nAIchemy ([https://aichemy.ac.uk](https://aichemy.ac.uk)) is an interdisciplinary UK hub with the mission of transforming the chemistry-AI interface via aiding the collaboration of chemists and AI researchers, as well as addressing gaps in data standards, curation, and availability for AI use. In partnership with SOLVE Chemistry ([https://www.solvechemistry.com](https://www.solvechemistry.com)), we present a first important step into addressing the dataset gap with the introduction of a new and unique open dataset for benchmarking low-data machine learning algorithms for chemistry.\nSolvent selection is one of the biggest challenges for chemical manufacturing, with solvents often being the main source of waste in the manufacturing process> [\n> constable2007perspective\n> ]\n. Increased regulation on solvents and a drive to making process manufacturing more sustainable led to an interest in the discovery of greener solvents and for improved solvent replacement tools. However, most of the solvent replacement tools focus purely on learning unsupervised representations of solvents, with the hope that experimentalists can find solvents with similar properties to replace those with environmental concerns. A much stronger approach would consider the interaction of a variety of different solvents with a reaction of interest to directly predict reaction yields, in such a way that the best possible solvent can be selected according to a yield-sustainability trade-off.\nMachine learning approaches have been shown to be a powerful tool for the prediction of chemical reaction conditions. Success has been reported in retro-synthesis> [\n> karpov2019transformer\n> , > tetko2020state\n> ]\n, condition recommendations> [\n> gao2018using\n> ]\n, product predictions> [\n> coley2019graph\n> , > tu2022permutation\n> ]\n, among others. While yield prediction has proven to be more difficult due to large inconsistencies in procedure and data reporting> [\n> wigh2024orderly\n> ]\n, we have still seen promising yield prediction results for smaller and more carefully curated datasets> [\n> schwaller2021prediction\n> , > griffiths2023gauche\n> , > rankovic2024bayesian\n> , > rankovic2025gollum\n> ]\n. However, these datasets lack the continuous reaction conditions, such as temperature and residence time, that are required to scale-up processes to practical manufacturing conditions.\nIn this paper, we release the first machine-learning-ready transient flow dataset, a framework that allows for quick and efficient screening of continuous reaction conditions. We specifically provide yield data over the uni-molecular allyl substituted catechol reaction, shown in Figure[1](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v2#S1.F1), with dense measurements across the residence time, temperature, and solvent space. We answer the call for more flow chemistry reaction data> [\n> deadman2025wanted\n> ]\n, further showcase how this type ofkinetic dataposes new challenges to current machine learning methods for chemistry, and identify potential solutions.\n![Refer to caption](figures/Project2_rxn.png)Figure 1:Data was gathered on the rearrangement of allyl substituted catechol. By subjecting the reaction mixture to high temperatures, we begin a cascade reaction forming multiple rearrangement products. We investigate the yield of the reaction for a range of different solvents. Product 1 was not observed and reacted immediately to form Product 2 and later 3.\n### 1.1Related works\nReaction datasets are common in chemistry research, but their suitability for machine learning benchmarking tends to be poor. This can be a result of improper formatting or documentation, incomplete information about reaction conditions or the experimental set-up, or the lack of machine readability, leading to limited usage by the ML community. However, some effort has been made to address this, with the biggest example being the creation of the Open Reaction Database (ORD)> [\n> kearnes2021open\n> ]\n, a repository containing over 2M different reactions, many of which come from US patent data (USPTO)> [\n> lowe2012extraction\n> ]\n. However, the dataset falls short in some aspects, in particular with respect to machine learning readiness and data inconsistencies across reactions.\nORDerly> [\n> wigh2024orderly\n> ]\nallows for easy cleaning and preparation of ORD data, showing the promise of the dataset for forward and retro-synthetic prediction using transformers; however, it also shows that yield prediction cannot be done well due to data inconsistencies.> schwaller2021prediction\ndrew similar conclusions when using the USPTO dataset, stating that reaction conditions such as temperature, concentrations, and duration have a significant effect on yield. The assumption that every reaction in the dataset is optimized for reaction parameters proved too loose, resulting in inaccurate predictive models for yield, and highlighting the importance of creating datasets with full (including potentially sub-optimal) reaction conditions.\nMore relevant to our work,> perera2018platform\nintroduced a dataset of 5760 Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reactions,> ahneman2018predicting\nintroduced a dataset of 3956 Buchwald\u2013Hartwig aminations, and> prieto2022accelerating\ninvestigated screening additives for Ni-catalysed reactions, all for the purposes of yield prediction.

Gaussian processes have long been a cornerstone of probabilistic machine learning, affording particular advantages for uncertainty quantification and Bayesian optimisation. Extending Gaussian processes to chemical representations, however, is nontrivial, necessitating kernels defined over structured inputs such as graphs, strings and bit vectors. By defining such kernels in GAUCHE, we seek to open the door to powerful tools for uncertainty quantification and Bayesian optimisation in chemistry. Motivated by scenarios frequently encountered in experimental chemistry, we showcase applications for GAUCHE in molecular discovery and chemical reaction optimisation.

We provide 30+ bespoke kernels for molecules, chemical reactions and proteins and illustrate how they can be used for Gaussian processes and Bayesian optimisation in 10+ easy-to-adapt tutorial notebooks.\n\n[Paper (NeurIPS 2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04450)\n\n# Overview [\\#](https://leojklarner.github.io/gauche/\\#overview)\n\nGeneral-purpose Gaussian process (GP) and Bayesian optimisation (BO) libraries do not cater for molecular representations. Likewise, general-purpose molecular machine learning libraries do not consider GPs and BO. To bridge this gap, GAUCHE provides a modular, robust and easy-to-use framework of 30+ parallelisable and batch-GP-compatible implementations of string, fingerprint and graph kernels that operate on a range of widely-used molecular representations.\n\n[![GAUCHE Overview](https://leojklarner.github.io/gauche/_images/gauche_overview.png)](https://leojklarner.github.io/gauche/_images/gauche_overview.png)\n\n## Kernels [\\#](https://leojklarner.github.io/gauche/\\#kernels)\n\nStandard GP packages typically assume continuous input spaces of low and fixed dimensionality. This makes it difficult to apply them to common molecular representations: molecular graphs are discrete objects, SMILES strings vary in length and topological fingerprints tend to be high-dimensional and sparse. To bridge this gap, GAUCHE provides:\n\n- **Fingerprint Kernels** that measure the similarity between bit/count vectors of descriptor by examining the degree to which their elements overlap.\n\n- **String Kernels** that measure the similarity between strings by examining the degree to which their sub-strings overlap.\n\n- **Graph Kernels** that measure between graphs by examining the degree to which certain substructural motifs overlap.\n\n\n## Representations [\\#](https://leojklarner.github.io/gauche/\\#representations)\n\nGAUCHE supports any representation that is based on bit/count vectors, strings or graphs. For rapid prototyping and benchmarking, we also provide a range of standard featurisation techniques for molecules, chemical reactions and proteins:\n\n| Domain | Representation |\n| --- | --- |\n| Molecules | ECFP Fingerprints \\[1\\], rdkit Fragments, Fragprints, Graphs \\[2\\], SMILES \\[3\\], SELFIES \\[4\\] |\n| Chemical Reactions | One-Hot Encoding, Data-Driven Reaction Fingerprints \\[5\\], Differential Reaction Fingerprints \\[6\\], Reaction SMARTS |\n| Proteins | Sequences, Graphs \\[2\\] |\n\n## Getting Started [\\#](https://leojklarner.github.io/gauche/\\#getting-started)\n\nThe easiest way to install Gauche is via pip.\n\npip install gauche\n\nAs not all users will need the full functionality of the package, we provide a range of installation options:\n\n- pip install gauche \\- installs the core functionality of GAUCHE (kernels, representations, data loaders, etc.) and should cover a wide range of use cases.\n\n- pip install gauche\\[rxn\\] \\- additionally installs the rxnfp and drfp fingerprints that can be used to represent chemical reactions.\n\n- pip install gauche\\[graphs\\] \\- installs all dependencies for graph kernels and representations.\n\n\nIf you aren\u2019t sure which installation option is right for you, you can simply install all of them with pip install gauche\\[all\\].\n\nThe best way to get started with GAUCHE is to check out our tutorial notebooks.

In this work, we present a\nmachine learning (ML) model that can learn and predict the aqueous solvation free\nenergy of an organic molecule using Gaussian process regression method based on a new\nmolecular graph kernel. To investigate the performance of the ML model on electrostatic\ninteraction, the nonpolar interaction contribution of solvent and the conformational\nentropy of solute in solvation free energy, three data sets with implicit or explicit water\nsolvent models, and contribution of conformational entropy of solute are tested. We\n1\ndemonstrate that our ML model can predict the solvation free energy of molecules at\nchemical accuracy with a mean absolute error of less than 1 kcal/mol for subsets of the\nQM9 dataset and the Freesolv database. To solve the general data scarcity problem\nfor a graph-based ML model, we propose a dimension reduction algorithm based on\nthe distance between molecular graphs, which can be used to examine the diversity of\nthe molecular data set. It provides a promising way to build a minimum training set\nto improve prediction for certain test sets where the space of molecular structures is\npredetermined.\nIntroduction\nRedox flow batteries (RFBs), particularly the aqueous organic RFBs (ORFBs), have gained\nsignificant interest for grid scale energy storage due to their inherent safety, flexible de\u0002sign, modular scale-up, and potential low cost. Critical functionalities of ORFBs such as\nenergy density, cycling stability, and rate capability are largely impacted by the properties\nof the active organic species. 1,2 For example, the solubility of the active organic molecule\ndictates the energy density of an organic RFB. Therefore, the search for highly soluble\n(>1M) and chemically stable redox active organic materials has recently become a critical\nresearch endeavor. 3 The solubility, as well as the reactivity, viscosity, and redox potential of\nthe active organic molecules depend on intricate interactions between the solute and solvent\nmolecules, for which the free energy of solvation is often a critical parameter. 4,5 Evidently, sol\u0002vation free energy has often been identified as a critical descriptor in quantitative structure\u0002property/activity relationships (QSPR/QSAR) analysis. Yet there have been comparatively\nfew experimental values (<2000) reported despite the millions of organic molecules synthe\u0002sized to date. Density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation\nmethods have been widely utilized for determining this prominent chemical descriptor. 6\u201312\nWith recent advancements in implicit solvation models 13\u201316 and operating functionals, the\nDFT and MD methodologies 17\u201320 provide a reliable estimate of solvation free energy with\nthe mean-absolute-error approaching the chemical accuracy level of 1 kcal/mol. However,\napproximations are often used to lower computational time at the cost of accuracy. 21,22 Fur\u0002thermore, large-scale calculation of solvation free energy with high precision method through\nDFT and MD is computationally intractable. In view of this challenge, an artificial intelli\u0002gence (AI) based prediction is needed because their computational strategies automatically\nimprove through experience. 21,22 Machine learning (ML) methods are capable to predict a\nvery broad range of properties. Recently, neural network model (NN) has received new\nattention for predicting solvation free energy prediction. 23\u201326 Some of these architectures\noperate over fixed molecular fingerprints common akin to traditional QSPR models. 27\u201329\nHowever, due to the incomplete physical understanding of the structure of molecule and\nemergent properties, the features provided by domain experts may not include all critical\ndesign parameters in the material design. The graph approach is a powerful tool to comple\u0002ment the domain experts knowledge because many features selected by domain experts are\nbased on the computations which use the molecular structures. 30\u201335 Moreover, as molecules\nhave arbitrary chemical composition and highly variable connectivity, useful information is\ndifficult to be extracted from a molecule into a fixed dimensional representation. Thus,\nincorporating the graph approach can add important features that could be inadvertedly\nneglected by domain experts when designing an ML model. Naturally, a molecular struc\u0002ture can be represented by an undirected labeled graph that encodes both structural and\nfunctional information. The graph contains an initial feature vector and a neighbor list for\neach atom. The feature vector summarizes the atom\u2019s local chemical environment, including\natom-types, hybridization types, and valence structures. Neighbor lists represent connectiv\u0002ity of the whole molecule. Another key question for molecular properties prediction using\nML methods is lack of data, namely the data sparsity. Molecular properties data sets are\ndifferent from the data sets in other applications as image recognition or natural language\nprocessing. Usually, the size of molecular properties data set that can be found is much\nsmaller than those available for the aforementioned conventional machine learning tasks,\n3\nas accurate results for molecular properties typically requires specialized instruments and\nmeasurements. Therefore, the measurement cost of a small data set is rather expensive and\ntime-consuming. Even for some molecular properties which can be obtained by computer\nsimulation, e.g., solvation free energy in explicit solvent, the calculations are also not cost\u0002effective. So the amount of training data remains a challenge in the property prediction of\nmolecules.\nGaussian process (GP) is one of the most well studied stochastic processes in proba\u0002bility and statistics. Given the flexible form of data representation, GP is a powerful tool\nfor classification and regression, and it is widely used in probabilistic scientific computing,\nengineering design, geostatistics, data assimilation, machine learning, etc. 36\u201338 In particular,\ngiven a data set comprising input/output pairs of locations and quantity of interest (QoI),\nGP regression (GPR), also known as Kriging, can provide a prediction along with a mean\nsquared error (MSE) estimate of the QoI at any location. Alternatively, from the Bayesian\nperspective, GPR identifies a Gaussian random variable at any location with posterior mean\n(corresponding to the prediction) and variance (corresponding to the MSE). In other words,\na GP model not only provides point predictions in the form of posterior means but also\nestimates the uncertainty of the prediction using posterior variances. Generally spea...",

      "text": "### Subjects\n\n## Abstract\n\nSolvent effects influence all stages of the chemical processes, modulating the stability of intermediates and transition states, as well as altering reaction rates and product ratios. However, accurately modelling these effects remains challenging. Here, we present a general strategy for generating reactive machine learning potentials to model chemical processes in solution. Our approach combines active learning with descriptor-based selectors and automation, enabling the construction of data-efficient training sets that span the relevant chemical and conformational space. We apply this strategy to investigate a Diels-Alder reaction in water and methanol. The generated machine learning potentials enable us to obtain reaction rates that are in agreement with experimental data and analyse the influence of these solvents on the reaction mechanism. Our strategy offers an efficient approach to the routine modelling of chemical reactions in solution, opening up avenues for studying complex chemical processes in an efficient manner.\n\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n\n## Introduction\n\n(Bio)chemical and industrially relevant reactions occur predominantly in the liquid phase[1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR1), [2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR2). The influence of solvent on reaction rates was first documented by Berthelot and Pean de Saint-Gilles in 1862[3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR3) and later formalised by Menschutkin in 1890[4](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR4). Since then, experimental and computational techniques have been developed to elucidate and quantify the origin of solvent effects on reactivity and selectivity[5](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR5). From an atomistic point of view, solvent effects arise from the interactions between solute and solvent molecules, which, although generally weak, have a significant impact on the overall reaction dynamics.\n\nIn computational chemistry, solvent effects are modelled using implicit or explicit solvent models. The former represents solvents as a polarisable continuum, offering computational simplicity and efficiency. However, it fails to capture the contributions arising from solute-solvent interactions, including entropy and pre-organisation effects[6](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR6). On the other hand, explicit solvent models provide an atomistic representation of the solvent but at a much higher computational cost since they require the use of ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD). This cost becomes significant when attempting to compute free energies, where extensive sampling is required to obtain statistically meaningful ensembles. Hybrid approaches, such as quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM), can alleviate this computational cost by describing only the reactive part at a QM level while the environment is described classically. However, the inclusion of mobile solvent molecules into the QM part creates additional technical difficulties, such as discontinuities at the boundary between the QM and MM regions[7](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR7), [8](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR8).\n\nIn recent years, machine learning-based potentials (MLPs) have emerged as powerful surrogates for existing modelling techniques, representing complex potential energy surfaces (PES) with an accuracy comparable to QM methods but at a significantly lower computational cost[9](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR9), [10](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR10). Since the pioneering work of Behler and Parinello (BP) on neural network-based potentials (NNP)[9](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR9), several MLP approaches have been developed, including models directly derived from BP, such as DeepMD[11](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR11) and ANI[12](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR12), message-passing NN models[13](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR13), such as PhysNet[14](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR14), SchNet[15](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR15), and MACE[16](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR16), kernel-based approaches, such as Gaussian Approximation Potential (GAP) and gradient-domain ML (GDML)[17](http://www.nature.com/www.nature.com#ref-CR17), [18](http://www.nature.com/www.nature.com#ref-CR18), [19](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR19), and linear regression-based models, such as linear Atomic Cluster Expansion (ACE)[20](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR20), [21](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR21). These MLPs have been successfully applied to study organic molecules[12](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR12), [22](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR22), material properties[23](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR23), [24](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR24) and simple chemical reactions in the gas phase and interfaces[25](http://www.nature.com/www.nature.com#ref-CR25), [26](http://www.nature.com/www.nature.com#ref-CR26), [27](http://www.nature.com/www.nature.com#ref-CR27), [28](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR28). While there are prominent examples of using MLPs to correct QM/MM computed free energies[29](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR29), modelling solvent implicitly[30](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR30), [31](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR31), or replacing the QM part to have a more efficient approach, ML/MM[32](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR32), only a handful of examples exist where chemical processes have been modelled in explicit solvent fully using MLPs. Such examples include urea decomposition in water[33](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR33), 1,3-dipolar cycloadditions in water[34](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR34), Strecker-cyanohydrin synthesis of glycine in water[35](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR35), and reactions in alkali carbonate-hydroxide electrolytes[36](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR36). In all these cases, NNPs are used, requiring thousands of AIMD configurations. For a comprehensive overview of relevant works, we refer the reader to a recent review by Isayev and Roitberg, ref. [37](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR37), and SI \u00a7 [S1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#MOESM1).\n\nOne of the main challenges limiting the application of MLPs to study chemical reactions in solution is the quality and size of the training data set, which needs to incorporate diverse configurations to effectively capture solute-solvent interaction at the minima and TS regions. Unlike solid-state systems, where particles are packed in highly ordered arrangements, molecules in solution are often flexible, resulting in a larger conformational space that needs to be sampled to accurately describe their PES. Moreover, the reliable description of reaction barriers and non-covalent interactions requires accurate reference electronic structure methods, further increasing the computational cost[38](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR38). The complexity of the training data can be reduced in \u0394-ML models[39](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR39), which predict the differences between semi-empirical baseline and QM PES rather than the absolute energies. However, even in these approache...",

Methodological aspects of reference data\ngeneration, representation, and regression, as well as the question\nof how a data-driven model may be validated, are reviewed and critically\ndiscussed. A survey of applications to a variety of research questions\nin chemistry and materials science illustrates the rapid growth in\nthe field. A vision is outlined for the development of the methodology\nin the years to come.\n## 1. Introduction\nAt the heart of chemistry is the need to understand the nature,\ntransformations, and macroscopic effects of atomistic structure. This\nis true for*materials*\u2014crystals, glasses, nanostructures,\ncomposites\u2014as well as for*molecules*, from\nthe simplest industrial feedstocks to entire proteins. And with the\noften-quoted role of chemistry as the \u201ccentral science\u201d,[1](#ref1),[2](#ref2)its emphasis on atomistic understanding has a bearing on many neighboring\ndisciplines: candidate drug molecules are made by synthetic chemists\nbased on an atomic-level knowledge of reaction mechanisms; functional\nmaterials for technological applications are characterized on a range\nof length scales, which begins with increasingly accurate information\nabout where exactly the atoms are located relative to one another\nin three-dimensional space.\nResearch progress in structural\nchemistry has largely been driven\nby advances in experimental characterization techniques, from landmark\nstudies in X-ray and neutron crystallography to novel electron microscopy\ntechniques which make it possible to visualize individual atoms directly.\nComplementing these new developments, detailed and realistic structural\ninsight is also increasingly gained from computer simulations. Today,\nchemists (together with materials scientists) are heavy users of large-scale\nsupercomputing fa...",
