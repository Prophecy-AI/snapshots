However, their complicated molecular interplay and compositional fluidity make experimentally determining properties such as viscosity, density, and melting point a significant undertaking. ML has increasingly been utilized as a powerful approach for predicting DES properties by identifying nonlinear relationships between molecular descriptors and macroscopic behaviors. This survey offers an extensive examination of ML applications in DES property prediction, covering prominent algorithms like artificial neural networks, support vector machines, random forests, and XGBoost, characteristic engineering strategies such as COSMO-RS descriptors and SMILES encoding, as well as hybrid methods merging physics-based modeling. We critically assess model performance metrics including R2, RMSE, and MAE, dataset qualities, and validation protocols, highlighting the superiority of ensemble and physics-informed ML methods in accuracy and generalizability. Recent advances in ML, for instance multifidelity Gaussian Process Regression and graph neural networks, demonstrate enhanced predictive capabilities for viscosity, density, and melting points, surpassing traditional thermodynamic models such as COSMO-RS and UNIFAC. Interpretability tools like SHAP analysis uncover dominant molecular interactions, guiding DES structure for specific applications. Challenges like data scarcity, extrapolation limitations, and computational expenses are discussed, alongside solutions like transfer learning and active learning. The study also explores burgeoning directions, involving the integration of quantum chemical descriptors and autonomous high-throughput screening. By bridging computational intelligence with chemical insights, ML accelerates the discovery of customized DESs, fostering innovation in green chemistry.\n\n## Introduction\n\nDeep Eutectic Solvents (DESs), a class of designer solvents formed through the eutectic mixture of hydrogen bond donors (HBDs) and hydrogen bond acceptors (HBAs), have emerged as promising green alternatives to conventional organic solvents. Owing to their low volatility, biodegradability, tunability, and low cost, DESs have found applications across various sectors, including drug delivery, extraction, catalysis, electrochemistry, and biomedicine \\[1\\]. Central to their utility is a thorough understanding and precise prediction of their physicochemical properties (such as viscosity, solubility, density, and surface tension) and biological properties like absorption, toxicity, and bioavailability. However, the complex molecular interactions\u2014especially extensive hydrogen bonding networks and compositional variability\u2014make experimental determination of DES properties both time-consuming and resource-intensive. This necessitates the development of predictive models capable of estimating DES behavior with high accuracy and generalizability \\[2\\].\n\nDESs can be systematically classified based on their chemical composition, hydrogen bonding interactions, polarity, physical state, charge, and specialized applications. The primary classification divides DESs into five types (I-V) based on their components, with additional categories emerging for advanced applications. Type I DESs consist of a quaternary ammonium salt (e.g., choline chloride) mixed with a metal chloride (e.g., ZnCl\u2082, FeCl\u2083). These solvents are highly stable and used in electrochemistry and metal processing but can be corrosive. Type II DESs are similar but incorporate hydrated metal chlorides (e.g., CrCl\u2083\u00b76H\u2082O), reducing viscosity and corrosion compared to Type I. Type III DESs, the most widely studied, combine choline chloride with hydrogen bond donors (HBDs) like urea, glycerol, or organic acids, making them biodegradable and versatile for green chemistry applications. Type IV DESs replace the ammonium salt with metal salts (e.g., ZnCl\u2082, AlCl\u2083) paired with HBDs, offering strong Lewis acidity for catalysis. Finally, Type V DESs are composed of non-ionic components (e.g., menthol + thymol), forming hydrophobic DESs useful for essential oil extraction and pharmaceuticals.\n\nDESs can also be categorized by their ionic nature. Ionic DESs (e.g., choline chloride-based mixtures) contain charged species and are common in electrochemistry. In contrast, neutral DESs (e.g., sugar-based mixtures like glucose + fructose) lack ionic components and are often used in food and cosmetic applications. DESs exhibit varying polarities, leading to hydrophilic (water-miscible, e.g., choline chloride + urea) and hydrophobic (water-immiscible, e.g., menthol + fatty acids) categories. Hydrophilic DESs dominate in extraction and bio catalysis, while hydrophobic DESs excel in non-polar separations. Most DESs are liquid at room temperature, but some solid eutectic mixtures (e.g., certain metal-based DESs) require heating to liquefy. This distinction is crucial for applications like thermal energy storage. Beyond traditional types, specialized DES classes have emerged. NADES (Natural Deep Eutectic Solvents) are derived from primary metabolites (e.g., sugars, organic acids) and are biocompatible, making them ideal for food, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals. THEDES (Therapeutic DESs) incorporate active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) to enhance drug solubility and transdermal delivery (e.g., ibuprofen + menthol). Emerging categories include PolyDES (polymer-enhanced DESs) for flexible electronics, SOLDES (solar thermal DESs) for energy storage, and eutectogels for wearable sensors. DESs are further tailored for specific uses: (a) Biocompatible DESs (e.g., choline chloride + glyce...",

In this work, we introduce a new tool for organic solvent recommendation that ranks possible solvent choices requiring only the SMILES representation of the solvents and solute involved. We report on three additional innovations: first, a differential/relative approach to solubility prediction is employed, in which solubility is modeled using pairs of measurements with the same solute but different solvents. We show that a relative framing of solubility as ranking solvents improves over a corresponding absolute solubility model across a diverse set of selected features. Second, a novel semiempirical featurization based on extended tight-binding (xtb) is applied to both the solvent and the solute, thereby providing physically meaningful representations of the problem at hand. Third, we provide an open-source implementation of this practical and convenient tool for organic solvent recommendation. Taken together, this work could be of benefit to those working in diverse areas, such as chemical engineering, material science, or synthesis planning.\n## 1 Introduction\nThe solubility in a given organic solvent is a key parameter in the synthesis, analysis and chemical processing of an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API).[1\u20134](#cit1)Therefore, it is a vital consideration reaching from initial drug discovery to final manufacturing.[5,6](#cit5)Hence, the development of a practical and reliable organic solvent recommendation system promises a reduction in both material costs and time-to-market.[5,7](#cit5)\nModelling of solubility can be roughly divided into physical, data-driven and hybrid approaches. Physical approaches aim to describe actual physical interactions involved in the observed solubility from first principles.[8](#cit8)Purely data-driven approaches lie on the other end of the spectrum and aim to employ statistical models withouta prioriknowledge of the physical effects involved. Due to its importance in drug discovery considerations, aqueous solubility prediction has been a major subject of focus. Hence, a plethora of approaches such as fragment-based,[9](#cit9)molecular-dynamics,[10](#cit10)general-solubility equation,[11\u201313](#cit11)Hansen solubility parameters and Hildebrandt solubility parameters,[14,15](#cit14)and first principleab initiocalculations have been reported.[16\u201319](#cit16)More recently, we see a switch of focus towards quantitative structure property relationships (QSPR)viastatistical techniques.[20\u201324](#cit20)The Open Notebook Science challenge[25](#cit25)is one of the few data sources of organic solubility (i.e., solubility in solvents other than water), but has received little attention in comparison to the aqueous case.[26,27](#cit26)\nVermeireet al.[28](#cit28)reported on a combined physical/ML approach that is applicable to a wide range of organic solvents and temperatures (RMSE \u22480.89, MAE \u22480.62). A recent communication[29](#cit29)reported on a hybrid approach towards organic solubility, that combines machine learning (ML) andab initiocalculations. In this study, a focused set of 14 physicochemical descriptors were chosen based on their significance in influencing the dissolution process. These descriptors encompass both properties derived fromab initiocomputations as well as the experimentally determined melting point. With this setup, an error of RMSE(log![[thin space (1/6-em)]](https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif)S) \u22480.7 was obtained, which is close to the experimental accuracy of 0.7\u20131.0 log units for drug-like molecules.[5,30](#cit5)While this work does illustrate the advantages of hybrid physical/ML modelling, it is still somewhat restricted from a practical point of view: it requires expensiveab initiocalculations, supports a limited set of solvents (acetone, benzene, and ethanol), and requires the experimental melting point.\nVassileiouet al.[31](#cit31)further support the observation that hybrid physical/ML approaches lead to improved predictive performance. Here, the conductor-like screening model for real solvents (COSMO-RS) with RMSE(log![[thin space (1/6-em)]](https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif)S) \u22481.0 is critically compared against machine learning on 2D descriptors (RMSE(log![[thin space (1/6-em)]](https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif)S) \u22480.92), as well as hybrid models thereof, with hybrid models (RMSE(log![[thin space (1/6-em)]](https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif)S) \u22480.8) giving the best results. While the set of solvents was extended over ref.[29](#cit29), it is still restrained to a limited set, and also shares the requirement of an experimental melting point as well as expensive electronic structure calculations.\nIn our quest to implement a more convenient solvent recommendation tool, we thus asked ourselves two questions:\nCould the expensiveab initiocalculations be replaced by faster approximate methods?\nAre experimental melting points strictly required to produce accurate QSPR solubility predictions?\nTo replace the expensiveab initiomodels, a computationally efficient yet accurate solvation model based on the analytical linearized Poisson\u2013Boltzmann (ALPB) parameterized for the extended tight binding (xtb) method[32](#cit32)was selected as a replacement for the more expensive COSMO-RS used in prior studies. The proposed method performs well over a broad range of systems and applications. For hydration free energies of small molecules, xtb(ALPB) is reaching the accuracy of sophisticated explicitly solvated approaches, with a mean absolute deviation of only 1.4 kcal mol\u22121compared to experiment.[32](#cit32)While this compares favorably against COSMO (MAE = 2.19 kcal mol\u22121), it is worse than the computationally more elaborate COSMO-RS (MAECOSMO-RS= 0.52 kcal mol\u22121).[33](#cit33)\nBut logarithmic octanol/water partitioning coefficients are computed with a MAE \u22480.65 log units,[32](#cit32)which is comparable to the performance of COSMO-RS with MAE \u22480.57.[34](#cit34)This indicates that xtb gives a consistent description of differential solvent effects,[32](#cit32)which we regarded as crucial for hybrid physics/ML descriptors in organic solvent recommendation. Concerning the second question, it has to be noted t...",

This study presents a comprehensive evaluation of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) for predicting drug solubility in binary solvent mixtures across diverse temperature ranges. We used an extensive dataset comprising 27,000 solubility measurements encompassing 123 small-molecule solutes, 44 solvents, and 110 binary solvent combinations measured across varied temperatures (273\u2013373 K). Our GCN architecture incorporates multi-head attention mechanisms, hierarchical molecular representation learning, and sophisticated pooling strategies to capture complex molecular interactions. The proposed GCN model achieved exceptional performance with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.28\\\\(LogS\\\\)units, demonstrating a 15% improvement over traditional machine learning approaches. Through comprehensive ablation studies and attention visualization analyses, we demonstrate that GCNs excel particularly in modeling structure-solubility relationships for pharmaceutically relevant compounds. Prospective validation using four drug molecules confirmed the model\u2019s predictive reliability, with experimental verification yielding MAE\u2009&lt;\u20090.5\\\\(Log\\\\)S for compounds structurally similar to training data. This research establishes GCNs as powerful tools for accelerating pharmaceutical formulation development, potentially reducing experimental requirements by 60\u201380% while providing interpretable molecular insights through attention mechanisms.

The accurate determination of solubility typically relies on established thermodynamic and kinetic methodologies[9](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-28272-3#ref-CR9),[10](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-28272-3#ref-CR10), where thermodynamic approaches measure equilibrium concentrations between dissolved and solid phases, while kinetic methods determine precipitation onset concentrations[11](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-28272-3#ref-CR11).\nDespite methodological advances aimed at enhancing experimental throughput[12](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-28272-3#ref-CR12),[13](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-28272-3#ref-CR13), significant challenges persist, particularly when dealing with high-value pharmaceutical compounds or when material availability is constrained. These limitations have catalyzed research into computational alternatives, with machine learning and deep learning approaches emerging as promising solutions[14](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-28272-3#ref-CR14),[15](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-28272-3#ref-CR15).\nThe majority of existing machine learning models focus on predicting solubility in single solvents[16](#ref-CR16),[17](#ref-CR17),[18](#ref-CR18),[19](#ref-CR19),[20](#ref-CR20),[21](#ref-CR21),[22](#ref-CR22),[23](#ref-CR23),[24](#ref-CR24),[25](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-28272-3#ref-CR25), primarily targeting aqueous systems due to abundant training data availability.

Vermeire\n\n###### Abstract\n\nSolvation free energy is an important design parameter in reaction kinetics and separation processes, making it a critical property to predict during process development. In previous research, directed message passing neural networks (D-MPNN) have successfully been used to predict solvation free energies and enthalpies in organic solvents. However, solvent mixtures provide greater flexibility for optimizing solvent interactions than monosolvents. This work aims to extend our previous models to mixtures.\nTo handle mixtures in a permutation invariant manner we propose a pooling function; MolPool. With this pooling function, the machine learning models can learn and predict properties for an arbitrary number of molecules.\nThe novel SolProp-mix software that applies MolPool to D-MPNN was compared to state-of-the-art architectures for predicting mixture properties and validated with our new database of COSMOtherm calculations; BinarySolv-QM.\nTo improve predictions towards experimental accuracy, the network was then fine-tuned on experimental data in monosolvents.\nTo demonstrate the benefit of this transfer learning methodology, experimental datasets of solvation free energies in binary (BinarySolv-Exp) and ternary (TernarySolv-Exp) solvent mixtures were compiled from data on vapor-liquid equilibria and activity coefficients.\nThe neural network performed better than COSMOtherm calculations with an MAE of 0.25\u2062k\u2062c\u2062a\u2062l/m\u2062o\u2062l0.25\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc590.25\\ kcal/mol0.25 italic\\_k italic\\_c italic\\_a italic\\_l / italic\\_m italic\\_o italic\\_l and an RMSE of 0.37\u2062k\u2062c\u2062a\u2062l/m\u2062o\u2062l0.37\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc590.37\\ kcal/mol0.37 italic\\_k italic\\_c italic\\_a italic\\_l / italic\\_m italic\\_o italic\\_l for non-aqueous mixed solvents.\nAdditionally, the ability to capture trends for a varying mixture composition was validated successfully.

These methods have been widely applied to thermochemical properties of both pure compounds and infinite-diluted mixtures, outperforming well established thermodynamic models. Accordingly, applications to numerous properties were shown, for example, activity coefficients \\[ [6](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.01982v2#bib.bib6), [7](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.01982v2#bib.bib7), [8](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.01982v2#bib.bib8), [9](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.01982v2#bib.bib9), [10](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.01982v2#bib.bib10)\\], solubilities \\[ [11](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.01982v2#bib.bib11)\\], viscosities \\[ [12](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.01982v2#bib.bib12)\\], liquid densities \\[ [13](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.01982v2#bib.bib13)\\], and vapour pressures \\[ [14](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.01982v2#bib.bib14)\\]. These applications outperform renowned models such as UNIFAC \\[ [15](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.01982v2#bib.bib15)\\] and COSMO-RS \\[ [16](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.01982v2#bib.bib16)\\]. Recent research has studied infinite-diluted \\[ [9](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.01982v2#bib.bib9), [17](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.01982v2#bib.bib17)\\] and composition dependent mixtures \\[ [6](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.01982v2#bib.bib6), [7](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.01982v2#bib.bib7)\\], as well as temperature dependence \\[ [18](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.01982v2#bib.bib18)\\].\n\nAs part of thermochemical property research, solvation free energy is actively investigated because solvation is of critical influence to the optimization of reactions in solution and the design of new separation processes \\[ [11](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.01982v2#bib.bib11), [17](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.01982v2#bib.bib17), [19](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.01982v2#bib.bib19), [20](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.01982v2#bib.bib20)\\].\nReactions are influenced by the solvation free energy because it affects the activation energy of the reaction in solution through the Eyring equation, which in turn influences reaction rates and pathways.\nMoreover, solvation properties, e.g. activity coefficients and solvation free energy, correlate to the solubility of gases, liquids, and solids.\nSolvation free energy predictors have focused on infinite-diluted binary systems of active pharmaceutical ingredients \\[ [17](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.01982v2#bib.bib17)\\]; however, in industry, it is common practice to formulate solvent mixtures to increase the reaction rate and solubility compared to individual solvents \\[ [21](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.01982v2#bib.bib21)\\]. Solvent mixtures increase the exploration space of economical viable solvents because of the broader range of parameters that can be optimized to reach similar objectives as in the design of de novo solvents. De novo solvents are usually designed for specifically applications but often fail to take into account toxicological, economical, or synthesizable viability. The potential to formulate a solvent mixture is argued to be the single most useful idea of the famous Hansen solubility parameters \\[ [22](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.01982v2#bib.bib22)\\]. Therefore, an extension of machine learning methods for solvation free energy prediction to solvent mixtures is timely.\n\nA variety of ML architectures for predicting properties of mixtures have been proposed \\[ [23](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.01982v2#bib.bib23)\\]. Although there have been studies to predict activity coefficients that included compositional dependence \\[ [6](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.01982v2#bib.bib6), [7](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.01982v2#bib.bib7), [9](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.01982v2#bib.bib9)\\], none of these proposed a method that can process an arbitrary number of components in the mixture in a permutation invariant way. In other words, they cannot reuse the same neural network for both binary and ternary mixtures and hence fail to include the information of these highly similar systems in a single neural network. Therefore, we adapt an architecture from Hanaoka and Kyohei \\[ [23](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.01982v2#bib.bib23)\\] that is permutation invariant with respect to the number and order of components. This architecture uses a weighted averaging of individual component embeddings to pool these embeddings into an embedding for the mixture. This is analogous to the classical pooling function in message passing neural networks (MPNNs) that pools the atom embeddings into a molecular embedding \\[ [24](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.01982v2#bib.bib24)\\]. This pooling function creates the same embedding when the input order of molecules is shuffled, which is useful as also the components in homogeneous mixtures are not naturally ordered.\nSuch pooling function also allows the model to train on information from single molecule property data and transfer this information to mixture predictions. This is important because single molecule data are often available in higher quan...",

      "text": "### Subjects\n\n## Abstract\n\nSolvent effects influence all stages of the chemical processes, modulating the stability of intermediates and transition states, as well as altering reaction rates and product ratios. However, accurately modelling these effects remains challenging. Here, we present a general strategy for generating reactive machine learning potentials to model chemical processes in solution. Our approach combines active learning with descriptor-based selectors and automation, enabling the construction of data-efficient training sets that span the relevant chemical and conformational space. We apply this strategy to investigate a Diels-Alder reaction in water and methanol. The generated machine learning potentials enable us to obtain reaction rates that are in agreement with experimental data and analyse the influence of these solvents on the reaction mechanism. Our strategy offers an efficient approach to the routine modelling of chemical reactions in solution, opening up avenues for studying complex chemical processes in an efficient manner.\n\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n\n## Introduction\n\n(Bio)chemical and industrially relevant reactions occur predominantly in the liquid phase[1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR1), [2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR2). The influence of solvent on reaction rates was first documented by Berthelot and Pean de Saint-Gilles in 1862[3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR3) and later formalised by Menschutkin in 1890[4](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR4). Since then, experimental and computational techniques have been developed to elucidate and quantify the origin of solvent effects on reactivity and selectivity[5](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR5). From an atomistic point of view, solvent effects arise from the interactions between solute and solvent molecules, which, although generally weak, have a significant impact on the overall reaction dynamics.\n\nIn computational chemistry, solvent effects are modelled using implicit or explicit solvent models. The former represents solvents as a polarisable continuum, offering computational simplicity and efficiency. However, it fails to capture the contributions arising from solute-solvent interactions, including entropy and pre-organisation effects[6](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR6). On the other hand, explicit solvent models provide an atomistic representation of the solvent but at a much higher computational cost since they require the use of ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD). This cost becomes significant when attempting to compute free energies, where extensive sampling is required to obtain statistically meaningful ensembles. Hybrid approaches, such as quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM), can alleviate this computational cost by describing only the reactive part at a QM level while the environment is described classically. However, the inclusion of mobile solvent molecules into the QM part creates additional technical difficulties, such as discontinuities at the boundary between the QM and MM regions[7](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR7), [8](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR8).\n\nIn recent years, machine learning-based potentials (MLPs) have emerged as powerful surrogates for existing modelling techniques, representing complex potential energy surfaces (PES) with an accuracy comparable to QM methods but at a significantly lower computational cost[9](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR9), [10](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR10). Since the pioneering work of Behler and Parinello (BP) on neural network-based potentials (NNP)[9](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR9), several MLP approaches have been developed, including models directly derived from BP, such as DeepMD[11](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR11) and ANI[12](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR12), message-passing NN models[13](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR13), such as PhysNet[14](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR14), SchNet[15](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR15), and MACE[16](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR16), kernel-based approaches, such as Gaussian Approximation Potential (GAP) and gradient-domain ML (GDML)[17](http://www.nature.com/www.nature.com#ref-CR17), [18](http://www.nature.com/www.nature.com#ref-CR18), [19](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR19), and linear regression-based models, such as linear Atomic Cluster Expansion (ACE)[20](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR20), [21](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR21). These MLPs have been successfully applied to study organic molecules[12](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR12), [22](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR22), material properties[23](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR23), [24](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR24) and simple chemical reactions in the gas phase and interfaces[25](http://www.nature.com/www.nature.com#ref-CR25), [26](http://www.nature.com/www.nature.com#ref-CR26), [27](http://www.nature.com/www.nature.com#ref-CR27), [28](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR28). While there are prominent examples of using MLPs to correct QM/MM computed free energies[29](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR29), modelling solvent implicitly[30](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR30), [31](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR31), or replacing the QM part to have a more efficient approach, ML/MM[32](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR32), only a handful of examples exist where chemical processes have been modelled in explicit solvent fully using MLPs. Such examples include urea decomposition in water[33](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR33), 1,3-dipolar cycloadditions in water[34](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR34), Strecker-cyanohydrin synthesis of glycine in water[35](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR35), and reactions in alkali carbonate-hydroxide electrolytes[36](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR36). In all these cases, NNPs are used, requiring thousands of AIMD configurations. For a comprehensive overview of relevant works, we refer the reader to a recent review by Isayev and Roitberg, ref. [37](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR37), and SI \u00a7 [S1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#MOESM1).\n\nOne of the main challenges limiting the application of MLPs to study chemical reactions in solution is the quality and size of the training data set, which needs to incorporate diverse configurations to effectively capture solute-solvent interaction at the minima and TS regions. Unlike solid-state systems, where particles are packed in highly ordered arrangements, molecules in solution are often flexible, resulting in a larger conformational space that needs to be sampled to accurately describe their PES. Moreover, the reliable description of reaction barriers and non-covalent interactions requires accurate reference electronic structure methods, further increasing the computational cost[38](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR38). The complexity of the training data can be reduced in \u0394-ML models[39](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR39), which predict the differences between semi-empirical baseline and QM PES rather than the absolute energies. However, even in these approache...",

For alanine dipeptide, a machine learning potential (MLP) based on the DeepPot-SE representation of the molecule was trained to capture its interactions with its average solvent environment configuration (ASEC). The predicted forces on the solute deviated only by an RMSD of 0.4 kcal mol\u22121 \u00c5\u22121 from the reference values, and the MLP-based free energy surface differed from that obtained from explicit solvent MD simulations by an RMSD of less than 0.9 kcal mol\u22121. Our MLP training protocol could also accurately reproduce combined quantum mechanical molecular mechanical (QM/MM) forces on the quantum mechanical (QM) solute in ASEC environment, thus enabling the development of accurate ML-based implicit solvent models for ab initio-QM MD simulations. Such ML-based implicit solvent models for QM calculations are cost-effective in both the training stage, where the use of ASEC reduces the number of data points to be labelled, and the inference stage, where the MLP can be evaluated at a relatively small additional cost on top of the QM calculation of the solute.\n\n* * *\n\n## 1\\. Introduction\n\nOne of the central tasks in the field of Computational Chemistry is to simulate various chemical processes and conformational changes of molecules and macromolecules in aqueous solutions. [1\u20135](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2023/ra/d2ra08180f#cit1) In general, molecular mechanics (MM), quantum mechanics (QM), [6](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2023/ra/d2ra08180f#cit6) or combined quantum mechanics molecular mechanics (QM/MM) [7](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2023/ra/d2ra08180f#cit7) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations incorporate the aqueous environment through explicit or implicit solvent models. [8\u201310](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2023/ra/d2ra08180f#cit8) In the explicit solvent models, the solvent molecules are accounted for explicitly, where solvent\u2013solute interactions can be calculated with atomistic resolution. Popular models for explicit solvents include TIPnP, [11\u201313](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2023/ra/d2ra08180f#cit11) SPC, [14](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2023/ra/d2ra08180f#cit14) and AMOEBA. [15,16](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2023/ra/d2ra08180f#cit15) On the other hand, the implicit solvent models (also known as the continuum solvent models) [17\u201320](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2023/ra/d2ra08180f#cit17) treat the solvent implicitly as a dielectric continuum, thus reducing the number of explicit particle\u2013particle interactions. Popular methods include the Poisson\u2013Boltzmann (PB), [21](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2023/ra/d2ra08180f#cit21) COSMO/polarized continuum model (PCM), [22\u201333](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2023/ra/d2ra08180f#cit22) or Generalized Born (GB) models. [34\u201337](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2023/ra/d2ra08180f#cit34)\n\nWith fewer atoms involved in the calculation, the implicit solvent models offer an advantage in terms of its lower computational cost. [38](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2023/ra/d2ra08180f#cit38) However, the accuracy of implicit solvent models can be limited by its inadequacy to capture specific solute\u2013solvent interactions and solvent structure fluctuations. [39](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2023/ra/d2ra08180f#cit39) In MM-based modeling, implicit solvent model based simulations do not always accurately reproduce folded [40\u201342](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2023/ra/d2ra08180f#cit40) and unfolded structural distributions. [8,38,43,44](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2023/ra/d2ra08180f#cit8) For QM-based modeling, pKa predictions of the solute can sometimes be off by a couple of pH units, if the hydrogen bonding between solute and the nearby solvent molecules is completely ignored in implicit solvent calculations. [45](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2023/ra/d2ra08180f#cit45) In principle, such deficiencies in implicit solvent based MM and QM modelings can be mitigated by including one or multiple solvent molecules or the entire first solvation shell into the solute region of implicit solvent calculations. [46\u201348](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2023/ra/d2ra08180f#cit46) However, such a treatment might inadvertently reduce the mobility of those solvent molecules and thus over-stabilize the short-range solute\u2013solvent interactions.\n\nTo guide the development of more accurate implicit solvent models, it would be highly desirable if one can \u201cderive\u201d an implicit solvent model directly from explicit solvent MD simulations of the system.

We investigated the solubility of rivaroxaban in both dichloromethane and a variety of primary alcohols at various temperatures and concentrations of solvents to understand its behavior in mixed solvents. Given the complex, non-linear patterns in solubility behavior, three advanced regression approaches were utilized: Polynomial Curve Fitting, a Bayesian-based Neural Network (BNN), and the Neural Oblivious Decision Ensemble (NODE) method. To optimize model performance, hyperparameters were fine-tuned using the Stochastic Fractal Search (SFS) algorithm. Among the tested models, BNN obtained the best precision for fitting, with a test R\u00b2 of 0.9926 and a MSE of 3.07\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u207b\u2078, proving outstanding accuracy in fitting the rivaroxaban data. The NODE model followed BNN, showing a test R\u00b2 of 0.9413 and the lowest MAPE of 0.1835. The Polynomial model yielded a lower test R\u00b2 of 0.8200 and higher error rates, indicating its limitations in unravelling the underlying relationships for the solubility variations. This study shows that advanced machine learning models, particularly BNN and NODE, can predict pharmaceutical solubility and improve crystallization process design and optimization.\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n![](https://media.springernature.com/w215h120/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-025-05535-7/MediaObjects/41598_2025_5535_Fig1_HTML.png)\n### [Machine learning-based analysis on pharmaceutical compounds interaction with polymer to estimate drug solubility in formulations](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-05535-7?fromPaywallRec=false)\nArticleOpen access02 July 2025\n![](https://media.springernature.com/w215h120/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-025-90704-x/MediaObjects/41598_2025_90704_Fig1_HTML.png)\n### [Computational intelligence investigations on evaluation of salicylic acid solubility in various solvents at different temperatures](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-90704-x?fromPaywallRec=false)\nArticleOpen access28 February 2025\n![](https://media.springernature.com/w215h120/springer-static/image/art%3Aplaceholder%2Fimages/placeholder-figure-nature.png)\n### [Predicting drug solubility in binary solvent mixtures using graph convolutional networks: a comprehensive deep learning approach](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-28272-3?fromPaywallRec=false)\nArticleOpen access29 November 2025\n## Introduction\nIn pharmaceutical production, solid-based oral formulations require crystallization as the heart of process for recovery of active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) from the synthesis solution. The process of API crystallization relies on reducing drug solubility which can be conducted via various techniques such as cooling, adding antisolvent to the solution, reaction, etc. The efficient processing depends on the measuring and predicting solubility of API at different conditions[1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-13090-4#ref-CR1),[2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-13090-4#ref-CR2). For some cases, the crystallization is difficult to be carried out and solvent must be changed. Indeed, API solubility in mixed solvents should be estimated as it is tedious to measure it via experimental methods[3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-13090-4#ref-CR3). As such, computational methods such as machine learning (ML) are applicable for estimation of APIs in mixed solvents[4](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-13090-4#ref-CR4).\nRecently, some ML-based models were developed for estimation and correlation of API solubility to temperature and solvent composition[4](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-13090-4#ref-CR4). Jeong et al.[5](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-13090-4#ref-CR5)measured and correlated solubility of rivaroxaban in mixed solvents. The considered solvents were mixture of dichloromethane and primary alcohols to find the highest solubility at different temperatures. Other studies recently estimated the solubility of rivaroxaban via ML models and reported that ML is a powerful approach in correlation of rivaroxaban solubility to temperature and concentration[4](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-13090-4#ref-CR4),[6](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-13090-4#ref-CR6),[7](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-13090-4#ref-CR7). Although several studies reported correlation of rivaroxaban solubility to temperature and solvent concentrations, more ML models and optimizers need to be evaluated to provide greater choice for selection of proper model in pharmaceutical crystallization design and optimization.\nML techniques have increasingly been applied to predict solubility and other physico-chemical properties of pharmaceutical compounds. For instance, data-driven models such as Bayesian-based models, Neural Networks, and Polynomial Regression have been successfully applied to determine solubility of APIs in supercritical solvents and to model thermodynamic behavior in multicomponent systems which indicated great accuracy[8](#ref-CR8),[9](#ref-CR9),[10](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-13090-4#ref-CR10). Moreover, advanced deep learning frameworks, including ensemble-based models like NODE, have shown strong performance in predicting material properties in biomedical engineering applications, especially for structured data involving drug release from biomaterials matrix[11...",

To alleviate these challenges, machine learning (ML) has been applied to predict drug solubility as an alternative approach. However, the majority of existing ML research has focused on the predictions of aqueous solubility and/or solubility at specific temperatures, which restricts the model applicability in pharmaceutical development. To bridge this gap, we compiled a dataset of 27,000 solubility datapoints, including solubility of small molecules measured in a range of binary solvent mixtures under various temperatures. Next, a panel of ML models were trained on this dataset with their hyperparameters tuned using Bayesian optimization. The resulting top-performing models, both gradient boosted decision trees (light gradient boosting machine and extreme gradient boosting), achieved mean absolute errors (MAE) of 0.33 for LogS (S in g/100\u00a0g) on the holdout set. These models were further validated through a prospective study, wherein the solubility of four drug molecules were predicted by the models and then validated with in-house solubility experiments. This prospective study demonstrated that the models accurately predicted the solubility of solutes in specific binary solvent mixtures under different temperatures, especially for drugs whose features closely align within the solutes in the dataset (MAE\u2009<\u20090.5 for LogS). To support future research and facilitate advancements in the field, we have made the dataset and code openly available.\n\n**Scientific contribution**\n\nOur research advances the state-of-the-art in predicting solubility for small molecules by leveraging ML and a uniquely comprehensive dataset. Unlike existing ML studies that predominantly focus on solubility in aqueous solvents at fixed temperatures, our work enables prediction of drug solubility in a variety of binary solvent mixtures over a broad temperature range, providing practical insights on the modeling of solubility for realistic pharmaceutical applications. These advancements along with the open access dataset and code support significant steps in the drug development process including new molecule discovery, drug analysis and formulation.\n\n### Graphical Abstract\n\n## Introduction\n\nIn pharmaceutical development, the solubility of drugs is a critical factor that influences various stages, including drug discovery \\[ [1](https://jcheminf.biomedcentral.com/jcheminf.biomedcentral.com#ref-CR1), [2](https://jcheminf.biomedcentral.com/jcheminf.biomedcentral.com#ref-CR2), [3](https://jcheminf.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13321-024-00911-3#ref-CR3)\\], drug analysis \\[ [2](https://jcheminf.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13321-024-00911-3#ref-CR2), [4](https://jcheminf.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13321-024-00911-3#ref-CR4), [5](https://jcheminf.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13321-024-00911-3#ref-CR5)\\], and formulation design \\[ [6](https://jcheminf.biomedcentral.com/jcheminf.biomedcentral.com#ref-CR6), [7](https://jcheminf.biomedcentral.com/jcheminf.biomedcentral.com#ref-CR7), [8](https://jcheminf.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13321-024-00911-3#ref-CR8)\\].
