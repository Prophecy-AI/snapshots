    "1. **CV-LB Relationship**: LB = 4.68*CV + 0.0490 (R²=0.952)\n",
    "2. **Intercept Problem**: The intercept (0.0490) is HIGHER than the target (0.0347)\n",
    "3. **This means**: Even with CV=0, we'd get LB=0.0490 > 0.0347\n",
    "4. **GNN Benchmark**: Achieved MSE 0.0039 on this exact dataset!\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Fundamental Problem:\n",
    "The current approach (MLP/LGBM/GP ensembles with Spange+DRFP features) has a CV-LB relationship that CANNOT reach the target. The intercept is too high.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What the GNN Benchmark Did:\n",
    "- Used Graph Attention Networks (GATs) with DRFP\n",
    "- Learned mixture-aware solvent encodings\n",
    "- Achieved MSE 0.0039 (25x better than our best LB 0.0877)"
