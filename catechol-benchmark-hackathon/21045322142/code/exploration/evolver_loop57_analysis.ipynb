    "# Loop 57 Analysis: Post-XGBoost+RF Ensemble Assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "**Situation:**\n",
    "- 57 experiments completed, 26 consecutive failures since exp_030\n",
    "- Best LB: 0.0877 (exp_030), Target: 0.0347\n",
    "- Gap: 2.53x (0.0877 / 0.0347)\n",
    "- 5 submissions remaining\n",
    "- exp_056 (XGBoost + RandomForest Ensemble) FAILED - CV 0.014233 (71.5% worse)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Finding from exp_056:**\n",
    "XGBoost and RandomForest don't help - they actually hurt performance. The GP + MLP + LGBM ensemble from exp_030 remains the best approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Critical Evaluator Insight:**\n",
    "The 'mixall' kernel OVERWRITES the CV functions to use GroupKFold(5) instead of Leave-One-Out(24). This is why their local CV correlates better with LB. Our Leave-One-Out(24) CV doesn't predict LB well.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Questions:**\n",
    "1. Can we use GroupKFold(5) locally to understand the CV-LB relationship better?\n",
    "2. What fundamentally different approaches remain?\n",
    "3. How can we change the CV-LB relationship?"
