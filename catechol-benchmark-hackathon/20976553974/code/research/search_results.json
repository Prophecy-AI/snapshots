      "title": "ANSWER",
      "text": "Predicting reaction yields when the test set contains solvents that were never seen during training is essentially an out\u2011of\u2011distribution (OOD) problem.  Recent benchmarks show that **few\u2011shot and transfer\u2011learning strategies** are the most effective way to bridge this gap: models are first pretrained on large, heterogeneous reaction datasets and then fine\u2011tuned on a small number of examples that include the new solvent, often using active\u2011learning loops to select the most informative experiments\u202f([arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1)).  In parallel, **graph neural networks (GNNs)** that treat the solvent as a separate molecular graph and encode continuous physicochemical descriptors (e.g., polarity, dielectric constant) have demonstrated strong performance on the Catechol rearrangement benchmark, where solvent effects vary continuously across a transient\u2011flow dataset\u202f([arxiv.org/abs/2512.19530](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19530)).  These GNNs can be combined with meta\u2011learning (e.g., MAML) to enable rapid adaptation to unseen solvents with only a handful of labeled reactions.\n\nBecause OOD predictions carry high uncertainty, **Bayesian deep learning** and **uncertainty quantification** are recommended to flag low\u2011confidence yield estimates and guide experimental validation\u202f([nature.com/articles/s41467-025-59812-0](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-59812-0)).  Complementary approaches include augmenting reaction SMILES with **solvent embeddings derived from quantum\u2011chemical calculations** (e.g., COSMO\u2011RS or SMD solvation energies) and feeding them into transformer\u2011based regression models, which have already shown state\u2011of\u2011the\u2011art performance on high\u2011throughput yield datasets\u202f([research.ibm.com/publications/prediction-of-chemical-reaction-yields-using-deep-learning](https://research.ibm.com/publications/prediction-of-chemical-reaction-yields-using-deep-learning)).  Together, a pipeline that (1) pretrains a GNN or transformer on large reaction corpora, (2) incorporates rich, continuous solvent descriptors, (3) applies few\u2011shot/meta\u2011learning for rapid adaptation, and (4) quantifies uncertainty with Bayesian methods provides the best current strategy for reliable yield prediction on completely unseen solvents.",

However, chemical datasets are often inaccessible to the machine learning community as they tend to require cleaning, thorough understanding of the chemistry, or are simply not available. In this paper, we introduce a novel dataset for yield prediction, providing the first-ever transient flow dataset for machine learning benchmarking, covering over 1200 process conditions. While previous datasets focus on discrete parameters, our experimental set-up allow us to sample a large number of continuous process conditions, generating new challenges for machine learning models. We focus on solvent selection, a task that is particularly difficult to model theoretically and therefore ripe for machine learning applications. We showcase benchmarking for regression algorithms, transfer-learning approaches, feature engineering, and active learning, with important applications towards solvent replacement and sustainable manufacturing.\n## 1Introduction\nMachine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) have showcased enormous potential in empowering the world of the natural sciences: from famous examples such as AlphaFold for protein predictions> [\n[> 1\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib1)> ]\n, to fusion reactor control> [\n[> 2\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib2)> ]\n, disease detection> [\n[> 3\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib3)> ]\n, battery design> [\n[> 4\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib4)> ]\n, and material discovery> [\n[> 5\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib5)> ]\n, among many more. However, we seldom see the machine learning community benchmark new methods in physical science datasets, mostly due to the difficulty in cleaning real-world data, the need for interdisciplinary understanding to correctly benchmark, and most importantly, how expensive the data can be to produce, resulting in many datasets being locked behind closed doors by large companies.\nAIchemy ([https://aichemy.ac.uk](https://aichemy.ac.uk)) is an interdisciplinary UK hub with the mission of transforming the chemistry-AI interface via aiding the collaboration of chemists and AI researchers, as well as addressing gaps in data standards, curation, and availability for AI use. In partnership with SOLVE Chemistry ([https://www.solvechemistry.com](https://www.solvechemistry.com)), we present a first important step into addressing the dataset gap with the introduction of a new and unique open dataset for benchmarking low-data machine learning algorithms for chemistry.\nSolvent selection is one of the biggest challenges for chemical manufacturing, with solvents often being the main source of waste in the manufacturing process> [\n[> 6\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib6)> ]\n. Increased regulation on solvents and a drive to making process manufacturing more sustainable led to an interest in the discovery of greener solvents and for improved solvent replacement tools. However, most of the solvent replacement tools focus purely on learning unsupervised representations of solvents, with the hope that experimentalists can find solvents with similar properties to replace those with environmental concerns. A much stronger approach would consider the interaction of a variety of different solvents with a reaction of interest to directly predict reaction yields, in such a way that the best possible solvent can be selected according to a yield-sustainability trade-off.\nMachine learning approaches have been shown to be a powerful tool for the prediction of chemical reaction conditions. Success has been reported in retro-synthesis> [\n[> 7\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib7)> , [> 8\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib8)> ]\n, condition recommendations> [\n[> 9\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib9)> ]\n, product predictions> [\n[> 10\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib10)> , [> 11\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib11)> ]\n, among others. While yield prediction has proven to be more difficult due to large inconsistencies in procedure and data reporting> [\n[> 12\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib12)> ]\n, we have still seen promising yield prediction results for smaller and more carefully curated datasets> [\n[> 13\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib13)> , [> 14\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib14)> , [> 15\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib15)> , [> 16\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib16)> ]\n. However, these datasets lack the continuous reaction conditions, such as temperature and residence time, that are required to scale-up processes to practical manufacturing conditions.\nIn this paper, we release the first machine-learning-ready transient flow dataset, a framework that allows for quick and efficient screening of continuous reaction conditions. We specifically provide yield data over the uni-molecular allyl substituted catechol reaction, shown in Figure[1](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#S1.F1), with dense measurements across the residence time, temperature, and solvent space. We further showcase how this type ofkinetic dataposes new challenges to current machine learning methods for chemistry, and identify how the challenges can potentially be tackled by the community.\n![Refer to caption](extracted/6524982/figures/Project2_rxn.png)Figure 1:Data was gathered on the rearrangement of allyl substituted catechol. By subjecting the reaction mixture to high temperatures, we begin a cascade reaction forming multiple rearrangement products. We investigate the yield of the reaction for a range of different solvents. Product 1 was not observed and reacted immediately to form Product 2 and later 3.\n### 1.1Related works\nReaction datasets are common in chemistry research, but their suitability for machine learning benchmarking tends to be poor. This can be a result of improper formatting or documentation, incomplete information about reaction conditions or the experimental set-up, or the lack of machine readability, leading to limited usage by the ML community. However, some effort has been made to address this, with the biggest example being the creation of the Open Reaction Database (ORD)> [\n[> 17\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib17)> ]\n, a repository containing over 2M different reactions, many of which come from US patent data (USPTO)> [\n[> 18\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib18)> ]\n.

Traditional machine learning approaches often treat solvent identity as a discrete categorical variable, which prevents systematic interpolation and extrapolation across the solvent space. This work introduces the \\textbf{Catechol Benchmark}, a high-throughput transient flow chemistry dataset comprising 1,227 experimental yield measurements for the rearrangement of allyl-substituted catechol in 24 pure solvents and their binary mixtures, parameterized by continuous volume fractions ($\\% B$). We evaluate various architectures under rigorous leave-one-solvent-out and leave-one-mixture-out protocols to test generalization to unseen chemical environments.\n> Our results demonstrate that classical tabular methods (e.g., Gradient-Boosted Decision Trees) and large language model embeddings (e.g., Qwen-7B) struggle with quantitative precision, yielding Mean Squared Errors (MSE) of 0.099 and 0.129, respectively. In contrast, we propose a hybrid GNN-based architecture that integrates Graph Attention Networks (GATs) with Differential Reaction Fingerprints (DRFP) and learned mixture-aware solvent encodings. This approach achieves an \\textbf{MSE of 0.0039} ($\\pm$ 0.0003), representing a 60\\% error reduction over competitive baselines and a $&gt;25\\times$ improvement over tabular ensembles. Ablation studies confirm that explicit molecular graph message-passing and continuous mixture encoding are essential for robust generalization. The complete dataset, evaluation protocols, and reference implementations are released to facilitate data-efficient reaction prediction and continuous solvent representation learning.

      "title": "Towards global reaction feasibility and robustness prediction with high throughput data and bayesian deep learning",
      "text": "## Introduction\n\nPredicting the feasibility of any given reaction has been a fundamental yet long perplexing problem for organic chemists. Addressing this issue would enable organic chemists to swiftly rule out non-viable reactions during the synthesis design process, thereby saving enormous time while navigating complex pathways to synthesize highly valuable compounds[1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-59812-0#ref-CR1). This is particularly critical in the field of medicinal chemistry, where time and cost constraints are crucial during stages such as early drug discovery and preclinical process development[2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-59812-0#ref-CR2), [3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-59812-0#ref-CR3). However, to date, no universal \u201coracle\u201d exists to definitively predict the feasibility of a reaction before experimental validation[4](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-59812-0#ref-CR4). Although theoretical advances in the reactivity of organic compounds have progressed rapidly, a complete understanding of the causal relationships between molecular structures and reaction outcomes based solely on first principles remains elusive. Emerging statistical learning methods that leverage existing literature data show promise but are still in their early stage, mainly due to the lack of negative results in published data[5](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-59812-0#ref-CR5), [6](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-59812-0#ref-CR6). In practice, identifying feasible reactions is still a task that highly relies on the expertise and intuition of seasoned experts in organic chemistry[7](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-59812-0#ref-CR7). Training such experts requires both smart learning strategies and rigorous efforts. Similarly, developing an artificial intelligence (AI) system that matches the performance of such experts requires smart strategies to navigate global chemical space using minimal data amount and systematically acquiring extensive, unbiased wetlab data automatically. Despite many promising pioneering works[2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-59812-0#ref-CR2), [5](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-59812-0#ref-CR5), [8](http://www.nature.com/www.nature.com#ref-CR8), [9](http://www.nature.com/www.nature.com#ref-CR9), [10](http://www.nature.com/www.nature.com#ref-CR10), [11](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-59812-0#ref-CR11), researchers are still in the early exploring stage to build an AI system that can steadily serve as an \u201coracle\u201d to predict the feasibility of any given organic reaction.\n\nBeneath the surface of predicting reaction feasibility lies a more complex challenge: assessing the robustness of reactions. The results of organic reactions can be influenced by many factors, _e.g_., minor changes in environments (moisture, oxygen level, light, _etc_.), nuanced differences in analytical and separation methods, and subtle variations in manual operations. This intrinsic stochasticity often makes certain sensitive reactions difficult to replicate across different laboratories. Scaling up such sensitive reactions to an industrial level requires enormous efforts in process and operational control. Consequently, process engineers frequently seek alternative reactions that are less sensitive and more reliable whenever possible. Therefore, there is a strong demand for an AI system capable of pre-emptively assessing reaction robustness. However, this task is also extremely challenging. The main reasons lie in two aspects: firstly, to build such an AI system, a high-throughput and autonomous method to navigate the enormous chemical space is needed, but not attainable. Secondly, to understand the underlying uncertainty for organic reactions, fine-grained uncertainty analysis and disentanglement based on the results of chemical space exploration is necessary, however, there has been no such demonstration to dig the intrinsic stochasticity of chemical reactions systematically. To date, the problem of estimating the robustness of chemical reactions is still unsolved.\n\nIn this work, we demonstrate a synergistic and systematic solution based on high-throughput experimentation (HTE) and Bayesian deep learning to effectively tackle the challenges of feasibility and robustness estimation in organic reactions. We present (1) an extensive wetlab dataset based on an automated HTE platform developed by our team; (2) a model uncertainty-driven learning strategy to navigate a broad chemical space with minimal data requirements to predict reaction feasibility; and (3) a data uncertainty analysis procedure to grasp intrinsic stochasticity for the estimation of reaction robustness. The overall workflow described in this work is shown in Fig.\u00a0[1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-59812-0#Fig1). Specifically, we focus on acid amine coupling reactions, which are most widely reported and used in organic synthesis, yet remain challenging to assess for feasibility and robustness, even for experienced bench chemists[12](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-59812-0#ref-CR12). We conduct 11,669 reactions for 8095 target products at 200\u2013300\u2009\u03bcL scale, covering 272 acids, 231 amines, 6 condensation reagents, 2 bases, and 1 solvent, on an in-house HTE platform within 156 instrument working hours to explore both the substrate and condition space of general acid amine condensation reactions rationally and globally. The overall chemical space explored is shown in Fig.\u00a0[2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-59812-0#Fig2) a. To the best of our knowledge, this is the most extensive single reaction-type HTE dataset covering a broad chemical space at a volume scale practical for industrial delivery[13](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-59812-0#ref-CR13). It is also the HTE dataset that covers the most target products to date. Based on the HTE data, our Bayesian neural network (BNN) model achieves a feasibility prediction accuracy of 89.48% and an F1 score of 0.86, outperforming existing feasibility prediction approaches on broad chemical spaces. With fine-grained uncertainty disentanglement, we identify the modeling and chemical origins of prediction uncertainty and demonstrate that an active learning strategy saves \u00a0~\u200980% data for feasibility prediction. At the same time, we discover that extensive experimental exploration contributes to high-quality uncertainty estimation. We correlate the intrinsic data uncertainty with the robustness of chemical reactions. This is validated by the analysis of reactions reported on the mg scale and in the kg/ton scale in the literature. We note here that our work focuses on the reaction process without considering the feasibility or robustness during the separation process. Diverging from nearly all existing HTE works in organic synthesis, our approach demonstrated a potential way to combine HTE and Bayesian deep learning to systematically answer the questions about reaction feasibility and robustness, thus enabling highly efficient organic synthesis and scaling up.\n\n**Fig. 1: Overall workflow combining HTE and bayesian deep learning to estimate reaction feasibility and robustness against environmental factors.**\n\nWetlab data is collected using automated HTE, followed by probabilistic modeling using Bayesian neural networks. The uncertainty is disentangled into epistemic uncertainty and aleatoric uncertainty. Epistemic uncertainty originates from insufficient data and is used for further design of experiments (DoE). Aleatoric uncertainty is linked to the intrinsic noise of experimentation and is demonstrated to be an indicator of reaction robustness. We also found extensive HTE exploration enhances the quality of uncertainty estimation.\n\n[Full size image](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-59812-0/figures/1)\n\n**Fig. 2: Data analysis of the automated HTE data and substrate down-sampling process.**\n\n**a** Overvie...",

      "text": "## Abstract\nArtificial intelligence is driving one of the most important revolutions in organic chemistry. Multiple platforms, including tools for reaction prediction and synthesis planning based on machine learning, have successfully become part of the organic chemists\u2019 daily laboratory, assisting in domain-specific synthetic problems. Unlike reaction prediction and retrosynthetic models, the prediction of reaction yields has received less attention in spite of the enormous potential of accurately predicting reaction conversion rates. Reaction yields models, describing the percentage of the reactants converted to the desired products, could guide chemists and help them select high-yielding reactions and score synthesis routes, reducing the number of attempts. So far, yield predictions have been predominantly performed for high-throughput experiments using a categorical (one-hot) encoding of reactants, concatenated molecular fingerprints, or computed chemical descriptors. Here, we extend the application of natural language processing architectures to predict reaction properties given a text-based representation of the reaction, using an encoder transformer model combined with a regression layer. We demonstrate outstanding prediction performance on two high-throughput experiment reactions sets. An analysis of the yields reported in the open-source USPTO data set shows that their distribution differs depending on the mass scale, limiting the data set applicability in reaction yields predictions.\n## Related\nPaper\n### [Transfer learning enables the molecular transformer to predict regio- and stereoselective reactions on carbohydrates](https://research.ibm.com/publications/transfer-learning-enables-the-molecular-transformer-to-predict-regio-and-stereoselective-reactions-on-carbohydrates)\nPaper\n### [Comparison of computational methods for the electrochemical stability window of solid-state electrolyte materials](https://research.ibm.com/publications/comparison-of-computational-methods-for-the-electrochemical-stability-window-of-solid-state-electrolyte-materials)\nPoster\n### [Molecular transformer-aided biocatalysed synthesis planning](https://research.ibm.com/publications/molecular-transformer-aided-biocatalysed-synthesis-planning)\nShort paper\n### [Simulating fluid flow at pore scale with carbon dioxide in digital rock](https://research.ibm.com/publications/simulating-fluid-flow-at-pore-scale-with-carbon-dioxide-in-digital-rock)\n[View all publications](https://research.ibm.com/publications)",

Despite compelling performance on popular benchmark tasks, strange and erroneous predictions sometimes ensue when using these models in practice. The core issue is that common benchmarks test models in an in-distribution setting, whereas many real-world uses for these models are in out-of-distribution settings and require a greater degree of extrapolation. To better understand how current reaction predictors work in out-of-distribution domains, we report a series of more challenging evaluations of a prototypical SMILES-based deep learning model. First, we illustrate how performance on randomly sampled datasets is overly optimistic compared to performance when generalizing to new patents or new authors. Second, we conduct time splits that evaluate how models perform when tested on reactions published in years after those in their training set, mimicking real-world deployment. Finally, we consider extrapolation across reaction classes to reflect what would be required for the discovery of novel reaction types. This panel of tasks can reveal the capabilities and limitations of today's reaction predictors, acting as a crucial first step in the development of tomorrow's next-generation models capable of reaction discovery.\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| Subjects: | Machine Learning (cs.LG); Chemical Physics (physics.chem-ph) |\n| Cite as: | [arXiv:2501.06669](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06669) \\[cs.LG\\] |\n| (or [arXiv:2501.06669v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06669v1) \\[cs.LG\\] for this version) |\n| [https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2501.06669](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2501.06669) <br>Focus to learn more<br>arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite |\n\n## Submission history\n\nFrom: John Bradshaw \\[ [view email](https://arxiv.org/show-email/47bd441c/2501.06669)\\] **\\[v1\\]**\nSat, 11 Jan 2025 23:49:14 UTC (2,297 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled Challenging reaction prediction models to generalize to novel chemistry, by John Bradshaw and 5 other authors\n\n- [View PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.06669)\n- [HTML (experimental)](https://arxiv.org/html/2501.06669v1)\n- [TeX Source](https://arxiv.org/src/2501.06669)\n\n[view license](http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/)\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.LG\n\n[<\u00a0prev](https://arxiv.org/prevnext?id=2501.06669&function=prev&context=cs.LG)\u00a0 \\| \u00a0[next\u00a0>](https://arxiv.org/prevnext?id=2501.06669&function=next&context=cs.LG)\n\n[new](https://arxiv.org/list/cs.LG/new) \\| [recent](https://arxiv.org/list/cs.LG/recent) \\| [2025-01](https://arxiv.org/list/cs.LG/2025-01)\n\nChange to browse by:\n\n[cs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06669?context=cs) [physics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06669?context=physics) [physics.chem-ph](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06669?context=physics.chem-ph)\n\n### References & Citations\n\n- [NASA ADS](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/arXiv:2501.06669)\n- [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?arxiv_id=2501.06669)\n- [Semantic Scholar](https://api.semanticscholar.org/arXiv:2501.06669)\n\nexport BibTeX citationLoading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\nBibliographic Tools\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer Toggle\n\nBibliographic Explorer _( [What is the Explorer?](https://info.arxiv.org/labs/showcase.html#arxiv-bibliographic-explorer))_\n\nConnected Papers Toggle\n\nConnected Papers _( [What is Connected Papers?](https://www.connectedpapers.com/about))_\n\nLitmaps Toggle\n\nLitmaps _( [What is Litmaps?](https://www.litmaps.co/))_\n\nscite.ai Toggle\n\nscite Smart Citations _( [What are Smart Citations?](https://www.scite.ai/))_\n\nCode, Data, Media\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv Toggle\n\nalphaXiv _( [What is alphaXiv?](https://alphaxiv.org/))_\n\nLinks to Code Toggle\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers _( [What is CatalyzeX?](https://www.catalyzex.com))_\n\nDagsHub Toggle\n\nDagsHub _( [What is DagsHub?](https://dagshub.com/))_\n\nGotitPub Toggle\n\nGotit.pub _( [What is GotitPub?](http://gotit.pub/faq))_\n\nHuggingface Toggle\n\nHugging Face _( [What is Huggingface?](https://huggingface.co/huggingface))_\n\nLinks to Code Toggle\n\nPapers with Code _( [What is Papers with Code?](https://paperswithcode.com/))_\n\nScienceCast Toggle\n\nScienceCast _( [What is ScienceCast?](https://sciencecast.org/welcome))_\n\nDemos\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate Toggle\n\nReplicate _( [What is Replicate?](https://replicate.com/docs/arxiv/about))_\n\nSpaces Toggle\n\nHugging Face Spaces _( [What is Spaces?](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/spaces))_\n\nSpaces Toggle\n\nTXYZ.AI _( [What is TXYZ.AI?](https://txyz.ai))_\n\nRelated Papers\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nLink to Influence Flower\n\nInfluence Flower _( [What are Influence Flowers?](https://influencemap.cmlab.dev/))_\n\nCore recommender toggle\n\nCORE Recommender _( [What is CORE?](https://core.ac.uk/services/recommender))_\n\nIArxiv recommender toggle\n\nIArxiv Recommender _( [What is IArxiv?](https://iarxiv.org/about))_\n\n- Author\n- Venue\n- Institution\n- Topic\n\nAbout arXivLabs\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

Despite the recent advance in machine learning, a scarcity of reliable data has hindered the development of predictive models that are generalizable for diverse reactions and solvents. In this work, we generate a large set of data with the COSMO-RS method for over 28\u2006000 neutral reactions and 295 solvents and train a machine learning model to predict the solvation free energy and solvation enthalpy of activation (\u0394\u0394 _G_\u2021solv, \u0394\u0394 _H_\u2021solv) for a solution phase reaction. On unseen reactions, the model achieves mean absolute errors of 0.71 and 1.03 kcal mol\u22121 for \u0394\u0394 _G_\u2021solv and \u0394\u0394 _H_\u2021solv, respectively, relative to the COSMO-RS calculations. The model also provides reliable predictions of relative rate constants within a factor of 4 when tested on experimental data. The presented model can provide nearly instantaneous predictions of kinetic solvent effects or relative rate constants for a broad range of neutral closed-shell or free radical reactions and solvents only based on atom-mapped reaction SMILES and solvent SMILES strings.\n\n![Graphical abstract: Machine learning from quantum chemistry to predict experimental solvent effects on reaction rates](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/Image/Get?imageInfo.ImageType=GA&imageInfo.ImageIdentifier.ManuscriptID=D3SC05353A&imageInfo.ImageIdentifier.Year=2024)\n\n- This article is part of the themed collections:\n[#MyFirstChemSci 2024](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/journals/articlecollectionlanding?sercode=sc&themeid=26a1e262-5929-453c-b3a7-f61b43147ce2) and [Most popular 2024 physical, theoretical and computational chemistry articles](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/journals/articlecollectionlanding?sercode=sc&themeid=777d3e88-b794-457a-8932-5995aa89df7b)\n\nThis article is Open Access\n\n![](https://www.rsc-cdn.org/pubs-core/2022.0.171/content/NewImages/Ajax-GA-Loader.gif)\nPlease wait while we load your content...\nSomething went wrong.

Models based on machine learning have emerged as a promising alternative to address these problems, but these models currently lack the precision to give crucial information on the magnitude of barrier heights, influence of solvents and catalysts and extent of regio- and chemoselectivity. Here, we construct hybrid models which combine the traditional transition state modelling and machine learning to accurately predict reaction barriers. We train a Gaussian Process Regression model to reproduce high-quality experimental kinetic data for the nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction and use it to predict barriers with a mean absolute error of 0.77 kcal mol\u22121 for an external test set. The model was further validated on regio- and chemoselectivity prediction on patent reaction data and achieved a competitive top-1 accuracy of 86%, despite not being trained explicitly for this task. Importantly, the model gives error bars for its predictions that can be used for risk assessment by the end user. Hybrid models emerge as the preferred alternative for accurate reaction prediction in the very common low-data situation where only 100\u2013150 rate constants are available for a reaction class. With recent advances in deep learning for quickly predicting barriers and transition state geometries from density functional theory, we envision that hybrid models will soon become a standard alternative to complement current machine learning approaches based on ground-state physical organic descriptors or structural information such as molecular graphs or fingerprints.\n\n* * *\n\n## Introduction\n\nAccurate prediction of chemical reactions is an important goal both in academic and industrial research. [1\u20133](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2021/sc/d0sc04896h#cit1) Recently, machine learning approaches have had tremendous success in quantitative prediction of reaction yields based on data from high-throughput experimentation [4,5](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2021/sc/d0sc04896h#cit4) and enantioselectivities based on carefully selected universal training sets. [6](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2021/sc/d0sc04896h#cit6) At the same time, traditional quantitative structure\u2013reactivity relationship (QSRR) methods based on linear regression have seen a renaissance with interpretable, holistic models that can generalize across reaction types. [7](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2021/sc/d0sc04896h#cit7) In parallel with these developments of quantitative prediction methods, deep learning models trained on reaction databases containing millions of patent and literature data have made quick qualitative yes/no feasibility prediction routine for almost any reaction type. [8](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2021/sc/d0sc04896h#cit8)\n\nIn the pharmaceutical industry, prediction tools have great potential to accelerate synthesis of prospective drugs ( [Fig. 1a](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2021/sc/d0sc04896h#imgfig1)). [9](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2021/sc/d0sc04896h#cit9) Quick prediction is essential in the discovery phase, especially within the context of automation and rapid synthesis of a multitude of candidates for initial activity screening. [3,10,11](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2021/sc/d0sc04896h#cit3) In these circumstances, a simple yes/no as provided by classification models is usually sufficient. More accurate prediction is necessary in the later drug development process, where the synthesis route and formulation of one or a few promising drug candidates is optimized. Here, regression models that give the reaction activation energy can be used to predict both absolute reactivity and selectivity ( [Fig. 1b](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2021/sc/d0sc04896h#imgfig1)). Prediction of absolute reactivity can be used to assess feasibility under process-relevant conditions, while prediction of selectivity is key to reducing purification steps. Predictive tools therefore hold great promise for accelerating route and process development, ultimately delivering medicines to patients both faster and at lower costs.\n\n|     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| [![image file: d0sc04896h-f1.tif](https://pubs.rsc.org/image/article/2021/SC/d0sc04896h/d0sc04896h-f1.gif)](https://pubs.rsc.org/image/article/2021/SC/d0sc04896h/d0sc04896h-f1_hi-res.gif) |\n|  | **Fig. 1**(a) Example of synthetic route to a drug compound.

Since rising to prominence in the early 90s, DFT has enjoyed extraordinary success in rationalizing reactivity and selectivity across the reaction spectrum by modelling the full reaction mechanism. [12](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2021/sc/d0sc04896h#cit12) The success of DFT can be traced in part due to a fortuitous cancellation of errors, which makes it particularly suited for properties such as enantioselectivity, which depends on the relative energies of two structurally very similar transition states (TSs). However, this cancellation of errors does not generally extend to the prediction of the absolute magnitude of reactions barriers (activation free energies, \u0394G\u2021). In particular, DFT struggles with one very important class of reactions: ionic reactions in solution. Plata and Singleton even sug...",

Despite the recent advance in machine learning, a scarcity of reliable data has hindered the development of predictive models that are generalizable for diverse reactions and solvents. In this work, we generate a large set of data with the COSMO-RS method for over 28,000 neutral reactions and 295 solvents and train a machine learning model to predict the solvation free energy and solvation enthalpy of activation (\u0394\u0394G\u2021solv, \u0394\u0394H\u2021solv) for a solution phase reaction. On unseen reactions, the model achieves mean absolute errors of 0.71 and 1.03 kcal/mol for \u0394\u0394G\u2021solv and \u0394\u0394H\u2021solv, respectively, relative to the COSMO-RS calculations. The model also provides reliable predictions of relative rate constants within a factor of 4 when tested on experimental data. The presented model can provide nearly instantaneous predictions of kinetic solvent effects or relative rate constants for a broad range of neutral closed-shell or free radical reactions and solvents only based on atom-mapped reaction SMILES and solvent SMILES strings.\n## Keywords\n[kinetic solvent effect](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/search-dashboard?keywords=kinetic%20solvent%20effect)\n[solution phase reaction](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/search-dashboard?keywords=solution%20phase%20reaction)\n[solvation free energy](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/search-dashboard?keywords=solvation%20free%20energy)\n[COSMO-RS](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/search-dashboard?keywords=COSMO-RS)\n[machine learning for reaction](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/search-dashboard?keywords=machine%20learning%20for%20reaction)\n## Supplementary materials\n**Title**\n**Description**\n**Actions**\n**Title**\n![](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/_nuxt/img/pdfIcon.1fd0100.svg)\nSupporting Information\n**Description**\nDetails on data sets, machine learning models, and pre-training set results\n**Actions**\n**Download(2 MB)**\n## Supplementary weblinks\n**Title**\n**Description**\n**Actions**\n**Title**\n![](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/_nuxt/img/Weblink.b642c15.svg)\nData sets and machine learning model files\n**Description**\nData sets and machine learning model files\n**Actions**\n[**View**](https://zenodo.org/record/8423911)\n**Title**\n![](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/_nuxt/img/Weblink.b642c15.svg)\nSample code for the machine learning model\n**Description**\nIncludes a sample code for making predictions using the fine-tuned machine learning model\n**Actions**\n[**View**](https://github.com/yunsiechung/chemprop/tree/RxnSolvKSE_ML)\n## Comments\nYou are signed in as .
