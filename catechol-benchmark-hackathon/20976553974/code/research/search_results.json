However, chemical datasets are often inaccessible to the machine\n4 learning community as they tend to require cleaning, thorough understanding of the\n5 chemistry, or are simply not available. In this paper, we introduce a novel dataset\n6 for yield prediction, providing the first-ever transient flow dataset for machine\n7 learning benchmarking, covering over 1200 process conditions. While previous\n8 datasets focus on discrete parameters, our experimental set-up allow us to sample\n9 a large number of continuous process conditions, generating new challenges for\n10 machine learning models. We focus on solvent selection, a task that is particularly\n11 difficult to model theoretically and therefore ripe for machine learning applica\u000212 tions. We showcase benchmarking for regression algorithms, transfer-learning\n13 approaches, feature engineering, and active learning, with important applications\n14 towards solvent replacement and sustainable manufacturing.\n15 1 Introduction\n16 Machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) have showcased enormous potential in em\u000217 powering the world of the natural sciences: from famous examples such as AlphaFold for protein\n18 predictions [1], to fusion reactor control [2], disease detection [3], battery design [4], and material\n19 discovery [5], among many more. However, we seldom see the machine learning community bench\u000220 mark new methods in physical science datasets, mostly due to the difficulty in cleaning real-world\n21 data, the need for interdisciplinary understanding to correctly benchmark, and most importantly, how\n22 expensive the data can be to produce, resulting in many datasets being locked behind closed doors by\n23 large companies.\n24 AIchemy (https://aichemy.ac.uk) is an interdisciplinary UK hub with the mission of transform\u000225 ing the chemistry-AI interface via aiding the collaboration of chemists and AI researchers, as well as\n26 addressing gaps in data standards, curation, and availability for AI use. In partnership with SOLVE\n27 Chemistry (https://www.solvechemistry.com), we present a first important step into addressing\n28 the dataset gap with the introduction of a new and unique open dataset for benchmarking low-data\n29 machine learning algorithms for chemistry.\n30 Solvent selection is one of the biggest challenges for chemical manufacturing, with solvents often\n31 being the main source of waste in the manufacturing process [6]. Increased regulation on solvents and\n32 a drive to making process manufacturing more sustainable led to an interest in the discovery of greener\n\u2217\nt.boyne23@imperial.ac.uk ;\n\u2020\njose@solvechemistry.com\nSubmitted to 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025). Do not distribute.\nFigure 1: Data was gathered on the rearrangement of allyl substituted catechol. By subjecting the\nreaction mixture to high temperatures, we begin a cascade reaction forming multiple rearrangement\nproducts. We investigate the yield of the reaction for a range of different solvents. Product 1 was not\nobserved and reacted immediately to form Product 2 and later 3.\n33 solvents and for improved solvent replacement tools. However, most of the solvent replacement tools\n34 focus purely on learning unsupervised representations of solvents, with the hope that experimentalists\n35 can find solvents with similar properties to replace those with environmental concerns. A much\n36 stronger approach would consider the interaction of a variety of different solvents with a reaction of\n37 interest to directly predict reaction yields, in such a way that the best possible solvent can be selected\n38 according to a yield-sustainability trade-off.\n39 Machine learning approaches have been shown to be a powerful tool for the prediction of chemical\n40 reaction conditions. Success has been reported in retro-synthesis [7, 8], condition recommendations\n41 [9], product predictions [10, 11], among others. While yield prediction has proven to be more difficult\n42 due to large inconsistencies in procedure and data reporting [12], we have still seen promising yield\n43 prediction results for smaller and more carefully curated datasets [13\u201316]. However, these datasets\n44 lack the continuous reaction conditions, such as temperature and residence time, that are required to\n45 scale-up processes to practical manufacturing conditions.\n46 In this paper, we release the first machine-learning-ready transient flow dataset, a framework that\n47 allows for quick and efficient screening of continuous reaction conditions. We specifically provide\n48 yield data over the uni-molecular allyl substituted catechol reaction, shown in Figure 1, with dense\n49 measurements across the residence time, temperature, and solvent space. We answer the call for\n50 more flow chemistry reaction data [17], further showcase how this type of kinetic data poses new\n51 challenges to current machine learning methods for chemistry, and identify potential solutions.\n52 1.1 Related works\n53 Reaction datasets are common in chemistry research, but their suitability for machine learning\n54 benchmarking tends to be poor. This can be a result of improper formatting or documentation,\n55 incomplete information about reaction conditions or the experimental set-up, or the lack of machine\n56 readability, leading to limited usage by the ML community. However, some effort has been made\n57 to address this, with the biggest example being the creation of the Open Reaction Database (ORD)\n58 [18], a repository containing over 2M different reactions, many of which come from US patent data\n59 (USPTO) [19]. However, the dataset falls short in some aspects, in particular with respect to machine\n60 learning readiness and data inconsistencies across reactions.\n61 ORDerly [12] allows for easy cleaning and preparation of ORD data, showing the promise of the\n62 dataset for forward and retro-synthetic prediction using transformers; however, it also shows that\n63 yield prediction cannot be done well due to data inconsistencies. Schwaller et al. [13] drew similar\n64 conclusions when using the USPTO dataset, stating that reaction conditions such as temperature,\n65 concentrations, and duration have a significant effect on yield. The assumption that every reaction in\n66 the dataset is optimized for reaction parameters proved too loose, resulting in inaccurate predictive\n67 models for yield, and highlighting the importance of creating datasets with full (including potentially\n68 sub-optimal) reaction conditions.\n69 More relevant to our work, Perera et al. [20] introduced a dataset of 5760 Suzuki-Miyaura cross\u000270 coupling reactions, Ahneman et al. [21] introduced a dataset of 3956 Buchwald\u2013Hartwig aminations,\n71 and Prieto Kullmer et al. [22] investigated screening additives for Ni-catalysed reactions, all for the\n72 purposes of yield prediction. The datasets have been used in the benchmarking of Gaussian processes\n73 and Bayesian neural networks [14], deep learning models [13], language-model-based embeddings\n2\n74 [16], data augmentation techniques [23], and Bayesian optimisation [15]. In each case, the datasets\n75 focus on discrete reaction variables, such as ligand, base, additives, or reactants at fixed temperatures\n76 and residence times. We are instead introducing a dataset rich in continuous reaction conditions (in\n77 our case temperature ...",

The efficacy of such models depends heavily on the representation of chemical reactions, which has commonly been learned from SMILES or graphs of molecules using deep neural networks. However, the progression of chemical reactions is inherently determined by the molecular 3D geometric properties, which have been recently highlighted as crucial features in accurately predicting molecular properties and chemical reactions. Additionally, large-scale pre-training has been shown to be essential in enhancing the generalization capability of complex deep learning models. Based on these considerations, we propose the Reaction Multi-View Pre-training (ReaMVP) framework, which leverages self-supervised learning techniques and a two-stage pre-training strategy to predict chemical reaction yields. By incorporating multi-view learning with 3D geometric information, ReaMVP achieves state-of-the-art performance on two benchmark datasets. Notably, the experimental results indicate that ReaMVP has a significant advantage in predicting out-of-sample data, suggesting an enhanced generalization ability to predict new reactions. Scientific Contribution: This study presents the ReaMVP framework, which improves the generalization capability of machine learning models for predicting chemical reaction yields. By integrating sequential and geometric views and leveraging self-supervised learning techniques with a two-stage pre-training strategy, ReaMVP achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets. The framework demonstrates superior predictive ability for out-of-sample data and enhances the prediction of new reactions.\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n![](https://media.springernature.com/w215h120/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1186%2Fs13321-024-00818-z/MediaObjects/13321_2024_818_Fig1_HTML.png)\n### [Improving chemical reaction yield prediction using pre-trained graph neural networks](https://link.springer.com/10.1186/s13321-024-00818-z?fromPaywallRec=true)\nArticleOpen access01 March 2024\n![](https://media.springernature.com/w215h120/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1186%2Fs13321-024-00805-4/MediaObjects/13321_2024_805_Figa_HTML.png)\n### [Enhancing chemical synthesis: a two-stage deep neural network for predicting feasible reaction conditions](https://link.springer.com/10.1186/s13321-024-00805-4?fromPaywallRec=true)\nArticleOpen access24 January 2024\n![](https://media.springernature.com/w215h120/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-024-55082-4/MediaObjects/41467_2024_55082_Fig1_HTML.png)\n### [Multi-channel learning for integrating structural hierarchies into context-dependent molecular representation](https://link.springer.com/10.1038/s41467-024-55082-4?fromPaywallRec=true)\nArticleOpen access06 January 2025\n### Explore related subjects\nDiscover the latest articles, books and news in related subjects, suggested using machine learning.\n* [Biochemical Reaction Network](https://link.springer.com/subjects/biochemical-reaction-network)\n* [Process Chemistry](https://link.springer.com/subjects/process-chemistry)\n* [Reactive Precursor](https://link.springer.com/subjects/reactive-precursor)\n* [Reaction Kinetics](https://link.springer.com/subjects/reaction-kinetics)\n* [Reaction Mechanisms](https://link.springer.com/subjects/reaction-mechanisms)\n* [Structure Prediction](https://link.springer.com/subjects/structure-prediction)\n[Use our pre-submission checklist](https://beta.springernature.com/pre-submission?journalId=13321)\nAvoid common mistakes on your manuscript.\n## Introduction\nThe prediction of chemical reaction yields, which refer to the percentage of product formed in relation to the reactant consumed, is an important research topic in organic chemistry [[1](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13321-024-00815-2#ref-CR1),[2](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13321-024-00815-2#ref-CR2)]. In the field of organic synthesis, chemists often synthesize a target molecule through several or a dozen reaction steps [[3](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13321-024-00815-2#ref-CR3)]. Consequently, low-yield reactions in the intermediate steps can have a negative impact on the total yield of the synthesis route due to the cumulative effect of each step. The estimation of chemical reaction yields plays an important role in guiding synthetic chemists to choose appropriate molecular synthesis routes, particularly in the case of identifying highly active and selective catalysts efficiently. Traditionally, chemists depend on empirical predictions or specific wet experiments to determine yields, which require extensive domain knowledge and are both time-consuming and labor-intensive. Therefore, data-driven machine learning techniques are needed to provide an efficient alternative.\nIt remains a great challenge to accurately predict chemical reaction yields due to the complexity of reaction space and the diverse factors that influence chemical experiments [[4](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13321-024-00815-2#ref-CR4),[5](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13321-024-00815-2#ref-CR5)]. To develop machine learning-based approaches, it is crucial to establish effective methods for representing chemical reactions. Conventional studies typically rely on feature engineering to represent chemical reactions using fingerprints or descriptors. This involves creating customized descriptors based on domain expertise to capture molecular, atomic, vibrational, or physicochemical properties [[6](#ref-CR6),[7](#ref-CR7),[8](#ref-CR8),[9](#ref-CR9),[10](#ref-CR10),[11](#ref-CR11),[12](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13321-024-00815-2#ref-CR12)]. Some researchers derived descriptors from circular substructures present in the simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES) [[13](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13321-024-00815-2#ref-CR13)] strings of the reactions [[14](https:/...",

Multiple platforms, including tools for reaction prediction and synthesis planning based on machine learning, successfully became part of the organic chemists\u2019 daily laboratory, assisting in domain-specific synthetic problems. Unlike reaction prediction and retrosynthetic models, reaction yields models have been less investigated, despite the enormous potential of accurately predicting them. Reaction yields models, describing the percentage of the reactants that is converted to the desired products, could guide chemists and help them select high-yielding reactions and score synthesis routes, reducing the number of attempts. So far, yield predictions have been predominantly performed for high-throughput experiments using a categorical (one-hot) encoding of reactants, concatenated molecular fingerprints, or computed chemical descriptors. Here, we extend the application of natural language processing architectures to predict reaction properties given a text-based representation of the reaction, using an encoder transformer model combined with a regression layer. We demonstrate outstanding prediction performance on two high-throughput experiment reactions sets. An analysis of the yields reported in the open-source USPTO data set shows that their distribution differs depending on the mass scale, limiting the dataset applicability in reaction yields predictions.\nThis repository complements our studies on[predicting chemical reaction yields](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2632-2153/abc81d)(published in Machine Learning: Science and Technology) and[data augmentation and uncertainty estimation for yield predictions](https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv.13286741)(presented at the Machine Learning for Molecules Workshop at NeurIPS 2020).\n## Install[](#Install)\nAs the library is based on the chemoinformatics toolkit[RDKit](http://www.rdkit.org)it is best installed using the[Anaconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)package manager.

Make sure that the pretrained model (from which you start training) is loaded from a folder with the same structure as for our[rxnfp models](https://github.com/rxn4chemistry/rxnfp/tree/master/rxnfp/models/transformers/bert_pretrained).\n## Approach - predicting yields from reaction SMILES[](#Approach---predicting-yields-from-reaction-SMILES)\nTransformer models have recently revolutionised Natural Language Processing and were also successfully applied to task in chemistry, using a text-based representation of molecules and chemical reactions called Simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES).\nSequence-2-Sequence transformers as in[Attention is all you need](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/7181-attention-is-all-you-need)were used for:\n* Chemical Reaction Prediction\n* [Molecular Transformer: A Model for Uncertainty-Calibrated Chemical Reaction](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acscentsci.9b00576)\n* [Carbohydrate Transformer: Predicting Regio- and Stereoselective Reactions Using Transfer Learning](http://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv.11935635)\n* Multi-step retrosynthesis\n* [Predicting retrosynthetic pathways using a combined linguistic model and hyper-graph exploration strategy](http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9sc05704h)\n* [Unassisted Noise-Reduction of Chemical Reactions Data Sets](https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Unassisted_Noise-Reduction_of_Chemical_Reactions_Data_Sets/12395120/1)\nEncoder Transformers like[BERT](https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkZmKmWOWH)and[ALBERT](https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1eA7AEtvS)for:\n* Reaction fingerprints and classification\n* [Mapping the Space of Chemical Reactions using Attention-Based Neural Networks](https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Data-Driven_Chemical_Reaction_Classification_with_Attention-Based_Neural_Networks/9897365)\n* Atom rearrangements during chemical reactions\n* [Unsupervised Attention-Guided Atom-Mapping](https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Unsupervised_Attention-Guided_Atom-Mapping/12298559)\nThose studies show that Transformer models are able to learn organic chemistry and chemical reactions from SMILES.\nHere we asked the question, how well a**BERT**model would perform when applied to a**yield prediction**task:\n![](https://rxn4chemistry.github.io/rxn_yields/images/pipeline.jpg)\n**Figure:**Pipeline and task description.\nTo do so, we started with the reaction fingerprint models from the[rxnfp](https://rxn4chemistry.github.io/rxnfp/)library and added a fine-tuning regression head through[SimpleTransformers.ai](https://simpletransformers.ai). As we don't need to change the hyperparameters of the base model, we only tune the learning rate for the training and the dropout probability.\nWe explored two high-throughput experiment (HTE) data sets and then also the yields data found in the USPTO data base.\n## Buchwald-Hartwig HTE data set[](#Buchwald-Hartwig-HTE-data-set)\n### Canonical reaction representation[](#Canonical-reaction-representation)\nOne of the best studied reaction yield is the one that was published by Ahneman et al. in[Predicting reaction performance in C\u2013N cross-coupling using machine learning](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6385/186.full), where the authors have used DFT-computed descriptors as inputs to different machine learning descriptors. There best model was a random forest model. More recently,[one-hot encodings](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/362/6416/eaat8603)and[multi-fingerprint features (MFF)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451929420300851)as input representations were investigated. Here, we show competitive results starting simply from a text-based reaction SMILES input to our models.\n![](https://rxn4chemistry.github.io/rxn_yields/images/buchwald_hartwig.jpg)\n**Figure:**a) Summary of the results on the Buchwald\u2013Hartwig data set. b) Example regression plot for the first random-split.\n### Augmentated reaction representations[](#Augmentated-reaction-representations)\nWe were able to further improve the results on this data set using data augmentation on reaction SMILES (molecule order permuations and SMILES randomisations).

      "text": "# What factors can affect percentage yield?\n\nPercentage yield can be affected by factors such as reaction completion, side reactions, loss of product during purification, and measurement errors.In more detail, the first factor that can affect the percentage yield is whether the reaction has gone to completion. In some cases, a reaction may not have fully completed, meaning not all of the reactants have been converted into the product. This can be due to a variety of reasons, such as insufficient time given for the reaction to occur, or not enough of a certain reactant being present. This would result in a lower percentage yield.Another factor is the occurrence of side reactions. Sometimes, the reactants can react in ways that were not intended, producing different products. This can also lower the percentage yield of the desired product, as some of the reactants have been 'used up' in these side reactions.Loss of product during the purification process is another factor that can affect the percentage yield. After a reaction has taken place, the product is often purified to remove any unreacted reactants or unwanted by-products. However, during this purification process, some of the desired product may also be lost, reducing the overall yield.Lastly, measurement errors can also impact the percentage yield. This could be due to inaccuracies in measuring the amounts of reactants used, or errors in measuring the amount of product obtained. These errors can lead to an overestimation or underestimation of the percentage yield.In conclusion, there are several factors that can affect the percentage yield of a reaction. Understanding these factors can help in planning and carrying out reactions more effectively, and in interpreting the results obtained.\n\nAnswered by [Till - University of Cambridge: Master\u2019s in Chemical Engineering](https://www.tutorchase.com/tutors/till-57502)\n\n[GCSE Chemistry tutor](https://www.tutorchase.com/gcse/chemistry)\n\nStudy and Practice for Free\n\nTrusted by 100,000+ Students Worldwide\n\nAchieve Top Grades in your Exams with our Free Resources.\n\nPractice Questions, Study Notes, and Past Exam Papers for all Subjects!\n\n[IB Resources](https://www.tutorchase.com/resources/ib) [A-Level Resources](https://www.tutorchase.com/resources/a-level) [GCSE Resources](https://www.tutorchase.com/resources/gcse) [IGCSE Resources](https://www.tutorchase.com/resources/igcse)\n\n### Need help from an expert?\n\n4.93/5 based on [733 reviews in](https://www.reviews.co.uk/company-reviews/store/tutorchase)\n\nThe world\u2019s top online tutoring provider trusted by students, parents, and schools globally.\n\n[Hire a tutor](https://www.tutorchase.com/answers/gcse/chemistry/what-factors-can-affect-percentage-yield#hireFormBlock)\n\n## Related Chemistry gcse Answers\n\n[Read All Answers](https://www.tutorchase.com/answers/gcse/chemistry)\n\n[Earn \u00a3 as a Student Ambassador!](https://tally.so/r/mRzZ89)\n\nLoading...\n\nLoading...",

      "text": "<div><div>\n<section>\n<article>\n<h3>Abstract</h3>\n<div>\n<p>Chemical reactions are central for the creation of new materials, drug design and many more fields. Obtaining high reaction yields is of great importance to reduce cost and increase the efficiency and purity of the obtained product. To reduce the number of experiments for high reaction yield screening in organic chemistry, the use of active learning (AL) is an interesting approach. Unfortunately, the majority of AL is based on \u201cretro-AL\u201d where all the reactions are already available. One problem of \u201creal-time\u201d AL is determining when to stop the AL loop without creating an external labeled test set to analyze the performance of the model. The stopping procedure presented in this work is a stopping criterion, namely the stabilization prediction (SP) (Bloodgood <em>et al.</em>, Proceedings of the Thirteenth Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning, 2009, 39\u201347). It uses an unlabeled equivalent of a test set called a stop set to indirectly evaluate the accuracy of the AL loop. To benchmark the stability of this method and investigate its applicability in chemistry, two datasets from the organic literature, four estimators, three types of descriptors, two sizes of queries per iteration (QPI) and stop set size were investigated. We determine that the present method is the most stable with a Support Vector Classification (SVC) estimator, 50 QPI and a stop set size containing 30% of the data. It produces the best compromise between an early stop (consumes less than 50% of the data) and a reliable accuracy over 10 different runs compared to the accuracy obtained with classical supervised machine learning. We do hope that this method would be of use to create \u201creal-time\u201d AL in chemistry.</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n</div>\n</article>\n</section>\n<div>\n<div>\n<h2>Supplementary files</h2>\n<div>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://www.rsc.org/suppdata/d3/re/d3re00628j/d3re00628j1.pdf\">\n<span>\nSupplementary information\n<span> PDF (3206K)</span>\n</span>\n</a>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div>\n<h2>Article information</h2>\n<dl>\n<p>\n</p><dt>DOI</dt>\n<dd><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1039/D3RE00628J\">https://doi.org/10.1039/D3RE00628J</a></dd>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n</p><dt><strong>Article type</strong></dt>\n<dd>Paper</dd>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n</p><dt>Submitted</dt>\n<dd>21 Nov 2023</dd>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n</p><dt>Accepted</dt>\n<dd>25 Jan 2024</dd>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n</p><dt>First published</dt>\n<dd>26 Jan 2024</dd>\n<p></p>\n</dl>\n<div>\n<p>\n</p><h3>\n</h3>\n<p></p>\n<div>\n<p><i><strong>React.
