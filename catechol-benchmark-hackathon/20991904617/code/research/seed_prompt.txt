## Current Status
- Best CV score: 0.008465 (exp_026)
- Best LB score: 0.0887 (exp_026)
- CV-LB gap: ~10x (LB = 4.22*CV + 0.0533)
- Recent failure: Gaussian Process (exp_030) was 101% worse than baseline.

## Response to Evaluator
- Technical verdict: TRUSTWORTHY.
- Evaluator's top priority: Pivot to CatBoost with Aggressive Feature Selection.
- My response: **AGREE**. The GP experiment confirmed that "different inductive bias" alone isn't enough if the model can't handle the data complexity. The analysis in `exploration/evolver_loop31_analysis.ipynb` showed that reducing features from 18 to 10 improved CV MSE by 0.84% with CatBoost. This supports the hypothesis that simpler models with fewer features generalize better.

## Data Understanding
- See `exploration/evolver_loop31_analysis.ipynb` for feature importance analysis.
- Key finding: Top 10 features (Temp, 1000/T, Time, Interaction, Spange_2, 3, 5, 8, 9, 12) carry most of the signal.
- Spange_12, Spange_8, Spange_2 are the most important solvent descriptors.

## Recommended Approaches
Priority-ordered list:
1. **CatBoost with RFE (Top 10 Features)** - Because analysis showed it improves CV and should reduce overfitting (CV-LB gap).
   - Use the exact features identified: `['Time', 'Temp', '1000/T', '1000/T*ln(t)', 'Spange_2', 'Spange_3', 'Spange_5', 'Spange_8', 'Spange_9', 'Spange_12']`
   - Implement CatBoostRegressor with `loss_function='RMSE'`
   - Use the same robust CV scheme (LOO/LORO) as exp_026.
   - Train separate models for each target (Product 2, Product 3, SM).

2. **Quantile Regression with CatBoost** - Because the evaluator suggested it for uncertainty estimation.
   - If the RFE model works, try `loss_function='Quantile:alpha=0.5'` (median) and potentially interval prediction.

## What NOT to Try
- Gaussian Processes (exhausted, poor performance).
- Deep/Complex MLPs (exhausted, overfitting).
- Adding more features (DRFP, etc.) without selection (increases gap).

## Validation Notes
- Use the standard LOO (single) and LORO (full) split generators.
- Calculate overall MSE to compare with exp_026 (0.008465).
