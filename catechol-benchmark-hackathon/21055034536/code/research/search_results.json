      "text": "In machine\u2011learning models for solvent\u2011mixture properties the raw descriptors of the pure components (e.g., molecular fingerprints, polarity indices, boiling point) are rarely used on their own; instead they are combined with composition\u2011dependent constructions that can represent the non\u2011linear way in which two or more solvents interact.  The most common strategies are  \n\n* **Interaction\u2011product terms** \u2013 the simplest way to go beyond a linear blend is to multiply the descriptor of one component by that of the other (or by the mole fraction of the partner).  In the binary\u2011solubility study of rivaroxaban, the authors added cross\u2011terms such as\u202f\\(x_1 d_1\\),\u202f\\(x_2 d_2\\) and\u202f\\(d_1 d_2\\) to a polynomial\u2011regression model, which allowed the regression to capture curvature in the solubility surface that a pure linear\u2011mixing rule could not reproduce\u202f([nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-13090-4)).  \n\n* **Polynomial mixing rules** \u2013 higher\u2011order powers of the composition (e.g.,\u202f\\(x_1^2\\),\u202f\\((1-x_1)^2\\),\u202f\\(x_1(1-x_1)\\)) are appended to the feature vector, effectively turning a linear regressor into a polynomial one.  The viscosity\u2011deviation work on benzyl\u2011alcohol/\u202fn\u2011hexanol/water mixtures employed second\u2011order composition terms together with the pure\u2011component descriptors to fit a quadratic model that reproduced the observed non\u2011ideal deviation\u202f([mdpi.com](https://mdpi-res.com/d_attachment/materials/materials-15-05699/article_deploy/materials-15-05699-v3.pdf)).  \n\n* **Excess\u2011property descriptors** \u2013 thermodynamic excess functions (Gibbs\u2011excess energy, activity coefficients, excess enthalpy, etc.) are calculated from classical models such as UNIQUAC, NRTL or Redlich\u2011Kister expansions and then fed to the ML algorithm as additional features.  In the \u201cmatrix\u2011completion\u201d study the pair\u2011interaction energies predicted by a latent\u2011factor model were inserted directly into the UNIQUAC expression for the excess Gibbs energy; the resulting hybrid model was trained in a Bayesian framework and outperformed purely empirical UNIFAC\u202f([rsc.org](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlepdf/2022/sc/d1sc07210b)).  \n\n* **Redlich\u2011Kister series coefficients** \u2013 the excess property is expressed as \\(\\displaystyle G^{E}= \\sum_{i=0}^{n} L_i (x_1-x_2)^{i}\\).  The coefficients \\(L_i\\) can either be taken from fitted thermodynamic data or treated as learnable parameters that become part of the feature set.  When combined with polynomial regression or kernel\u2011based regressors they give the model the flexibility to reproduce highly asymmetric mixing behavior.  \n\n* **Latent\u2011interaction embeddings** \u2013 recent hybrid approaches for deep\u2011eutectic solvents construct low\u2011dimensional latent vectors for each solvent component; the dot product of two vectors (or a small neural network applied to the pair) serves as an interaction feature that implicitly encodes the Redlich\u2011Kister\u2011type non\u2011linearity.  The review of ML for deep\u2011eutectic solvents highlights such hybrid descriptor engineering as a best practice for capturing complex, nonlinear mixture effects\u202f([sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167732225014941)).  \n\nIn practice these engineered features are fed to standard regression algorithms\u2014linear or ridge regression on the expanded feature matrix, polynomial regression, Gaussian\u2011process regression, random\u2011forest or gradient\u2011boosting trees, and even deep neural networks.  Because the non\u2011linear terms are explicitly present in the input, the learning algorithm can fit curvature, asymmetry, and excess\u2011property trends without having to infer them from raw data alone, leading to more accurate predictions of solubility, viscosity, heat capacity, and other mixture\u2011dependent properties.",

We investigated the solubility of rivaroxaban in both dichloromethane and a variety of primary alcohols at various temperatures and concentrations of solvents to understand its behavior in mixed solvents. Given the complex, non-linear patterns in solubility behavior, three advanced regression approaches were utilized: Polynomial Curve Fitting, a Bayesian-based Neural Network (BNN), and the Neural Oblivious Decision Ensemble (NODE) method. To optimize model performance, hyperparameters were fine-tuned using the Stochastic Fractal Search (SFS) algorithm. Among the tested models, BNN obtained the best precision for fitting, with a test R\u00b2 of 0.9926 and a MSE of 3.07\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u207b\u2078, proving outstanding accuracy in fitting the rivaroxaban data. The NODE model followed BNN, showing a test R\u00b2 of 0.9413 and the lowest MAPE of 0.1835. The Polynomial model yielded a lower test R\u00b2 of 0.8200 and higher error rates, indicating its limitations in unravelling the underlying relationships for the solubility variations. This study shows that advanced machine learning models, particularly BNN and NODE, can predict pharmaceutical solubility and improve crystallization process design and optimization.\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n![](https://media.springernature.com/w215h120/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-025-05535-7/MediaObjects/41598_2025_5535_Fig1_HTML.png)\n### [Machine learning-based analysis on pharmaceutical compounds interaction with polymer to estimate drug solubility in formulations](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-05535-7?fromPaywallRec=false)\nArticleOpen access02 July 2025\n![](https://media.springernature.com/w215h120/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-025-90704-x/MediaObjects/41598_2025_90704_Fig1_HTML.png)\n### [Computational intelligence investigations on evaluation of salicylic acid solubility in various solvents at different temperatures](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-90704-x?fromPaywallRec=false)\nArticleOpen access28 February 2025\n![](https://media.springernature.com/w215h120/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-025-28272-3/MediaObjects/41598_2025_28272_Fig1_HTML.png)\n### [Predicting drug solubility in binary solvent mixtures using graph convolutional networks: a comprehensive deep learning approach](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-28272-3?fromPaywallRec=false)\nArticleOpen access29 November 2025\n## Introduction\nIn pharmaceutical production, solid-based oral formulations require crystallization as the heart of process for recovery of active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) from the synthesis solution. The process of API crystallization relies on reducing drug solubility which can be conducted via various techniques such as cooling, adding antisolvent to the solution, reaction, etc. The efficient processing depends on the measuring and predicting solubility of API at different conditions[1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-13090-4#ref-CR1),[2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-13090-4#ref-CR2). For some cases, the crystallization is difficult to be carried out and solvent must be changed. Indeed, API solubility in mixed solvents should be estimated as it is tedious to measure it via experimental methods[3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-13090-4#ref-CR3). As such, computational methods such as machine learning (ML) are applicable for estimation of APIs in mixed solvents[4](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-13090-4#ref-CR4).\nRecently, some ML-based models were developed for estimation and correlation of API solubility to temperature and solvent composition[4](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-13090-4#ref-CR4). Jeong et al.[5](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-13090-4#ref-CR5)measured and correlated solubility of rivaroxaban in mixed solvents. The considered solvents were mixture of dichloromethane and primary alcohols to find the highest solubility at different temperatures. Other studies recently estimated the solubility of rivaroxaban via ML models and reported that ML is a powerful approach in correlation of rivaroxaban solubility to temperature and concentration[4](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-13090-4#ref-CR4),[6](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-13090-4#ref-CR6),[7](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-13090-4#ref-CR7). Although several studies reported correlation of rivaroxaban solubility to temperature and solvent concentrations, more ML models and optimizers need to be evaluated to provide greater choice for selection of proper model in pharmaceutical crystallization design and optimization.\nML techniques have increasingly been applied to predict solubility and other physico-chemical properties of pharmaceutical compounds. For instance, data-driven models such as Bayesian-based models, Neural Networks, and Polynomial Regression have been successfully applied to determine solubility of APIs in supercritical solvents and to model thermodynamic behavior in multicomponent systems which indicated great accuracy[8](#ref-CR8),[9](#ref-CR9),[10](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-13090-4#ref-CR10). Moreover, advanced deep learning frameworks, including ensemble-based models like NODE, have shown strong performance in predicting material properties in biomedical engineering applications, especially for structured data involving drug release from ...",

We critically assess model performance metrics including R2, RMSE, and MAE, dataset qualities, and validation protocols, highlighting the superiority of ensemble and physics-informed ML methods in accuracy and generalizability. Recent advances in ML, for instance multifidelity Gaussian Process Regression and graph neural networks, demonstrate enhanced predictive capabilities for viscosity, density, and melting points, surpassing traditional thermodynamic models such as COSMO-RS and UNIFAC. Interpretability tools like SHAP analysis uncover dominant molecular interactions, guiding DES structure for specific applications. Challenges like data scarcity, extrapolation limitations, and computational expenses are discussed, alongside solutions like transfer learning and active learning. The study also explores burgeoning directions, involving the integration of quantum chemical descriptors and autonomous high-throughput screening. By bridging computational intelligence with chemical insights, ML accelerates the discovery of customized DESs, fostering innovation in green chemistry.\n\n## Introduction\n\nDeep Eutectic Solvents (DESs), a class of designer solvents formed through the eutectic mixture of hydrogen bond donors (HBDs) and hydrogen bond acceptors (HBAs), have emerged as promising green alternatives to conventional organic solvents. Owing to their low volatility, biodegradability, tunability, and low cost, DESs have found applications across various sectors, including drug delivery, extraction, catalysis, electrochemistry, and biomedicine \\[1\\]. Central to their utility is a thorough understanding and precise prediction of their physicochemical properties (such as viscosity, solubility, density, and surface tension) and biological properties like absorption, toxicity, and bioavailability. However, the complex molecular interactions\u2014especially extensive hydrogen bonding networks and compositional variability\u2014make experimental determination of DES properties both time-consuming and resource-intensive. This necessitates the development of predictive models capable of estimating DES behavior with high accuracy and generalizability \\[2\\].\n\nDESs can be systematically classified based on their chemical composition, hydrogen bonding interactions, polarity, physical state, charge, and specialized applications. The primary classification divides DESs into five types (I-V) based on their components, with additional categories emerging for advanced applications. Type I DESs consist of a quaternary ammonium salt (e.g., choline chloride) mixed with a metal chloride (e.g., ZnCl\u2082, FeCl\u2083). These solvents are highly stable and used in electrochemistry and metal processing but can be corrosive. Type II DESs are similar but incorporate hydrated metal chlorides (e.g., CrCl\u2083\u00b76H\u2082O), reducing viscosity and corrosion compared to Type I. Type III DESs, the most widely studied, combine choline chloride with hydrogen bond donors (HBDs) like urea, glycerol, or organic acids, making them biodegradable and versatile for green chemistry applications. Type IV DESs replace the ammonium salt with metal salts (e.g., ZnCl\u2082, AlCl\u2083) paired with HBDs, offering strong Lewis acidity for catalysis. Finally, Type V DESs are composed of non-ionic components (e.g., menthol + thymol), forming hydrophobic DESs useful for essential oil extraction and pharmaceuticals.\n\nDESs can also be categorized by their ionic nature. Ionic DESs (e.g., choline chloride-based mixtures) contain charged species and are common in electrochemistry. In contrast, neutral DESs (e.g., sugar-based mixtures like glucose + fructose) lack ionic components and are often used in food and cosmetic applications. DESs exhibit varying polarities, leading to hydrophilic (water-miscible, e.g., choline chloride + urea) and hydrophobic (water-immiscible, e.g., menthol + fatty acids) categories. Hydrophilic DESs dominate in extraction and bio catalysis, while hydrophobic DESs excel in non-polar separations. Most DESs are liquid at room temperature, but some solid eutectic mixtures (e.g., certain metal-based DESs) require heating to liquefy. This distinction is crucial for applications like thermal energy storage. Beyond traditional types, specialized DES classes have emerged. NADES (Natural Deep Eutectic Solvents) are derived from primary metabolites (e.g., sugars, organic acids) and are biocompatible, making them ideal for food, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals. THEDES (Therapeutic DESs) incorporate active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) to enhance drug solubility and transdermal delivery (e.g., ibuprofen + menthol). Emerging categories include PolyDES (polymer-enhanced DESs) for flexible electronics, SOLDES (solar thermal DESs) for energy storage, and eutectogels for wearable sensors. DESs are further tailored for specific uses: (a) Biocompatible DESs (e.g., choline chloride + glyce...",

      "title": "Making thermodynamic models of mixtures predictive by machine learning: matrix completion of pair interactions",
      "text": "Making thermodynamic models of mixtures\npredictive by machine learning: matrix completion\nof pair interactions\u2020\nFabian Jirasek, *a Robert Bamler,b Sophie Fellenz,c Michael Bortz,d Marius Kloft,c\nStephan Mandt\u2021e and Hans Hasse\u2021a\nPredictive models of thermodynamic properties of mixtures are paramount in chemical engineering and\nchemistry. Classical thermodynamic models are successful in generalizing over (continuous) conditions\nlike temperature and concentration. On the other hand, matrix completion methods (MCMs) from\nmachine learning successfully generalize over (discrete) binary systems; these MCMs can make\npredictions without any data for a given binary system by implicitly learning commonalities across\nsystems. In the present work, we combine the strengths from both worlds in a hybrid approach. The\nunderlying idea is to predict the pair-interaction energies, as they are used in basically all physical\nmodels of liquid mixtures, by an MCM. As an example, we embed an MCM into UNIQUAC, a widely-used\nphysical model for the Gibbs excess energy. We train the resulting hybrid model in a Bayesian machine\u0002learning framework on experimental data for activity coefficients in binary systems of 1146 components\nfrom the Dortmund Data Bank. We thereby obtain, for the first time, a complete set of UNIQUAC\nparameters for all binary systems of these components, which allows us to predict, in principle, activity\ncoefficients at arbitrary temperature and composition for any combination of these components, not\nonly for binary but also for multicomponent systems. The hybrid model even outperforms the best\navailable physical model for predicting activity coefficients, the modified UNIFAC (Dortmund) model.\nIntroduction\nInformation on thermodynamic properties of mixtures is of\ncrucial importance in chemical engineering and chemistry.\nHowever, providing this information is hampered by a combi\u0002natorial problem: the number N of known components is\nincreasing rapidly (it is presently in the order of N \u00bc 108\n,\ncounted by entries in the CAS Registry1\n); if only binary mixtures\nare considered, the number of mixtures that can be formed\nfrom these components already goes with N2\n. Even if only\ntechnically relevant components and their mixtures are\nconsidered, the numbers are still extremely high. Consequently,\nexperimental data on thermodynamic properties are available\nonly for a small fraction of the relevant mixtures, especially as\nthe corresponding experimental investigations are tedious.\nTherefore, methods for the prediction of thermodynamic\nproperties of mixtures are essential in practice.\nThe present work is focused on thermodynamic properties of\n\ue104uid mixtures. Physical models for describing these properties\nare generally based on the concept of pair interactions, which are\ncommonly described by pair-interaction energies. All types of pair\ninteractions in a multicomponent mixture can be investigated\nby studying the pure components (for the like interactions) and\nthe binary subsystems (for the unlike interactions). Therefore,\nphysical models for thermodynamic properties of \ue104uid mixtures\nare generally developed using data on pure components and\nbinary mixtures; based on this, they can also be used to predict\nproperties of multicomponent mixtures. In the application of\nmodels of thermodynamic properties, their predictive capabil\u0002ities are of prime importance. To assess them, the relation of\nthe data used in the model development (the training data) to\nthe data to be predicted is important. Regarding thermody\u0002namic properties of mixtures, we distinguish two categories of\npredictions here:\na\nLaboratory of Engineering Thermodynamics (LTD), TU Kaiserslautern,\nErwin-Schr\u00a8odinger-Str. 44, 67663 Kaiserslautern, Germany.

In the\nnomenclature of the present paper, we follow the common\nusage, which says that \u2018mixture\u2019 can have two meanings: in the\n\ue103rst, it simply designates the combination of speci\ue103c compo\u0002nents (regardless of their concentrations, e.g., \u2018water + ethanol\u2019),\nin the second, also the concentrations are included in the term\n(e.g., \u2018water + ethanol with xwater \u00bc 0.1 mol/mol\u2019). In cases where\nthis ambiguity can lead to misunderstandings, we use the term\n\u2018system\u2019 instead of \u2018mixture\u2019 when we refer to the \ue103rst case.\nThe most common types of thermodynamic models of\nmixtures are models of the Gibbs excess energy GE\n, such as\nUNIQUAC2,3 or NRTL,4 and equations of state (EoS).5 These\nmodels excel in generalizing over conditions. By virtue of the\nunderlying thermodynamic theory, they can also be used for\ngeneralizing over properties, i.e., if trained on data for a speci\ue103c\nproperty, they can be used to predict a different but related\nproperty; this is an important issue, which, however, is not in\nthe focus of the present work.\nIn their basic form, GE models and EoS are only partially\nuseful for generalizing over systems: for the reasons given\nabove, they are usually trained on data for binary systems, but\ncan then be used for modeling those binary systems only for\nwhich data were available during the training. In contrast,\npredictions of properties of unstudied multicomponent systems\nwith GE models and EoS o\ue09den turn out to be sufficiently accu\u0002rate, under the condition that the model was trained on data for\nall constituent binary subsystems.\n6\nTo overcome the lack of generalization over (binary) systems,\ngroup-contribution (GC) approaches like UNIFAC,7\u20139 modi\ue103ed\nUNIFAC (Dortmund),10,11 and the Predictive Soave\u2013Redlich\u2013\nKwong (PSRK) EoS12,13 have been developed. They are based on\nthe idea that components can be split into structural groups\nand, instead of considering pair interactions between compo\u0002nents, pair interactions between these groups are modeled. As\nthe number of relevant structural groups is comparatively small\n(in the order of 100), the combinatorial problem described\nabove thereby becomes tractable.

However, chemical datasets are often inaccessible to the machine learning community as they tend to require cleaning, thorough understanding of the chemistry, or are simply not available. In this paper, we introduce a novel dataset for yield prediction, providing the first-ever transient flow dataset for machine learning benchmarking, covering over 1200 process conditions. While previous datasets focus on discrete parameters, our experimental set-up allow us to sample a large number of continuous process conditions, generating new challenges for machine learning models. We focus on solvent selection, a task that is particularly difficult to model theoretically and therefore ripe for machine learning applications. We showcase benchmarking for regression algorithms, transfer-learning approaches, feature engineering, and active learning, with important applications towards solvent replacement and sustainable manufacturing.\n## 1Introduction\nMachine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) have showcased enormous potential in empowering the world of the natural sciences: from famous examples such as AlphaFold for protein predictions> [\n[> 1\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib1)> ]\n, to fusion reactor control> [\n[> 2\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib2)> ]\n, disease detection> [\n[> 3\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib3)> ]\n, battery design> [\n[> 4\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib4)> ]\n, and material discovery> [\n[> 5\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib5)> ]\n, among many more. However, we seldom see the machine learning community benchmark new methods in physical science datasets, mostly due to the difficulty in cleaning real-world data, the need for interdisciplinary understanding to correctly benchmark, and most importantly, how expensive the data can be to produce, resulting in many datasets being locked behind closed doors by large companies.\nAIchemy ([https://aichemy.ac.uk](https://aichemy.ac.uk)) is an interdisciplinary UK hub with the mission of transforming the chemistry-AI interface via aiding the collaboration of chemists and AI researchers, as well as addressing gaps in data standards, curation, and availability for AI use. In partnership with SOLVE Chemistry ([https://www.solvechemistry.com](https://www.solvechemistry.com)), we present a first important step into addressing the dataset gap with the introduction of a new and unique open dataset for benchmarking low-data machine learning algorithms for chemistry.\nSolvent selection is one of the biggest challenges for chemical manufacturing, with solvents often being the main source of waste in the manufacturing process> [\n[> 6\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib6)> ]\n. Increased regulation on solvents and a drive to making process manufacturing more sustainable led to an interest in the discovery of greener solvents and for improved solvent replacement tools. However, most of the solvent replacement tools focus purely on learning unsupervised representations of solvents, with the hope that experimentalists can find solvents with similar properties to replace those with environmental concerns. A much stronger approach would consider the interaction of a variety of different solvents with a reaction of interest to directly predict reaction yields, in such a way that the best possible solvent can be selected according to a yield-sustainability trade-off.\nMachine learning approaches have been shown to be a powerful tool for the prediction of chemical reaction conditions. Success has been reported in retro-synthesis> [\n[> 7\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib7)> , [> 8\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib8)> ]\n, condition recommendations> [\n[> 9\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib9)> ]\n, product predictions> [\n[> 10\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib10)> , [> 11\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib11)> ]\n, among others. While yield prediction has proven to be more difficult due to large inconsistencies in procedure and data reporting> [\n[> 12\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib12)> ]\n, we have still seen promising yield prediction results for smaller and more carefully curated datasets> [\n[> 13\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib13)> , [> 14\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib14)> , [> 15\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib15)> , [> 16\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib16)> ]\n. However, these datasets lack the continuous reaction conditions, such as temperature and residence time, that are required to scale-up processes to practical manufacturing conditions.\nIn this paper, we release the first machine-learning-ready transient flow dataset, a framework that allows for quick and efficient screening of continuous reaction conditions. We specifically provide yield data over the uni-molecular allyl substituted catechol reaction, shown in Figure[1](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#S1.F1), with dense measurements across the residence time, temperature, and solvent space. We further showcase how this type ofkinetic dataposes new challenges to current machine learning methods for chemistry, and identify how the challenges can potentially be tackled by the community.\n![Refer to caption](extracted/6524982/figures/Project2_rxn.png)Figure 1:Data was gathered on the rearrangement of allyl substituted catechol. By subjecting the reaction mixture to high temperatures, we begin a cascade reaction forming multiple rearrangement products. We investigate the yield of the reaction for a range of different solvents. Product 1 was not observed and reacted immediately to form Product 2 and later 3.\n### 1.1Related works\nReaction datasets are common in chemistry research, but their suitability for machine learning benchmarking tends to be poor. This can be a result of improper formatting or documentation, incomplete information about reaction conditions or the experimental set-up, or the lack of machine readability, leading to limited usage by the ML community. However, some effort has been made to address this, with the biggest example being the creation of the Open Reaction Database (ORD)> [\n[> 17\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib17)> ]\n, a repository containing over 2M different reactions, many of which come from US patent data (USPTO)> [\n[> 18\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib18)> ]\n. However, the dataset falls short in some aspects, in particular with respect to machine learning readiness and data inconsistencies across reactions.\nORDerly> [\n[> 12\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib12)> ]\nallows for easy cleaning and preparation of ORD data, showing the promise of the dataset for forward and retro-synthetic prediction using transformers; however, it also shows that yield prediction cannot be done well due to data inconsistencies.> Schwaller et\u00a0al.

This study addresses this by developing a robust machine learning (ML) model for accurately predicting the solubility of three phenolic acids (syringic, p-coumaric, and caffeic) in various deep eutectic solvents (DESs), integrating both experimental and computational investigations. Measured solubility data showed that the choline chloride combined with triethylene glycol in a 1:2 molar ratio was the most efficient system for the dissolution of the studied APIs. Different ML models, utilizing nu-Support Vector Regression (nuSVR) as the core regressor and based on descriptor sets derived from COSMO-RS (Conductor-like Screening Model for Real Solvents) computations, were systematically evaluated. A novel methodology termed DOO-IT (Dual-Objective Optimization with ITerative feature pruning) was employed to address the common challenges of model development with limited, high-value datasets. The final optimal 10-descriptor nuSVR model, selected from an exhaustive, multi-run search, demonstrated outstanding predictive power, offering a highly reliable computational tool for guiding experimental screening, significantly accelerating the exploration of DES-based formulations. This research also provides a strong foundation for future machine learning-guided discovery of chemicals, offering an effective and transferable framework for developing QSPR models for various chemical systems.</p>\n </section>\n <div>\n \n \n<div>\n <section><h2> 1. Introduction</h2><p>Phenolic acids are a prominent group of naturally occurring plant secondary metabolites with a wide range of biological activities and industrial applications [<a href=\"#B1-ijms-26-10099\">1</a>,<a href=\"#B2-ijms-26-10099\">2</a>,<a href=\"#B3-ijms-26-10099\">3</a>]. Among them, caffeic acid, syringic acid, and p-coumaric acid are three structurally related hydroxycinnamic and hydroxybenzoic acid derivatives extensively studied for their antioxidant, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer properties. These compounds are ubiquitous in fruits, vegetables, grains, and beverages, including coffee, wine, and tea, and have garnered attention in recent years for their potential therapeutic and nutraceutical uses [<a href=\"#B4-ijms-26-10099\">4</a>,<a href=\"#B5-ijms-26-10099\">5</a>]. Caffeic acid (3,4-dihydroxycinnamic acid) belongs to the hydroxycinnamic acid class and is characterized by a catechol moiety and a propenoic acid side chain. This structure results in high radical scavenging activity and metal-chelating ability, which underlie its potent antioxidant effects [<a href=\"#B6-ijms-26-10099\">6</a>,<a href=\"#B7-ijms-26-10099\">7</a>]. Caffeic acid occurs both in its free form and as an ester with quinic acid, most notably in the form of chlorogenic acid in coffee beans. It exhibits anti-inflammatory effects through inhibition of cyclooxygenase enzymes and the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway, with additional effects on glucose metabolism modulation and protection against oxidative stress-related diseases [<a href=\"#B8-ijms-26-10099\">8</a>,<a href=\"#B9-ijms-26-10099\">9</a>,<a href=\"#B10-ijms-26-10099\">10</a>]. Syringic acid (4-hydroxy-3,5-dimethoxybenzoic acid) is a derivative of benzoic acid and belongs to the hydroxybenzoic acid subclass. Its structure includes two methoxy groups on the aromatic ring, which influence its antioxidant potential and lipophilicity. Syringic acid is commonly found in red wine, olives, as well as acai berries and has been reported to exhibit antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, and antimicrobial activities [<a href=\"#B11-ijms-26-10099\">11</a>,<a href=\"#B12-ijms-26-10099\">12</a>,<a href=\"#B13-ijms-26-10099\">13</a>]. Its neuroprotective effects have been linked to the reduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inhibition of apoptosis in neuronal cells, making it a promising compound for neurodegenerative disease research [<a href=\"#B14-ijms-26-10099\">14</a>,<a href=\"#B15-ijms-26-10099\">15</a>]. p-Coumaric acid (4-hydroxycinnamic acid) differs structurally from caffeic acid by having only one hydroxyl group on the aromatic ring. It is widely distributed in cereal grains, tomatoes, or honey and acts as a precursor in the biosynthesis of more complex phenolics such as lignin and flavonoids [<a href=\"#B16-ijms-26-10099\">16</a>,<a href=\"#B17-ijms-26-10099\">17</a>]. Its biological properties include antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial effects, and it has been found to inhibit lipid peroxidation and modulate the enzyme activity involved in detoxification and inflammatory pathways [<a href=\"#B18-ijms-26-10099\">18</a>,<a href=\"#B19-ijms-26-10099\">19</a>]. Recent studies have also explored its role in enhancing food preservation and packaging due to its ability to inhibit microbial growth and oxidative spoilage [<a href=\"#B20-ijms-26-10099\">20</a>]. Together, these three phenolic acids share a common biosynthetic origin via the phenylpropanoid pathway [<a href=\"#B21-ijms-26-10099\">21</a>,<a href=\"#B22-ijms-26-10099\">22</a>] and exhibit structural similarities that contribute to overlapping, yet distinct, biological profiles.</p><p>The solubility behavior of caffeic, p-coumaric, and syringic acids is primarily governed by their distinct substitution patterns on the aromatic ring, which influence polarity, hydrogen-bonding capacity, and hydrophilicity. The structural formulas and electron density distributions of the three considered phenolic acids are presented in <a href=\"#ijms-26-10099-f001\">Figure 1</a>.

The neural model that led to the best performance in the testing\nand validation stages contains 4 neurons in the input layer, 12 neurons in the hidden layer, and one\nneuron in the output layer. In the testing stage for this model, the standard deviation is 0.0067, and\nthe correlation coefficient is 0.999. In the validation stage, a deviation of 0.0226 and a correlation\ncoefficient of 0.996 were obtained. The MLR model led to worse results than those obtained with the\nneural model and also with the R-L models. The standard deviation for this model is 0.099, and the\ncorrelation coefficient is 0.898. Its advantage over the R-L type models is that the influence of both\ncomposition and temperature are included in a single equation.\nKeywords: viscosity deviation modeling; ANN; benzyl alcohol; n-hexanol; water\n1. Introduction\nMany products from the pharmaceutical or cosmetic industries consist of liquid\nsystems in the form of solutions that contain more than one solute. After they are used,\nthey reach the environment and can negatively influence it. Environmental pollution with\npharmaceuticals and cosmetics has represented a particularly important global problem\nsince ancient times [1]. The presence of pharmaceutical and cosmetic products in surface\nwaters negatively affects living organisms. Also, if they reach the human body, they can\ncause various ailments. In order to reduce these negative effects on the environment,\nnumerous groups of researchers from around the world have focused their attention on\nstudies on the behavior of liquid mixtures [2\u201314]. It can be said that the pollution caused\nby the products of the pharmaceutical and cosmetic industry represents an ever-increasing\nchallenge for the protection of the environment because the human population registers\na systematic increase in the use of medicines and personal care products [2]. Emerging\npollutants reach the environment and pollute wastewater through various pathways.\nMedicines and pharmaceutical skin products such as creams, ointments, and body lotions\nMaterials 2022, 15, 5699. https://doi.org/10.3390/ma15165699 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/materials\nMaterials 2022, 15, 5699 2 of 15\nbelong to the category of emerging pollutants. Since they are not completely absorbed by\nthe skin, they can contaminate surface waters. Other examples of emerging pollutants can\nbe personal care products or some soaps. Benzyl alcohol and n-hexanol are the most widely\napplied solvents in the pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries.\nThe properties most frequently evaluated in the case of aqueous solutions are density,\nviscosity, refractive index, surface tension, thermal conductivity, etc. The importance of\nevaluating the thermodynamic and transport properties of aqueous solutions derives from\nthe need to know them for the development of theoretical models and for the design and\ndevelopment of new technologies. Knowing the dynamic viscosity of liquid mixtures is\nimperative for chemical engineering calculations involving fluid, heat, and mass trans\u0002fer [3]. According to the literature, the viscosity data of liquid mixtures for binary systems\ncontaining n-hexanol and ethanol were reported by Cano-G\u00f3mez et al. They highlighted\nnegative viscosity deviations from a mole fraction weighted average of the pure compo\u0002nent viscosities over the entire composition range [4]. Indraswati and his collaborators\ndetermined the viscosity for binary mixtures containing n-hexanol and ethyl valerate or\nhexyl acetate, also obtaining negative viscosity deviations over the entire composition\nrange [5]. Other data for the viscosity of binary systems containing n-hexanol were re\u0002ported by Audonnet et al. [6], Domanska et al. [7], \u017divkovi\u00b4c et al. [8], Estrada-Baltazar\net al. [9], and Das et al. [10]. In all these studies, the viscosity deviation was correlated\nwith the composition with polynomial models of the Redlich and Kister type. This model\ncorrelates the excess properties of a multicomponent system with the mole fractions of\nthe components in the mixture for each temperature. The advantages of the Redlich and\nKister type models are given by the simplicity of the equations used and the very good\nperformances obtained.\nA significant contribution to the study of the transport properties for benzyl alcohol\nin different binary and ternary systems was made by Cruz and his collaborators and ob\u0002tained for the ternary system (benzaldehyde-toluene-benzyl alcohol), a standard deviation\nbetween the experimental viscosities and those calculated with a Redlich and Kister type\nmodel of 1.1% [11]. Nayak et al. evaluated the viscosity of benzyl alcohol in the binary\nmixture formed by ethyl chloroacetate\u2014benzyl alcohol at the following temperature values:\n298.15, 303.15, and 308.15 K. The obtained results were correlated with a polynomial model\nof the Redlich\u2013Kister type [12]. Gramajo De Doz et al. calculated the viscosity deviation\nfor the ternary system benzyl alcohol, 4-hydroxy-4-methyl-2-pentanone, and water and\ncorrelated the obtained values with mole fractions also using the Redlich\u2013Kister model [13].\nChen et al. determined the density, refractive index, viscosity, and surface tension for\nbinary and ternary systems containing benzyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, and ethanol. Based\non the experimental determinations, they calculated the thermodynamic properties of\nthe excess, which were then correlated with the Redlich\u2013Kister and Cibulkatype models.\nThey determined that the deviation from ideal behavior is probably due to the brea...",

However, due to their vast diversity, acquiring IL properties through experimentation alone is both time-consuming and costly. For this reason, the creation of prediction models that can accurately forecast the characteristics of IL and its mixtures is crucial to their application. This study proposes a model for predicting the three important parameters of the IL-organic solvent\u2013organic solvent ternary system: density, viscosity, and heat capacity. The model incorporates group contribution (GC) and machine learning (ML) methods. A link between variables such as temperature, pressure, and molecular structure is established by the model. We gathered 2775 viscosity, 6515 density, and 1057 heat capacity data points to compare the prediction accuracy of three machine learning methods, namely, artificial neural networks (ANNs), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM). As can be observed from the findings, the ANN model produced the best results out of the three GC-based ML methods, even though all three produced dependable predictions. For heat capacity, the mean absolute error (MAE) of the ANN model is 1.7320 and the squared correlation coefficient (<span>R</span><sup>2</sup>) is 0.9929. Regarding viscosity, the MAE of the ANN model is 0.0225 and the <span>R</span><sup>2</sup> is 0.9973. For density, the MAE of the ANN model is 7.3760 and the <span>R</span><sup>2</sup> is 0.9943. The Shapley additive explanatory (SHAP) approach was applied to the study to comprehend the significance of each feature in the prediction findings. The analysis results indicated that the R-CH<sub>3</sub> group of the ILs, followed by the imidazolium (Im) group, had the highest impact on the heat capacity property of the ternary system. On the other hand, the Im group and the R-H group of ILs had the most effects on viscosity. In terms of density, the Im group of the ILs had the greatest effect on the ternary system, followed by the molar fraction of the organic solvent.</p>\n </section>\n <div>\n \n \n<div>\n <section><h2> 1. Introduction</h2><p>Ionic liquids (ILs) are salts composed only of ions that remain in a liquid state at room temperature or low temperatures [<a href=\"#B1-processes-12-01420\">1</a>]. Many ILs have demonstrated significant potential as environmentally friendly solvents in different applications [<a href=\"#B2-processes-12-01420\">2</a>]. Compared to traditional organic solvents and electrolytes, ILs offer a range of unique properties, garnering considerable attention. These properties, including low vapor pressure, high solubility, recyclability, and environmental friendliness [<a href=\"#B3-processes-12-01420\">3</a>,<a href=\"#B4-processes-12-01420\">4</a>,<a href=\"#B5-processes-12-01420\">5</a>], enable ILs to be employed in a variety of processes, including absorption [<a href=\"#B6-processes-12-01420\">6</a>], distillation [<a href=\"#B7-processes-12-01420\">7</a>], and extraction [<a href=\"#B8-processes-12-01420\">8</a>]. Notably, ILs occupy a vital part in chemical industry applications due to their outstanding physical and chemical characteristics [<a href=\"#B9-processes-12-01420\">9</a>,<a href=\"#B10-processes-12-01420\">10</a>]. Therefore, understanding the properties of ILs and their combinations is crucial for their effective utilization.</p><p>One of the most important thermodynamic characteristics in the construction of chemical reactors and heat exchangers is heat capacity. This parameter is crucial for the design of chemical processes, commonly utilized in thermodynamic calculations, and necessary for evaluating the heat transfer efficiency of many important chemical equipment pieces (like heat exchangers and reactors) [<a href=\"#B11-processes-12-01420\">11</a>,<a href=\"#B12-processes-12-01420\">12</a>]. Viscosity, on the other hand, reflects the internal friction that occurs when a fluid is subjected to external forces or shear stresses [<a href=\"#B13-processes-12-01420\">13</a>]. This property appears essential in several fields, including engineering, medicine, and petroleum [<a href=\"#B14-processes-12-01420\">14</a>,<a href=\"#B15-processes-12-01420\">15</a>,<a href=\"#B16-processes-12-01420\">16</a>]. Additionally, density is another important IL physical characteristic, which serves as the foundation for determining other thermodynamic parameters like viscosity and heat capacity. It is essential for energy accounting, equipment selection, and other process steps [<a href=...",
