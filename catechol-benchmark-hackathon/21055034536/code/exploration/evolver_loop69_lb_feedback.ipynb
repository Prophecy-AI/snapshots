    "- The mapping remains extremely linear (high R²). This means *standard* modeling improvements mainly move us along the same line.\n",

    "1. **Applicability-domain (AD) / distance-based shrinkage** (cross-fitted): blend model prediction toward a robust baseline when the held-out solvent/mixture is far from the training manifold.\n",
    "2. **Mixture representation upgrade**: add explicit (A,B,pct) pair-interaction features (concat, differences, products) instead of pure linear blending.\n",
    "3. **Representation change** (if AD doesn’t move the LB): GNN / ChemBERTa embeddings, but ensure strict template compliance and identical model class in CV vs submission cells.\n"
