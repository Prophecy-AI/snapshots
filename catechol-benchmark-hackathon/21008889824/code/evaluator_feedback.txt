## What I Understood

The junior researcher implemented my previous recommendation for **Aggressive Feature Selection + Simpler Model**. They used LightGBM feature importance to select the top 30 features (from 145), then trained a simpler ensemble (SimplerMLP [16] with 0.6 weight + LGBM with 0.4 weight) with stronger regularization (weight_decay=1e-2). The hypothesis was that fewer features and simpler models would reduce the CV-LB intercept (systematic overfitting to training solvents), even if CV scores got slightly worse.

The result: CV 0.009573, which is 16.83% worse than the best CV (0.008194 from exp_032). The experiment was well-executed and followed my recommendation correctly.

## Technical Execution Assessment

**Validation**: SOUND ✓
- Leave-one-solvent-out CV correctly implemented (24 folds for single solvent)
- Leave-one-ramp-out CV correctly implemented (13 folds for full data)
- TTA for mixtures properly implemented
- Template compliance maintained (last 3 cells unchanged)

**Leakage Risk**: None detected ✓
- Feature importance computed on full single-solvent data (not per-fold), which is acceptable since it's a global feature selection strategy
- Proper train/test separation per fold
- No target leakage in feature selection (uses LightGBM importance, not correlation with targets)

**Score Integrity**: VERIFIED ✓
- Single Solvent MSE: 0.010581 (n=656)
- Full Data MSE: 0.009035 (n=1227)
- Overall MSE: 0.009573
- Scores verified in notebook output cell 16

**Code Quality**: GOOD ✓
- WeightedHuberLoss with target weights [1.0, 1.0, 2.0] correctly implemented (fixed from previous bug)
- Feature selection using LightGBM importance is a valid approach
- Strong regularization (weight_decay=1e-2) applied as intended
- Simpler architecture [16] hidden units as intended

Verdict: **TRUSTWORTHY** - The experiment was executed correctly and the results can be trusted.

## Strategic Assessment

**Approach Fit**: REASONABLE
The approach directly addresses the CV-LB gap hypothesis. The top 30 features capture 97% of total importance (1839.7 / 1893.7), so we're not losing much signal. The simpler model with stronger regularization is a valid strategy to reduce overfitting.

**Key Observation**: The CV got worse (0.009573 vs 0.008194), but this doesn't tell us whether the LB would improve. The hypothesis was that simpler models would have a lower CV-LB intercept. **This experiment needs to be submitted to validate the hypothesis.**

**Effort Allocation**: APPROPRIATE
- Quick experiment (~30 min training time)
- Tests a clear hypothesis about the CV-LB relationship
- Follows the recommended approach

**Assumptions Being Tested**:
1. Feature selection based on importance preserves predictive signal ✓ (97% importance retained)
2. Simpler models generalize better to unseen solvents (UNTESTED - needs LB submission)
3. Stronger regularization reduces overfitting (UNTESTED - needs LB submission)

**Blind Spots**:

1. **GP was removed from the ensemble**: The best model (exp_032) used GP 0.15 + MLP 0.55 + LGBM 0.3. This experiment uses only MLP 0.6 + LGBM 0.4. GP might provide valuable uncertainty-aware predictions that help generalization.

2. **Feature selection was done globally, not per-fold**: This is acceptable but could be improved by doing feature selection within each fold to avoid any potential information leakage.

3. **The CV-LB relationship is highly linear (R²=0.967)**: This suggests the intercept is a fundamental property of the approach, not random noise. Changing the model architecture might not change the intercept much.

**Trajectory Assessment**:

The team has been systematic and thorough. 36 experiments have been run, exploring:
- Different model architectures (MLP, LightGBM, XGBoost, CatBoost, GP, Ridge)
- Different feature sets (Spange, DRFP, ACS PCA, combinations)
- Different ensemble strategies (weights, stacking)
- Different regularization approaches
- Sample weighting strategies

The CV-LB relationship is remarkably consistent across all 11 submissions:
- LB = 4.27 × CV + 0.0527 (R² = 0.967)
- Best CV: 0.008194 → Best LB: 0.08772
- Target: 0.0347

**Critical Insight**: The intercept (0.0527) is 1.52x higher than the target. Even with CV=0, the predicted LB would be 0.0527. This suggests a fundamental distribution shift between training and test solvents that the current approaches cannot bridge.

## What's Working

1. **Feature engineering**: The combination of Spange + DRFP + ACS PCA + Arrhenius kinetics is solid
2. **Ensemble approach**: GP + MLP + LGBM ensemble (exp_032) achieves the best CV
3. **Template compliance**: All experiments maintain proper submission format
4. **Systematic experimentation**: The team has been methodical and thorough
5. **Correct implementation**: This experiment fixed the bug from exp_034/035 (target weighting)

## Key Concerns

### HIGH: The CV-LB Intercept Remains the Bottleneck

**Observation**: The linear fit LB = 4.27×CV + 0.0527 has held across all 11 submissions with R²=0.967.

**Why it matters**: The intercept (0.0527) is 1.52x higher than the target (0.0347). No amount of CV improvement can reach the target with the current approach.

**Suggestion**: This experiment (feature selection + simpler model) is designed to test whether we can reduce the intercept. **It should be submitted to validate the hypothesis.** Even if CV is worse, LB might be better.

### MEDIUM: GP Was Removed from the Ensemble

**Observation**: The best model (exp_032) used GP 0.15 + MLP 0.55 + LGBM 0.3. This experiment uses only MLP 0.6 + LGBM 0.4.

**Why it matters**: GP provides uncertainty-aware predictions that might help with generalization to unseen solvents. Removing it might hurt LB performance.

**Suggestion**: Consider a variant that keeps GP in the ensemble with feature-selected inputs.

### MEDIUM: Only 5 Submissions Remaining

**Observation**: 5 submissions left, best LB is 0.08772, target is 0.0347 (2.53x gap).

**Why it matters**: Each submission is precious. We need strategic choices.

**Suggestion**: 
- Submit this experiment (exp_036) to test the feature selection hypothesis
- If it doesn't improve LB, try more radical approaches:
  - k-NN (completely different inductive bias)
  - Kernel Ridge Regression (already tried in exp_034, CV 0.012)
  - Domain adaptation techniques

## Top Priority for Next Experiment

**SUBMIT THIS EXPERIMENT (exp_036) TO TEST THE HYPOTHESIS**

**Rationale**:
1. The experiment was correctly implemented and tests a clear hypothesis
2. We need empirical data on whether simpler models reduce the CV-LB intercept
3. Even if CV is 16.83% worse, LB might be better if the intercept is reduced
4. This is the only way to validate the hypothesis about the CV-LB relationship

**Expected Outcomes**:
- If LB improves (or stays similar despite worse CV): The hypothesis is validated, and we should pursue even simpler models
- If LB gets proportionally worse: The intercept is a fundamental property, and we need a completely different approach

**Alternative Approaches to Consider (if this doesn't work)**:

1. **k-Nearest Neighbors**: Completely different inductive bias. Might generalize differently to unseen solvents.

2. **Feature Selection + GP Only**: Use the 30 selected features with only GP (no MLP/LGBM). GP's uncertainty quantification might help with out-of-distribution solvents.

3. **Solvent Clustering**: Group solvents by similarity and train separate models per cluster. This might reduce the distribution shift within each cluster.

4. **Adversarial Validation**: Identify which features cause the train-test distribution shift and remove them.

**THE TARGET IS REACHABLE.** The current best CV of 0.008194 would translate to LB ≈ 0.035 if the intercept were 0. We need to find an approach that reduces the intercept from 0.0527 to ~0.02. This experiment is a step toward that goal.

**Key Question to Answer**: Does feature selection + simpler model reduce the CV-LB intercept?
