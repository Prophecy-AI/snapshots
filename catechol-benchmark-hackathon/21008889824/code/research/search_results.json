      "text": "Predicting reaction yields for solvents that were not present in the training set can be done by building a model that (1) represents solvents with transferable descriptors, (2) learns condition\u2011aware reaction embeddings, and (3) is evaluated explicitly on out\u2011of\u2011distribution (OOD) solvent splits.  The steps below follow the strategies reported in recent peer\u2011reviewed work\u202f([MIT News\u202f2025](https://news.mit.edu/2025/new-model-predicts-how-molecules-will-dissolve-in-different-solvents-0819);\u202f[Chemical\u202fScience\u202f2024](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2024/sc/d3sc05353a);\u202f[Egret\u202f2024](https://spj.science.org/doi/10.34133/research.0292);\u202f[arXiv\u202f2025\u202f2512.19530](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19530);\u202f[arXiv\u202f2025\u202f2501.06669](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06669)).\n\n1. **Collect a reaction\u2011yield dataset that includes explicit solvent information**  \n   - For each entry record the reaction SMILES (reactants\u202f\u2192\u202fproducts) and the solvent used.  \n   - Augment the solvent column with physicochemical descriptors (e.g., COSMO\u2011RS solvation energy, Hansen parameters, or molecular fingerprints) that can be computed for any solvent, even unseen ones\u202f([MIT model for solvent dissolution\u202f2025](https://news.mit.edu/2025/new-model-predicts-how-molecules-will-dissolve-in-different-solvents-0819);\u202f[Quantum\u2011chemistry solvent\u2011effect study\u202f2024](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2024/sc/d3sc05353a)).  \n\n2. **Encode reactions and solvents with a condition\u2011aware language model**  \n   - Use a transformer\u2011based reaction encoder (e.g., the SMILES\u2011to\u2011yield model from Schwaller\u202fet\u202fal.) and treat the solvent descriptor vector as additional tokens appended to the reaction string\u202f([Prediction of Chemical Reaction Yields using Deep Learning\u202fPDF](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/60c750f2ee301c70b1c7a973/original/prediction-of-chemical-reaction-yields-using-deep-learning.pdf)).  \n   - This creates a unified embedding that captures both molecular transformations and solvent environment.  \n\n3. **Pre\u2011train on large, generic reaction corpora with condition\u2011contrastive learning**  \n   - Apply masked\u2011language\u2011model (MLM) pre\u2011training on millions of reaction SMILES while masking both reaction tokens and solvent tokens.  \n   - Add a contrastive loss that pulls together reactions sharing the same solvent conditions and pushes apart different solvents; this has been shown to improve sensitivity to reaction conditions\u202f([Egret\u202f2024](https://spj.science.org/doi/10.34133/research.0292)).  \n\n4. **Fine\u2011tune the model on the yield dataset**  \n   - Replace the final transformer head with a regression layer that predicts % yield.  \n   - Train with mean\u2011absolute\u2011error loss, keeping the solvent embeddings fixed (or fine\u2011tuning them) so the model learns how each descriptor influences yield.  \n\n5. **Generate embeddings for unseen solvents and predict**  \n   - Compute the same descriptor vector for any new solvent (e.g., using quantum\u2011chemical solvation calculations).  \n   - Append this vector to the reaction SMILES and feed it through the fine\u2011tuned model; the learned condition\u2011aware embeddings allow the network to extrapolate to the new solvent space\u202f([Continuous solvent\u2011effect GNN benchmark\u202f2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19530)).  \n\n6. **Validate OOD performance with solvent\u2011split tests**  \n   - Hold out a set of solvents entirely from training and evaluate prediction error on reactions that use only those solvents.  \n   - Use time\u2011split or patent\u2011split protocols to mimic real\u2011world deployment, as recommended for assessing out\u2011of\u2011distribution generalization\u202f([Challenging reaction prediction models\u202f2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06669)).  \n   - If error is high, consider meta\u2011learning or additional contrastive pre\u2011training on a broader solvent library.  \n\n7. **Deploy and monitor uncertainty**  \n   - Deploy the model as a prediction API; for each new\u2011solvent prediction report the confidence interval (e.g., via Monte\u2011Carlo dropout).  \n   - Flag predictions with high uncertainty for experimental verification, iteratively adding the new data to the training set to improve future extrapolation.  \n\nFollowing these steps leverages solvent\u2011specific descriptors, condition\u2011aware transformer or GNN architectures, and explicit OOD evaluation to obtain reliable yield predictions even for solvents that were absent during model training.",

This type of prediction could make it much easier to develop new ways to produce drugs and other useful molecules.\nThe new model, which predicts how much of a solute will dissolve in a particular solvent, should help chemists to choose the right solvent for any given reaction in their synthesis, the researchers say. Common organic solvents include ethanol and acetone, and there are hundreds of others that can also be used in chemical reactions.\n\u201cPredicting solubility really is a rate-limiting step in synthetic planning and manufacturing of chemicals, especially drugs, so there\u2019s been a longstanding interest in being able to make better predictions of solubility,\u201d says Lucas Attia, an MIT graduate student and one of the lead authors of the new study.\nThe researchers have made their[model](https://askcos.mit.edu/solprop?tab=solpred)freely available, and many companies and labs have already started using it. The model could be particularly useful for identifying solvents that are less hazardous than some of the most commonly used industrial solvents, the researchers say.\n\u201cThere are some solvents which are known to dissolve most things. They\u2019re really useful, but they\u2019re damaging to the environment, and they\u2019re damaging to people, so many companies require that you have to minimize the amount of those solvents that you use,\u201d says Jackson Burns, an MIT graduate student who is also a lead author of the paper. \u201cOur model is extremely useful in being able to identify the next-best solvent, which is hopefully much less damaging to the environment.\u201d\nWilliam Green, the Hoyt Hottel Professor of Chemical Engineering and director of the MIT Energy Initiative, is the senior author of the[study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-62717-7), which appears today in*Nature Communications*. Patrick Doyle, the Robert T. Haslam Professor of Chemical Engineering, is also an author of the paper.\n**Solving solubility**\nThe new model grew out of a project that Attia and Burns worked on together in an MIT courseon applying machine learning to chemical engineering problems. Traditionally, chemists have predicted solubility with a tool known as the Abraham Solvation Model, which can be used to estimate a molecule\u2019s overall solubility by adding up the contributions of chemical structures within the molecule. While these predictions are useful, their accuracy is limited.\nIn the past few years, researchers have begun using machine learning to try to make more accurate solubility predictions. Before Burns and Attia began working on their new model, the state-of-the-art model for predicting solubility was a model developed in Green\u2019s lab in 2022.\nThat model, known as SolProp, works by predicting a set of related properties and combining them, using thermodynamics, to ultimately predict the solubility. However, the model has difficulty predicting solubility for solutes that it hasn\u2019t seen before.\n\u201cFor drug and chemical discovery pipelines where you\u2019re developing a new molecule, you want to be able to predict ahead of time what its solubility looks like,\u201d Attia says.\nPart of the reason that existin...",

Despite the recent advance in machine learning, a scarcity of reliable data has hindered the development of predictive models that are generalizable for diverse reactions and solvents. In this work, we generate a large set of data with the COSMO-RS method for over 28\u2006000 neutral reactions and 295 solvents and train a machine learning model to predict the solvation free energy and solvation enthalpy of activation (\u0394\u0394 _G_\u2021solv, \u0394\u0394 _H_\u2021solv) for a solution phase reaction. On unseen reactions, the model achieves mean absolute errors of 0.71 and 1.03 kcal mol\u22121 for \u0394\u0394 _G_\u2021solv and \u0394\u0394 _H_\u2021solv, respectively, relative to the COSMO-RS calculations. The model also provides reliable predictions of relative rate constants within a factor of 4 when tested on experimental data. The presented model can provide nearly instantaneous predictions of kinetic solvent effects or relative rate constants for a broad range of neutral closed-shell or free radical reactions and solvents only based on atom-mapped reaction SMILES and solvent SMILES strings.\n\n![Graphical abstract: Machine learning from quantum chemistry to predict experimental solvent effects on reaction rates](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/Image/Get?imageInfo.ImageType=GA&imageInfo.ImageIdentifier.ManuscriptID=D3SC05353A&imageInfo.ImageIdentifier.Year=2024)\n\n- This article is part of the themed collections:\n[#MyFirstChemSci 2024](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/journals/articlecollectionlanding?sercode=sc&themeid=26a1e262-5929-453c-b3a7-f61b43147ce2) and [Most popular 2024 physical, theoretical and computational chemistry articles](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/journals/articlecollectionlanding?sercode=sc&themeid=777d3e88-b794-457a-8932-5995aa89df7b)\n\nThis article is Open Access\n\n![](https://www.rsc-cdn.org/pubs-core/2022.0.171/content/NewImages/Ajax-GA-Loader.gif)\nPlease wait while we load your content...\nSomething went wrong.

So far, yield predictions have been predominantly performed for\nhigh-throughput experiments using a categorical (one-hot) encoding of reactants,\nconcatenated molecular fingerprints, or computed chemical descriptors.

Introduction\nChemical reactions in organic chemistry are described by writing the structural\nformula of reactants and products separated by an arrow, representing the chemical\ntransformation by specifying how the atoms rearrange between one or several reactant\nPrediction of Chemical Reaction Yields using Deep Learning 2\nmolecules and one or several product molecules [1]. Economic, logistic, and energetic\nconsiderations drive chemists to prefer chemical transformations capable of converting\nall reactant molecules into products with the highest yield possible. However, side\u0002reactions, degradation of reactants, reagents or products in the course of the reaction,\nequilibrium processes with incomplete conversion to a product, or simply by product\nisolation and purification undermine the quantitative conversion of reactants into\nproducts, rarely reaching optimal performance.\nReaction yields are usually reported as a percentage of the theoretical chemical\nconversion, i.e., the percentage of the reactant molecules successfully converted to the\ndesired product compared to the theoretical value. It is not uncommon for chemists\nto synthesise a molecule in a dozen or more reaction steps. Hence, low-yield reactions\nmay have a disastrous e\u21b5ect on the overall route yield because of the individual steps\u2019\nmultiplicative e\u21b5ect. Therefore, it is not surprising that designing new reactions with\nyields higher than existing ones attracts much e\u21b5ort in organic chemistry research.\nIn practice, specific chemical reaction classes are characterised by lower or higher\nyields, with the actual value depending on the reaction conditions (temperature,\nconcentrations, etc.) and on the specific substrates.\nEstimating the reaction yield can be a game-changing asset for synthesis planning.\nIt provides chemists with the ability to evaluate the overall yield of complex reaction\npaths, addressing possible shortcomings well ahead of investing hours and materials in\nwet-lab experiments. Computational models predicting reaction yields could support\nsynthetic chemists in choosing an appropriate synthesis route among many predicted\nby data-driven algorithms. Moreover, reaction yields prediction models could also be\nemployed as scoring functions in computer-assisted retrosynthesis route planning tools\n[2, 3, 4, 5], to complement forward prediction models [6, 4] and in-scope filters [2].\nMost of the existing e\u21b5orts in constructing models for the prediction of reactivity or\nof reaction yields focused on a particular reaction class: oxidative dehydrogenations of\nethylbenzene with tin oxide catalysts [7], reactions of vanadium selenites [8], Buchwald\u2013\nHartwig aminations [9, 10, 11], and Suzuki\u2013Miyaura cross-coupling reactions [12, 13, 14].\nTo the best of our knowledge, there was only one attempt to design a general-purpose\nprediction model for reactivity and yields, without applicability constraints to a specific\nreaction class [15]. In this work, the authors design a model predicting whether the\nreaction yield is above or below a threshold value and conclude that the models and\ndescriptors they consider cannot deliver satisfactory results.\nHere, we build on our legacy of treating organic chemistry as a language to introduce\na new model that predicts reaction yields starting from reaction SMILES [16]. More\nspecifically, we fine-tune the rxnfp models by Schwaller et al. [17] based on a BERT\u0002encoder [18] by extending it with a regression layer to predict reaction yields. BERT\nencoders belong to the transformer model family, which has revolutionised natural\nlanguage processing [19, 18]. These models take sequences of tokens as input to compute\ncontextualised representations of all the input tokens, and can be applied to reactions\nrepresented in the SMILES [20] format. In this work, we demonstrate for the first\nPrediction of Chemical Reaction Yields using Deep Learning 3\ntime, that these natural language architectures are very useful not only when working\nwith language tokens, but also to provide descriptors of high quality to predict reaction\nproperties such as reaction yields.\nIt is possible to train our approach both on data specific to a given reaction class\nor on data representing di\u21b5erent reaction types. Thus, we initially trained the model on\ntwo high-throughput experimentation (HTE) data sets. Among the few HTE reaction\ndata sets published in recent years, we selected the data sets for palladium-catalysed\nBuchwald\u2013Hartwig reactions provided by Ahneman et al. [9] and for Suzuki\u2013Miyaura\ncoupling reactions provided by Perera et al. [21]. Finally, we trained our model on\npatent data available in the USPTO data set [22, 23].\nHTE and Patent data sets are very di\u21b5erent in terms of content and quality. HTE\ndata sets typically cover a very narrow region in the chemical reaction space, with\nchemical reaction data related to one or a few reaction templates applied to large\ncombinations of selected precursors (reactants, solvents, bases, catalysts, etc.). In\ncontrast, patent reactions cover a much wider reaction space. In terms of quality, HTE\ndata sets report reactions represented uniformly and with yields measured using the\nsame analytical equipment, thus providing a consistent and high quality collection of\nknowledge. In comparison, the yields from patents were measured by di\u21b5erent scientists\nusing di\u21b5erent equipments. Incomplete information in the original documents, such\nas unreported reagents or reaction conditions, and the extensive limitation in text\nmining technologies makes the entire set of patent reactions quite noisy and sparse.\nAn extensive analysis of the USPTO data set revealed that the experimental conditions\nand reaction parameters, such as scale of the reaction, concentrations, temperature,\npressure, or reaction duration, may have a significant e\u21b5ect on the measured reaction\nyields. The functional dependency of the yields from the reaction conditions poses\nadditional constraints, as the model presented in this w...",

      "text": "<div><div><section><h2>Abstract</h2><p>Deep learning (DL)-driven efficient synthesis planning may profoundly transform the paradigm for designing novel pharmaceuticals and materials. However, the progress of many DL-assisted synthesis planning (DASP) algorithms has suffered from the lack of reliable automated pathway evaluation tools. As a critical metric for evaluating chemical reactions, accurate prediction of reaction yields helps improve the practicality of DASP algorithms in the real-world scenarios. Currently, accurately predicting yields of interesting reactions still faces numerous challenges, mainly including the absence of high-quality generic reaction yield datasets and robust generic yield predictors. To compensate for the limitations of high-throughput yield datasets, we curated a generic reaction yield dataset containing 12 reaction categories and rich reaction condition information. Subsequently, by utilizing 2 pretraining tasks based on chemical reaction masked language modeling and contrastive learning, we proposed a powerful bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT)-based reaction yield predictor named Egret. It achieved comparable or even superior performance to the best previous models on 4 benchmark datasets and established state-of-the-art performance on the newly curated dataset. We found that reaction-condition-based contrastive learning enhances the model\u2019s sensitivity to reaction conditions, and Egret is capable of capturing subtle differences between reactions involving identical reactants and products but different reaction conditions. Furthermore, we proposed a new scoring function that incorporated Egret into the evaluation of multistep synthesis routes. Test results showed that yield-incorporated scoring facilitated the prioritization of literature-supported high-yield reaction pathways for target molecules. In addition, through meta-learning strategy, we further improved the reliability of the model\u2019s prediction for reaction types with limited data and lower data quality. Our results suggest that Egret holds the potential to become an essential component of the next-generation DASP tools.</p></section><div><section><h2>Introduction</h2><p>Efficient chemical synthesis is crucial to satisfying the future demands for pharmaceuticals, materials, and energy [<a href=\"#B1\">1</a>]. Corey and Wipke [<a href=\"#B2\">2</a>] first proposed the concept of computer-aided synthesis planning (CASP) in the 1960s. CASP programs take the target molecule as input and return a series of single-step reactions that decompose the target molecule into a set of commercially available starting compounds or simple precursors that can be easily synthesized [<a href=\"#B3\">3</a>]. A feasible synthesis plan may dramatically accelerate the synthesis of desired molecules [<a href=\"#B4\">4</a>]. In recent years, with the development of data science, deep learning (DL) algorithms, and computing power, DL-assisted synthesis planning (DASP) has gained considerable interest [<a href=\"#B5\">5</a>\u2013<a href=\"#B17\">17</a>]. Modern DASP programs can quickly plan multiple potential retrosynthetic pathways for a given target molecule according to the constraints set by the user for the retrosynthetic search (such as the overall search time and number of single-step expansion steps) [<a href=\"#B18\">18</a>]. However, these theoretically feasible reaction pathways often become impractical because of such factors as incomplete conversion of reactants, side reactions, or inadequate purification [<a href=\"#B19\">19</a>]. Therefore, retrosynthetic route planning is only a major component of a successful DASP system [<a href=\"#B20\">20</a>]. To provide feasible suggestions that can be implemented by chemists in the laboratory, it is necessary to identify the optimal reaction conditions for the retrosynthetic route [<a href=\"#B21\">21</a>] and evaluate the quality of the overall synthesis route, and reaction yield is one of the most scientific and intuitive metrics for screening reaction conditions and evaluating synthesis pathway [<a href=\"#B22\">22</a>,<a href=\"#B23\">23</a>].</p><p>Reaction yield refers to the percentage of reactants that are successfully converted to the desired product [<a href=\"#B24\">24</a>]. Models that can reliably predict actual yields not only serve as scoring functions of DASP but also help chemists evaluate the overall yield of complex reaction pathways, giving priority to high-yield reactions to save time and cost in wet experiments [<a href=\"#B25\">25</a>]. However, because of the complexity of molecular structures, the multidimensionality of chemical reactions, and the limited availability of data, it is still a great challenge to predict the yields of chemical reactions under specific conditions [<a href=\"#B26\">26</a>]. The current yield prediction models are mainly built on high-throughput experimental (HTE) datasets, and Buchwald\u2013Hartwig reactions [<a href=\"#B26\">26</a>\u2013<a href=\"#B28\">28</a>] and Suzuki\u2013Miyaura reactions [<a href=\"#B29\">29</a>,<a href=\"#B30\">30</a>] are the 2 most well-studied HTE yield datasets (Fig. <a href=\"#F1\">1</a>A and B). Early studies utilized computed physicochemical descriptors [<a href=\"#B26\">26</a>], one-hot encoding of reactions [<a href=\"#B27\">27</a>], or structure-based molecular fingerprints [<a href=\"#B28\">28</a>] to predict the yields for these 2 datasets. Recently, the DL fingerprint rxnfp developed by Schwaller et\u00a0al. [<a href=\"#B31\">31</a>] and the differential reaction fingerprint drfp developed by Probst et\u00a0al. [<a href=\"#B32\">32</a>] have substantially outperformed previous methods. Rxnfp and drfp respectively achieved the best performance on test sets of Buchwald\u2013Hartwig dataset and Suzuki\u2013Miyaura dataset (70:30 random split), with coefficient of determination (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup>) scores of 0.95 and 0.85. However, by studying previous experimental results, we found that most of the aforementioned methods did not achieve the ideal predictive performance on the out-of-sample test sets of Buchwald\u2013Hartwig reactions containing additional additives. This indicates the limitations of using HTE datasets for yield prediction. HTE datasets usually involve specific classes of reactions and focus on a narrow chemical space. When using yield prediction models to explore unknown chemical spaces, this performance degradation problem will be prevalent because the unknown chemical space to be predicted can be very large [<a href=\"#B33\">33</a>]. Yield prediction models trained on HTE datasets cannot be applied in the real-world scenarios aimed at predicting the yields for a broad variety of reactions. Therefore, curating generic reaction yield datasets that are not limited to specific reaction classes is the first step to promote the practical application of yield prediction models.</p><div><figure><figcaption><span>Fig.\u00a01</span>. Overall reaction and variables for the Buchwald\u2013Hartwig (B-H) (A), Suzuki\u2013Miyaura (B), and Reaxys-MultiCondi-Yield (C) datasets.</figcaption></figure></div><p>Another key point to apply yield prediction models to chemical synthesis practice is to adopt effective modeling methods for generic reaction yield datasets. Reaction Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) is a simplified chemical language for representing chemical reactions [<a href=\"#B34\">34</a>]. Therefore, SMILES-based yield prediction can be viewed as a natural language processing (NLP) problem, extracting molecular features directly from reaction SMILES without relying on any manually generated feature. In 2017, Vaswani et\u00a0al. [<a href=\"#B35\">35</a>] proposed the transformer architecture for handling various NLP tasks, which achieved excellent feature extraction capability through the self-attention mechanism.

Traditional machine learning approaches often treat solvent identity as a discrete categorical variable, which prevents systematic interpolation and extrapolation across the solvent space. This work introduces the \\textbf{Catechol Benchmark}, a high-throughput transient flow chemistry dataset comprising 1,227 experimental yield measurements for the rearrangement of allyl-substituted catechol in 24 pure solvents and their binary mixtures, parameterized by continuous volume fractions ($\\% B$). We evaluate various architectures under rigorous leave-one-solvent-out and leave-one-mixture-out protocols to test generalization to unseen chemical environments.\n> Our results demonstrate that classical tabular methods (e.g., Gradient-Boosted Decision Trees) and large language model embeddings (e.g., Qwen-7B) struggle with quantitative precision, yielding Mean Squared Errors (MSE) of 0.099 and 0.129, respectively. In contrast, we propose a hybrid GNN-based architecture that integrates Graph Attention Networks (GATs) with Differential Reaction Fingerprints (DRFP) and learned mixture-aware solvent encodings. This approach achieves an \\textbf{MSE of 0.0039} ($\\pm$ 0.0003), representing a 60\\% error reduction over competitive baselines and a $&gt;25\\times$ improvement over tabular ensembles. Ablation studies confirm that explicit molecular graph message-passing and continuous mixture encoding are essential for robust generalization. The complete dataset, evaluation protocols, and reference implementations are released to facilitate data-efficient reaction prediction and continuous solvent representation learning.

Despite compelling performance on popular benchmark tasks, strange and erroneous predictions sometimes ensue when using these models in practice. The core issue is that common benchmarks test models in an in-distribution setting, whereas many real-world uses for these models are in out-of-distribution settings and require a greater degree of extrapolation. To better understand how current reaction predictors work in out-of-distribution domains, we report a series of more challenging evaluations of a prototypical SMILES-based deep learning model. First, we illustrate how performance on randomly sampled datasets is overly optimistic compared to performance when generalizing to new patents or new authors. Second, we conduct time splits that evaluate how models perform when tested on reactions published in years after those in their training set, mimicking real-world deployment. Finally, we consider extrapolation across reaction classes to reflect what would be required for the discovery of novel reaction types. This panel of tasks can reveal the capabilities and limitations of today's reaction predictors, acting as a crucial first step in the development of tomorrow's next-generation models capable of reaction discovery.\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| Subjects: | Machine Learning (cs.LG); Chemical Physics (physics.chem-ph) |\n| Cite as: | [arXiv:2501.06669](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06669) \\[cs.LG\\] |\n| (or [arXiv:2501.06669v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06669v1) \\[cs.LG\\] for this version) |\n| [https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2501.06669](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2501.06669) <br>Focus to learn more<br>arXiv-issued DOI via DataCite |\n\n## Submission history\n\nFrom: John Bradshaw \\[ [view email](https://arxiv.org/show-email/47bd441c/2501.06669)\\] **\\[v1\\]**\nSat, 11 Jan 2025 23:49:14 UTC (2,297 KB)\n\nFull-text links:\n\n## Access Paper:\n\nView a PDF of the paper titled Challenging reaction prediction models to generalize to novel chemistry, by John Bradshaw and 5 other authors\n\n- [View PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.06669)\n- [HTML (experimental)](https://arxiv.org/html/2501.06669v1)\n- [TeX Source](https://arxiv.org/src/2501.06669)\n\n[view license](http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/)\n\nCurrent browse context:\n\ncs.LG\n\n[<\u00a0prev](https://arxiv.org/prevnext?id=2501.06669&function=prev&context=cs.LG)\u00a0 \\| \u00a0[next\u00a0>](https://arxiv.org/prevnext?id=2501.06669&function=next&context=cs.LG)\n\n[new](https://arxiv.org/list/cs.LG/new) \\| [recent](https://arxiv.org/list/cs.LG/recent) \\| [2025-01](https://arxiv.org/list/cs.LG/2025-01)\n\nChange to browse by:\n\n[cs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06669?context=cs) [physics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06669?context=physics) [physics.chem-ph](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06669?context=physics.chem-ph)\n\n### References & Citations\n\n- [NASA ADS](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/arXiv:2501.06669)\n- [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?arxiv_id=2501.06669)\n- [Semantic Scholar](https://api.semanticscholar.org/arXiv:2501.06669)\n\nexport BibTeX citationLoading...\n\n## BibTeX formatted citation\n\n\u00d7\n\nData provided by:\n\n### Bookmark\n\nBibliographic Tools\n\n# Bibliographic and Citation Tools\n\nBibliographic Explorer Toggle\n\nBibliographic Explorer _( [What is the Explorer?](https://info.arxiv.org/labs/showcase.html#arxiv-bibliographic-explorer))_\n\nConnected Papers Toggle\n\nConnected Papers _( [What is Connected Papers?](https://www.connectedpapers.com/about))_\n\nLitmaps Toggle\n\nLitmaps _( [What is Litmaps?](https://www.litmaps.co/))_\n\nscite.ai Toggle\n\nscite Smart Citations _( [What are Smart Citations?](https://www.scite.ai/))_\n\nCode, Data, Media\n\n# Code, Data and Media Associated with this Article\n\nalphaXiv Toggle\n\nalphaXiv _( [What is alphaXiv?](https://alphaxiv.org/))_\n\nLinks to Code Toggle\n\nCatalyzeX Code Finder for Papers _( [What is CatalyzeX?](https://www.catalyzex.com))_\n\nDagsHub Toggle\n\nDagsHub _( [What is DagsHub?](https://dagshub.com/))_\n\nGotitPub Toggle\n\nGotit.pub _( [What is GotitPub?](http://gotit.pub/faq))_\n\nHuggingface Toggle\n\nHugging Face _( [What is Huggingface?](https://huggingface.co/huggingface))_\n\nLinks to Code Toggle\n\nPapers with Code _( [What is Papers with Code?](https://paperswithcode.com/))_\n\nScienceCast Toggle\n\nScienceCast _( [What is ScienceCast?](https://sciencecast.org/welcome))_\n\nDemos\n\n# Demos\n\nReplicate Toggle\n\nReplicate _( [What is Replicate?](https://replicate.com/docs/arxiv/about))_\n\nSpaces Toggle\n\nHugging Face Spaces _( [What is Spaces?](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/spaces))_\n\nSpaces Toggle\n\nTXYZ.AI _( [What is TXYZ.AI?](https://txyz.ai))_\n\nRelated Papers\n\n# Recommenders and Search Tools\n\nLink to Influence Flower\n\nInfluence Flower _( [What are Influence Flowers?](https://influencemap.cmlab.dev/))_\n\nCore recommender toggle\n\nCORE Recommender _( [What is CORE?](https://core.ac.uk/services/recommender))_\n\nIArxiv recommender toggle\n\nIArxiv Recommender _( [What is IArxiv?](https://iarxiv.org/about))_\n\n- Author\n- Venue\n- Institution\n- Topic\n\nAbout arXivLabs\n\n# arXivLabs: experimental projects with community collaborators\n\narXivLabs is a framework that allows collaborators to develop and share new arXiv features directly on our website.\n\nBoth individuals and organizations that work with arXivLabs have embraced and accepted our values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy. arXiv is committed to these values and only works with partners that adhere to them.\n\nHave an idea for a project that will add value for arXiv's community?

The data was provided by DeepMatter and was collected in their DigitalGlassware cloud platform. The reaction probe has 12 sensors to measure properties of interest, including temperature, pressure, and colour. Colour was a good predictor of product formation for this reaction and machine learning models were able to learn which of the properties were important. Predictions for the current product formation (in terms of % yield) had a mean absolute error of 1.2%. For predicting 30, 60 and 120\u00a0min ahead the error rose to 3.4, 4.1 and 4.6%, respectively. The work here presents an example into the insight that can be obtained from applying machine learning methods to sensor data in synthetic chemistry.</p></div></div><ul><li></li><li></li></ul><div><h2>Keywords</h2><p><span>Buchwald-Hartwig cross-coupling</span></p><p><span>Long short-term memory neural network</span></p><p><span>Reaction monitoring</span></p><p><span>Time series data</span></p></div><section><header><h2>Cited by (0)</h2></header></section><p><span>\u00a9 2022 The Author(s).

To facilitate molecular design, we integrated an interpretable\nheat-mapping algorithm named PIXIE (Predictive Insights and Xplainability\nfor Informed chemical space Exploration). PIXIE visualizes the influence\nof molecular substructures on predicted yields by leveraging fingerprint\nbit importances, providing synthetic chemists with a powerful tool\nfor the rational design of molecules. While heat mapping is an established\ntechnique, its integration with a machine-learning model tailored\nto the chemical space of C2-carboxylated 1,3-azoles represents a significant\nadvancement. This approach not only enables targeted exploration of\nthis underrepresented chemical space, fostering the discovery of new\nbioactive compounds, but also demonstrates the potential of combining\nthese methods for broader applications in other chemical domains.\n\n## 1\\. Introduction\n\nWhile carbon dioxide (CO2) is a key driver of climate\nchange,[1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#ref1) \u2212 [3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#ref3) it is also recognized as a versatile carbon source\nin organic chemistry due to its role as a C1 building block and its\nabundant availability and production.[4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#ref4) \u2212 [8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#ref8) Consequently, synthesis protocols that transform CO2 into\nvaluable molecules are of great interest.[5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#ref5) \u2212 [7](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#ref7), [9](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#ref9) \u2212 [14](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#ref14) Among these valuable molecules are 1,3-azoles, a prominent subgroup\nwithin the broader class of azoles.[15](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#ref15) 1,3-Azoles\nand their C2-carboxylated derivatives are already known to be relevant\nas anticoagulants, herbicides, fungicides, and aroma compounds.[16](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#ref16) \u2212 [18](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#ref18) C2-carboxylated 1,3-azoles could also enable new applications as\nprodrugs and propesticides, as well as in treatments for Bartter\u2019s\ndisease or breast cancer.[15](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#ref15)\n\nDespite\ntheir advantages, only about 20,000 C2-carboxylated azoles\nare commercially available, compared to almost 2.5 million C2-unsubstituted\n1,3-azoles (CAS SciFinder search in 07/2024; [Figure](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#fig1) [1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#fig1)).[15](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#ref15), [19](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#ref19) This highlights significant\npotential for expanding the chemical space of these compounds since\naccess to a broader variety of molecules facilitate the discovery\nof new bioactive compounds and, therefore, drugs.\n\n### Figure 1.\n\n[Open in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/figure/fig1/)\n\nNumber (in millions)\nof commercially available compounds that feature\na 1,3-azole substructure (with X = NR, O, S), excluding compounds\nwith a molecular weight exceeding 900 Da, as well as compounds containing\nmetal ions or isotopes.\n\nFelten et al. developed a mild, functional-group-tolerant\nsynthesis\nprotocol for the carboxylation of 1,3-azoles, followed by a subsequent\namide coupling reaction ( [Figure](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#fig2) [2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#fig2)).[19](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#ref19) The results of this\nprotocol were reported as liquid chromatography area percent (LCAP)\nyields. One data set from the study comprises 288 LCAP yields, obtained\nby combinatorially pairing 24 1,3-azoles (ten thiazoles, nine oxazoles,\nfive imidazoles) with 12 amines, see [Figure](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#fig2) [2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#fig2). The LCAP values of this combinatorial set\nrange from 0 to 78%.\n\n### Figure 2.\n\n[Open in a new tab](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/figure/fig2/)\n\nSynthesis protocol developed by Felten et al.[19](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#ref19)\n\nBy utilizing computer-aided synthesis planning\n(CASP) tools, time\nand resources can be saved by focusing on the most promising synthesis\nroutes or adapting protocols to achieve the desired outcome.[20](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#ref20) \u2212 [28](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#ref28) Building on the data set of Felten et al. ( [Figure](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#fig3) [3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#fig3)) and its associated synthesis pr...",
