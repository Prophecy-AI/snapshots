      "text": "K\u2011nearest\u2011neighbors (K\u2011NN) regression can give better generalization to solvents that were not present in the training set because it does not try to learn a global parametric mapping; it simply returns the average property of the most similar examples in the data.  In practice this means that when a new solvent shares structural or physicochemical descriptors with any of the training compounds, the prediction is anchored to those nearby points rather than being forced to extrapolate from a fitted neural\u2011network surface, which often over\u2011fits to the specific distribution of the training solvents\u202f([nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-22903-5)).  \n\nRecent comparative studies of solubility\u2011prediction models show that K\u2011NN can achieve accuracy comparable to deep\u2011neural\u2011network (DNN) or other complex learners while being far less sensitive to the choice of hyper\u2011parameters and to over\u2011training on the limited solvent space\u202f([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8665485)).  Moreover, a dedicated \u201csimple nearest\u2011neighbour\u201d analysis was found to match the performance of sophisticated machine\u2011learning pipelines on compound\u2011potency tasks, illustrating that the locality\u2011based approach can capture the essential solvent\u2011property relationships without the risk of memorising noise that plagues neural nets\u202f([nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-022-00581-6)).  \n\nTogether, these results suggest that K\u2011NN regression improves generalization to unseen chemical solvents by (1) relying on actual nearby examples rather than a learned global function, (2) reducing the tendency to over\u2011fit the training solvent distribution, and (3) delivering competitive predictive power with far fewer model\u2011specific assumptions.",

Supercritical processing can be used for nanonization of drug particles which in turn increases their solubility and consequently low dosage of drug for patients. This study presents the results of Neighbor-based ensemble models for predicting the mole fraction of paracetamol drug in supercritical solvent as well as solvent density at different conditions. The models were trained and evaluated using data of 40 instances. The K-nearest neighbor regression algorithm selected here as the base model, and ensemble methods of bagging and AdaBoost, were employed for model improvement. Additionally, two metaheuristic algorithms, BAT and GWO, were applied to adjust the hyperparameters of the models. The assessment of each model\u2019s performance was conducted through the utilization of three metrics, namely the R-squared score, MSE, and AARD percentage. The outcomes showed that the GWO-ADA-KNN model demonstrated superior performance in predicting both mole fraction and density, as evidenced by its respective R-squared scores of 0.98105 and 0.96719. These findings indicate that the proposed optimizer and models can predict accurately drug mole fraction and density under different conditions.\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n![](https://media.springernature.com/w215h120/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-025-19873-z/MediaObjects/41598_2025_19873_Fig1_HTML.png)\n### [Machine learning estimation and optimization for evaluation of pharmaceutical solubility in supercritical carbon dioxide for improvement of drug efficacy](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-19873-z?fromPaywallRec=false)\nArticleOpen access14 October 2025\n![](https://media.springernature.com/w215h120/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-025-24019-2/MediaObjects/41598_2025_24019_Fig1_HTML.png)\n### [Computational analysis on the influence of pressure and temperature on drug solubility in supercritical CO2with machine learning and optimizer](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-24019-2?fromPaywallRec=false)\nArticleOpen access17 November 2025\n![](https://media.springernature.com/w215h120/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-025-17642-6/MediaObjects/41598_2025_17642_Fig1_HTML.png)\n### [Raloxifene solubility in supercritical CO2and correlation of drug solubility via hybrid machine learning and gradient based optimization](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-17642-6?fromPaywallRec=false)\nArticleOpen access11 September 2025\n## Introduction\nThe physicochemical properties of paracetamol, such as its mole fraction and density, play a crucial role in its pharmaceutical applications, such as drug formulation, manufacturing, and quality control. Predicting the physicochemical properties of paracetamol under different conditions can be challenging due to its complex nature and the various factors that can influence its properties. One way to overcome this challenge is to develop accurate machine learning models that can provide reliable estimates of the mole fraction and density of paracetamol under different temperature and pressure conditions. On the other hand, solubility enhancement is a key issue in pharmaceutical production and most drugs suffer from poor solubility in body[1](#ref-CR1),[2](#ref-CR2),[3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-22903-5#ref-CR3). Different techniques can be utilized for improving drugs solubility.\nPreparation of drugs cocrystals and amorphous solid dispersion design are two methods developed for enhancing drugs bioavailability[4](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-22903-5#ref-CR4),[5](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-22903-5#ref-CR5). Also, nanosized medicines can be manufactured using supercritical solvents in which the drugs are formed after dissolution in the solvent. Pressure and temperatures can be tuned for production of drug particles with desired size[6](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-22903-5#ref-CR6),[7](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-22903-5#ref-CR7). The methodology is highly dependent on the solubility of drugs, and it is not suitable for poorly soluble drugs in supercritical solvents. While different solvents can be used in supercritical processing, CO2has attracted more attention owing to its great properties in drug manufacture, and mainly its mild supercritical condition which can be provided in the process. Several recent works have utilized CO2as the solvent for analysis of supercritical processing, and models were employed in estimation of solubility[8](#ref-CR8),[9](#ref-CR9),[10](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-22903-5#ref-CR10).\nFor saving the time and cost for solubility measurements in supercritical manufacture of medicines, predictive models can be executed and tested for calculation of solubility. Several thermodynamic models have been tested and used for correlating solubility of drugs in supercritical solvents; however, these models cannot be easily expanded for large variety of medications[11](#ref-CR11),[12](#ref-CR12),[13](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-22903-5#ref-CR13). Hence, models with easier procedures such as machine learning are...",

However, solubility prediction remains a crucial challenge. This study aimed to develop machine learning models that can accurately predict compound solubility in organic solvents. A dataset containing 5081 experimental temperature and solubility data of compounds in organic solvents was extracted and standardized. Molecular fingerprints were selected to characterize structural features. lightGBM was compared with deep learning and traditional machine learning (PLS, Ridge regression, kNN, DT, ET, RF, SVM) to develop models for predicting solubility in organic solvents at different temperatures. Compared to other models, lightGBM exhibited significantly better overall generalization (logS\u2009 \u00b1\u20090.20). For unseen solutes, our model gave a prediction accuracy (logS\u2009 \u00b1\u20090.59) close to the expected noise level of experimental solubility data. lightGBM revealed the physicochemical relationship between solubility and structural features. Our method enables rapid solvent screening in chemistry and may be applied to solubility prediction in other solvents.\n\n**Keywords:** Solubility prediction, Organic solvents, QSPR, Machine learning, lightGBM, Deep learning\n\n## Introduction\n\nOrganic solvents play an important role in the chemical industry. They are used in synthesis, catalysis, separation, quantitative analysis, and pharmaceutical formulation. Solvent selection depends on the solubility of compounds in multiple organic solvents. However, this has been a great challenge in chemistry and drug discovery. Since the last century, computational methods have been applied to estimating the solubility of compounds in water before the experiments \\[ [1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#CR1)\u2013 [6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#CR6)\\]. These methods included mechanism models and QSPR (quantitative structure\u2013property relationship) approaches. However, these methods are almost applied to prediction in water. There are relatively few approaches to predict the solubility in various organic solvents \\[ [7](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#CR7)\\]. Currently, the solubility measurements still rely on laborious and costly experiments, which is an obstacle to rapid solvent screening for the chemical industry. Increasing attention has been paid to designing QSPR approaches to accurately predict the solubility of molecules in various organic solvents because it represents potentially massive time and materials saving.\n\nBesides the QSPR approaches, some mechanism models have also been proposed for the solubility prediction in water or a single organic solvent since the last century. Table [1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#Tab1) summarizes the progress of mechanism models in solubility prediction. These methods include the simplistic rule-of-thumb \u201clike dissolves like\u201d, empirical equations, and thermodynamically-based mathematical expressions. Mathematical expressions were used to represent the correlations between solubility and other parameters quantitatively. For example, Hildebrand and Hansen solubility parameters are introduced to compute the solubility of drugs, excipients, and surfactants for dosage form design \\[ [8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#CR8)\\]. Flory\u2013Huggins modeling calculates the entropy of mixing when mixing a polymer and a drug/solvent \\[ [9](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#CR9), [10](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#CR10)\\]. The Flory\u2013Huggins parameter \u03c7 determines the compounds miscibility and could be estimated by simulation methods or solubility parameters \\[ [11](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#CR11), [12](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#CR12)\\]. Solvation Gibbs free energy is related to the solubility of substances. This is usually calculated by two types of thermodynamic cycles, involving the free energy of sublimation and solvating a gaseous molecule or the free energy of fusion and mixing. These cycles reflect the first-principles prediction and could be combined with machine learning models \\[ [13](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#CR13), [14](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#CR14)\\]. If some physical constants, such as enthalpy of fusion and melting point, are available, it is also possible to predict ideal solubility. Then, the error between...",

The general aim is the identification of new chemical entities that are highly potent against a given target. The relative performance of potency prediction models and their accuracy limitations continue to be debated in the field, and it remains unclear whether deep learning can further advance potency prediction. We have analysed and compared approaches of varying computational complexity for potency prediction and shown that simple nearest-neighbour analysis consistently meets or exceeds the accuracy of machine learning methods regarded as the state of the art in the field. Moreover, completely random predictions using different models were shown to reproduce experimental values within an order of magnitude, resulting from the potency value distributions in commonly used compound data sets. Taken together, these findings have important implications for typical benchmark calculations to evaluate machine learning performance. Simple controls such as nearest-neighbour analysis should generally be included in model evaluation. Furthermore, the narrow margin separating the best and completely random potency predictions is unrealistic and requires the consideration of alternative benchmark criteria, as discussed herein.\n[Access through your institution](https://wayf.springernature.com?redirect_uri&#x3D;https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-022-00581-6)\n[Buy or subscribe](#access-options)\nThis is a preview of subscription content,[access via your institution](https://wayf.springernature.com?redirect_uri&#x3D;https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-022-00581-6)\n## Access options\n[Access through your institution](https://wayf.springernature.com?redirect_uri&#x3D;https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-022-00581-6)\nAccess Nature and 54 other Nature Portfolio journals\nGet Nature+, our best-value online-access subscription\n$32.99/\u00a030\u00a0days\ncancel any time\n[Learn more](https://shop-amers.nature.com/products/plus/?region=US)\nSubscribe to this journal\nReceive 12 digital issues and online access to articles\n$119.00 per year\nonly $9.92 per issue\n[Learn more](https://www.nature.com/natmachintell/subscribe)\nBuy this article\n* Purchase on SpringerLink\n* Instant access to the full article PDF.\nUSD 39.95\nPrices may be subject to local taxes which are calculated during checkout\n**Fig. 1: Potency value distributions of activity classes.**\n![](https://media.springernature.com/m312/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs42256-022-00581-6/MediaObjects/42256_2022_581_Fig1_HTML.png)\n**Fig. 2: Prediction accuracy.**\n![](https://media.springernature.com/m312/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs42256-022-00581-6/MediaObjects/42256_2022_581_Fig2_HTML.png)\n**Fig. 3: Prediction accuracy for unique hold-out sets.**\n![](https://media.springernature.com/m312/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs42256-022-00581-6/MediaObjects/42256_2022_581_Fig3_HTML.png)\n**Fig. 4: Prediction accuracy for most potent compounds.**\n![](https://media.springernature.com/m312/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs42256-022-00581-6/MediaObjects/42256_2022_581_Fig4_HTML.png)\n**Fig. 5: Performance of random prediction models.**\n![](https://media.springernature.com/m312/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs42256-022-00581-6/MediaObjects/42256_2022_581_Fig5_HTML.png)\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n![](https://media.springernature.com/w215h120/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-023-45086-3/MediaObjects/41598_2023_45086_Fig1_HTML.png)\n### [Rationalizing general limitations in assessing and comparing methods for compound potency prediction](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-45086-3?fromPaywallRec=true)\nArticleOpen access19 October 2023\n![](https://media.springernature.com/w215h120/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-025-01594-y/MediaObjects/41598_2025_1594_Fig1_HTML.png)\n### [Computational approaches in drug chemistry leveraging python powered QSPR study of antimalaria compounds by using artificial neural networks](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-01594-y?fromPaywallRec=true)\nArticleOpen access02 June 2025\n![](https://media.springernature.com/w215h120/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-021-93771-y/MediaObjects/41598_2021_93771_Fig1_HTML.png)\n### [Feature importance correlation from machine learning indicates functional relationships between proteins and similar compound binding characteristics](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-93771-y?fromPaywallRec=true)\nArticleOpen access09 July 2021\n## Data availability\nPublicly available compounds and activity data including compound activity classes and sets of analogue series extracted from these classes were obtained from ChEMBL using the data selection and calculation protocols provided in[Compounds and activity data](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-022-00581-6#Sec9)and[Molecular representations, similarity calculations and analogue series](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-022-00581-6#Sec20).

      "text": "## 1\\. Introduction\n\nClick to copy section linkSection link copied!\n\n* * *\n\nMachine learning in general and especially deep learning has become a powerful tool in various fields of chemistry. Applications range from the prediction of physicochemical (1\u22129) and pharmacological (10) properties of molecules to the design of molecules or materials with certain properties, (11\u221213) the exploration of chemical synthesis pathways, (14\u221227) or the prediction of properties important for chemical analysis like IR, (28) UV/vis, (29) or mass spectra. (30\u221233)\n\nMany combinations of molecular representations and model architectures have been developed to extract features from molecules and predict molecular properties. Molecules can be represented as graphs, strings, precomputed feature vectors, or sets of atomic coordinates and processed using graph-convolutional neural networks, transformers, or feed-forward neural networks to train predictive models. While early works focused on handmade features or simple fingerprinting methods combined with kernel regression or neural networks, (34) the current state-of-the-art has shifted to end-to-end trainable models which directly learn to extract their own features. (35) Here, the models can achieve extreme complexity based on the mechanisms of information exchange between parts of the molecule. For example, graph convolutional neural networks (GCNNs) extract local information from the molecular graph for single or small groups of atoms and use that information to update the immediate neighborhood. (1\u22123,36) They offer robust performance for properties dependent on the local structure and if the three-dimensional conformation of a molecule is not known or not relevant for a prediction task. Graph attention transformers allow for a less local information exchange via attention layers, which learn to accumulate the features of atoms both close and far away in the graph. (37,38) Another important line of research comprises the prediction of properties dependent on the three-dimensional conformation of a molecule, such as the prediction of properties obtained from quantum mechanics. (2,39\u221241) Finally, transformer models from natural language processing can be trained on string representations such as SMILES or SELFIES, also leading to promising results. (42\u221245) In this work, we discuss our application of GCNNs, namely, Chemprop, (36) a directed-message passing algorithm derived from the seminal work of Gilmer et al. (1)\n\nAn early version of Chemprop was published in ref (36). Since then, the software has substantially evolved and now includes a vast collection of new features. For example, Chemprop is now able to predict properties for systems containing multiple molecules, such as solute/solvent combinations or reactions with and without solvent. It can train on molecular targets, spectra, or atom/bond-level targets and output the latent representation for analysis of the learned feature embedding. Available uncertainty metrics include popular approaches, such as ensembling, mean-variance estimation, and evidential learning. Chemprop is thus a general and versatile deep learning toolbox and enjoys a wide user base.\n\nThe remainder of the article is structured as follows: First, we summarize the architecture of Chemprop. We discuss a selection of Chemprop features with a focus on features introduced after the initial release of Chemprop. We then conclude the main body of the article and provide details on the data and software, which we have open-sourced including all scripts to allow for full reproducibility. Alongside the main body of this article, we provide [Supporting Information](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jcim.3c01250/suppl_file/ci3c01250_si_001.pdf) that contains further model design details; descriptions of the data acquisition, preprocessing, and splitting of all data sets used in benchmarking; and the results of Chemprop benchmarks on a variety of data sets showcasing its performance on both simple and advanced prediction tasks.\n\n## 2\\. Model Structure\n\nClick to copy section linkSection link copied!\n\n* * *\n\nChemprop consists of four modules: (1) a local features encoding function, (2) a directed message passing neural network (D-MPNN) to learn atomic embeddings from the local features, (3) an aggregation function to join atomic embeddings into molecular embeddings, and (4) a standard feed-forward neural network (FFN) for the transformation of molecular embeddings to target properties, summarized in [Figure 1](http://pubs.acs.org/pubs.acs.org#fig1). The D-MPNN is a class of graph-convolutional neural networks (GCNN), which updates hidden representations of the vertices _V_ and edges _E_ of a graph _G_ based on the local environment. In the following, we use bold lower case to denote vectors, bold upper case to denote matrices, and italic light font for scalars and objects.\n\n## Figure 1\n\nFigure 1. Overview of the architecture of Chemprop. The message passing update of the hidden vector for directed edge 2 \u2192 1 is expanded for demonstration.\n\nFor a molecule, the molecule SMILES string is used as input, which is then transformed to a molecular graph using RDKit, (46) where atoms correspond to vertices and bonds to edges. Initial features are constructed based on the identity and topology of each atom and bond. For each vertex _v_, initial feature vectors { **x** _v_ \\| _v_ \u2208 _V_} are obtained from a one-hot encoding of the atomic number, number of bonds linked to each atom, formal charge, chirality (if encoded in the SMILES), number of hydrogens, hybridization, and aromaticity of the atom, as well as the atomic mass (divided by 100 for scaling). For each edge _e_, initial feature vectors { **e** _vw_\\|{ _v_, _w_} \u2208 _E_} arise from the bond type, whether the bond is conjugated or in a ring, and whether it contains stereochemical information, such as a cis/trans double bond. The D-MPNN uses directed edges in a graph to pass information, where each undirected edge (bond) has two corresponding directed edges, one in each direction. Initial directed edge features **e** _vw_d are obtained via simple concatenation of the atom features of the first atom of a bond **x** _v_ to the respective undirected bond features **e** _vw_\n\nwhere cat() denotes simple concatenation. The directed edges **e** _vw_d and **e** _wv_d are distinguished only by the choice of which atom to use in [eq 1](http://pubs.acs.org/pubs.acs.org#eq1). Chemprop also offers the option to read in custom atom and bond features in addition to or as a replacement for the default features, as described in [SI](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acs.jcim.3c01250/suppl_file/ci3c01250_si_001.pdf) Section S1.2, and thus offers full control of the initial features. In summary, Module 1 of Chemprop constructs atom and directed bond feature vectors **x** _v_ and **e** _vw_d from the input molecules.\n\nThe initial atom and bond features are then passed to a D-MPNN. In a D-MPNN structure, messages are passed between directed edges rather than between nodes as would be done in a traditional MPNN. To construct the hidden directed edge features **h** _vw_0 of hidden size _h_, the initial directed edge features **e** _vw_d are passed through a single neural network layer with learnable weights Wi\u2208Rh\u00d7hi\n\nand a nonlinear activation function \u03c4 which can be chosen by the user (default ReLU). The size _h_ of **h** _vw_0 can be chosen by the user (default 300). The size of **e** _vw_d, which we term _h_ _i_, is set by the lengths of initial feature encodings, per [eq 1](http://pubs.acs.org/pubs.acs.org#eq1). The directed edge features are then iteratively updated based on the local environment via _T_ (default 3) message passing steps\n\nht+1vw=\u03c4(h0vw+Wh\u2211k\u2208{N(v)\\w}htkv)\n\n(3)\n\nuntil _t_ \\+ 1 = _T_, where Wh\u2208Rh\u00d7h and _N_( _v_)\\ _w_ denotes the neighbors of node _v_ excluding _w_. The opposite facing directed edge is excluded from the message passing update for increased num...",

      "text": "### Subjects\n\n## Abstract\n\nSolvent effects influence all stages of the chemical processes, modulating the stability of intermediates and transition states, as well as altering reaction rates and product ratios. However, accurately modelling these effects remains challenging. Here, we present a general strategy for generating reactive machine learning potentials to model chemical processes in solution. Our approach combines active learning with descriptor-based selectors and automation, enabling the construction of data-efficient training sets that span the relevant chemical and conformational space. We apply this strategy to investigate a Diels-Alder reaction in water and methanol. The generated machine learning potentials enable us to obtain reaction rates that are in agreement with experimental data and analyse the influence of these solvents on the reaction mechanism. Our strategy offers an efficient approach to the routine modelling of chemical reactions in solution, opening up avenues for studying complex chemical processes in an efficient manner.\n\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n\n## Introduction\n\n(Bio)chemical and industrially relevant reactions occur predominantly in the liquid phase[1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR1), [2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR2). The influence of solvent on reaction rates was first documented by Berthelot and Pean de Saint-Gilles in 1862[3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR3) and later formalised by Menschutkin in 1890[4](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR4). Since then, experimental and computational techniques have been developed to elucidate and quantify the origin of solvent effects on reactivity and selectivity[5](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR5). From an atomistic point of view, solvent effects arise from the interactions between solute and solvent molecules, which, although generally weak, have a significant impact on the overall reaction dynamics.\n\nIn computational chemistry, solvent effects are modelled using implicit or explicit solvent models. The former represents solvents as a polarisable continuum, offering computational simplicity and efficiency. However, it fails to capture the contributions arising from solute-solvent interactions, including entropy and pre-organisation effects[6](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR6). On the other hand, explicit solvent models provide an atomistic representation of the solvent but at a much higher computational cost since they require the use of ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD). This cost becomes significant when attempting to compute free energies, where extensive sampling is required to obtain statistically meaningful ensembles. Hybrid approaches, such as quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM), can alleviate this computational cost by describing only the reactive part at a QM level while the environment is described classically. However, the inclusion of mobile solvent molecules into the QM part creates additional technical difficulties, such as discontinuities at the boundary between the QM and MM regions[7](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR7), [8](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR8).\n\nIn recent years, machine learning-based potentials (MLPs) have emerged as powerful surrogates for existing modelling techniques, representing complex potential energy surfaces (PES) with an accuracy comparable to QM methods but at a significantly lower computational cost[9](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR9), [10](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR10). Since the pioneering work of Behler and Parinello (BP) on neural network-based potentials (NNP)[9](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR9), several MLP approaches have been developed, including models directly derived from BP, such as DeepMD[11](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR11) and ANI[12](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR12), message-passing NN models[13](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR13), such as PhysNet[14](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR14), SchNet[15](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR15), and MACE[16](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR16), kernel-based approaches, such as Gaussian Approximation Potential (GAP) and gradient-domain ML (GDML)[17](http://www.nature.com/www.nature.com#ref-CR17), [18](http://www.nature.com/www.nature.com#ref-CR18), [19](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR19), and linear regression-based models, such as linear Atomic Cluster Expansion (ACE)[20](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR20), [21](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR21). These MLPs have been successfully applied to study organic molecules[12](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR12), [22](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR22), material properties[23](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR23), [24](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR24) and simple chemical reactions in the gas phase and interfaces[25](http://www.nature.com/www.nature.com#ref-CR25), [26](http://www.nature.com/www.nature.com#ref-CR26), [27](http://www.nature.com/www.nature.com#ref-CR27), [28](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR28). While there are prominent examples of using MLPs to correct QM/MM computed free energies[29](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR29), modelling solvent implicitly[30](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR30), [31](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR31), or replacing the QM part to have a more efficient approach, ML/MM[32](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR32), only a handful of examples exist where chemical processes have been modelled in explicit solvent fully using MLPs. Such examples include urea decomposition in water[33](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR33), 1,3-dipolar cycloadditions in water[34](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR34), Strecker-cyanohydrin synthesis of glycine in water[35](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR35), and reactions in alkali carbonate-hydroxide electrolytes[36](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR36). In all these cases, NNPs are used, requiring thousands of AIMD configurations. For a comprehensive overview of relevant works, we refer the reader to a recent review by Isayev and Roitberg, ref. [37](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR37), and SI \u00a7 [S1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#MOESM1).\n\nOne of the main challenges limiting the application of MLPs to study chemical reactions in solution is the quality and size of the training data set, which needs to incorporate diverse configurations to effectively capture solute-solvent interaction at the minima and TS regions. Unlike solid-state systems, where particles are packed in highly ordered arrangements, molecules in solution are often flexible, resulting in a larger conformational space that needs to be sampled to accurately describe their PES. Moreover, the reliable description of reaction barriers and non-covalent interactions requires accurate reference electronic structure methods, further increasing the computational cost[38](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR38). The complexity of the training data can be reduced in \u0394-ML models[39](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50418-6#ref-CR39), which predict the differences between semi-empirical baseline and QM PES rather than the absolute energies. However, even in these approache...",

Here we report a successful approach\nto solubility prediction in organic solvents and water using a combination of machine learning\n(ANN, SVM, RF, ExtraTrees, Bagging and GP) and computational chemistry. Rational inter\u0002pretation of dissolution process into a numerical problem led to a small set of selected\ndescriptors and subsequent predictions which are independent of the applied machine\nlearning method. These models gave significantly more accurate predictions compared to\nbenchmarked open-access and commercial tools, achieving accuracy close to the expected\nlevel of noise in training data (LogS \u00b1 0.7). Finally, they reproduced physicochemical rela\u0002tionship between solubility and molecular properties in different solvents, which led to\nrational approaches to improve the accuracy of each models.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-19594-z OPEN\n1 Institute of Process Research & Development, School of Chemistry, University of Leeds, Woodhouse Lane, Leeds LS2 9JT, UK. 2 Chemical Development,\nPharmaceutical Technology and Development, Operations, AstraZeneca, Macclesfield SK10 2NA, UK. \u2709email: b.nguyen@leeds.ac.uk\nNATURE COMMUNICATIONS | (2020) 11:5753 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-19594-z | www.nature.com/naturecommunications 1\n1234567890():,;\nSolubility is a critical physical property of organic compounds\nin drug development, e.g., availability, distribution, meta\u0002bolism, excretion and toxicity (ADMET)1,2, protein engi\u0002neering3\u20135, chemical process design6, synthetic route prediction7,8,\nextraction and crystallisation9,10. Due to its importance in envir\u0002onmental predictions, biochemistry, and agrochemical and drug\ndesign, aqueous solubility prediction has been the subject of\nintensive research11. Previous solubility prediction approaches\ninclude fragment-based semi-empirical methods, e.g. general\nsolubility equation12, UNIFAC13, thermodynamic cycle14, ther\u0002modynamic parameters, e.g., UNIQUAC15,16, Hansen solubility\nparameters and Hildebrandt solubility parameters17,18, different\nmolecular dynamics methods19\u201321, and first principle ab initio\ncalculations (COSMO-RS)22,23. More recent developments\nfocused on quantitative structure-activity/property relationship\n(QSAR/QSPR)24,25, through statistical analysis and machine\nlearning techniques26\u201328. Despite these advances, accurate pre\u0002diction of solubility is still a major scientific challenge, as exem\u0002plified by the two solubility challenges issued to the research\ncommunity in 2008 and 201929,30. This is due to the complex\nnature of dissolution process, which involves lattice/sublimation\nenergy, solvation energy, ionisation of solute and solution phase\ninteractions. Each of these is a challenging property to predict and\ncan be quite computationally expensive31. Statistical and machine\nlearning approaches often employ a large number of descriptors\n(>100)32, which has led to difficulties in interpreting and rationally\nimproving prediction models33. Finally, prediction is hindered by\nthe poor quality of experimental solubility data34, which are\naffected by measurement techniques, and purity of solute and\nsolvents.\nIn this paper, we report our new approach to general solubility\nprediction in organic solvents, which has been understudied, and\nwater using machine learning. In contrast to previous studies, a\nsmall number of descriptors (14 in contrast to the usual >100\ndescriptors employed in QSPR models) were rationally selected\nbased on their relevance to the physicochemical aspects of dis\u0002solution process (Fig. 1a). Consequently, interpretable solubility\nprediction models, which reproduce physicochemical relation\u0002ships between solubility and molecular properties in different\nsolvents, with excellent accuracy were developed. Furthermore,\nthese models were successfully validated against industrial targets\nand those of the solubility challenges29,30. Finally, our results were\nbenchmarked against the AquaSol model26, EPI SuiteTM (the\nofficial tool of the EPA)35, and COSMOtherm as the standard ab\ninitio tool for solubility prediction36.\nResults and discussion\nData curation. Solubility data were collected from Open Note\u0002book Science Challenge aqueous solubility dataset and the Reaxys\ndatabase. For this study, only solubility data of neutral solutes in\nsingle component solvents were collected. While aqueous solu\u0002bility data are numerous, our search of the Reaxys database\nresulted in a limited amount of data in organic solvents (Fig. 1b).\nThus, ethanol, benzene and acetone were chosen as the solvents\nin this study to maximise the amount of training data and to\ncover the entire range of solvent polarity. Although benzene is not\na commonly employed solvent in modern chemistry, it represents\nnon-polar solvents with sufficient data availability.\nAnalysis of LogS values for the collected solubility data showed\nthat while the range for LogS (measured in M) in water is \u221212 to\n2, those in organic solvents are typically in the range of \u22124 to 1.\nTo provide a consistent comparison, a second aqueous solubility\ndataset (Water_set_narrow, LogS = \u22124 to 1) was created from\nthe first dataset (Water_set_wide). Although an even distribution\nof LogS values across the range in each dataset is preferable for\nmodel training (Fig. 1b), given the limitation on data availability\nno trimming based on LogS was carried out for the organic\nsolvent datasets (Ethanol_set, Benzene_set, and Acetone_set).\nMolecular weight (MW) was found to be normally distributed\nfor all datasets, centred on MW = 200 with few above MW = 500\n(Supplementary Fig. 4). For this study, compounds with MW >\n504 were excluded to keep computational costs reasonable while\nmaintaining their relevance to synthetic intermediates in drug\ndiscovery/development37. Interestingly, the distributions of\norganic functional groups are similar between the datasets with\nthe exception of a higher percentage of halides in Water_set_wide\nand Water_set_narrow and a higher percentage of sulphur\ncontaining compounds in Benzene_set (Supplementary Fig. 5). A\nwide range of functional groups were found including halogen, 3-\nand 4-membered rings, although B and Si containing compounds,\nwhich may be valuable synthetic intermediates, were absent.\nThus, five open-access and curated solubility datasets were\ncreated for this study. Three are unique solubility datasets in\norganic solvents. Each of these was split into a training set and a\nvalidation set by LogS binning (Supplementary Note 4.1) and a\nrandomly even distribution of data to ensure the representative\nnature of the validation set.\nDescriptor development: In order to develop interpretable\npredictive models for solubility in different solvents, a small set\nof molecular descriptors, which represent solute-solute and\nsolute-solvent interactions, was selected. This small set of\ndescriptors will also benefit the statistical robustness of the\nmodels given the relatively small size of the datasets. All 22\ndescriptors are summarised in Table 1, covering sum of thermal\nand electronic energies of the solute molecule, solvation energy,\norbital interaction between solute and solvent, dipole moment\nand charge distribution in the solute molecule, molecular\nvolume, Solvent Accessible Surface Area, molecular weight and\nthe number of atoms of the solute. Finally, the experimental\nmelting point was included as a reflection of the sublimation\nenergy of the solid form of the solute. Melting point prediction\nis still highly inaccurate (RMSE \u2248 38 \u00b0C), rendering experi\u0002mental values a necessity38.\nCorrelation between the calculated descriptors were analysed\nand summarised in Fig. 2a. The only observed significant\ncorrelations were those e...",

However, solubility prediction remains a crucial challenge. \nThis study aimed to develop machine learning models that can accurately predict compound solubility in organic \nsolvents. A dataset containing 5081 experimental temperature and solubility data of compounds in organic solvents \nwas extracted and standardized. Molecular fngerprints were selected to characterize structural features. lightGBM \nwas compared with deep learning and traditional machine learning (PLS, Ridge regression, kNN, DT, ET, RF, SVM) to \ndevelop models for predicting solubility in organic solvents at diferent temperatures. Compared to other models, \nlightGBM exhibited signifcantly better overall generalization (logS \u00b10.20). For unseen solutes, our model gave a pre\u0002diction accuracy (logS \u00b10.59) close to the expected noise level of experimental solubility data. lightGBM revealed the \nphysicochemical relationship between solubility and structural features. Our method enables rapid solvent screening \nin chemistry and may be applied to solubility prediction in other solvents.\nKeywords: Solubility prediction, Organic solvents, QSPR, Machine learning, lightGBM, Deep learning\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2021.

Tey are used in synthesis, catalysis, separation, \nquantitative analysis, and pharmaceutical formulation. \nSolvent selection depends on the solubility of com\u0002pounds in multiple organic solvents. However, this has \nbeen a great challenge in chemistry and drug discov\u0002ery. Since the last century, computational methods have \nbeen applied to estimating the solubility of compounds \nin water before the experiments [1\u20136]. Tese methods \nincluded mechanism models and QSPR (quantitative \nstructure\u2013property relationship) approaches. How\u0002ever, these methods are almost applied to prediction in \nwater. Tere are relatively few approaches to predict the \nsolubility in various organic solvents [7]. Currently, the \nsolubility measurements still rely on laborious and costly \nexperiments, which is an obstacle to rapid solvent screen\u0002ing for the chemical industry. Increasing attention has \nbeen paid to designing QSPR approaches to accurately \npredict the solubility of molecules in various organic sol\u0002vents because it represents potentially massive time and \nmaterials saving.\nBesides the QSPR approaches, some mechanism mod\u0002els have also been proposed for the solubility prediction \nin water or a single organic solvent since the last century. \nTable\u00a0 1 summarizes the progress of mechanism mod\u0002els in solubility prediction. Tese methods include the \nsimplistic rule-of-thumb \u201clike dissolves like\u201d, empirical \nequations, and thermodynamically-based mathemati\u0002cal expressions. Mathematical expressions were used to \nrepresent the correlations between solubility and other \nparameters quantitatively. For example, Hildebrand and \nHansen solubility parameters are introduced to compute \nthe solubility of drugs, excipients, and surfactants for \nOpen Access\nJournal of Cheminformatics\n*Correspondence: defangouyang@umac.mo\nState Key Laboratory of Quality Research in Chinese Medicine, Institute \nof Chinese Medical Sciences (ICMS), University of Macau, Macau, China\nYe\u00a0and Ouyang Journal of Cheminformatics (2021) 13:98 Page 2 of 13\ndosage form design [8]. Flory\u2013Huggins modeling calcu\u0002lates the entropy of mixing when mixing a polymer and \na drug/solvent [9, 10]. Te Flory\u2013Huggins parameter \u03c7 \ndetermines the compounds miscibility and could be esti\u0002mated by simulation methods or solubility parameters \n[11, 12]. Solvation Gibbs free energy is related to the \nsolubility of substances. Tis is usually calculated by two \ntypes of thermodynamic cycles, involving the free energy \nof sublimation and solvating a gaseous molecule or the \nfree energy of fusion and mixing. Tese cycles refect \nthe frst-principles prediction and could be combined \nwith machine learning models [13, 14]. If some physical \nconstants, such as enthalpy of fusion and melting point, \nare available, it is also possible to predict ideal solubil\u0002ity. Ten, the error between real and ideal solubility can \nbe reduced by taking account of additional heat capacity, \nevidenced by the case of paracetamol [15]. As for the pre\u0002diction in really nonideal solution, the activity coefcient \ncan be modeled by the non-random two-liquid (NRTL) \nmodel, UNIQUAC, and UNIFAC methods [16\u201318]. Te \nsolubility in real solvents can be predicted by conductor\u0002like screening model for real solvents (COSMO-RS), and \nit has been applied to drugs, pesticides, and asphaltenes \n[19\u201322]. Another mechanism model, molecular dynam\u0002ics (MD), provides the dynamic evolution of a system, \nincluding structure, motion, and energy of molecules. It \nexplains solubility through diferent aspects, such as Van \nder Waal forces and electrostatic forces between mol\u0002ecules [23]. Besides, ftted equations such as general solu\u0002bility equations (GSE) are proposed by Yalkowsky et\u00a0 al. \nconsidering logP and melting point of a substance [24, \n25]. logP is the measurement of the relationship between \nlipophilicity and hydrophilicity of a compound, which is \ndetermined by experiments.\nA few studies predict the solubility in various organic \nsolvents using these mechanism models. For exam\u0002ple, in 2002, Gracin et\u00a0 al. predicted the solubilities of 9 \ncompounds in water and 8 nonaqueous solvents using \nUNIFAC method [26]. In 2007, Eckert et\u00a0 al. applied \nCOSMO-RS to estimating the solubility of 21 solutes \nin aqueous and nonaqueous solvents [27]. In 2011 and \n2015, NRTL, UNIQUAC, UNIFAC, and COSMO-RS \nmodels were used to predict the solubilities of drugs \nand drug-like molecules in organic solvents by Matsuda \net\u00a0al. and Bouillot et\u00a0al. [28, 29]. However, these conven\u0002tional mechanism models required various experimental \nquantities for their implementation, such as enthalpy of \nfusion, Gibbs energy of fusion, and melting point. As a \nresult, their practical application in solvents screening is \nstill limited.\nMachine learning algorithms have also been employed \nto construct models for solubility prediction in vari\u0002ous organic solvents [7, 30, 31]. Te models were gen\u0002erated on experimental solubility data. Te accuracy \nof the models outperformed empirical equations and \nmechanistic models, such as UNIFAC and group contri\u0002bution methods [7]. Linear equations and support vec\u0002tor machine (SVM) are two commonly used traditional \nlinear and nonlinear methods. However, both methods \ndo not suit well high-dimension nonlinear data featured \nin the task of solubility prediction. Te dissolution pro\u0002cess depend...",
