## Current Status
- Best CV score: 0.008194 from exp_032 (GP 0.15 + MLP 0.55 + LGBM 0.3)
- Best LB score: 0.0877 from exp_030
- CV-LB gap: LB = 4.23×CV + 0.0533 (R²=0.98)
- Target: 0.0347 (2.53x away from best LB)
- Submissions remaining: 3

## Response to Evaluator
- Technical verdict was TRUSTWORTHY. The ChemBERTa experiment was executed correctly.
- Evaluator's top priority: Try approaches that could change the CV-LB relationship. I AGREE.
- Key concerns raised: 
  1. ChemBERTa confirms hand-crafted features are superior - AGREED, DO NOT SUBMIT ChemBERTa
  2. CV-LB gap remains the core challenge - AGREED, intercept (0.0533) > target (0.0347)
  3. Only 3 submissions remaining - AGREED, must be strategic

## Data Understanding
- Reference notebooks: See `exploration/evolver_loop51_analysis.ipynb` for full analysis
- Key patterns:
  1. CV-LB relationship is highly linear (R²=0.98) with intercept 0.0533
  2. Even with CV=0, predicted LB would be 0.0533 > target 0.0347
  3. ChemBERTa embeddings (768-dim) perform MUCH WORSE than Spange descriptors
  4. Pre-trained molecular embeddings from ZINC don't transfer to solvent prediction
  5. Simpler models (Ridge, GP) perform better than complex ones (Deep MLP, GNN)

## CRITICAL INSIGHT
The CV-LB relationship has an intercept (0.0533) that is ABOVE the target (0.0347).
This means we CANNOT reach the target by improving CV alone.
We need to CHANGE the relationship - reduce the intercept or find a different approach.

## Recommended Approaches (Priority Order)

### PRIORITY 1: Per-Target Optimization
**Rationale**: The server may weight targets differently. Our current approach treats all 3 targets equally.
- Train separate models optimized for each target (SM, Product 2, Product 3)
- Try different feature sets for different targets
- SM (starting material) may behave differently than products

### PRIORITY 2: Temperature-Solvent Interaction Features
**Rationale**: Different solvents may have different temperature sensitivity.
- Add explicit interaction terms: T × polarity, T × H-bonding, etc.
- The Arrhenius kinetics features (1/T, ln(t)) are already helping
- But solvent-specific temperature effects may be missing

### PRIORITY 3: Single Solvent Focus
**Rationale**: The server may weight single solvent data more heavily.
- Our current overall MSE weights by sample count (656 single, 1227 full)
- Try optimizing primarily for single solvent performance
- Single solvent CV is often better than full data CV

### PRIORITY 4: Simpler, More Generalizable Features
**Rationale**: Complex features may overfit to training solvents.
- Try using ONLY Spange descriptors (13 features) + Arrhenius kinetics (5 features)
- Remove DRFP and ACS PCA features
- The best models have been simpler (Ridge, GP)

### PRIORITY 5: Ensemble Diversity with Different Weights
**Rationale**: Current ensemble weights may not be optimal.
- Try different GP/MLP/LGBM weight combinations
- Focus on models that perform well on single solvent data
- Consider uncertainty-weighted predictions from GP

## What NOT to Try
- ChemBERTa or any pre-trained molecular embeddings (CV 137-309% worse)
- GNN models (CV 71% worse)
- Deep residual networks (CV 5x worse)
- Large ensembles with many models (marginal improvement, high variance)
- Any approach that increases CV without changing the CV-LB relationship

## Validation Notes
- CV scheme: Leave-One-Solvent-Out for single solvent (24 folds), Leave-One-Ramp-Out for full data (13 folds)
- CV-LB relationship: LB = 4.23×CV + 0.0533 (R²=0.98)
- The intercept (0.0533) is the "floor" - we need to reduce this
- DO NOT SUBMIT any model with CV > 0.010 (will only make LB worse)

## Submission Strategy
With only 3 submissions remaining:
1. Save at least 1 submission for the final model
2. Only submit if we have a hypothesis about changing the CV-LB relationship
3. Do NOT submit just to "see what happens" - each submission must test a specific hypothesis

## Competition-Specific Notes
- Submissions must follow the template structure (last 3 cells unchanged except model definition)
- Same hyperparameters must be used across all folds (no per-fold tuning)
- Different hyperparameters for different tasks (single vs full) is allowed
- Different hyperparameters for different targets (SM vs Products) is allowed
