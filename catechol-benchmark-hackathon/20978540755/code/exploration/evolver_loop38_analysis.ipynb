    "\n",
    "## The Fundamental Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "In leave-one-solvent-out CV:\n",
    "- The test solvent is NEVER seen during training\n",
    "- Learned embeddings for unseen solvents are just random initialization\n",
    "- This is why exp_037 got MSE 0.080438 (9.8x worse than baseline)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why GNN Would Work (But Learned Embeddings Don't)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **GNN**: Learns from molecular STRUCTURE (atoms, bonds, graph topology)\n",
    "   - Even for unseen solvents, the GNN can process the molecular graph\n",
    "   - The model learns general patterns about how molecular structure affects yield\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Learned Embeddings**: Learns from solvent IDENTITY\n",
    "   - For unseen solvents, there's no identity to look up\n",
    "   - The embedding is just random initialization\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Real Question\n",
