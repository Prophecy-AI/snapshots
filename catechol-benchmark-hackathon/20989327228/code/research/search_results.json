Recent work shows that **transfer\u2011learning with reaction\u2011transformer architectures** is especially effective: a pretrained natural\u2011language\u2011processing\u2011style transformer is fine\u2011tuned on an augmented version of the small training set, and test\u2011time augmentation is used to produce uncertainty estimates that correlate with actual errors.  Even when the augmented set contains only ~2.5\u202f% of the original high\u2011throughput data, these models outperform traditional fingerprint\u2011 or physics\u2011based descriptors ([IBM\u202f2021](https://research.ibm.com/publications/low-data-regime-yield-predictions-with-uncertainty-estimation-using-deep-learning-approaches)).  A closely related study demonstrates that an encoder\u2011transformer plus a regression head can achieve \u201coutstanding\u201d performance on high\u2011throughput reaction sets and highlights the importance of a text\u2011based reaction representation for low\u2011data scenarios ([IBM\u202f2021](https://research.ibm.com/publications/prediction-of-chemical-reaction-yields-using-deep-learning)).\n\nComplementary to deep\u2011learning transfer, **attention\u2011enhanced tree\u2011based models** have been shown to work well with very few trials.  The MetaRF framework couples a random\u2011forest regressor with an attention mechanism that focuses on the most informative descriptors, delivering accurate yield predictions from a handful of experiments ([MetaRF\u202f2023](https://jcheminf.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13321-023-00715-x)).  Classical **statistical modeling**\u2014careful selection of molecular descriptors (e.g., physicochemical, categorical, or computed features) combined with algorithms such as linear regression, Gaussian processes, or Bayesian regularization\u2014remains a solid baseline for sparse data, as it explicitly accounts for data distribution, descriptor relevance, and algorithmic bias ([Sigman\u202f2025](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adt3013)).  When graph\u2011structured information is desired, **attributed graph neural networks (AGNNs)** can match the best HTE\u2011based models but generally require larger, less biased datasets; they therefore serve best when supplemented with transfer learning or data\u2011augmentation strategies ([Saebi\u202f2023](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlepdf/2023/sc/d2sc06041h)).  In practice, the most reliable pipeline for small\u2011dataset yield prediction combines (1) a pretrained transformer fine\u2011tuned on an augmented reaction set, (2) uncertainty quantification via test\u2011time augmentation, and (3), as a fallback or interpretability layer, an attention\u2011augmented random forest or Bayesian statistical model.",

Here, we extend the application of natural language processing architectures to predict reaction properties given a text-based representation of the reaction, using an encoder transformer model combined with a regression layer. We demonstrate outstanding prediction performance on two high-throughput experiment reactions sets. An analysis of the yields reported in the open-source USPTO data set shows that their distribution differs depending on the mass scale, limiting the data set applicability in reaction yields predictions.\n## Related\nPaper\n### [Transfer learning enables the molecular transformer to predict regio- and stereoselective reactions on carbohydrates](https://research.ibm.com/publications/transfer-learning-enables-the-molecular-transformer-to-predict-regio-and-stereoselective-reactions-on-carbohydrates)\nPaper\n### [Comparison of computational methods for the electrochemical stability window of solid-state electrolyte materials](https://research.ibm.com/publications/comparison-of-computational-methods-for-the-electrochemical-stability-window-of-solid-state-electrolyte-materials)\nPoster\n### [Molecular transformer-aided biocatalysed synthesis planning](https://research.ibm.com/publications/molecular-transformer-aided-biocatalysed-synthesis-planning)\nShort paper\n### [Simulating fluid flow at pore scale with carbon dioxide in digital rock](https://research.ibm.com/publications/simulating-fluid-flow-at-pore-scale-with-carbon-dioxide-in-digital-rock)\n[View all publications](https://research.ibm.com/publications)",

In this paper, we focus on the reaction yield prediction problem, which assists chemists in selecting high-yield reactions in a new chemical space only with a few experimental trials. To attack this challenge, we first put forth MetaRF, an attention-based random forest model specially designed for the few-shot yield prediction, where the attention weight of a random forest is automatically optimized by the meta-learning framework and can be quickly adapted to predict the performance of new reagents while given a few additional samples. To improve the few-shot learning performance, we further introduce a dimension-reduction based sampling method to determine valuable samples to be experimentally tested and then learned. Our methodology is evaluated on three different datasets and acquires satisfactory performance on few-shot prediction. In high-throughput experimentation (HTE) datasets, the average yield of our methodology\u2019s top 10 high-yield reactions is relatively close to the results of ideal yield selection.\n\n## Introduction\n\nComputer-aided synthesis planning (CASP)\u00a0 \\[ [1](https://jcheminf.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13321-023-00715-x#ref-CR1)\\], which aims to assist chemists in synthesizing new molecule compounds, has been rapidly transformed by artificial intelligence methods. Given the availability of large-scale reaction datasets, such as the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) \\[ [2](https://jcheminf.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13321-023-00715-x#ref-CR2)\\], Reaxys \\[ [3](https://jcheminf.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13321-023-00715-x#ref-CR3)\\], and SciFinder \\[ [4](https://jcheminf.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13321-023-00715-x#ref-CR4)\\], CASP has become an increasingly popular topic in pharmaceutical discovery and organic chemistry with many impressive breakthroughs achieved \\[ [5](https://jcheminf.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13321-023-00715-x#ref-CR5)\\]. The current CASP systems can be divided into two critical aspects, retrosynthetic planning and forward-reaction prediction \\[ [6](https://jcheminf.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13321-023-00715-x#ref-CR6)\\]. Retrosynthetic planning, including template-based and template-free methods, can help generate possible synthetic routes of target molecules \\[ [7](https://jcheminf.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13321-023-00715-x#ref-CR7)\\]. Forward-reaction prediction is mainly used to evaluate the strategies proposed by retrosynthetic planning and increase the likelihood of experimental success \\[ [8](https://jcheminf.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13321-023-00715-x#ref-CR8)\\]. However, without considering reaction yield or reaction conditions, the synthetic strategies proposed in the CASP systems would be difficult to be implemented. It still remains a big challenge to predict the reaction yield. Due to the complexity of chemical experiments, few solid theories can help predict the reaction yield of a new chemical reaction given a specific condition, let alone optimize a reaction condition, which heavily depends on expertise, knowledge, intuition, numerous practices, extensive literature reading and even the luck of chemists \\[ [5](https://jcheminf.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13321-023-00715-x#ref-CR5), [9](https://jcheminf.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13321-023-00715-x#ref-CR9)\\].\n\nSome pioneer efforts have been contributed to predict the reaction yield, and then find the optimal reaction condition. Note that the optimal reaction selection problem can be naturally treated as a classical out-of-distribution (OOD) problem, since the optimal reaction is often not included in the training set. Ahneman et al. \\[ [10](https://jcheminf.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13321-023-00715-x#ref-CR10)\\] reported that the random forest model achieved the best performance on OOD yield prediction due to its good generalization ability. Zuranski et al. \\[ [11](https://jcheminf.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13321-023-00715-x#ref-CR11)\\] reviewed and examined the OOD performance of different machine learning algorithms and reaction embedding techniques. Dong et al. \\[ [12](https://jcheminf.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13321-023-00715-x#ref-CR12)\\] used the XGBoost model and achieved satisfactory OOD performance. Zhu et al. \\[ [13](https://jcheminf.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13321-023-00715-x#ref-CR13)\\] demonstrated that regression-based machine learning had great application potential in OOD yield prediction.\n\n\\[R2\u20134\\] Studying the experimental results in previous work, we found that the predicting performance will deteriorate dramatically when there exists relatively large difference between training and testing data.

Statistical modeling hinges on the data (what is being modeled), descriptors (how data are represented), and algorithms (how data are modeled).

This has encouraged a continually evolving landscape of strategies and questions regarding when to deploy a certain algorithm and the applicability of various types of molecular features. These two challenges are explicitly dependent on the experimental data available, including the number of experiments, the data distribution, and the identity of the output(s) measured. There have been many reviews on machine learning (ML) in synthetic chemistry (<a href=\"#core-collateral-R1\"><i>1</i></a>, <a href=\"#core-collateral-R2\"><i>2</i></a>), and we have recently presented perspectives on the history of these topics (<a href=\"#core-collateral-R3\"><i>3</i></a>) as well as protocols for designing datasets amenable to ML (<a href=\"#core-collateral-R4\"><i>4</i></a>, <a href=\"#core-collateral-R5\"><i>5</i></a>). Herein, we describe the tactics by which our group and others construct and interpret statistical models for chemical systems with an aim to describe the details to those that are just entering this exciting field.</p><p>In our experience, for most statistical modeling campaigns, an experimentalist has already collected much of the data intended for several downstream applications, including mechanistic interrogation, improving reaction performance, and understanding the scope and limitations of a reaction. These datasets are usually difficult to expand considerably for various practical reasons (e.g., cost, resources, and experimental burden such as measuring rates). Ideally, intentional dataset design (<a href=\"#core-collateral-R3\"><i>3</i></a>) is implemented regardless of the amount of data anticipated to be collected, but this is not always feasible. In other words, most data collected in both academia and industry are generally sparse, whether intentionally designed or not.

Specifically, we detail the strategies of statistical modeling efforts to glean valuable insights from low data regimes.</p><p>Statistical modeling of chemical reactivity, most often defined by selectivity, yield, and/or rates, is dependent on three pillars (<a href=\"#F1\">Fig. 1A</a>): data (what is being modeled), representation (how the chemical structures involved are described), and algorithm (how the data are processed as a function of the representation). All three pillars are interdependent and must be considered together to develop the best approach for a specific objective. Furthermore, if the goal is interpretability (i.e., mechanism or hypothesis generation), then ML in chemistry will also require grounding in physical measures (e.g., quantum mechanical calculations to understand electron distributions and/or potential energy surfaces that directly influence the reaction output).

However, the scope of this review is confined to modest to medium-sized datasets, which often limit employable methods and present unique statistical challenges (<a href=\"#core-collateral-R2\"><i>2</i></a>, <a href=\"#core-collateral-R6\"><i>6</i></a>). Here, we loosely define, from a data chemist\u2019s perspective, small to be fewer than 50 experimental data points, medium to be up to 1000 data points, and large to be &gt;1000 data points. Although these ranges are not definitive, they reflect the amount of data achieved from common experimental campaigns: Small datasets typically result from substrate/catalyst scope exploration, while medium datasets usually use high-throughput experimentation (HTE), and large datasets may also use HTE or can be mined from the literature.</p><p>Furthermore, the composition of the dataset is perhaps the most important consideration and will be discussed further in the next section. However, it is worth noting that we have largely found developing statistical models using data collected under a single set of reaction conditions (e.g., solvent and temperature) to be effective for elucidating substrate and/or catalyst reactivity trends, a common precept in developing linear free energy relationships. If the reaction conditions change, then statistical models can often still be constructed if the underlying mechanism is conserved. However, when reaction conditions lead to different interactions that affect reactivity, it becomes necessary to parameterize the reaction conditions and use nonlinear fitting techniques (<a href=\"#core-collateral-R7\"><i>7</i></a>, <a href=\"#core-collateral-R8\"><i>8</i></a>).</p></section><section><h3>Representation</h3><p>The molecular representation used to construct models is a key consideration. Molecules can be represented by descriptors that range from simplistic and computationally inexpensive to specifically designed and computationally expensive. No matter the level of complexity, molecular descriptors serve to quantify molecular features using mathematical relationships. The most common include quantitative structure activity relationships (QSAR) (<a href=\"#core-collateral-R9\"><i>9</i></a>), fingerprint (<a href=\"#core-collateral-R10\"><i>10</i></a>\u2013<a href=\"#core-collateral-R12\"><i>12</i></a>), graphs (<a href=\"#core-collateral-R13\"><i>13</i></a>, <a href=\"#core-collateral-R14\"><i>14</i></a>), semiempirical (<a href=\"#core-collateral-R15\"><i>15</i></a>), density functional theory (<a href=\"#core-collateral-R16\"><i>16</i></a>\u2013<a href=\"#core-collateral-R18\"><i>18</i></a>), and designer descriptors (<a href=\"#core-collateral-R19\"><i>19</i></a>), which have all been successfully used for statistical modeling. Specifically, we often use modern computationally derived molecular descriptors for modeling efforts (<a href=\"#core-collateral-R17\"><i>17</i></a>) and emphasize that the collection of descriptors specific to the reactive moiety lends itself to more mechanistically grounded models.

Data from electronic laboratory notebooks (ELNs) could provide less biased, large datasets, but no such datasets have been made publicly available. The first realworld dataset from the ELNs of a large pharmaceutical company is disclosed and its relationship to highthroughput experimentation (HTE) datasets is described. For chemical yield predictions, a key task in chemical synthesis, an attributed graph neural network (AGNN) performs as well as or better than the best previous models on two HTE datasets for the Suzuki-Miyaura and Buchwald-Hartwig reactions. However, training the AGNN on an ELN dataset does not lead to a predictive model. The implications of using ELN data for training ML-based models are discussed in the context of yield predictions. \u2020 Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available: Details of the dataset generation and curation, model building and evaluation, model operation guide and metrics.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe development of predictive methods is a long-standing goal of computational chemistry. Initially, physics based modeling techniques such as DFT or force \ue103eld methods were used to understand reaction mechanisms and predict e.g. the stereochemical outcome of reactions 1 or suitable catalysts for their acceleration. 2 More recently, machine leaning (ML) methods 3 have been used to predict the likely products of reactions (forward synthesis prediction) 4,5 and promising pathways for the synthesis of organic molecules with a range of complexity. [6][7][8][9] The prediction of yields of chemical reactions is a particularly challenging task because it is in\ue104uenced not only by the variables of the reaction under study, but also by all possible side reactions. At the same time, it is an extremely important task due to the signi\ue103cant effort needed to optimize the yield of a reaction by variation of reaction conditions and catalysts. Doyle and coworkers [10][11][12] sought to address this challenge for the case of predicting the effect of heterocyclic poisons on the yield of the widely used Buchwald-Hartwig amination by training a ML model on a dataset of 4608 reactions from highthroughput experimentation (HTE). Using a random forest (RF) model and computed physics-based features such as NMR shi\ue09ds or HOMO/LUMO energies, an R 2 of 0.92 was achieved ( Fig. 1 A). More complex models such as neural networks did not provide higher predictivity. 10 Fu et al. 13 used a dataset of 387 Suzuki-Miyaura reactions 14 and features from DFT calculations to train a deep neural network, resulting in a model with an R 2 of 0.92. Both HTE datasets have subsequently been successfully used in a range of ML models for yield predictions. [15][16][17] Bayesian optimizers 18,19 and deep reinforcement learning 20 were also successful in the iterative optimization of reaction conditions for a variety of reactions. As will be discussed in more detail below, the use of HTE datasets in ML predictions has some signi\ue103cant drawbacks in that these datasets represent a very narrow part of the reaction space, are very time-and resource intensive and present challenges with over\ue103tting of the models.\n\nIn contrast, the use of legacy datasets from published scien-ti\ue103c or patent literature for yield prediction has been less successful. The attempt to classify reaction yields as above or below 65% based on a training set of \u223c10 6 reactions from the Reaxys database using a large number of descriptors and ML methods gave an accuracy of 65 \u00b1 5%, i.e. a 35% error. 21 The authors of that study attributed this \ue103nding to the de\ue103ciencies of \"currently available chemical descriptors\", but it should also be noted that the reaction space represented in their dataset is vast. Schwaller et al. 22 developed a modi\ue103cation of the bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) model, 23 which uses natural language processing to build a reaction SMILES encoder trained on a large corpus of reactions, followed by a classi\ue103cation or regression layer for a speci\ue103c task. This approach was successful for product predictions 5 as well as for reaction yield predictions of the Suzuki-Miyaura (blue in Fig. 1B) and Buchwald-Hartwig reactions. 22 While this approach achieves R 2 values of 0.81 and 0.95, respectively, in line with other ML models when trained on these HTE datasets, 10,24 training on a dataset of Suzuki-Miyaura reactions from the US Patent database (USPTO) 22,25 led to a maximum R 2 score of 0.388 (red in Fig. 1B). When the training set was limited to reactions run on a gram scale, the R 2 value dropped further to 0.277, which was attributed to the strong bias of this dataset towards high-yielding reactions. 22 Similarly, a recent study on the predictions of optimal conditions by Burke and Grzybowski showed that even when limiting the dataset to a single reaction, in their case 16 748 Suzuki-Miyaura reactions curated from the literature, a range of ML models did not perform better than a model based only on the popularity of a set of reaction conditions. 26 Finally, Reymond and coworkers 27 constructed a more qualitative \"data-driven cheat-sheet\" for the recommendation of conditions for the Buchwald-Hartwig reaction based on a dataset of 62 000 examples from a variety of databases.\n\nTaken together, these previous \ue103ndings highlight the challenges in using legacy datasets to train ML yield prediction models. As in other areas of ML, there is a lack of suitable datasets to train and validate the models. Although most of the chemical literature is summarized in commercial databases, they are proprietary. The USPTO, which was converted into a widely used dataset, 4 and the recently introduced Open Reaction Database 28 are exceptions. As a result, studies using commercial databases do not include the data the models were built with. 27,29 Furthermore, databases such as Reaxys frequently do not contain complete reaction information and re\ue104ect the bias of the published literature towards high-yielding reactions and inevitable human error, e.g. in assigning product structures. 30 Finally, the total chemical reaction space is enormous in comparison with even the biggest reaction databases, resulting in a sparse coverage.\n\nAs part of our ongoing efforts to explore the potential and limitations of ML methods in synthetic chemistry, we sought to investigate distinct approaches to the use of legacy datasets for reaction yield prediction. Here we introduce a novel dataset extracted from the electronic laboratory notebooks (ELNs) of a large pharmaceutical company and an automated procedure for the curation of the dataset using a Jupyter notebook. It has long been hypothesized 8,31,32 that the use of ELNs to train ML models could unlock much larger datasets that are not subject to the publication bias towards high-yielding reactions. While this approach is pursued internally at a number of large organizations, 8 the underlying datasets are proprietary. To the best of our knowledge no such ELN-derived datasets have been made publicly available, and therefore the frequently made assumption that they can be used for training ML models for yield predictions has not been tested in a reproducible fashion. To investigate whether the sparsity, noise, and inherent bias of legacy datasets can be addressed in either standard ML models used for HTE datasets or more advanced ML models based on an attributed graph neural network model we developed, we studied two widely used reactions on both HTE and ELNderived datasets as case studies. Finally, we discuss the implications of the \ue103ndings for the u...",

In organic synthesis, providing accurate chemical reactivity predictions with supervised ML could assist chemists with reaction prediction, optimization, and mechanistic interrogation.To apply supervised ML to chemical reactions, one needs to define the object of prediction (e.g., yield, enantioselectivity, solubility, or a recommendation) and represent reactions with descriptive data. Our group's effort has focused on representing chemical reactions using DFT-derived physical features of the reacting molecules and conditions, which serve as features for building supervised ML models.In this Account, we present a review and perspective on three studies conducted by our group where ML models have been employed to predict reaction yield. First, we focus on a small reaction data set where 16 phosphine ligands were evaluated in a single Ni-catalyzed Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reaction, and the reaction yield was modeled with linear regression. In this setting, where the regression complexity is strongly limited by the amount of available data, we emphasize the importance of identifying single features that are directly relevant to reactivity. Next, we focus on models trained on two larger data sets obtained with high-throughput experimentation (HTE). With hundreds to thousands of reactions available, more complex models can be explored, for example, models that algorithmically perform feature selection from a broad set of candidate features. We examine how a variety of ML algorithms model these data sets and how well these models generalize to out-of-sample substrates. Specifically, we compare the ML models that use DFT-based featurization to a baseline model that is obtained with features that carry no physical information, that is, random features, and to a naive non-ML model that averages yields of reactions that share the same conditions and substrate combinations. We find that for only one of the two data sets, DFT-based featurization leads to a significant, although moderate, out-of-sample prediction improvement. The source of this improvement was further isolated to specific features which allowed us to formulate a testable mechanistic hypothesis that was validated experimentally. Finally, we offer remarks on supervised ML model building on HTE data sets focusing on algorithmic improvements in model training.Statistical methods in chemistry have a rich history, but only recently has ML gained widespread attention in reaction development. As the untapped potential of ML is explored, novel tools are likely to arise from future research. Our studies suggest that supervised ML can lead to improved predictions of reaction yield over simpler modeling methods and facilitate mechanistic understanding of reaction dynamics. However, further research and development is required to establish ML as an indispensable tool in reactivity modeling.\n\n[PubMed Disclaimer](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/disclaimer/)\n\n## Similar articles\n\n- [Molecular Machine Learning for Chemical Catalysis: Prospects and Challenges.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36715248/)\n\nSingh S, Sunoj RB.Singh S, et al.Acc Chem Res. 2023 Feb 7;56(3):402-412. doi: 10.1021/acs.accounts.2c00801.
