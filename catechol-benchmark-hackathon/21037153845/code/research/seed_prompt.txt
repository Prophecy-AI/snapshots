## Current Status
- Best CV score: 0.005146 from exp_069 (CatBoost + XGBoost Ens Model) - **35% improvement!**
- Best LB score: 0.0877 (exp_030)
- Target: 0.0347 | Gap to target: 0.0530 (from best LB)

## CV-LB Relationship Analysis (CRITICAL)
- Linear fit: LB = 4.23 * CV + 0.0533 (R² = 0.98)
- Intercept interpretation: Even at CV=0, expected LB is 0.0533 (above target!)
- Predicted LB for exp_069: 4.23 * 0.005146 + 0.0533 = **0.0751**
- **CRITICAL**: All 13 previous submissions used GP + MLP + LGBM variants
- exp_069 uses CatBoost + XGBoost (fundamentally different approach)
- **The CV-LB relationship MAY BE DIFFERENT for this approach!**

## Response to Evaluator
- Technical verdict: TRUSTWORTHY. Implementation is correct and follows the Ens Model kernel.
- Evaluator's top priority: SUBMIT exp_069 to verify CV-LB relationship. **AGREED 100%**
- Key concerns raised:
  1. Verify numeric feature engineering (T_x_RT, RT_log, T_inv, RT_scaled) - IMPLEMENTED
  2. Single solvent performance degradation (0.009175 vs 0.008216) - Acceptable trade-off for 62% improvement in Full Data
  3. Submission strategy - Using this submission to verify if CatBoost+XGBoost has different CV-LB relationship

## Data Understanding
- Reference notebooks: See `exploration/evolver_loop65_analysis.ipynb` for CV-LB analysis
- Key patterns:
  1. CatBoost + XGBoost dramatically better for mixture data (Full Data MSE: 0.002992 vs 0.007789)
  2. Feature priority filtering reduced features from 4199 to 69
  3. Different ensemble weights for single (7:6) vs full (1:2) are important
  4. Multi-target normalization (clip + renormalize if sum > 1) applied

## IMMEDIATE ACTION: SUBMIT exp_069
This is the highest-leverage action available:
- 35% CV improvement (largest in 69 experiments)
- Fundamentally different approach (CatBoost + XGBoost vs GP + MLP + LGBM)
- May have a different CV-LB relationship that makes target reachable

**Expected outcomes:**
1. **BEST CASE**: LB ≈ 0.05-0.06 (different CV-LB relationship, lower intercept)
   - Would indicate target is reachable with further optimization
2. **GOOD CASE**: LB ≈ 0.075 (follows old relationship)
   - Still best LB achieved (vs 0.0877)
3. **WORST CASE**: LB doesn't improve proportionally
   - Would indicate need to investigate differences from kernel

## After Submission: Next Steps Based on LB Result

### If LB < 0.07 (different CV-LB relationship confirmed):
1. **Optimize CatBoost + XGBoost hyperparameters** for this specific problem
2. **Try different ensemble weights** - current weights from kernel may not be optimal
3. **Add more feature sources** - the kernel uses bit-table filtering for DRFP/Fragprints
4. **Per-target optimization** - different hyperparameters for SM vs Product 2 vs Product 3

### If LB ≈ 0.075 (same CV-LB relationship):
1. **Combine CatBoost+XGBoost with GP** - ensemble diversity
2. **Try uncertainty-weighted predictions** - blend toward mean when extrapolating
3. **Investigate kernel differences** - are there features we're missing?

### If LB > 0.08 (CV improvement doesn't translate):
1. **Debug the implementation** - compare feature-by-feature with kernel
2. **Check for data leakage** - ensure no information leaking
3. **Try the exact kernel code** - copy-paste approach

## What NOT to Try
- More GP + MLP + LGBM variations (exhausted, same CV-LB line)
- Multi-seed ensembles (proven not to help)
- Bias correction / post-processing (doesn't change the relationship)

## Validation Notes
- CV scheme: Leave-One-Solvent-Out for single, Leave-One-Ramp-Out for full
- Combined CV: Weighted average by sample count (656 single + 1227 full = 1883 total)
- Multi-target normalization applied as post-processing
