## Current Status
- Best CV score: 0.005146 from exp_069 (CatBoost + XGBoost Ens Model) - **35% IMPROVEMENT!**
- Best LB score: 0.0877 (exp_030)
- Target: 0.0347 | Gap to target: 0.0530 (from best LB)

## CV-LB Relationship Analysis (CRITICAL)
- Linear fit: LB = 4.23 * CV + 0.0533 (R² = 0.98)
- Intercept interpretation: Even at CV=0, expected LB is 0.0533 > Target (0.0347)
- **Predicted LB for exp_069**: 4.23 * 0.005146 + 0.0533 = **0.0751**
- This would be the BEST LB achieved (vs 0.0877), but still far from target

**CRITICAL QUESTION**: Does the CatBoost + XGBoost approach have a DIFFERENT CV-LB relationship?
- The approach is fundamentally different (gradient boosting vs GP/MLP/LGBM)
- Feature priority-based correlation filtering may improve generalization
- **ONLY WAY TO KNOW: SUBMIT exp_069 and compare actual vs predicted LB**

## Response to Evaluator
- Technical verdict was **TRUSTWORTHY**. Implementation is correct and results are reliable.
- Evaluator's top priority: **SUBMIT THIS MODEL** to verify the CV-LB relationship. **FULLY AGREE.**
- Key concerns raised:
  1. Verify numeric feature engineering (T_x_RT, RT_log, T_inv, RT_scaled) - These ARE included in the featurizer
  2. Single solvent performance degradation (0.009175 vs 0.008216) - Acceptable tradeoff for 62% improvement in Full Data
  3. Submission strategy - 5 submissions remaining, this is the highest-leverage use

## Data Understanding
- Reference notebooks: See `exploration/evolver_loop65_analysis.ipynb` for CV-LB analysis
- Key patterns exploited by exp_069:
  1. **Feature priority filtering**: Spange (5) > ACS (4) > DRFP (3) > Frag (2) - reduced 4199 features to 69
  2. **CatBoost with MultiRMSE**: Multi-output regression in single model
  3. **Different ensemble weights**: Single (7:6 CatBoost:XGBoost), Full (1:2 CatBoost:XGBoost)
  4. **Multi-target normalization**: Clip negatives, renormalize if sum > 1

## IMMEDIATE ACTION: SUBMIT exp_069

**This is the highest-leverage action available.**

Reasons:
1. **35% CV improvement** - largest improvement in 69 experiments
2. **Fundamentally different approach** - may have different CV-LB relationship
3. **Predicted LB = 0.0751** would be best LB achieved
4. **If actual LB < 0.0751**: The intercept is lower, target may become reachable
5. **5 submissions remaining** - this is the best use of a submission

## After Submission: Next Steps Based on LB Result

### Scenario A: Actual LB ≈ 0.0751 (same relationship)
- The CV-LB relationship hasn't changed
- Continue optimizing the Ens Model approach:
  1. Tune hyperparameters (depth, learning_rate, n_estimators)
  2. Try different correlation thresholds (0.7, 0.9)
  3. Add more feature engineering (polynomial features, interactions)
  4. Try different ensemble weights

### Scenario B: Actual LB < 0.0751 (better relationship!)
- The CatBoost + XGBoost approach generalizes better!
- Calculate new intercept and slope
- If target becomes reachable, focus on:
  1. Further CV improvement
  2. Hyperparameter optimization
  3. Feature engineering

### Scenario C: Actual LB > 0.0751 (worse relationship)
- The approach overfits more than expected
- Investigate why:
  1. Check if feature filtering is too aggressive
  2. Try more regularization
  3. Consider simpler models

## Recommended Approaches (After Submission)

Priority-ordered list based on submission result:

1. **Hyperparameter tuning for Ens Model** - CatBoost and XGBoost have many tunable parameters
   - Depth: Try 2, 4, 5 (currently 3)
   - Learning rate: Try 0.05, 0.08, 0.1 (currently 0.06-0.07)
   - n_estimators: Try 800, 1200 (currently 1050-1100)

2. **Feature correlation threshold tuning** - Currently 0.8
   - Try 0.7 (more aggressive filtering)
   - Try 0.9 (less aggressive filtering)

3. **Single solvent optimization** - Currently worse than best (0.009175 vs 0.008216)
   - The combined score is dominated by Full Data, but Single Solvent matters
   - Try separate hyperparameters for single solvent

4. **Ensemble with previous best models** - Combine Ens Model with GP ensemble
   - The approaches are diverse (gradient boosting vs GP)
   - Blending may reduce variance

## What NOT to Try
- GP + MLP + LGBM variations - exhausted, all fall on same CV-LB line
- Multi-target normalization alone - only 0.08% improvement
- Deep residual networks - failed badly (exp_004)
- DRFP with PCA - worse than Spange alone (exp_002)

## Validation Notes
- CV scheme: Leave-One-Solvent-Out for single (24 folds), Leave-One-Ramp-Out for full (87 folds)
- Combined MSE: (single_mse * 656 + full_mse * 1227) / 1883
- The Ens Model kernel uses the same CV scheme, so results should be comparable

## CRITICAL REMINDER
- **SUBMIT exp_069 IMMEDIATELY** to verify the CV-LB relationship
- This is the most important action right now
- The 35% CV improvement is the largest in 69 experiments
- We need to know if this approach changes the CV-LB relationship
