## Current Status
- Best CV score: 0.005146 from exp_069 (MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH - 35% improvement!)
- Best LB score: 0.0877 from exp_030
- Target: 0.0347 | Gap to target: 0.053 (current best LB)

## CV-LB Relationship Analysis (CRITICAL)
- Linear fit: LB = 4.23 * CV + 0.0533 (R² = 0.98)
- Intercept interpretation: Even at CV=0, expected LB is 0.0533
- Are all approaches on the same line? YES (so far)
- Predicted LB for exp_069: 0.0751 (using old relationship)
- **CRITICAL QUESTION**: Does exp_069 have a DIFFERENT CV-LB relationship?

## Response to Evaluator
- Technical verdict was TRUSTWORTHY. Implementation is correct and results are reliable.
- Evaluator's top priority: SUBMIT exp_069 to verify the CV-LB relationship. **FULLY AGREE.**
- Key concerns raised:
  1. Verify numeric feature engineering (T_x_RT, RT_log, T_inv, RT_scaled) - These ARE included in the featurizer
  2. Single solvent performance degradation (0.009175 vs 0.008216) - Acceptable tradeoff for 62% improvement in Full Data
  3. Submission strategy - SUBMIT IMMEDIATELY is the correct action

## Data Understanding
- Reference notebooks: See `experiments/069_ens_model_exact/experiment.ipynb`
- Key patterns exploited:
  1. Feature priority filtering: Spange (5) > ACS (4) > DRFP (3) > Frag (2)
  2. Correlation filtering (threshold=0.8) reduced features from 4199 to 69
  3. Different ensemble weights: Single (7:6), Full (1:2)
  4. CatBoost with MultiRMSE for multi-output regression
  5. XGBoost with separate models per target

## MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH: exp_069 Results
- Single Solvent MSE: 0.009175 (n=656) - slightly worse
- Full Data MSE: 0.002992 (n=1227) - **62% BETTER!**
- Combined MSE: 0.005146 - **35% BETTER than previous best!**

This is a fundamentally different approach:
1. Different model family (CatBoost + XGBoost vs GP + MLP + LGBM)
2. Different feature set (69 features after correlation filtering vs 140+)
3. Different ensemble weights for single vs full data
4. Multi-target normalization (clip + renormalize if sum > 1)

## Recommended Approaches (AFTER SUBMISSION)
Priority-ordered list of what to try next:

1. **SUBMIT exp_069 FIRST** - This is the most critical action
   - Will reveal if the CV-LB relationship has changed
   - Expected LB: 0.0751 (if relationship unchanged) or better (if changed)

2. **If LB improves significantly (< 0.07):**
   - Continue optimizing the CatBoost + XGBoost approach
   - Try different correlation thresholds (0.7, 0.9)
   - Try different ensemble weights
   - Add more feature engineering

3. **If LB follows old relationship (~0.075):**
   - The intercept problem persists
   - Need to find approaches that CHANGE the relationship
   - Consider extrapolation detection features
   - Consider uncertainty-weighted predictions

4. **Improve Single Solvent Performance:**
   - Single Solvent MSE is worse (0.009175 vs 0.008216)
   - Try separate hyperparameters for single solvent
   - Consider ensemble with GP for single solvent

## What NOT to Try
- More GP + MLP + LGBM variations - these all fall on the same CV-LB line
- Simple hyperparameter tuning without changing the approach
- Approaches that only improve CV without addressing the intercept

## Validation Notes
- CV scheme: Leave-One-Solvent-Out for single, Leave-One-Ramp-Out for full
- The CV-LB relationship is LB = 4.23*CV + 0.0533 (R² = 0.98)
- Intercept (0.0533) > Target (0.0347) means target is unreachable with current relationship
- **MUST SUBMIT to verify if exp_069 changes the relationship**

## CRITICAL DECISION: SUBMIT exp_069 NOW
- 5 submissions remaining
- This is a 35% CV improvement - the largest in 69 experiments
- The key question is whether this approach has a different CV-LB relationship
- This submission will provide critical information for the next steps
