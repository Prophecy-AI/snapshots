## Current Status
- Best CV score: 0.005146 from exp_069 (Ens Model approach) - **35.17% improvement!**
- Best LB score: 0.0877 (exp_030)
- Target: 0.0347 | Gap to target: 0.053 (if old CV-LB relationship holds)

## CV-LB Relationship Analysis (CRITICAL)
- Linear fit (13 submissions): LB = 4.23 * CV + 0.0533 (R² = 0.98)
- Intercept (0.0533) > Target (0.0347) - target unreachable with old approaches
- Predicted LB for exp_069 (using old fit): 0.0751
- **CRITICAL HYPOTHESIS**: exp_069 uses a FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT approach that may have a DIFFERENT CV-LB relationship!

## Response to Evaluator
- Technical verdict was TRUSTWORTHY. The implementation is correct and follows the Ens Model kernel closely.
- Evaluator's top priority: SUBMIT THIS MODEL to verify the CV-LB relationship. **FULLY AGREE.**
- Key concerns raised:
  1. Verify numeric feature engineering (T_x_RT, RT_log, T_inv, RT_scaled) - These ARE included in the featurizer
  2. Single solvent performance degradation (0.009175 vs 0.008216) - Acceptable tradeoff for 62% improvement on mixture data
  3. Submission strategy - 5 submissions remaining, this is the highest-leverage use

## Data Understanding
- Reference notebooks: See `exploration/evolver_loop65_analysis.ipynb` for CV-LB analysis
- Key patterns:
  1. CatBoost + XGBoost ensemble dramatically outperforms GP + MLP + LGBM on mixture data
  2. Feature priority-based correlation filtering (69 features vs 140+) reduces noise
  3. Different ensemble weights for single (7:6) vs full (1:2) data are important
  4. Multi-target normalization ensures physically meaningful predictions

## MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH: exp_069 Results
- Single Solvent MSE: 0.009175 (n=656) - slightly worse than previous best
- Full Data MSE: 0.002992 (n=1227) - **62% improvement!**
- Combined MSE: 0.005146 - **35.17% improvement over previous best!**

## Why This Approach May Have a Different CV-LB Relationship
1. **Different model family**: CatBoost + XGBoost (gradient boosting) vs GP + MLP + LGBM
2. **Different feature set**: 69 features after correlation filtering vs 140+ features
3. **Different ensemble strategy**: Weights optimized for single vs full data separately
4. **Multi-target normalization**: Ensures predictions are physically meaningful

## Recommended Approaches (After Submission Feedback)

### If LB improves significantly (LB < 0.07):
1. **Optimize the Ens Model approach further**:
   - Tune CatBoost/XGBoost hyperparameters
   - Try different correlation thresholds (0.7, 0.9)
   - Experiment with different ensemble weights
   - Add more feature engineering (interaction terms, polynomial features)

2. **Ensemble with previous best models**:
   - Blend Ens Model predictions with GP + MLP + LGBM ensemble
   - Use stacking with meta-learner

### If LB follows old relationship (LB ≈ 0.075):
1. **Focus on reducing the intercept**:
   - Extrapolation detection features (solvent similarity to training)
   - Uncertainty-weighted predictions (blend toward mean when extrapolating)
   - Physics-informed constraints

2. **Study other top kernels**:
   - The "mixall" kernel uses GroupKFold (5 splits) instead of Leave-One-Out
   - May have different CV-LB characteristics

### If LB doesn't improve much (LB > 0.08):
1. **Investigate why CV improvement doesn't translate**:
   - Check for differences between kernel and our implementation
   - Verify feature sources are correct
   - Check if bit-table filtering is implemented correctly

## What NOT to Try
- More GP + MLP + LGBM variations (exhausted, all on same CV-LB line)
- Simple hyperparameter tuning without changing the approach
- More ensemble members without diversity

## Validation Notes
- CV scheme: Leave-One-Solvent-Out for single solvent (24 folds), Leave-One-Ramp-Out for full data (87 folds)
- This matches the Ens Model kernel's validation scheme
- The key question is whether this approach has a different CV-LB relationship

## IMMEDIATE ACTION: SUBMIT exp_069
This is the highest-leverage action available:
1. 35% CV improvement - largest in 69 experiments
2. Fundamentally different approach - may change CV-LB relationship
3. 5 submissions remaining - this is worth the investment
4. Even if it follows the old relationship, predicted LB (0.0751) would be the best achieved
