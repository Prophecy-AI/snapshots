## Current Status
- Best CV score: 0.005146 from exp_069 (Ens Model: CatBoost + XGBoost)
- Best LB score: 0.0877 (exp_030)
- Target: 0.0347 | Gap to target: 0.0530 (from best LB)

## CV-LB Relationship Analysis (CRITICAL)
- Linear fit: LB = 4.23 * CV + 0.0533 (R² = 0.98)
- Intercept interpretation: Even at CV=0, expected LB is 0.0533
- **CRITICAL: Intercept (0.0533) > Target (0.0347)**
- Required CV for target: (0.0347 - 0.0533) / 4.23 = -0.0044 (NEGATIVE!)
- This means target is UNREACHABLE with the current CV-LB relationship

**HOWEVER: Exp_069 uses a FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT approach:**
- CatBoost + XGBoost (not GP + MLP + LGBM)
- Feature priority-based correlation filtering (69 features vs 140+)
- Different ensemble weights for single vs full data
- Multi-target normalization

**The CV-LB relationship MAY BE DIFFERENT for this approach!**
- If the intercept is lower, the target becomes reachable
- Predicted LB (using old relationship): 0.0751
- This would still be the best LB (vs 0.0877)

## Response to Evaluator
- Technical verdict was TRUSTWORTHY. The implementation is correct and follows the Ens Model kernel closely.
- Evaluator's top priority: SUBMIT exp_069 to verify the CV-LB relationship. **AGREED - this is the highest-leverage action.**
- Key concerns raised:
  1. Verify numeric feature engineering - ADDRESSED: The featurizer includes T, rt, inv_T, log_rt, T_x_rt
  2. Single solvent performance degradation - NOTED: Single MSE is worse (0.009175 vs 0.008216), but full data is much better (0.002992 vs 0.007789)
  3. Submission strategy - AGREED: Submit to verify CV-LB relationship

## Data Understanding
- Reference notebooks: See `exploration/evolver_loop65_analysis.ipynb` for CV-LB analysis
- Key patterns:
  - The Ens Model approach is MUCH better for mixture data (62% improvement)
  - Feature priority filtering reduced features from 4199 to 69
  - CatBoost with MultiRMSE (multi-output) + XGBoost with separate models per target

## Recommended Approaches

### IMMEDIATE: SUBMIT exp_069
**This is the highest priority action.** We need to verify if the Ens Model approach has a different CV-LB relationship.

Expected outcomes:
1. **Best case**: LB improves significantly (e.g., 0.05-0.06), indicating a different CV-LB relationship
2. **Good case**: LB improves to ~0.075 (following old relationship), still best LB
3. **Worst case**: LB doesn't improve much, indicating the approach doesn't generalize

### After Submission, Based on Results:

**If LB improves significantly (new CV-LB relationship):**
1. **Optimize the Ens Model approach further:**
   - Tune CatBoost hyperparameters (depth, learning_rate, n_estimators)
   - Tune XGBoost hyperparameters
   - Try different ensemble weights
   - Try different correlation filtering thresholds

2. **Combine with other techniques:**
   - Add GP predictions as features
   - Try stacking with MLP
   - Add uncertainty-weighted predictions

**If LB follows the old relationship (~0.075):**
1. **Focus on reducing the intercept:**
   - Extrapolation detection features
   - Uncertainty-weighted predictions
   - Physics-informed constraints

2. **Try other top kernel approaches:**
   - "mixall" kernel: MLP + XGBoost + RF + LightGBM ensemble with Optuna
   - "System Malfunction V1": Different MLP architecture

**If LB doesn't improve:**
1. **Investigate why:**
   - Are there differences between our implementation and the kernel?
   - Is the bit-table filtering different?
   - Are there missing features?

## What NOT to Try
- More GP + MLP + LGBM variations (all fall on the same CV-LB line)
- Simple hyperparameter tuning without changing the approach
- Multi-seed ensembles (proven to not help significantly)

## Validation Notes
- CV scheme: Leave-One-Solvent-Out for single (24 folds), Leave-One-Ramp-Out for full (87 folds)
- Combined MSE: weighted average by sample count
- The Ens Model approach uses the same CV scheme as our previous experiments

## Key Insight
The 35% CV improvement from exp_069 is the largest improvement in 69 experiments. This is a fundamentally different approach that may have a different CV-LB relationship. **SUBMIT to verify.**

## Submissions Remaining: 5
Use wisely. Each submission should test a hypothesis about the CV-LB relationship.
