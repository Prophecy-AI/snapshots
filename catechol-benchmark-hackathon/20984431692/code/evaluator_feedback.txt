## What I Understood
You implemented a Deep Sets MLP architecture to predict reaction yields, treating the problem as a set-based learning task to handle solvent mixtures effectively. You merged the full and single-solvent datasets, used Spange and PCA descriptors, and validated using a Leave-One-Ramp-Out scheme to test generalization to new mixtures.

## Technical Execution Assessment
[CONCERNS]

**Submission Compliance (CRITICAL)**: 
- **Issue**: The competition requires the submission to follow a strict template (specifically the last three cells). Your notebook replaces these with a custom CV loop.
- **Risk**: Your submission will likely fail in the evaluation environment because it doesn't expose the `model` variable in the expected way or read the hidden test set.
- **Fix**: You MUST restore the template's structure. Your notebook should define the `MLPModel` class and then end with the mandatory cells where `model = MLPModel()` is instantiated.

**API Mismatch**:
- **Issue**: Your `MLPModel.fit` and `MLPModel.predict` methods require `solvent_features` as an argument. The template's evaluation harness likely calls `model.fit(X, Y)` and `model.predict(X)` without extra arguments.
- **Risk**: The evaluation code will crash with a `TypeError`.
- **Fix**: Load the solvent features (lookup tables) *inside* the `MLPModel` class (e.g., in `__init__` or `fit`) so the method signatures match the standard sklearn-like interface expected by the template.

**Score Integrity**:
- **Observation**: You report a CV MSE of 0.009 and MAE of 0.064. The target is 0.047.
- **Concern**: If the target (0.047) is **MAE**, you are currently *behind* (0.064 > 0.047). If the target is MSE, you are significantly ahead. Given the typical magnitude of errors in this domain, 0.047 is likely MAE.
- **Action**: Verify the competition metric. If it's MAE, you need to improve performance further.

## Strategic Assessment
[TRUSTWORTHY STRATEGY, NEEDS REFINEMENT]

**Approach Fit**: 
Deep Sets is an excellent choice for this problem. It naturally handles the permutation invariance of mixtures (Solvent A + Solvent B is the same as B + A) and allows learning a shared solvent representation.

**Validation**: 
Leave-One-Ramp-Out is a good strategy for testing generalization to *new mixtures of known solvents*.
- **Blind Spot**: Does the test set contain *completely new solvents*? If so, your current CV might be optimistic. Consider checking "Leave-One-Solvent-Out" performance to see how the model handles unseen molecules.

## What's Working
- **Architecture**: The Deep Sets design (Encoder -> Aggregation -> Predictor) is theoretically sound and well-implemented.
- **Data Handling**: Merging single and full datasets correctly increases your training volume.
- **Preprocessing**: Fitting scalers only on training splits prevents leakage.

## Key Concerns
- **Observation**: `MLPModel` relies on external `solvent_features` passed to `fit`/`predict`.
- **Why it matters**: This breaks the template's automated evaluation.
- **Suggestion**: Refactor `MLPModel` to be self-contained.

- **Observation**: Target metric ambiguity.
- **Why it matters**: You might be optimizing MSE when the leaderboard is MAE.
- **Suggestion**: Check the competition rules. If MAE is the metric, consider using L1 loss (MAE) or Huber loss instead of MSE during training.

## Top Priority for Next Experiment
**Fix the Submission Structure and Model Interface.**
1.  Refactor `MLPModel` so `fit(X, Y)` and `predict(X)` load the lookup tables internally and don't require extra arguments.
2.  **Restore the mandatory last 3 cells** from the template.
3.  (Optional) Switch loss function to L1 (MAE) if you confirm the target metric is MAE.

Do this before tuning hyperparameters. We need a valid submission pipeline first.
