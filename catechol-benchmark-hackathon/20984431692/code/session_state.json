      "strategy": "# Catechol Benchmark Seed Prompt\n\n## 1. Problem Understanding\n**Goal:** Predict reaction yields (SM, Product 2, Product 3) for allyl substituted catechol rearrangement in various solvent mixtures.\n**Challenge:** Generalization to **unseen solvent mixtures**. The test set contains solvent pairs not seen during training.\n**Metric:** Cross-Validation Score (likely MSE or MAE on yields).\n**Constraint:** Must use `MLPModel` class structure.\n\n## 2. Data Strategy\n**Reference Notebooks:**\n- `exploration/eda.ipynb`: Data inspection, target correlations, solvent overlap.\n\n**Key Data Insights:**\n- **Small Dataset:** ~1200 rows (full) + ~650 rows (single). High risk of overfitting.\n- **Mixture Data:** Solvents A and B with %B.\n- **Single Data:** Can be treated as mixture where Solvent A = Solvent B (or %B = 0).\n- **Targets:** 3 continuous targets (SM, P2, P3). Sum is approx 1 but not exact.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n- **Merge Datasets:** Combine `catechol_full_data_yields.csv` and `catechol_single_solvent_yields.csv`.\n- **Unified Format:** Convert single data to mixture format:\n  - `SOLVENT A NAME` = `SOLVENT NAME`\n  - `SOLVENT B NAME` = `SOLVENT NAME`\n  - `SolventB%` = 0.0\n\n## 3. Feature Engineering\n**Solvent Descriptors (Crucial):**\nUse the provided look-up tables to represent solvents numerically.\n- **Physical Properties:** `spange_descriptors_lookup.csv` (13 features).\n- **PCA Descriptors:** `acs_pca_descriptors_lookup.csv` (5 features).\n- **Fingerprints:** `drfps_catechol_lookup.csv` (2048 features) - *Use with caution due to dimensionality.*\n\n**Mixture Representation:**\nFor a mixture of Solvent A and Solvent B with ratio $x_B$:\n1. **Linear Combination (FDA):** $Feature_{mix} = (1 - x_B) \\cdot Feature_A + x_B \\cdot Feature_B$\n   - Works well for physical properties (e.g., dielectric constant).\n2. **Interaction Terms:**\n   - $|Feature_A - Feature_B|$ (Difference)\n   - $Feature_A \\cdot Feature_B$ (Product)\n   - These capture non-linear mixing effects.\n\n**Process Conditions:**\n- **Normalize:** Standardize `Temperature` and `Residence Time` (Z-score).\n\n## 4. Model Architecture (MLPModel)\nSince the template requires an `MLPModel` class, design a robust neural network.\n**Recommended Architecture: \"Deep Sets\" for Mixtures**\nInstead of just averaging inputs, learn the representation:\n1. **Solvent Encoder (Shared):** A small MLP (e.g., 64->32) that takes raw solvent descriptors (A or B) and outputs a latent vector $h$.\n2. **Weighted Aggregation:** $h_{mix} = (1 - x_B) \\cdot h_A + x_B \\cdot h_B$.\n3. **Condition Fusion:** Concatenate $h_{mix}$ with normalized Temperature and Time.\n4. **Predictor:** Final MLP (e.g., 32->16->3) to predict yields.\n\n**Why this works:** It allows the model to learn *non-linear* solvent features before mixing, which is more expressive than averaging raw features.\n\n**Regularization:**\n- **Dropout:** 0.2-0.5 in hidden layers.\n- **Weight Decay:** 1e-4 to 1e-3.\n- **Batch Normalization:** Helpful for convergence.\n\n## 5. Validation Strategy\n- **Leave-One-Group-Out:** Use `generate_leave_one_ramp_out_splits` from `utils.py`.\n- **Metric:** Monitor MSE/MAE on the left-out ramps.\n- **Ensembling:** Train 5-10 models with different random seeds and average predictions.\n\n## 6. Advanced Techniques\n- **Transfer Learning:** Pre-train on single solvent data, fine-tune on mixtures (if treated separately).\n- **Dimensionality Reduction:** If using fingerprints (DRFP), use PCA to reduce to ~20-50 components before feeding to MLP.\n- **Physics-Informed Constraints:** Add a loss term to penalize deviations from mass balance (SM + P2 + P3 \u2248 1).\n- **Hybrid Features:** Combine PCA descriptors (global properties) with Spange descriptors (physical properties).\n",
