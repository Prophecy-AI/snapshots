      "text": "Feature engineering for solvent\u2011mixture models is the process of turning the chemical identities of the components and their composition into numerical representations that a machine\u2011learning (ML) algorithm can ingest.  Because a mixture is not simply a list of isolated molecules, descriptors must capture both **individual\u2011molecule properties** (e.g., atom\u2011type counts, topological fingerprints, polarity, hydrogen\u2011bond donors/acceptors) and **mixture\u2011level information** such as mole fractions, interaction potentials, and aggregated structural features.  Recent benchmarks such as CheMixHub explicitly provide 11 mixture\u2011property tasks and evaluate how different descriptor strategies affect generalisation across formulation domains\u202f([arxiv](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.12231v1)).  In the \u201cCatechol\u201d benchmark, the authors demonstrate that careful feature engineering\u2014combining continuous process variables with molecular descriptors\u2014significantly improves few\u2011shot solvent\u2011selection models\u202f([arxiv](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1)).\n\nThree families of mixture descriptors have emerged in the literature.  **Formulation Descriptor Aggregation (FDA)** simply pools single\u2011molecule descriptors (e.g., Morgan fingerprints, physicochemical constants) weighted by composition, providing a fast baseline\u202f([nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-025-01552-2)).  **Formulation Graph (FG)** treats each component as a node in a graph and adds edges that encode pairwise interaction terms (e.g., Lennard\u2011Jones parameters, solvation energies), enabling graph\u2011neural\u2011network (GNN) models to learn explicit intermolecular messages\u202f([rsc](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2023/dd/d2dd00045h)).  The most expressive approach reported so far is the **Set2Set\u2011based formulation (FDS2S)**, which learns a permutation\u2011invariant representation of the set of components and their interactions, outperforming FDA and FG on high\u2011throughput molecular\u2011dynamics datasets\u202f([nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-025-01552-2)).  Hybrid methods that blend handcrafted descriptors with representation\u2011learning (e.g., combining QSPR fingerprints with latent embeddings) have also shown promise for predicting physico\u2011chemical properties of mixtures\u202f([rsc](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2025/dd/d4dd00154k)).\n\nThese descriptor strategies have been applied to real\u2011world problems such as drug\u2011solubility prediction in binary solvent systems, where gradient\u2011boosted trees trained on aggregated molecular features achieved mean absolute errors of \u22480.33\u202flog\u202fS on a 27\u202fk\u2011point dataset of solvent mixtures\u202f([d\u2011nb](https://d-nb.info/1353665232/34)).  Similarly, high\u2011throughput experiments on solvent\u2011selection for flow chemistry have leveraged the same engineered features to guide active\u2011learning loops and accelerate sustainable solvent replacement\u202f([arxiv](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1)).  Together, these works illustrate that effective feature engineering\u2014balancing simple physicochemical descriptors, composition weighting, and graph\u2011based interaction modeling\u2014is central to building accurate, transferable ML models for solvent mixtures.",

While being a vital part of the industry pipeline, the chemical mixture space remains relatively unexplored by the Machine Learning community. In this paper, we introduce CheMixHub, a holistic benchmark for molecular mixtures, covering a corpus of 11 chemical mixtures property prediction tasks, from drug delivery formulations to battery electrolytes, totalling approximately 500k data points gathered and curated from 7 publicly available datasets. CheMixHub introduces various data splitting techniques to assess context-specific generalization and model robustness, providing a foundation for the development of predictive models for chemical mixture properties. Furthermore, we map out the modelling space of deep learning models for chemical mixtures, establishing initial benchmarks for the community. This dataset has the potential to accelerate chemical mixture development, encompassing reformulation, optimization, and discovery.

However, chemical datasets are often inaccessible to the machine learning community as they tend to require cleaning, thorough understanding of the chemistry, or are simply not available. In this paper, we introduce a novel dataset for yield prediction, providing the first-ever transient flow dataset for machine learning benchmarking, covering over 1200 process conditions. While previous datasets focus on discrete parameters, our experimental set-up allow us to sample a large number of continuous process conditions, generating new challenges for machine learning models. We focus on solvent selection, a task that is particularly difficult to model theoretically and therefore ripe for machine learning applications. We showcase benchmarking for regression algorithms, transfer-learning approaches, feature engineering, and active learning, with important applications towards solvent replacement and sustainable manufacturing.\n## 1Introduction\nMachine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) have showcased enormous potential in empowering the world of the natural sciences: from famous examples such as AlphaFold for protein predictions> [\n[> 1\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib1)> ]\n, to fusion reactor control> [\n[> 2\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib2)> ]\n, disease detection> [\n[> 3\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib3)> ]\n, battery design> [\n[> 4\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib4)> ]\n, and material discovery> [\n[> 5\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib5)> ]\n, among many more. However, we seldom see the machine learning community benchmark new methods in physical science datasets, mostly due to the difficulty in cleaning real-world data, the need for interdisciplinary understanding to correctly benchmark, and most importantly, how expensive the data can be to produce, resulting in many datasets being locked behind closed doors by large companies.\nAIchemy ([https://aichemy.ac.uk](https://aichemy.ac.uk)) is an interdisciplinary UK hub with the mission of transforming the chemistry-AI interface via aiding the collaboration of chemists and AI researchers, as well as addressing gaps in data standards, curation, and availability for AI use. In partnership with SOLVE Chemistry ([https://www.solvechemistry.com](https://www.solvechemistry.com)), we present a first important step into addressing the dataset gap with the introduction of a new and unique open dataset for benchmarking low-data machine learning algorithms for chemistry.\nSolvent selection is one of the biggest challenges for chemical manufacturing, with solvents often being the main source of waste in the manufacturing process> [\n[> 6\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib6)> ]\n. Increased regulation on solvents and a drive to making process manufacturing more sustainable led to an interest in the discovery of greener solvents and for improved solvent replacement tools. However, most of the solvent replacement tools focus purely on learning unsupervised representations of solvents, with the hope that experimentalists can find solvents with similar properties to replace those with environmental concerns. A much stronger approach would consider the interaction of a variety of different solvents with a reaction of interest to directly predict reaction yields, in such a way that the best possible solvent can be selected according to a yield-sustainability trade-off.\nMachine learning approaches have been shown to be a powerful tool for the prediction of chemical reaction conditions. Success has been reported in retro-synthesis> [\n[> 7\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib7)> , [> 8\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib8)> ]\n, condition recommendations> [\n[> 9\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib9)> ]\n, product predictions> [\n[> 10\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib10)> , [> 11\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib11)> ]\n, among others. While yield prediction has proven to be more difficult due to large inconsistencies in procedure and data reporting> [\n[> 12\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib12)> ]\n, we have still seen promising yield prediction results for smaller and more carefully curated datasets> [\n[> 13\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib13)> , [> 14\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib14)> , [> 15\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib15)> , [> 16\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib16)> ]\n. However, these datasets lack the continuous reaction conditions, such as temperature and residence time, that are required to scale-up processes to practical manufacturing conditions.\nIn this paper, we release the first machine-learning-ready transient flow dataset, a framework that allows for quick and efficient screening of continuous reaction conditions. We specifically provide yield data over the uni-molecular allyl substituted catechol reaction, shown in Figure[1](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#S1.F1), with dense measurements across the residence time, temperature, and solvent space. We further showcase how this type ofkinetic dataposes new challenges to current machine learning methods for chemistry, and identify how the challenges can potentially be tackled by the community.\n![Refer to caption](extracted/6524982/figures/Project2_rxn.png)Figure 1:Data was gathered on the rearrangement of allyl substituted catechol. By subjecting the reaction mixture to high temperatures, we begin a cascade reaction forming multiple rearrangement products. We investigate the yield of the reaction for a range of different solvents. Product 1 was not observed and reacted immediately to form Product 2 and later 3.\n### 1.1Related works\nReaction datasets are common in chemistry research, but their suitability for machine learning benchmarking tends to be poor. This can be a result of improper formatting or documentation, incomplete information about reaction conditions or the experimental set-up, or the lack of machine readability, leading to limited usage by the ML community. However, some effort has been made to address this, with the biggest example being the creation of the Open Reaction Database (ORD)> [\n[> 17\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib17)> ]\n, a repository containing over 2M different reactions, many of which come from US patent data (USPTO)> [\n[> 18\n](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.07619v1#bib.bib18)> ]\n.

Computational approaches offer a promising solution to traverse this space while minimizing trial-and-error experimentation. Using high-throughput classical molecular dynamics simulations, we generated a comprehensive dataset of over 30,000 solvent mixtures to evaluate three machine learning approaches that connect molecular structure and composition to property: formulation descriptor aggregation (FDA), formulation graph (FG), and Set2Set-based method (FDS2S). Our results demonstrate that our new FDS2S approach outperforms other approaches in predicting simulation-derived properties. Formulation-property relationships can reveal important substructures and identify promising formulations at least two to three times faster than random guessing. The models show robust transferability to experimental datasets, accurately predicting properties across energy, pharmaceutical, and petroleum applications. Our research demonstrates the utility of high-throughput simulations and machine learning tools to design formulations with promising properties.\n\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n\n### [Exploring structure-property relationships in magnesium dissolution modulators](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41529-020-00148-z?fromPaywallRec=false)\n\nArticleOpen access08 January 2021\n\n### [Human- and machine-centred designs of molecules and materials for sustainability and decarbonization](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41578-022-00466-5?fromPaywallRec=false)\n\nArticle24 August 2022\n\n### [Approaching coupled-cluster accuracy for molecular electronic structures with multi-task learning](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43588-024-00747-9?fromPaywallRec=false)\n\nArticle27 December 2024\n\n## Introduction\n\nFormulations consisting of a mixture of chemical ingredients are crucial to a wide range of material science applications. These mixtures have multiple chemical ingredients with well-defined compositional information, but their formulation properties are challenging to predict a priori because they emerge from non-obvious intermolecular interactions arising between multiple ingredients that heavily depend on both molecular structure and composition. Hence, tuning the chemistry and composition for a desired formulation property is often performed with trial-and-error experiments, which is challenging given the large design space of possible chemical structures and compositions.\n\nAs an alternative to experiments, simulating all possible interactions between molecules with classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations is a promising approach to compute properties of multicomponent systems. For example, MD simulations have been used to study the impact of copolymer blends on polymer properties[1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-025-01552-2#ref-CR1), cosolvents on reactivity[2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-025-01552-2#ref-CR2), [3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-025-01552-2#ref-CR3), and surfactants on cosmetic properties[4](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-025-01552-2#ref-CR4). MD simulations have achieved success in not only accurately capturing experimental trends[5](https://www.nature.com/www.nature.com#ref-CR5), [6](https://www.nature.com/www.nature.com#ref-CR6), [7](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-025-01552-2#ref-CR7), but they have also provided physical insight into the underlying mechanisms that lead to the bulk properties of multicomponent systems, such as phase separation or solvation behavior[2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-025-01552-2#ref-CR2). Despite significant advances in MD, the utility of MD to simulate formulation systems is limited by the number of atoms in the system, whereby large multicomponent systems with more than ~10 different components may be computationally expensive to simulate but highly prevalent in materials applications like paints, perfumes or fuel[8](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-025-01552-2#ref-CR8).\n\nRecent developments in data-driven machine learning modeling that could map chemical structure to bulk properties have shown great promise to speed up chemical discovery, namely quantitative structure-property relationships (QSPR)[9](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-025-01552-2#ref-CR9). QSPR modeling has primarily been focused on single molecule structure-property predictions, where expert-defined cheminformatics descriptors or graph representations are used to train machine learning models[10](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-025-01552-2#ref-CR10). QSPR approaches for single molecules have shown great success in the last decade, especially in the small-molecule drug discovery field[9](https://www.nature.com/www.nature.com#ref-CR9), [10](https://www.nature.com/www.nature.com#ref-CR10), [11](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-025-01552-2#ref-CR11). However, developing accurate QSPR models for formulation systems has not been well-explored. Recent literature have shown some success on applying machine learning to multicomponent systems, namely the use of various machine learning methods to predict thermodynamic properties[12](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-025-01552-2#ref-CR12), variational autoencoders to predict compositions of ingredients[13](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-025-01552-2#ref-CR13), and graph neural networks to predict a variety of formulation properties, such as viscosities of binary mixtures[14](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-025-01552-2#ref-CR14), battery performance[15](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-025-01552-2#ref-CR15), [16](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-025-01552-2#ref-CR16), or optical properties of dyes[17](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-025-01552-2#ref-CR17), [18](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-025-01552-2#ref-CR18). However, the development of QSPR models for formulation systems ( _i.e_. formulation-property relationships) has been largely hindered by the lack of publicly available, consistent datasets to evaluate these systems, which makes rigorous benchmarking of formulation-property relationships difficult. Given a sufficiently large formulation dataset, we can begin to tune accurate machine learning models that can handle chemical information aggregated from multiple ingredients and varying compositions.\n\nIn this work, we explore QSPR methods for formulation systems to identify the best formulation-property relationships that can accurately predict formulation properties. We generate a representative formulation dataset consisting of ~30,000 miscible solvent mixtures computed by MD simulations, where ensemble-averaged properties from MD correlate well with experiments. While simulation-derived properties differ from real-world conditions, MD is useful to generate a comprehensive dataset using a consistent simulation protocol, which can then be used to benchmark formulation-property models without concern of error arising from different experimental conditions that is often observed in literature-curated experimental datasets. We focus on the capabilities of formulation-property models in predicting three relevant formulation properties, namely packing density, heat of vaporization ( _\u0394_ _H_ _v_ _a_ _p_), and enthalpy of mixing ( _\u0394_ _H_ _m_). We then apply feature importance analysis tools to identify the top features relevant to formulation-property relationships for each of th...",

However, when treating multi-component systems, GNNs have mostly used simple data representations (concatenation, averaging, or self-attention on features of individual components) that might fail to capture molecular interactions and potentially limit prediction accuracy. In this work, we propose a GNN architecture that captures molecular interactions in an explicit manner by combining atomic-level (local) graph convolution and molecular-level (global) message passing through a molecular interaction network. We tested the architecture (which we call SolvGNN) on a comprehensive phase equilibrium case study that aims to predict activity coefficients for a wide range of binary and ternary mixtures; we built this large dataset using the COnductor-like Screening MOdel for Real Solvation (COSMO-RS). We show that SolvGNN can predict composition-dependent activity coefficients with high accuracy and show that it outperforms a previously-developed GNN used for predicting only infinite-dilution activity coefficients. We performed counterfactual analysis on the SolvGNN model that allowed us to explore the impact of functional groups and composition on equilibrium behavior. We also used the SolvGNN model for the development of a computational framework that automatically creates phase diagrams for a diverse set of complex mixtures. All scripts needed to reproduce the results are shared as open-source code.\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nPredicting the physicochemical properties of molecules is crucial for applications such as product and process design. In the past decade, machine learning (ML) techniques have been used as data-driven approaches that help accelerate molecule screening and to reduce experimentation cost, especially when a large chemical space is involved. These models have also shown to be versatile and to predict diverse molecular properties such as water solubility, [1\u20133](https://pubs.rsc.org/pubs.rsc.org#cit1) toxicity, [4\u20136](https://pubs.rsc.org/pubs.rsc.org#cit4) and lipophilicity. [7,8](https://pubs.rsc.org/pubs.rsc.org#cit7) A fundamental step in the use of ML models is the pre-definition or pre-calculation of molecular descriptors; [9\u201312](https://pubs.rsc.org/pubs.rsc.org#cit9) such descriptors are used as input data to develop quantitative structure\u2013property relationship models. [13](https://pubs.rsc.org/pubs.rsc.org#cit13) Recently, there has been growing interest in applying ML models to study more complex chemical systems that might contain multiple components such as chemical reactions, [14,15](https://pubs.rsc.org/pubs.rsc.org#cit14) alloys, [16,17](https://pubs.rsc.org/pubs.rsc.org#cit16) copolymers, [18\u201320](https://pubs.rsc.org/pubs.rsc.org#cit18) and gas/liquid mixtures. [21\u201333](https://pubs.rsc.org/pubs.rsc.org#cit21) Among the ML techniques explored, graph neural networks (GNNs) [34,35](https://pubs.rsc.org/pubs.rsc.org#cit34) have gained special popularity because they can directly incorporate molecular representations (in the form of graphs), which enable the capturing of key structural information while potentially avoiding the need to pre-calculate/pre-define descriptors using more advanced but computationally-intensive tools such density functional theory (DFT) or molecular dynamics (MD) models.\n\nIn a typical GNN architecture for prediction of molecular properties, [36](https://pubs.rsc.org/pubs.rsc.org#cit36) the characteristics of the atoms and of the bonds are propagated based on the chemical structure of a single input molecule, followed by featuring embedding via nonlinear transformation. The embedded features are then fed to fully-connected layers to construct predictive models. GNNs have achieved better performance than conventional descriptor-based approaches in various benchmark datasets. [37,38](https://pubs.rsc.org/pubs.rsc.org#cit37) When dealing with multiple components, several approaches have been devised; a typical way to encode multi-molecule information is to simply average or concatenate the features of individual molecules and to use these as system-level features for property inference with fully connected or attentive layers. [14,15,19](https://pubs.rsc.org/pubs.rsc.org#cit14) Previous studies have also incorporated weighted sums or concatenation to take into account composition information when needed. [19](https://pubs.rsc.org/pubs.rsc.org#cit19) However, these approaches do not capture molecular interactions in an explicit manner, which may limit the predictive power of GNNs for systems in which intermolecular interactions play an important role.\n\nIn this work, we present a GNN architecture that explicitly incorporates molecular interactions via the combination of atomic-level (local) graph convolution and molecular-level (global) message passing for property prediction of multi-component chemical systems. To connect local features with global features, we construct a molecular interaction network as an intermediate step. The molecular interaction network is a complete graph in which each node represents a molecule and each edge represents a hypothetical intermolecular interaction (e.g., hydrogen bonding). This representation serves as a physics-informed topological prior that aids feature extraction from multi-component systems. The composition information is also encoded in the architecture as additional node feature for the molecular interaction network. We hypothesize that, with this type of data representation and feature propagation guided by physical intuition, the proposed architecture may better model mixture properties while taking composition information into consideration.\n\nWe evaluate the proposed GNN architecture through a comprehensive case study on miscibility calculations for multi-component systems. We choose activity coefficients as the target thermodynamic property of interest, which measures the deviation of a liquid mixture from ideal solution behavior. Activity coefficients are one of the fundamental properties of a mixture and therefore can lead to the derivation of equilibrium conditions (e.g., phase diagrams), which are important in physical chemistry and engineering for understanding and optimizing chemical separations. [39](https://pubs.rsc.org/pubs.rsc.org#cit39) Previous studies have developed ML-based methods to predict infinite-dilution activity coefficients for binary mixtures, including matrix completion on the activity coefficient matrix [28,40](https://pubs.rsc.org/pubs.rsc.org#cit28) and multilayer perceptrons on the sy...",

Established prediction methods range from fully physics-based ab initio calculations, which are only feasible for very simple systems, over descriptor-based methods that use some information on the molecules to be modeled together with fitted model parameters (e.g., quantitative-structure\u2013property relationship methods or classical group contribution methods), to representation-learning methods, which may, in extreme cases, completely ignore molecular descriptors and extrapolate only from existing data on the property to be modeled (e.g., matrix completion methods). In this work, we propose a general method for combining molecular descriptors with representation learning using the so-called expectation maximization algorithm from the probabilistic machine-learning literature, which uses uncertainty estimates to trade off between the two approaches. The proposed hybrid model exploits chemical structure information using graph neural networks, but it automatically detects cases where structure-based predictions are unreliable, in which case it corrects them by representation-learning based predictions that can better specialize to unusual cases. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated using the prediction of activity coefficients in binary mixtures as an example. The results are compelling, as the method significantly improves predictive accuracy over the current state of the art, showcasing its potential to advance the prediction of physico-chemical properties in general.\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nInformation on physico-chemical properties is crucial for the conceptual design and optimization of processes in many industries, including chemistry, pharmacy, and biotechnology. Among the most important thermodynamic properties are the activity coefficients of the components in a mixture, which describe the deviation of a mixture from the ideal mixture and enable the accurate prediction of reaction and phase equilibria of mixtures. Activity coefficients at infinite dilution are more sensitive thermodynamic properties than activity coefficients at finite concentration (and the subsequently calculated reaction and phase equilibria) and knowing the activity coefficients at infinite dilution allows to predict the activity coefficients in binary mixtures of any finite concentration as well as the activity coefficients in multi-component mixtures. Unfortunately, measuring activity coefficients, as measuring thermodynamic properties of mixtures in general, is costly and time-consuming, and the number of relevant mixtures exceeds the ones that can be studied experimentally by orders of magnitude. [1](https://pubs.rsc.org/pubs.rsc.org#cit1) Consequently, prediction methods for thermodynamic properties of mixtures are paramount. Recently, research on such prediction methods has split into two branches.\n\nOn the one hand, descriptor-based methods correlate information on the molecules to be modeled with properties of interest. Among these, group-contribution methods, which use the composition of the components in terms of structural groups as molecular descriptors and whose underlying equations are usually derived from physical theories, have succeeded and are still the gold standard for property prediction in many (industrial) fields. [2,3](https://pubs.rsc.org/pubs.rsc.org#cit2) The most successful group-contribution method for predicting activity coefficients is UNIFAC, [4\u20136](https://pubs.rsc.org/pubs.rsc.org#cit4) which is available in different versions and established in most process simulation software. Besides the physics-based group-contribution methods, also other descriptor-based methods that rely on various descriptors, such as molecular weight, surface area, or boiling point, have been proposed for predicting activity coefficients. [7\u201314](https://pubs.rsc.org/pubs.rsc.org#cit7)\n\nIn statistics parlance, such descriptor-based models are called parametric models as they fit model parameters that affect several related components (e.g., those containing a given structural group). Thus, parametric models can leverage statistical strength across chemically similar components.\n\nOn the other hand, recent idea transfer from the machine-learning community has led to an alternative approach to predicting activity coefficients and other mixture properties, which is based solely on learned representations without relying on descriptors. So-called matrix completion methods (MCMs) [15\u201319](https://pubs.rsc.org/pubs.rsc.org#cit15) ignore the chemical structure of components and fit individual representation vectors for each mixture component that appears in a set of available experimental data. While this approach makes MCMs more flexible than descriptor-based methods, it prevents them from exploiting structural similarities across components, and from extrapolating to new components. In statistics parlance, one says that MCMs are \u201cnonparametric in the components\u201d (note that nonparametric models tend to have many parameters, similar to how a \u201cstepless\u201d controller has infinitely many steps).\n\nIt was shown empirically [15,16,20](https://pubs.rsc.org/pubs.rsc.org#cit15) that purely nonparametric MCMs make more accurate predictions for activity coefficients compared to the descriptor-based (parametric) state-of-the-art UNIFAC. However, since each fitted parameter (i.e., each representation vector) in an MCM only describes a single component, MCMs can only make predictions for mixtures where each component appears in some (other) mixtures in the available experimental data (\u201cin-domain predictions\u201d). By contrast, descriptor-based methods can exploit the structural similarity of components to extrapolate to components that appear in no mixture in the available experimental data (\u201cout-of-domain predictions\u201d).\n\nIn this work, we propose a new method for predicting activity coefficients in binary mixtures that combines the strengths of both the parametric (descriptor-based) and the nonparametric (representation-based) approach while avoiding their respective weaknesses. To do this, we phrase both a parametric and a nonparametric model in a probabilistic framework, and we fit them jointly using the so-called variational expectation maximization (variational EM) algorithm. This algorithm finds an optimal compromise between the parametric and the nonparametric part of a model, taking into account how confident each part is in its fitted or predicted parameters, as discussed in the next section. Our evaluation shows that weighing off the respective confidences of the parametric and nonparametric models indeed improves the accuracy of both in-domain and out-of-domain predictions.\n\nW...",

Journal of Cheminformatics (2024) 16:117 Page 2 of 17\nIntroduction\nIn pharmaceutical development, the solubility of drugs is \na critical factor that infuences various stages, including \ndrug discovery [1\u20133], drug analysis [2, 4, 5], and \nformulation design [6\u20138]. Drug solubility measurements \nprimarily include thermodynamic and kinetic methods \n[9, 10]. Termodynamic methods assess the solute \nconcentration in a solution at equilibrium between \ndissolved and undissolved compounds, while kinetic \nmethods identify the solute concentration at which \nprecipitation frst occurs [11]. Although both methods \nare efective and eforts have been made to enhance \ntheir throughput [1, 4, 12], they remain tedious and can \npose challenges for costly drugs or when the available \nquantity of drug is limited. To address these challenges, \nresearchers have begun to explore machine learning \n(ML) as an alternative method [13, 14]. As a data\u0002driven approach, ML models can be trained on available \nsolubility datasets to learn solute\u2013solvent interactions \nfor prediction of unmeasured solubility. To date, most \nof these ML models were developed to model the solute \nsolubility in a specifc solvent [15\u201325], with a primary \nfocus on aqueous solubility due to availability of data\u00a0for \nmodel development. Compared to models designed \nfor predicting solubility across multiple solvents, these \nsolvent-specifc models generally deliver improved \naccuracy because their design does not require them \nto account for variations between diferent solvents. \nHowever, for the same reason, the applications of these \nsolvent-specifc models are limited to the specifc \nsolvents for which they were developed. To extend the \napplicability of these models, researchers have started to \ninclude a range of solvents into their datasets, allowing \nML models to learn and adapt to diferent solvents [26\u2013\n28]. A notable example is the work of Vassileiou et\u00a0 al., \nwho compiled a dataset primarily from the literature, \nsupplemented with in-house and industrial partner data \n[26]. Tis dataset includes 714 solubility data points \nmeasured at room temperature, covering 75 solutes and \n49 solvents [26]. Using this dataset, ML models were \ntrained to predict solubility across solvents, with the \nresulting model mean absolute error (MAE) ranging \nfrom 0.39 to 0.58 (LogS, S in g/100\u00a0 g) [26]. Another \nsignifcant contribution is from Ye et\u00a0al., who collected a \nlarger dataset of 5081 data points from the literature [27]. \nTis dataset includes the solubility of 266 compounds in \n123 solvents measured at various temperatures, and the \noptimal model resulted in predictions for solubility with \nan MAE of 0.47 (LogS, S in mol/L) [27].\nDespite these signifcant advancements in predicting \nsolubility within single solvents, the complicated \nnature of pharmaceutical research often necessitates \nan understanding of drug solubility in solvent mixtures \n[29\u201332]. Tese mixtures allow greater fexibility through \nadjusting solvent combinations and ratios, enabling \nsolubility to be tailored to meet specifc needs and to \nco-dissolve other necessary materials (e.g., excipients \n[33, 34]). However, the wide variety of possible solvent \ncombinations/ratios and the infuence of temperature \nsignifcantly complicate the experimental measurements. \nTis complexity further extends beyond experimental \nmethods to ML approaches, which require extensive \ndatasets covering a broad spectrum of these conditions \nfor efective model training. Te need for such an \nextensive dataset potentially contributes to the scarcity \nof research on modeling solubility in solvent mixtures \nwith ML approaches. One of the very few examples in \nthis feld is work by Chinta et\u00a0 al. [35], who trained ML \nmodels to predict solubility in binary solvent mixtures. \nIn that study, models were trained and evaluated using a \nrelatively\u00a0small dataset, containing around 600 solubility \nresults for 27 solutes predominantly measured at a single \nGraphical Abstract\nBao\u00a0et\u00a0al.

However, predicting solubility values in any solvent except water from a molecular structure still remains a challenging task in modern cheminformatics, not least due to the lack of large and diverse datasets. In this study, we present a dataset containing 103944 experimental solubility values within a temperature range from 243 to 425 K for 1448 organic compounds measured in 213 individual solvents extracted from 1595 peer-reviewed articles. The molecular structures of solutes and solvents as well as solubility data are standardized and provided in a machine-readable format, allowing straightforward data-driven analysis. We have also developed a web-tool for interactive visualization and search within the dataset. This dataset can serve as a comprehensive benchmark for developing machine learning for predicting solubility.\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n![](https://media.springernature.com/w215h120/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-025-62717-7/MediaObjects/41467_2025_62717_Fig1_HTML.png)\n### [Data-driven organic solubility prediction at the limit of aleatoric uncertainty](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-62717-7?fromPaywallRec=false)\nArticleOpen access19 August 2025\n![](https://media.springernature.com/w215h120/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41597-024-03105-6/MediaObjects/41597_2024_3105_Fig1_HTML.png)\n### [Will we ever be able to accurately predict solubility?](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-024-03105-6?fromPaywallRec=false)\nArticleOpen access18 March 2024\n![](https://media.springernature.com/w215h120/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41467-024-47070-5/MediaObjects/41467_2024_47070_Fig1_HTML.png)\n### [An integrated high-throughput robotic platform and active learning approach for accelerated discovery of optimal electrolyte formulations](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-47070-5?fromPaywallRec=false)\nArticleOpen access29 March 2024\n## Background &amp; Summary\nSolubility is an extremely important parameter, which determines the applicability of a certain compound in synthetic, medicinal, environmental chemistry, geochemistry and many other chemistry-related research and industry. In particular, organic solvents for synthesis are often chosen considering the solubility of initial reagents to boost the reaction itself or ensure low solubility of the desired product facilitating its isolation[1](#ref-CR1),[2](#ref-CR2),[3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-05559-8#ref-CR3). Moreover, the aqueous solubility is crucial for design of pharmaceutics, as it significantly limits bioavailability of drugs[4](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-05559-8#ref-CR4). Solubility is also critical for the development of effective extraction and crystallization methods[5](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-05559-8#ref-CR5),[6](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-05559-8#ref-CR6). Given the need to perform screening of large libraries of compounds, experimentally measuring the solubility of each compound seems to be an incredibly tedious process sometimes even proves infeasible. Thus, there is a clear need for a tool for the direct assessment of molecular solubility from chemical structures of a solute-solvent pair.\nThe prediction of solubility still represents a significant challenge in modern quantum chemistry and cheminformatics, and dozens of various methods have been developed to fill this gap. The computational approaches usually include the use of molecular dynamics[7](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-05559-8#ref-CR7),[8](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-05559-8#ref-CR8)and/or ab initio calculations[9](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-05559-8#ref-CR9),[10](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-05559-8#ref-CR10). Various data-driven approaches have also emerged, seeking to establish Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR)[11](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-05559-8#ref-CR11)through the development of machine learning (ML) models. The importance of this task has also been highlighted by two solubility challenges to the cheminformatics community[12](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-05559-8#ref-CR12),[13](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-05559-8#ref-CR13). It is worth mentioning that most studies considered only aqueous solubility[14](#ref-CR14),[15](#ref-CR15),[16](#ref-CR16),[17](#ref-CR17),[18](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-05559-8#ref-CR18). Accordingly, the data surveys were also predominantly focused on the solubility in water, with AqSolDB being the most notable contribution to the field[19](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-05559-8#ref-CR19),[20](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-05559-8#ref-CR20). Later, attempts to predict solubility in organic solvents were made possible by rational selection of descriptors and curation/usage of corresponding datasets[21](#ref-CR21),[22](#ref-CR22),[23](#ref-CR23...",

Solubility of pharmaceutical drugs</h3><p><span>Drug substance, starting material and/or intermediate solubility is a critical consideration during pharmaceutical product and process development. For instance, drug solubility in several organic solvents or solvents mixtures must be screened to select the best solvent system for <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/crystallization\">crystallisation</a><span> or chemical reactions in the liquid phase. These activities play a particularly relevant role in the <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/pharmaceutical-industry\">pharmaceutical industry</a>: considering only crystallisation itself, more than 90\u00a0% of drug substances are crystalline products (</span></span><a href=\"#b0210\"><span><span>Orehek et al., 2021</span></span></a><span>) and drug <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/crystallinity\">crystallinity</a> has an impact on downstream processes, such as filtration, drying, and dissolution testing (</span><a href=\"#b0175\"><span><span>Lemmer and Liebenberg, 2023</span></span></a>), as well as on product attributes such as dissolution rates and tablet hardness (<a href=\"#b0090\"><span><span>Gao et al., 2017</span></span></a>).</p><p>Due to the high number of potential solvents and their mixtures, as well as the system conditions (e.g., temperature), it is not sustainable to experimentally measure solubility in all possible solvent combinations and conditions (<a href=\"#b0055\"><span><span>Cysewski et al., 2022</span></span></a>). This issue is partially overcome by the employment of high-throughput technology, which allows to screen several conditions in parallel while reducing time, material and labour (<a href=\"#b0195\"><span><span>Mennen et al., 2019</span></span></a>); in addition, mathematical models can be useful to predict solubility in solvents systems not explored experimentally (<a href=\"#b0225\"><span><span>Ruether and Sadowski, 2009</span></span></a>). However, the accurate prediction of solubility of complex pharmaceutical molecules in multicomponent mixtures is still an open challenge (<a href=\"#b0025\"><span><span>Boobier et al., 2020</span></span></a>, <a href=\"#b0260\"><span><span>Ye and Ouyang, 2021</span></span></a>). Different approaches have been proposed in the literature and they can be grouped into two main categories: thermodynamic models and empirical correlations (<a href=\"#b0225\"><span><span>Ruether and Sadowski, 2009</span></span></a>, <a href=\"#b0100\"><span><span>Gharagheizi et al., 2011</span></span></a>).</p></section><section><h3>1.2. Existing modelling approaches: Thermodynamic models</h3><p><span>Thermodynamically, <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/systemic-lupus-erythematosus\">SLE</a> is attained when the chemical potential of the solute in the solid phase and the liquid phase are equal. Different thermodynamic models express the chemical potential as a function of activity coefficients (</span><a href=\"#b0065\"><span><span>Elliott and Lira, 2012</span></span></a>). Such models usually require a smaller amount of data to identify model parameters than data-driven approaches (<a href=\"#b0225\"><span><span>Ruether and Sadowski, 2009</span></span></a>), but they have been developed mainly for vapor\u2013liquid or liquid\u2013liquid equilibria and they may predict drug solubility with unsatisfactory accuracy. For instance, <a href=\"#b0035\"><span><span>Bouillot et al. (2011)</span></span></a> compared predictions accuracy of different thermodynamic models (UNIFAC, modified UNIFAC, COSMO-SAC and NRTL-SAC) using five drug or drug-like molecules. At best, UNIFAC and NRTL-SAC provided the correct order of magnitude of solubility, but no model was accurate enough to obtain quantitative results. Another limitation of the UNIFAC model is that UNIFAC group contributions are often missing for the complex API molecules currently handled in pharmaceutical processes. Other commonly used solubility models derived from the physical understanding of the system are COSMO-RC (<a href=\"#b0165\"><span><span>Klamt, 1995</span></span></a>) and PC-SAFT (<a href=\"#b0110\"><span><span>Gross and Sadowski, 2001</span></span></a>, <a href=\"#b0115\"><span><span>Gross and Sadowski, 2002</span></span></a><span>). Such models allow to make <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/solubility-prediction\">solubility predictions</a> without estimating model parameters with solubility data; different studies have shown their ability to perform qualitative screens and ranking of solvents (</span><a href=\"#b0160\"><span><span>Klajmon, 2022</span></span></a>, <a href=\"#b0225\"><span><span>Ruether and Sadowski, 2009</span></span></a><span>). Therefore, they are advantageous for qualitative studies at early stages of <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/pharmacology-toxicology-and-pharmaceutical-science/drug-development\">drug development</a> when API is scarce for experimentation.</span></p><p>In addition, semi-empirical thermodynamic models that allow accurate representation of the temperature-dependence of solubility have been proposed, such as the modified Apelblat equation (<a href=\"#b0015\"><span><span>Apelblat and Manzurola, 1997</span></span></a>, <a href=\"#b0020\"><span><span>Apelblat and Manzurola, 1999</span></span></a>) and the \u03bbh equation (<a href=\"#b0040\"><span><span>Buchowski et al., 1980</span></span></a>), and they have been applied to several drug and drug-like molecules in organic solvents (<a href=\"#b0180\"><span><span>Li et al., 2020</span></span></a>, <a href=\"#b0255\"><span><span>Wu et al., 2020</span></span></a>, <a href=\"#b0125\"><span><span>Hu et al., 2021</span></span></a>, <a href=\"#b0270\"><span><span>Zhou et al., 2021</span></span></a>, <a href=\"#b0265\"><span><span>Zhang et al., 2019</span></span></a>, <a href=\"#b0130\"><span><span>Huang et al., 2015</span></span></a>, <a href=\"#b0245\"><span><span>Wang et al., 2021</span></span></a>). However, none of those models include molecular descriptors among the input variables, therefore, they must be re-calibrated for every different solvent system. In contrast, the Jouyban-Acree models (<a href=\"#b0145\"><span><span>Jouyban et al., 2002</span></span></a>, <a href=\"#b0135\"><span><span>Jouyban, 2008</span></span></a>, <a href=\"#b0150\"><span><span>Jouyban et al., 2012</span></span></a>, <a href=\"#b0140\"><span><span>Jouyban and Acree, 2018</span></span></a>) are calibrated with solubility data and can be used to make predictions at different temperatures and solvent systems. Therefore, they are considered in this study for a comparison with the proposed modelling approach.</p><p>Finally, a different thermodynamic approach was adopted by <a href=\"#b0185\"><span><span>Lovette (2022)</span></span></a>, who developed a solubility model based on the representation of the net flux balance between attachment and detachment of solute molecules at kink sites (i.e., unoccupied sites adjacent to crystal facets). The solubility model provides satisfactory solubility predictions with a variety of solvents and solutes, but its applicability is currently limited to single-solvent systems and a fixed temperature of 25\u00a0\u00b0C.</p></section><section><h3>1.3. Existing modelling approaches: Data-driven models</h3><div><p><span>Data-driven models predict solubility as a function of physico-chemical properties and/or of the molecular structure of the solute and solvents. For example, quantitative structure\u2013property relationship (QSPR) models relate the property of interest (e.g., solubility) to molecular descriptors like topological and geometric indices, quantum\u2013mechanical and thermodynamic quantities, or group contributions.
