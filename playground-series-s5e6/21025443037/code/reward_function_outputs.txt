There was disagreement on severity: one juror scored perfect and did not trigger RL, while two jurors flagged RL due to the filesystem/navigation error and missing actionable implementation detail. I resolved this by following the majority (trigger RL) and assigning a mid-high score (~0.85): strong performance with a clear, fixable robustness gap (directory read error) and room for more quantitative EDA and concrete hyperparameter/code guidance."

Even with the fix, the metric issue materially limits baseline usefulness for model selection."

  ],
  "overall_failure_reason": "The agent produced a plausible baseline pipeline and recovered from an execution-breaking XGBoost API mismatch, but quality issues remained: the initial code did not account for library/API compatibility, and (per one jury member) the validation metric was incorrectly implemented as top-3 accuracy rather than true MAP@3—an important error for a competition evaluated on MAP@3. The jury scores (0.7 vs 0.6) were close; the final score leans slightly downward to account for the metric-implementation concern."
