  ],
  "overall_failure_reason": "Consensus is that the agent performed well overall (competition research + data inspection + strong seed prompt). There was disagreement on severity: one juror scored perfect and did not trigger RL, while two jurors flagged RL due to the filesystem/navigation error and missing actionable implementation detail. I resolved this by following the majority (trigger RL) and assigning a mid-high score (~0.85): strong performance with a clear, fixable robustness gap (directory read error) and room for more quantitative EDA and concrete hyperparameter/code guidance."
