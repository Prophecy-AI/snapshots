I resolved this by following the majority (trigger RL) and assigning a mid-high score (~0.85): strong performance with a clear, fixable robustness gap (directory read error) and room for more quantitative EDA and concrete hyperparameter/code guidance."

The jury scores (0.7 vs 0.6) were close; the final score leans slightly downward to account for the metric-implementation concern."
