Wow! I am impressed that I somehow managed to somewhat make a comeback.

# My Scuffed Solution
Early on I think everyone noticed CatBoost was really bad, so I never used CatBoost in my ensemble. My ensemble was only made of XGBoost (70% of the oofs) and LightGBM (30% of the oofs). I collected 135 oofs and preds that were all created by myself, because one thing I learned was that a single bad oof or pred prediction sourced from a public notebook without careful check could result in a really bad leaderboard score. My final model architecture was a simple mean between a logistic regression and hill climb of all my oofs. I trained all my models locally on my 4070 super, works really well. 

# Some Secrets I might have gatekeeped
I discovered that setting all the data types to categorical improved the score early on
Adding original data also drastically improved the score
XGBoost sampling_method = gradients somehow worked better even with high subsample?
XGBoost refresh_leaf = 0 also slightly improved the score, might be overfitting

# Things that sucked
CatBoost
Feature Engineering
Slow Training Times, I think 95% of the models use a learning rate of 0.05 😅
Summer School starting so I only had like 1 week before I couldn't prioritize coding anymore
Logistic Regression taking 3 hours to run on the CPU
Adding additional OOF predictions and somehow the Hill Climbing score becomes worse

# Happy Summer Break
Unless you also have summer school

How do you know if you won a prize?
