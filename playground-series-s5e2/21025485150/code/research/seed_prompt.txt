## Current Status
- Best CV score: 38.781061 from exp_000 (baseline)
- Target: 38.616280
- Gap: 0.165 RMSE to close
- CV-LB gap: Unknown (no LB submission yet)

## Response to Evaluator
- Technical verdict: TRUSTWORTHY - Baseline execution is sound
- Evaluator's top priority: Implement comprehensive feature engineering with original dataset, categorical interactions, target encoding, and count encoding
- Key concerns addressed:
  - ✅ Will use original dataset statistics (simulated from available data)
  - ✅ Will create categorical interactions (Brand_Size, Size_Color, Size_Style)
  - ✅ Will implement target encoding with proper CV to prevent leakage
  - ✅ Will add count encoding despite weak correlation (winning solutions use it)
  - ✅ Will tune hyperparameters (lower learning rate, more trees)

## Data Understanding
- Reference notebooks: See `exploration/evolver_loop1_analysis.ipynb` and `evolver_loop2_analysis.ipynb` for feature analysis
- Key patterns to exploit:
  - Weight Capacity: 50 uniform bins provide best signal (price range 8.85)
  - Target encoding: Color (1.93), Material (1.54), Brand (1.54) show highest potential
  - Interactions: Brand_Size (0.49 signal score), Size_Color (0.17), Size_Style (0.12)
  - Original dataset: Need to simulate price statistics from available data

## Recommended Approaches

### 1. Enhanced Weight Capacity Features (Highest Priority)
- 50 uniform bins for Weight Capacity (best from analysis)
- Rounding to 7-10 decimal places (winning solution pattern)
- Digit extraction (1-5 digits) to capture decimal patterns
- Original dataset price: Compute mean Price by Weight Capacity from training data
- Quantile features: Compute price quantiles (25th, 50th, 75th, 90th) by Weight Capacity

### 2. Target Encoding with Nested CV (High Priority)
- Features: Color, Material, Brand (top 3 from analysis)
- Method: Use 5-fold nested CV to compute target statistics
- Statistics: mean, std, count for each category
- Smoothing: Apply regularization to prevent overfitting on rare categories
- Leakage prevention: Compute encoding on training folds only, apply to validation

### 3. Categorical Interaction Features (High Priority)
- Brand_Size: Strongest signal (0.49) with 24 combinations
- Size_Color: Moderate signal (0.17) with 28 combinations  
- Size_Style: Moderate signal (0.12) with 16 combinations
- Method: Create interaction strings, then apply target encoding with same nested CV approach

### 4. Count Encoding (Medium Priority)
- All categorical features: Brand, Material, Size, Laptop Compartment, Waterproof, Style, Color
- Method: Compute category frequencies from combined train data
- Rationale: Despite weak correlation (<0.005), winning solutions use it for model diversity

### 5. NaN Encoding (Medium Priority)
- Base-2 encoding: Create single feature representing all NaN patterns
- NaN × Weight Capacity: Combine each column's NaN status with Weight Capacity
- Rationale: Captures missing value patterns that may correlate with price

### 6. Hyperparameter Tuning (Medium Priority)
- Learning rate: Reduce from 0.1 to 0.05 (winning solutions use 0.01-0.05)
- Max depth: Increase from 6 to 8-10
- n_estimators: Increase to 2000 with early_stopping_rounds=100
- Objective: Better convergence and generalization

## What NOT to Try
- Complex ensembles: Focus on single strong model first
- Neural networks: Winning solutions are XGBoost-based
- Excessive feature count: Start with 50-100 well-engineered features, not 500
- Advanced binning beyond 50: Analysis shows diminishing returns

## Validation Notes
- CV scheme: 20-fold CV (same as baseline for consistency)
- Leakage prevention: Critical for target encoding - use nested CV
- Feature importance: Monitor to identify most valuable engineered features
- LB calibration: Submit after significant CV improvement (>0.001) to verify correlation
