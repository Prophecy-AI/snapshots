  "overall_failure_reason": "Consensus: overall work quality is high (good research-first approach and solid seed prompt), but there were avoidable tooling errors (reading a directory as a file) and incomplete extraction/verification (did not read key kernel code and performed limited/no substantive EDA to validate assumptions). Disagreement noted: one juror scored 1.0 and would not trigger RL despite the tool error; the other two jurors treated the tool error and incomplete follow-through as sufficient to trigger RL. I resolve this by weighting the shared evidence of a concrete tool misuse plus incompleteness, yielding TRIGGER=1 with a still-strong but not perfect score."
