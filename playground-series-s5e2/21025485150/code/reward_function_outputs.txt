Disagreement noted: one juror scored 1.0 and would not trigger RL despite the tool error; the other two jurors treated the tool error and incomplete follow-through as sufficient to trigger RL. I resolve this by weighting the shared evidence of a concrete tool misuse plus incompleteness, yielding TRIGGER=1 with a still-strong but not perfect score."

    }
  ],
  "overall_failure_reason": "There was partial disagreement: o3-mini-high rated the overall process higher due to iterative debugging and eventual successful submission generation, while Claude/Gemini focused on critical execution-management failures. Resolving this, the strongest cross-jury consensus is that the agent (1) initially missed basic NaN-robust preprocessing, and more importantly (2) mismanaged training runtime/timeout and then continued as if CV had completed, with insufficient CV logging. These issues materially undermine reliability despite some correct fixes and progress, yielding a mid score and triggering RL."
