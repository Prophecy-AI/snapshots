There is disagreement on severity: two jurors scored high (0.8) emphasizing strong strategic discovery, while one scored low (0.4) emphasizing excessive debugging and lack of follow-through (no completed training/submission after many calls). I resolve this by adopting a mid-range score (0.65) that credits the major insight but penalizes the repeated operational failures and slow conversion of insight into a tested, end-to-end result; RL trigger is therefore warranted."
