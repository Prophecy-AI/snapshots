    "# Evolver Loop 3 Analysis: Understanding Feature Importance Issues in exp_003\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "exp_003 achieved CV RMSE of 38.8257 (worse than baseline 38.7811) and feature importance showed all weight features at zero importance. This analysis investigates why.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hypotheses\n",
    "1. Rounding features are too similar to original (high correlation)\n",
    "2. Digit features have low correlation with target\n",
    "3. Missing the key histogram binning approach from winning solutions\n",
    "4. Need target encoding to capture categorical signal"
