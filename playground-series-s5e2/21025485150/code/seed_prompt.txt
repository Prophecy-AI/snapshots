## Current Status
- Best CV score: 38.66084 from exp_003 (groupby statistics)
- Target: 38.616280
- Gap: 0.044560 RMSE to close
- CV-LB gap: Unknown (no LB submission yet)

## Response to Evaluator
- Technical verdict from evolver_loop5: Feature importance extraction works correctly with cleaned names
- **Critical finding**: Feature names with special characters (spaces, parentheses) cause issues in importance extraction
- **Solution validated**: Cleaned names (no special characters) allow proper importance tracking
- Evaluator's top priority: Continue building on groupby statistics success
- **New technique validated**: Histogram binning (1st place solution) creates 20 features with non-zero importance

## Data Understanding
- Reference notebooks: See `exploration/evolver_loop5_analysis.ipynb` for debugging analysis
- **Key breakthrough**: Groupby statistics achieved 0.164883 improvement (38.825723 → 38.660840)
- **Feature importance issue resolved**: Cleaned names enable proper tracking (weight_capacity_mean_price: 4734475 importance)
- **Histogram binning validated**: All 20 bins show non-zero importance (hist_bin_1: 14716.94 top importance)
- **Combined approach promising**: 26 features (6 baseline + 20 histogram) show good distribution

## Recommended Approaches

### 1. Fix Feature Naming (CRITICAL - Prevents Importance Tracking)
**Why**: Special characters break XGBoost feature importance extraction
**Implementation**:
- Clean all feature names: remove spaces, parentheses, hyphens, special characters
- Use pattern: `weight_capacity_mean_price` not `'Weight Capacity (kg)_mean_price'`
- Apply to all 67 features from exp_003
- Validate importance extraction shows non-zero values for all features

### 2. Add Histogram Binning (HIGH PRIORITY - 1st Place Technique)
**Why**: Chris Deotte's winning solution uses histogram binning extensively
**Implementation**:
- Pattern: `groupby(COL1)[COL2].apply(make_histogram)` where COL2 is target Price
- Create 50 bins (not 20) per group key for maximum granularity
- Group keys to test: Weight Capacity, Brand, Material, Size, Color
- Each key creates 50 features: hist_bin_0 through hist_bin_49
- Use price percentiles for bin edges (same approach as 1st place)
- Fill NaN for unseen groups with 0

### 3. Expand Groupby Statistics (HIGH PRIORITY - Proven Winner)
**Why**: exp_003 showed 0.164883 improvement with basic groupby stats
**Implementation**:
- Current: 48 statistics (6 stats × 8 group keys)
- Add more statistics: skew, kurtosis, q25, q75 (6 more = 54 total)
- Add more group keys: Brand_Material, Size_Color interactions (2-3 more keys)
- Total target: 80-100 groupby features
- Use nested 5-fold CV to prevent leakage (same as exp_003)

### 4. Combine All Feature Types (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Why**: Diverse feature types capture different signal patterns
**Implementation**:
- Baseline features: weight rounding (7-10 decimals), digit extraction
- Groupby statistics: 80-100 features from approach #3
- Histogram bins: 200-250 features from approach #2 (4-5 keys × 50 bins)
- Target encoding: Color, Material, Brand (from earlier analysis)
- Total features: ~300 (manageable for XGBoost)

### 5. Hyperparameter Refinement (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Why**: More features need slightly different hyperparameters
**Implementation**:
- Learning rate: 0.05 (keep - proven in exp_003)
- Max depth: 8-10 (increase from 8 to handle more features)
- n_estimators: 2000 (increase from 1000 for better convergence)
- Subsample: 0.8, colsample_bytree: 0.8 (add regularization)
- Early stopping: rounds=100 (prevent overfitting)

## What NOT to Try
- Special characters in feature names: Proven to break importance tracking
- Simple weight transformations: <0.02 correlation, already proven ineffective
- Quantile features: Constant columns from earlier experiments
- Neural networks: Winning solutions are XGBoost-based
- Excessive bins (>50): Diminishing returns, increases memory usage

## Validation Notes
- CV scheme: 20-fold CV (consistent with exp_003)
- Feature importance: Monitor to ensure all feature groups contribute
- Ablation threshold: Keep features that improve CV by >0.001 RMSE
- LB calibration: Submit after >0.002 improvement to verify CV-LB correlation
- Memory check: 300 features × 4M rows = ~9.6GB (should fit in GPU memory)
