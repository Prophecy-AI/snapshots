      "text": "Protein function prediction relies on mapping an amino\u2011acid sequence to the structured terms of the Gene Ontology (GO), which encodes molecular functions, biological processes and cellular components.  Deep\u2011learning models are now the dominant approach because they can learn rich sequence representations while simultaneously exploiting the hierarchical constraints of GO, leading to more consistent and accurate annotations ([nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-024-00795-w)).\n\nThe most effective recent techniques combine large\u2011scale protein language models with GO\u2011aware architectures.  **DeepGO\u2011SE** uses a pretrained language model to generate multiple approximate GO models and a neural network that predicts truth values for GO statements, effectively performing semantic entailment and achieving state\u2011of\u2011the\u2011art performance on benchmark sets ([nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-024-00795-w)).  **POSA\u2011GO** fuses hierarchical GO information with protein language embeddings in a joint model, improving recall on deep GO terms ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12250456)).  **GOProFormer** adopts a multimodal transformer that simultaneously processes sequence embeddings and GO term embeddings, yielding strong multi\u2011label classification across all three GO sub\u2011ontologies ([biorxiv.org](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.20.513033v1.full)).  Graph\u2011based approaches such as **DeepGATGO** employ hierarchical pre\u2011training and graph\u2011attention networks with contrastive learning to capture relationships among GO labels and protein features ([arxiv.org](https://export.arxiv.org/pdf/2307.13004v1.pdf)).  **STAR\u2011GO** further refines this idea by learning hierarchical ontology\u2011informed semantic embeddings that are integrated into a deep predictor ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05245)).\n\nGenerative\u2011adversarial methods also show promise when GO term correlations are explicitly modeled.  **PFP\u2011WGAN** builds a conditional GAN to discover and exploit GO term dependencies, while **GOGAN** extracts features directly from raw sequences without handcrafted descriptors, leveraging large unlabeled protein corpora to overcome label scarcity ([journals.plos.org](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0244430&type=printable); [springer.com](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00500-021-06707-z)).  Across these approaches, the best-performing pipelines tend to (1) use pretrained protein language models (e.g., ESM, ProtBert), (2) incorporate GO\u2019s hierarchical structure through semantic entailment, transformers, or graph attention, and (3) optionally model GO term correlations with contrastive or adversarial learning to boost predictions for rare, specific functions.",

Predicting the functions of proteins using the GO requires both learning and reasoning capabilities in order to maintain consistency and exploit the background knowledge in the GO. Many methods have been developed to automatically predict protein functions, but effectively exploiting all the axioms in the GO for knowledge-enhanced learning has remained a challenge. We have developed DeepGO-SE, a method that predicts GO functions from protein sequences using a pretrained large language model. DeepGO-SE generates multiple approximate models of GO, and a neural network predicts the truth values of statements about protein functions in these approximate models. We aggregate the truth values over multiple models so that DeepGO-SE approximates semantic entailment when predicting protein functions. We show, using several benchmarks, that the approach effectively exploits background knowledge in the GO and improves protein function prediction compared to state-of-the-art methods.\n\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n\n### [Protein function prediction using GO similarity-based heterogeneous network propagation](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-04933-1?fromPaywallRec=false)\n\nArticleOpen access31 May 2025\n\n### [Functional protein mining with conformal guarantees](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-55676-y?fromPaywallRec=false)\n\nArticleOpen access02 January 2025\n\n### [Learning functional properties of proteins with language models](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-022-00457-9?fromPaywallRec=false)\n\nArticle21 March 2022\n\n## Main\n\nProtein function prediction is one of the key challenges in modern biology and bioinformatics as it enables better understanding of the roles and interactions of proteins within living systems. Accurate functional descriptions of proteins are necessary for tasks such as identification of drug targets, understanding disease mechanisms and improving biotechnological applications in industry. While predicting protein structures has become increasingly accurate in recent years[1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-024-00795-w#ref-CR1), predicting protein function remains challenging due to the small number of known functions combined with their complexity and interactions.\n\nFunctions of proteins are described using the Gene Ontology (GO)[2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-024-00795-w#ref-CR2) which is one of the most successful ontologies in biology. GO includes three subontologies for describing molecular functions (MFO) of a single protein, biological processes (BPO) to which proteins can contribute and cellular components (CCO) where proteins are active. Researchers identify protein functions based on experiments and generate scientific reports which are then taken by database curators and added to knowledge bases. These annotations are generally propagated to homologue proteins. As a result, the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot database[3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-024-00795-w#ref-CR3) contains manually curated GO annotations for thousands of organisms and more than 550,000 proteins.\n\nRecent protein function prediction methods rely on different sources of information such as sequence, interactions, protein tertiary structure, literature, coexpression, phylogenetic analysis or the information provided in GO[4](https://www.nature.com/www.nature.com#ref-CR4), [5](https://www.nature.com/www.nature.com#ref-CR5), [6](https://www.nature.com/www.nature.com#ref-CR6), [7](https://www.nature.com/www.nature.com#ref-CR7), [8](https://www.nature.com/www.nature.com#ref-CR8), [9](https://www.nature.com/www.nature.com#ref-CR9), [10](https://www.nature.com/www.nature.com#ref-CR10), [11](https://www.nature.com/www.nature.com#ref-CR11), [12](https://www.nature.com/www.nature.com#ref-CR12), [13](https://www.nature.com/www.nature.com#ref-CR13), [14](https://www.nature.com/www.nature.com#ref-CR14), [15](https://www.nature.com/www.nature.com#ref-CR15), [16](https://www.nature.com/www.nature.com#ref-CR16), [17](https://www.nature.com/www.nature.com#ref-CR17), [18](https://www.nature.com/www.nature.com#ref-CR18), [19](https://www.nature.com/www.nature.com#ref-CR19), [20](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-024-00795-w#ref-CR20). The methods may use sequence domain annotations[5](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-024-00795-w#ref-CR5), [6](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-024-00795-w#ref-CR6), [8](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-024-00795-w#ref-CR8), [11](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-024-00795-w#ref-CR11), [21](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-024-00795-w#ref-CR21), directly apply deep convolutional neural networks (CNN)[13](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-024-00795-w#ref-CR13) or language models such as long short-term memory neural networks[9](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-024-00795-w#ref-CR9) and transformers[14](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-024-00795-w#ref-CR14), or use pretrained protein language models[10](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-024-00795-w#ref-CR10), [15](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-024-00795-w#ref-CR15) to represent amino acid sequences. Models may also incorporate protein\u2013protein interactions through knowledge graph embeddings[12](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-024-00795-w#ref-CR12), [16](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-024-00795-w#ref-CR16), approaches using _k_ nearest neighbours[21](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-024-00795-w#ref-CR21) and graph convolutional neural networks[6](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-024-00795-w#ref-CR6). Also, natural language models applied to scientific literature have been successful in automated function prediction[8](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-024-00795-w#ref-CR8).\n\nOne of the major limitations of many function prediction methods is their reliance on sequence similarity to predict functions. While this approach has been effective when applied to proteins that have similar proteins with well-characterized functions, it can be less reliable for proteins with little or no sequence similarity to known functional domains. Molecular functions arise largely from structure, and proteins with similar structures might have different sequence[22](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-024-00795-w#ref-CR22). Importantly, proteins with similar sequences can have a different set of functions depending on their active sites and the organisms in which they are a part. Consequently, methods that use the same sources of information for all three subontologies of GO are limited; while functions from the MFO subontology can be predicted by a protein sequence or structure, functions from BPO and, to a lesser degree, CCO, inherently rely on multiple proteins being present and interacting in particular ways; therefore, predicting BPO and CCO annotations requires different sources of information than predicting MFO annotations. In general, predicting whether a protein participates in a biological process requires knowledge of an organisms proteome, or at least its annotated genome so that proteins can be predicted; as a result, two proteins may have 100% sequence identity but participate in different processes, dependin...",

However, with the widespread adoption of high-throughput sequencing technologies, the pace of protein function annotation significantly lags behind that of sequence discovery, highlighting the urgent need for more efficient and reliable predictive methods. To address the problem of existing methods ignoring the hierarchical structure of gene ontology terms and making it challenging to dynamically associate protein features with functional contexts, we propose a novel protein function prediction framework, termed Partial Order-Based Self-Attention for Gene Ontology (POSA-GO). This cross-modal collaborative modelling approach fuses GO terms with protein sequences. The model leverages the pre-trained language model ESM-2 to extract deep semantic features from protein sequences. Meanwhile, it transforms the partial order relationships among Gene Ontology (GO) terms into topological embeddings to capture their biological hierarchical dependencies. Furthermore, a multi-head self-attention mechanism is employed to dynamically model the association weights between proteins and GO terms, thereby enabling context-aware functional annotation. Comparative experiments on the CAFA3 and SwissProt datasets demonstrate that POSA-GO outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of Fmax and AUPR metrics, offering a promising solution for protein functional studies.\n\n**Keywords:** protein function prediction, gene ontology, multiple self-attention mechanisms, protein language model\n\n## 1\\.

They have yet to be demonstrated useful for protein function prediction. In particular, the problem of automatic annotation of proteins under the Gene Ontology (GO) framework remains open. This paper makes two key contributions. It debuts a novel method that leverages the transformer architecture in two ways. A sequence transformer encodes protein sequences in a task-agnostic feature space. A graph transformer learns a representation of GO terms while respecting their hierarchical relationships. The learned sequence and GO terms representations are combined and utilized for multi-label classification, with the labels corresponding to GO terms. The method is shown superior over recent representative GO prediction methods. The second major contribution in this paper is a deep investigation of different ways of constructing training and testing datasets. The paper shows that existing approaches under- or over-estimate the generalization power of a model. A novel approach is proposed to address these issues, resulting a new benchmark dataset to rigorously evaluate and compare methods and advance the state-of-the-art.\n\n## I.

In particular, they provide an alternative framework to link protein sequence to function without relying on sequence similarity.

Throughput technologies have greatly increased the number of protein sequences in public repositories, but only about 1% of the sequences in the UniProtKB database have been functionally characterized \\[ [10](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.20.513033v1.full#ref-10)\\]. This gap motivates computational approaches \\[ [11](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.20.513033v1.full#ref-11)\\], and the computational literature on protein function prediction is rich \\[ [12](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.20.513033v1.full#ref-12)\\].\n\nIn this paper we focus on challenging, community-driven instantiation of protein function prediction that utilizes the gene ontology (GO) hierarchy. The GO hierarchy consists of terms/concepts via which one can describe protein functions at varying resolution \\[ [13](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.20.513033v1.full#ref-13)\\]. The GO framework is split into three sub-ontologies: the Cellular Component (CC), the Molecular Function (MF) and the Biological Process (BP). Each subontology is organized as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) that encodes the relationships between the GO terms in a subontology. The True Path rule is used \\[ [13](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.20.513033v1.full#ref-13)\\] to associate proteins to GO terms. If a protein is annotated with a particular GO term _t_, it is also annotated with all the ancestor terms of _t_ in the DAG of the sub-ontology to which t belongs. If a protein is not annotated with a particular GO term t, it is then also not annotated with any of the descendants of t.\n\nGO annotation is a well-formulated instantiation of protein function prediction. It remains an open problem, though much progress has been made over the years, particularly due to deep models \\[ [14](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.20.513033v1.full#ref-14)\\]\u2013\\[ [17](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.20.513033v1.full#ref-17)\\]. However, PLMs have yet to be demon-strated useful for GO annotation prediction. DeepChoi \\[ [18](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.20.513033v1.full#ref-18)\\], a method presented in an article that remains in preprint, is the only occurrence of a PLM-based GO annotation method.\n\nCurrently, there is little to no understanding of how transformer-based approaches perform compared to the state- of-art for GO term prediction. This paper addresses this gap in the research literature. In particular, the paper makes two key contributions, one regarding methodology, and the other regarding rigorous training and testing data construction.\n\nThe paper debuts a novel method, GOProFormer, which leverages the Transformer \\[ [1](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.20.513033v1.full#ref-1)\\] architecture in two ways.

Yet experimental annotation lags far behind the rapid growth of protein sequence data. Computational approaches address this gap by associating proteins with Gene Ontology (GO) terms, which encode functional knowledge through hierarchical relations and textual definitions. However, existing models often emphasize one modality over the other, limiting their ability to generalize, particularly to unseen or newly introduced GO terms that frequently arise as the ontology evolves, and making the previously trained models outdated. We present STAR-GO, a Transformer-based framework that jointly models the semantic and structural characteristics of GO terms to enhance zero-shot protein function prediction. STAR-GO integrates textual definitions with ontology graph structure to learn unified GO representations, which are processed in hierarchical order to propagate information from general to specific terms. These representations are then aligned with protein sequence embeddings to capture sequence-function relationships. STAR-GO achieves state-of-the-art performance and superior zero-shot generalization, demonstrating the utility of integrating semantics and structure for robust and adaptable protein function prediction.

Currently, popular methods primar\u0002ily combine protein-related information and Gene Ontology (GO)\nterms to generate final functional predictions. For example, protein\nsequences, structural information, and protein-protein interaction\nnetworks are integrated as prior knowledge to fuse with GO term\nembeddings and generate the ultimate prediction results. However,\nthese methods are limited by the difficulty in obtaining structural in\u0002formation or network topology information, as well as the accuracy\nof such data. Therefore, more and more methods that only use pro\u0002tein sequences for protein function prediction have been proposed,\nwhich is a more reliable and computationally cheaper approach.\nHowever, the existing methods fail to fully extract feature infor\u0002mation from protein sequences or label data because they do not\nadequately consider the intrinsic characteristics of the data itself.\nTherefore, we propose a sequence-based hierarchical prediction\nmethod, DeepGATGO, which processes protein sequences and GO\nterm labels hierarchically, and utilizes graph attention networks\n(GATs) and contrastive learning for protein function prediction.\nSpecifically, we compute embeddings of the sequence and label\ndata using pre-trained models to reduce computational costs and\nimprove the embedding accuracy. Then, we use GATs to dynami\u0002cally extract the structural information of non-Euclidean data, and\nlearn general features of the label dataset with contrastive learning\nby constructing positive and negative example samples.

Each protein has one or\nmore functions, including catalyzing metabolic reactions [1], DNA\nreplication [2], providing structure for cells and organisms, etc.\nIn the past few decades, next-generation sequencing technologies\n[3] have enabled explosive the growth of protein sequence data\ndue to their advantages in high throughput, scalability, and speed.\nHowever, the method of determining protein function through wet\nexperiments wastes a lot of manual resources and time. The avail\u0002ability of various biological data such as subcellular localization,\nprotein sequences, protein structures [4], and protein-protein inter\u0002action networks [5] has increased the diversity of protein datasets,\nmaking it possible for automatic protein function prediction (AFP)\nvia well-designed computational methods [6].\nExisting computational methods like NetGO [7] and DeepFRI [8]\nintegrate additional protein network data or structural data with the\nsequence information to enhance protein function prediction. How\u0002ever, due to the existence of data incompleteness and inaccuracy,\nas well as the reliance on the conservative nature of homologous\nsequences, these methods may exhibit suboptimal performance\nand high complexity [9]. Since the differences in protein functions\nmainly lie in the arrangement of amino acid sequences, structural\ninformation and folding patterns are implicitly represented in the\nsequence features. Therefore, relying solely on sequence informa\u0002tion for AFP has become a more realistic method. However, it is\nchallenging to accurately characterize the sequence information\ndue to the highly complicated interdependencies between the se\u0002quence data. Moreover, the current AFP approaches often rely on\nthe curated Gene Ontology [10] (GO) data as functional annota\u0002tion labels. Due to the inherent differences between sequence data\nand GO data, it is not feasible to simply combine them for fea\u0002ture extraction. Therefore, a popular approach in current research\narXiv:2307.13004v1 [q-bio.QM] 24 Jul 2023\nBIOKDD\u201923, August 9, 2023, Long Beach, CA, USA Li et al.\nis to hierarchically process sequence and GO data to analyze the\nrelationship between sequences and functional descriptions.\nAs the largest source of gene function system representation\nworldwide, GO is commonly used for protein enrichment analysis\n[11]. Moreover, the widely used general protein knowledge base,\nUniProt [12], incorporates GO terms as part of the functional anno\u0002tation scores for proteins. As a result, many computational methods\nfocus on improving the accuracy and scalability of GO annotations\nas an evaluation metric for protein function prediction methods.\nGO annotation is created by associating genes or gene products\nwith GO terms. These statements together constitute a \u201csnapshot\u201d\nof current biological knowledge. A GO annotation can be uniquely\nidentified by four pieces of information: Gene product (maybe a\nprotein, RNA, etc.), GO term, Reference, and Evidence. GO data con\u0002tains three biological domains [13]: Molecular Function Ontology\n(MFO), Biological Process Ontology (BPO), and Cellular Component\nOntology (CCO), and there are already over 44,000 concepts in 2021.\nThe description of the GO structure can be viewed as a directed\nacyclic graph (DAG) with a root node, where each GO term repre\u0002sents a node and the relationship between terms can be viewed as\nedges in the graph. GO terms strictly follow the \u201cparent-child\u201d rela\u0002tionship, where child terms often have more specialized functions\nthan parent terms, which is a reflection of metabolic processes in\nbiosynthesis. As GO term datasets are not inherently flat labels,\nmeaning that they do not possess the translational invariance like\nimage or text data, when dealing with GO data, we must consider\nits irregular graph structure. Therefore, developing an AFP method\nthat can capture the global GO graph structure information is an\nimportant problem that needs to be further addressed.\nRecently, there have been methods based on CNNs to extract the\nrelationships between GO terms (e.g., TALE [14]).

However, in-laboratory techniques for protein function prediction are not as efficient as methods developed and processed for protein sequencing. While more than 70 million protein sequences are available today, only the functionality of around one percent of them are known. These facts have encouraged researchers to develop computational methods to infer protein functionalities from their sequences. Gene Ontology is the most well-known database for protein functions which has a hierarchical structure, where deeper terms are more determinative and specific. However, the lack of experimentally approved annotations for these specific terms limits the performance of computational methods applied on them. In this work, we propose a method to improve protein function prediction using their sequences by deeply extracting relationships between Gene Ontology terms. To this end, we construct a conditional generative adversarial network which helps to effectively discover and incorporate term correlations in the annotation process. In addition to the baseline algorithms, we compare our method with two recently proposed deep techniques that attempt to utilize Gene Ontology term correlations. Our results confirm the superiority of the proposed method compared to the previous works. Moreover, we demonstrate how our model can effectively help to assign more specific terms to sequences.

PLoS ONE 16(2): e0244430. https://doi.\n\nIntroduction\n\nProteins are one of the most important macro-molecule families in biology. Each protein is responsible for one or more functions in biological pathways and discovering these functions leads to a deeper understanding of biological mechanisms. This is also critical in designing different disease treatments. However, available in-laboratory techniques to discover protein functions are expensive and time-consuming. Thus, researchers tend to employ computational techniques which are able to infer protein functionalities from other biological data sources including protein structures [1], protein-protein interaction networks [2][3][4], protein sequences [5], or any combination of them [6][7][8][9]. Nowadays, due to improvements in sequencing technologies, a large number of protein sequences are available. The UniProtKB database [10] stores more than 70 million sequences where the functionality of around one percent of them is experimentally approved [5]. Experimental methods for gathering other data sources like interaction networks are more costly and noisier than current sequencing technologies and for the majority of proteins the only available data is their sequence [5]. These facts imply the importance of developing sequence-based computational methods for protein function prediction, which is addressed in the current research.\n\nThe previous works on this topic can be divided into three categories [11]: The first category contains alignment-based algorithms which assume that homologous protein sequences have the same functionalities [12][13][14]. The second group is based on finding specific motifs in sequences. These motifs are functional sites, which are considered as signatures of special functions [11]. The last group includes those methods that are based on machine learning and also are able to extract meaningful and high-level features from raw sequences. The well-known benchmarks for computational methods in protein function prediction, like Critical Assessment of Functional Annotation (CAFA) [15], confirm the superiority of machine learning methods compared to the other categories because machine learning techniques are capable to extract higher level features from raw protein sequences [11].\n\nThe most well-known database for annotating proteins is Gene Ontology (GO) [16] which was introduced in 1998 to describe the functionality of genes and their products including proteins. This database includes more than 40000 terms in a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). A protein can be assigned to more than one GO term. For example, in SwissProt [17], as the most important annotated subset of UniProtKB, around 71 GO terms are assigned to each human protein on average [5]. Moreover, in the GO structure, every term is a more specific version of its parents and whenever a term is assigned to a protein, all of its parents should also be assigned to it. In this context, protein function prediction can be described as a multi-label classification problem in which the DAG structure of GO imposes a redundancy in the label space. Moreover, there are semantic relations between GO terms which can help to increase the accuracy of an annotating model that incorporates these relations.\n\nUntil now, several works that consider the GO term relations in their protein function prediction methods have been introduced [18]. The work in [19] obtains the principal directions in the GO term space by Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to filter out noisy annotations. CSSAG [20] proposes a greedy hierarchical multi-label classification algorithm which can be used in both tree and DAG structured output spaces. To find the optimal solution, CSSAG searches for the best subgraph in the GO hierarchy. Inspired by the topic modeling studies in the text analysis field, [21] model GO terms as words that are from special topics. In fact, they consider these topics as new representations of functions. In [13], a label space dimensional reduction (LSDR) method which considers both the GO structure and the label distribution is introduced. By incorporating the label distribution in calculating latent representations for GO terms, it is able to consider semantic similarities which can not be necessarily derived from the GO DAG. GO2Vec [22] exploits a graph embedding algorithm, and node2vec [23], tries to obtain a vector representation for each GO term based on the structural information of GO graph. The authors in [22] also apply their method to GOA graph which includes both term-term, from the GO graph, and the term-protein, from the annotation information relations. They use these representations to calculate semantic similarities between GO terms and functional similarities between proteins. Onto2Vec [24] constructs a corpus of axioms based on the GO graph. These axioms describe the hierarchical relations in the GO DAG. It then uses the Word2Vec [25] algorithm to find feature vectors for GO terms by this corpus of sentences. Onto2Vec finds feature vectors for proteins by adding new axioms describing the annotating relations to the corpus or by a linear combination of feature vectors of terms in the protein's GO annotations.\n\nOn the other hand, some researches have focused on introducing new methods for extracting features from raw protein sequences. The work in [26] extends the classical linear discriminant analysis to multi-label problems. They find the best subspa...",

      "text": "## Abstract\n\nProtein function prediction is a crucial part of genome annotation. Prediction methods have recently witnessed rapid development, owing to the emergence of high-throughput sequencing technologies. Among the available databases for identifying protein function terms, Gene Ontology (GO) is an important resource that describes the functional properties of proteins. Researchers are employing various approaches to efficiently predict the GO terms. Meanwhile, deep learning, a fast-evolving discipline in data-driven approach, exhibits impressive potential with respect to assigning GO terms to amino acid sequences. Herein, we reviewed the currently available computational GO annotation methods for proteins, ranging from conventional to deep learning approach. Further, we selected some suitable predictors from among the reviewed tools and conducted a mini comparison of their performance using a worldwide challenge dataset. Finally, we discussed the remaining major challenges in the field, and emphasized the future directions for protein function prediction with GO.\n\n**Keywords:** Gene Ontology, Protein function prediction, Machine learning, Deep learning, CAFA3, Annotation\n\n## Introduction\n\nProteins are organic macromolecules that are fundamental determinants of the structure and function of living organisms. They play a role in numerous processes, including biochemical reactions, transmission of signals, nutrient transport, immune system boosting, etc. Therefore, understanding protein properties is essential not only from the biological and evolutionary perspectives, but also from the viewpoint of leveraging their potential in biomedical and pharmaceutical applications, and other areas\u00a0( [Amiri-Dashatan et al., 2018](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#ref-3)).\n\nGenerally, protein function identification is accomplished through manual or computational annotation. The former approach is the gold standard for functional annotation, because it is implemented by expert annotators and yields high quality curated results. Nonetheless, this approach is expensive and laborious, and thus, it is difficult to scale. Furthermore, because of the development of high-throughput sequencing technologies, such as next-generation sequencing (NGS), the amount of sequences to be annotated has increased dramatically. Thus, computational annotation methods have been developed as a must to automatically process the high volume of newly generated sequences, and also to improve the accuracy of the annotated data\u00a0( [Sleator & Walsh, 2010](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#ref-63)).\n\nBecause of the variability in the vocabulary used to define protein function, which makes the annotation process confusing to both humans and machines, various databases have been proposed to provide a standardized scheme, such as the Enzyme Commission (EC)\u00a0( [Webb, 1992](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#ref-74)), Functional Catalogue (FunCat)\u00a0( [Ruepp et al., 2004](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#ref-57)), and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)\u00a0( [Kanehisa et al., 2004](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#ref-30)). Currently, Gene Ontology (GO)\u00a0( [Ashburner et al., 2000](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#ref-4); [Consortium, 2015](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#ref-11)) is the most comprehensive resource, as it possesses all the desirable properties of a functional classification system\u00a0( [Pandey, Kumar & Steinbach, 2006](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#ref-48)). The GO consortium created a database for a controlled vocabulary describing the functional properties of genomic products ( _e.g._,\u00a0genes, proteins, and RNA). Each ontology (vocabulary) belongs to one of three categories: molecular function (MF), biological process (BP), and cellular component (CC). In terms of structure, the GO follows a hierarchical organization as a directed acyclic graph (DAG), in which each term is a node and each edge connected to two nodes represents a parent\u2013child relationship. It can be used to infer many types of information, such as \u201cis-a\u201d or \u201cpart-of\u201d. For instance, if term A is denoted as \u201cis-a\u201d of term B, it means that A is a sub-type of B. Further, \u201cpart-of\u201d implies that the child node is necessarily part of the parent. This allows the flexible annotation of proteins with respect to the various levels of function\u2014from general to specific terms\u2014depending on the available evidence\u00a0( [Stein, 2001](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#ref-65)).\n\nAutomated function prediction (AFP) based on the GO system is a challenging problem in bioinformatics. Many studies have discussed protein functional annotation from different perspectives. Previous reviews focused on AFP\u00a0( [Rost et al., 2003](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#ref-56)) in terms of the data type used\u00a0( [Watson, Laskowski & Thornton, 2005](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#ref-73); [Pandey, Kumar & Steinbach, 2006](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#ref-48); [Sleator & Walsh, 2010](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#ref-63); [Shehu, Barbar\u00e1 & Molloy, 2016](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#ref-62)), drawbacks and corresponding solutions\u00a0( [Friedberg, 2006](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#ref-19)), protein interaction networks\u00a0( [Sharan, Ulitsky & Shamir, 2007](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#ref-61)), types of classified function\u00a0( [Rentzsch & Orengo, 2009](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#ref-54)), and GO assignment based on sequence information\u00a0( [Cozzetto & Jones, 2017](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#ref-12)). The two latest reviews are prepared by\u00a0[Bonetta & Valentino (2020)](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#ref-6) and\u00a0[Zhao et al. (2020)](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#ref-83).\u00a0[Bonetta & Valentino (2020)](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#ref-6) demonstrate protein function prediction in the machine learning workflow. Meanwhile,\u00a0[Zhao et al. (2020)](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#ref-83) discuss prediction of gene function prediction from the GO modeling perspective. All these researches provided independent perspectives to the issue, but we observed that there has not been any detailed review about deep learning, which is an emerging approach for protein function prediction with GO terms. Therefore, our paper suggests the possibility of predicting protein function using both conventional learning and deep learning, further indicating that better predictive performance can be expected by comparing several methods with each other.\n\nHerein, we reviewed automated protein function prediction using GO terms (ranging from traditional solutions to the most recently developed deep learning-based tools). We presented not only an overview of the literature, but also, a performance comparison of the emerging solutions. Further, we highlighted the challenges and future prospects of the field. We hope that this review will provide bioinformaticians, computer scientists or any researchers who are interested in this topic, with the latest updates in terms of protein features used, models, and evaluation criteria, hoping to contribute to further improvements in the future.\n\n## Survey Methodology\n\nBased on previous studies\u00a0( [Jung & Thon, 2006](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#ref-28); [Jung et al., 2010](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#ref-29)) and the aforementioned surveys, our review is divided in two main parts offering an overview of the field (from its inception to its present state). The first parts covers the conventional approach and includes solutions that do not use deep learning, while the second part describes methods that rely on deep learning to address the prob...",

Experimental functional characterization of these proteins is time-consuming and expensive, and is often only done rigorously for few selected model organisms. Computational function prediction approaches have been suggested to fill this gap. The functions of proteins are classified using the Gene Ontology (GO), which contains over 40\u2009000 classes. Additionally, proteins have multiple functions, making function prediction a large-scale, multi-class, multi-label problem.\n\n### Results\n\nWe have developed a novel method to predict protein function from sequence. We use deep learning to learn features from protein sequences as well as a cross-species protein\u2013protein interaction network. Our approach specifically outputs information in the structure of the GO and utilizes the dependencies between GO classes as background information to construct a deep learning model. We evaluate our method using the standards established by the Computational Assessment of Function Annotation (CAFA) and demonstrate a significant improvement over baseline methods such as BLAST, in particular for predicting cellular locations.\n\n### Availability and implementation\n\nWeb server: [http://deepgo.bio2vec.net](http://deepgo.bio2vec.net), Source code: [https://github.com/bio-ontology-research-group/deepgo](https://github.com/bio-ontology-research-group/deepgo)\n\n### Supplementary information\n\n[Supplementary data](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#sup1) are available at _Bioinformatics_ online.\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nAdvances in sequencing technology have led to a large and rapidly increasing amount of genetic and protein sequences, and the amount is expected to increase further through sequencing of additional organisms as well as metagenomics. Although knowledge of protein sequences is useful for many applications, such as phylogenetics and evolutionary biology, understanding the behavior of biological systems additionally requires knowledge of the proteins\u2019 functions. Identifying protein functions is challenging and commonly requires _in vitro_ or _in vivo_ experiments ( [Costanzo _et al._, 2016](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#btx624-B13)), and it is obvious that experimental functional annotation of proteins will not scale with the amount of novel protein sequences becoming available.\n\nOne approach to address the challenge of identifying proteins\u2019 functions is the computational prediction of protein functions ( [Radivojac _et al._, 2013](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#btx624-B31)). Function prediction can use several sources of information, including protein\u2013protein interactions ( [Hou, 2017](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#btx624-B23); [Jiang and McQuay, 2012](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#btx624-B25); [Kirac and Ozsoyoglu, 2008](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#btx624-B26); [Nguyen _et al._, 2011](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#btx624-B29); [Sharan _et al._, 2007](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#btx624-B33)), genetic interactions ( [Costanzo _et al...",
