      "text": "Protein function prediction with Gene Ontology (GO) terms has evolved from simple homology\u2011based annotation to sophisticated deep\u2011learning frameworks that explicitly model the GO hierarchy.  Early methods relied on sequence similarity (BLAST), domain/family signatures, or protein\u2011protein interaction (PPI) networks, often combined with machine\u2011learning classifiers such as SVMs or random forests\u202f([DeepGO](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5860606))\u200b.  More recent approaches treat GO prediction as a multi\u2011label, hierarchical classification problem: they embed proteins (e.g., using convolutional or recurrent networks on raw sequences) and jointly learn the dependencies among GO terms, which improves both precision and recall for rare functions\u202f([Kulmanov\u202fet\u202fal., 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.05919))\u200b.\n\nState\u2011of\u2011the\u2011art techniques integrate protein language models with hierarchical GO information.  POSA\u2011GO fuses embeddings from large\u2011scale protein language models (e.g., ESM, ProtBert) with a graph\u2011aware representation of the GO DAG, yielding top performance in CAFA challenges\u202f([Liu\u202fet\u202fal., 2025](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12250456))\u200b.  GOProFormer extends this idea by using a multi\u2011modal transformer that jointly attends to sequence embeddings, structural features, and GO term embeddings, achieving superior accuracy on benchmark datasets\u202f([Kabir\u202fet\u202fal., 2022](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9687818))\u200b.  STAR\u2011GO further refines the hierarchy by learning ontology\u2011informed semantic embeddings that are integrated hierarchically, demonstrating notable gains on large\u2011scale prediction tasks\u202f([Ak\u00e7a\u202fet\u202fal., 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05245))\u200b.\n\nPractical best\u2011practice pipelines therefore combine: (1) deep protein embeddings from pretrained language models; (2) explicit modeling of the GO DAG (e.g., hierarchical loss, graph convolution, or transformer attention); (3) complementary data such as PPI or structural information when available; and (4) post\u2011processing steps like k\u2011nearest\u2011neighbor refinement or random\u2011walk propagation to capture semantic similarity across proteins\u202f([Yu\u202fet\u202fal., 2015](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/s12859-015-0713-y.pdf))\u200b.  This hybrid strategy consistently outperforms purely sequence\u2011based or shallow machine\u2011learning methods and represents the current \u201cbest\u201d technique for GO\u2011based protein function prediction.",

However, with the widespread adoption of high-throughput sequencing technologies, the pace of protein function annotation significantly lags behind that of sequence discovery, highlighting the urgent need for more efficient and reliable predictive methods. To address the problem of existing methods ignoring the hierarchical structure of gene ontology terms and making it challenging to dynamically associate protein features with functional contexts, we propose a novel protein function prediction framework, termed Partial Order-Based Self-Attention for Gene Ontology (POSA-GO). This cross-modal collaborative modelling approach fuses GO terms with protein sequences. The model leverages the pre-trained language model ESM-2 to extract deep semantic features from protein sequences. Meanwhile, it transforms the partial order relationships among Gene Ontology (GO) terms into topological embeddings to capture their biological hierarchical dependencies. Furthermore, a multi-head self-attention mechanism is employed to dynamically model the association weights between proteins and GO terms, thereby enabling context-aware functional annotation. Comparative experiments on the CAFA3 and SwissProt datasets demonstrate that POSA-GO outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of Fmax and AUPR metrics, offering a promising solution for protein functional studies.\n\n**Keywords:** protein function prediction, gene ontology, multiple self-attention mechanisms, protein language model\n\n## 1\\.

They have yet to be demonstrated useful for protein function prediction. In particular, the problem of automatic annotation of proteins under the Gene Ontology (GO) framework remains open. This paper makes two key contributions. It debuts a novel method that leverages the transformer architecture in two ways. A sequence transformer encodes protein sequences in a task-agnostic feature space. A graph transformer learns a representation of GO terms while respecting their hierarchical relationships. The learned sequence and GO terms representations are combined and utilized for multi-label classification, with the labels corresponding to GO terms. The method is shown superior over recent representative GO prediction methods. The second major contribution in this paper is a deep investigation of different ways of constructing training and testing datasets. The paper shows that existing approaches under- or over-estimate the generalization power of a model. A novel approach is proposed to address these issues, resulting in a new benchmark dataset to rigorously evaluate and compare methods and advance the state-of-the-art.\n\n**Keywords:** multi-modal transformer, gene ontology, protein function\n\n## 1\\. Introduction\n\nAn explosion in the number of known protein sequences is now allowing us to leverage the Transformer \\[ [1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9687818/#B1-biomolecules-12-01709)\\] architecture to build Protein Language Models (PLMS) \\[ [2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9687818/#B2-biomolecules-12-01709), [3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9687818/#B3-biomolecules-12-01709), [4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9687818/#B4-biomolecules-12-01709)\\]. PLMs are highly appealing due to their ability to learn task-agnostic representations of proteins. In particular, they provide an alternative framework to link protein sequence to function without relying on sequence similarity. Sequence representations learned via PLMs have been shown useful for various prediction tasks, from predicting secondary structure \\[ [4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9687818/#B4-biomolecules-12-01709)\\], subcellular localization \\[ [4](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9687818/#B4-biomolecules-12-01709), [5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9687818/#B5-biomolecules-12-01709)\\], evolutionary relationships within protein families \\[ [6](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9687818/#B6-biomolecules-12-01709)\\], superfamily \\[ [7](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9687818/#B7-biomolecules-12-01709)\\], and family \\[ [8](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9687818/#B8-biomolecules-12-01709)\\] membership.\n\nPLMs have yet to be demonstrated as useful for protein function prediction, which remains a hallmark problem in molecular biology \\[ [9](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9687818/#B9-biomolecules-12-01709)\\]. In particular, throughput technologies have greatly increased the number of protein sequences in public repositories, but only about 1% of the sequences in the UniProtKB database have been functionally characterized \\[ [10](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9687818/#B10-biomolecules-12-01709)\\].

Experimental functional characterization of these proteins is time-consuming and expensive, and is often only done rigorously for few selected model organisms. Computational function prediction approaches have been suggested to fill this gap. The functions of proteins are classified using the Gene Ontology (GO), which contains over 40\u2009000 classes. Additionally, proteins have multiple functions, making function prediction a large-scale, multi-class, multi-label problem.\n\n### Results\n\nWe have developed a novel method to predict protein function from sequence. We use deep learning to learn features from protein sequences as well as a cross-species protein\u2013protein interaction network. Our approach specifically outputs information in the structure of the GO and utilizes the dependencies between GO classes as background information to construct a deep learning model. We evaluate our method using the standards established by the Computational Assessment of Function Annotation (CAFA) and demonstrate a significant improvement over baseline methods such as BLAST, in particular for predicting cellular locations.\n\n### Availability and implementation\n\nWeb server: [http://deepgo.bio2vec.net](http://deepgo.bio2vec.net), Source code: [https://github.com/bio-ontology-research-group/deepgo](https://github.com/bio-ontology-research-group/deepgo)\n\n### Supplementary information\n\n[Supplementary data](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#sup1) are available at _Bioinformatics_ online.\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nAdvances in sequencing technology have led to a large and rapidly increasing amount of genetic and protein sequences, and the amount is expected to increase further through sequencing of additional organisms as well as metagenomics. Although knowledge of protein sequences is useful for many applications, such as phylogenetics and evolutionary biology, understanding the behavior of biological systems additionally requires knowledge of the proteins\u2019 functions. Identifying protein functions is challenging and commonly requires _in vitro_ or _in vivo_ experiments ( [Costanzo _et al._, 2016](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#btx624-B13)), and it is obvious that experimental functional annotation of proteins will not scale with the amount of novel protein sequences becoming available.\n\nOne approach to address the challenge of identifying proteins\u2019 functions is the computational prediction of protein functions ( [Radivojac _et al._, 2013](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#btx624-B31)). Function prediction can use several sources of information, including protein\u2013protein interactions ( [Hou, 2017](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#btx624-B23); [Jiang and McQuay, 2012](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#btx624-B25); [Kirac and Ozsoyoglu, 2008](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#btx624-B26); [Nguyen _et al._, 2011](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#btx624-B29); [Sharan _et al._, 2007](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#btx624-B33)), genetic interactions ( [Costanzo _et al...",

Yet experimental annotation lags far behind the rapid growth of protein sequence data. Computational approaches address this gap by associating proteins with Gene Ontology (GO) terms, which encode functional knowledge through hierarchical relations and textual definitions. However, existing models often emphasize one modality over the other, limiting their ability to generalize, particularly to unseen or newly introduced GO terms that frequently arise as the ontology evolves, and making the previously trained models outdated. We present STAR-GO, a Transformer-based framework that jointly models the semantic and structural characteristics of GO terms to enhance zero-shot protein function prediction. STAR-GO integrates textual definitions with ontology graph structure to learn unified GO representations, which are processed in hierarchical order to propagate information from general to specific terms. These representations are then aligned with protein sequence embeddings to capture sequence-function relationships. STAR-GO achieves state-of-the-art performance and superior zero-shot generalization, demonstrating the utility of integrating semantics and structure for robust and adaptable protein function prediction.

BMC Bioinformatics (2015) 16:271 \nDOI 10.1186/s12859-015-0713-y\nMETHODOLOGY ARTICLE Open Access\nPredicting protein function via downward\nrandom walks on a gene ontology\nGuoxian Yu1,2*, Hailong Zhu3*, Carlotta Domeniconi4 and Jiming Liu3\nAbstract\nBackground: High-throughput bio-techniques accumulate ever-increasing amount of genomic and proteomic\ndata. These data are far from being functionally characterized, despite the advances in gene (or gene\u2019s product\nproteins) functional annotations. Due to experimental techniques and to the research bias in biology, the regularly\nupdated functional annotation databases, i.e., the Gene Ontology (GO), are far from being complete. Given the\nimportance of protein functions for biological studies and drug design, proteins should be more comprehensively\nand precisely annotated.\nResults: We proposed downward Random Walks (dRW) to predict missing (or new) functions of partially annotated\nproteins. Particularly, we apply downward random walks with restart on the GO directed acyclic graph, along with the\navailable functions of a protein, to estimate the probability of missing functions. To further boost the prediction\naccuracy, we extend dRW to dRW-kNN. dRW-kNN computes the semantic similarity between proteins based on the\nfunctional annotations of proteins; it then predicts functions based on the functions estimated by dRW, together with\nthe functions associated with the k nearest proteins. Our proposed models can predict two kinds of missing functions:\n(i) the ones that are missing for a protein but associated with other proteins of interest; (ii) the ones that are not\navailable for any protein of interest, but exist in the GO hierarchy. Experimental results on the proteins of Yeast and\nHuman show that dRW and dRW-kNN can replenish functions more accurately than other related approaches,\nespecially for sparse functions associated with no more than 10 proteins.\nConclusion: The empirical study shows that the semantic similarity between GO terms and the ontology hierarchy\nplay important roles in predicting protein function. The proposed dRW and dRW-kNN can serve as tools for\nreplenishing functions of partially annotated proteins.\nKeywords: Function prediction, Downward random walk, Gene ontology, Partially annotated proteins\nBackground\nThe Gene Ontology (GO) is a controlled vocabulary of\nterms for describing the biological roles of genes and their\nproducts (i.e., proteins) [1]. GO organizes the ontologi\u0002cal knowledge (or GO terms) in a direct acyclic graph\n(DAG), and represents the knowledge in three orthogonal\nsub-ontologies, namely a Biological Process (BP), a Molec\u0002ular Function (MF) and a Cellular Component (CC).

The Human Proteome Project consortium recently\nclaimed that we still have very little information about the\ncellular functions of approximately two-thirds of human\nproteins [3]. Schones et al.

BMC Bioinformatics (2015) 16:271 Page 2 of 13\nterms can facilitate the understanding of life at the cellular\nlevel, and lay a foundation for the development of diag\u0002nostic, prognostic, therapeutic, and preventive medical\napplications [3, 5, 6].\nAlthough researchers have been working on protein\nfunction prediction for more than ten years, the functional\nroles of proteins are still poorly characterized for several\nreasons: (i) most functional information is yet to be dis\u0002covered through direct experiments in the first place [7],\nand it is time consuming and costly to annotate proteins in\nwet-labs; (ii) the wet-lab verified functions of proteins are\nstill limited by the experimental techniques and the bio\u0002logical research interest [4, 8\u201310]. These techniques often\ncan only provide partial annotations, which are not spe\u0002cific enough to be of biological interest [4] and result in\nthe issues of evaluation of predicted functions [11, 12]; (iii)\nour current knowledge of the GO terms and structure is\nincomplete. Both are updated regularly; as a result, some\nGO terms are obsolete and some new ones are included\nfrom time to time. For these reasons, developing compu\u0002tational models to comprehensively annotate proteins is of\ngreat importance and necessity. More importantly, these\nmodels should explicitly take into account the incomplete\nfunctional annotation of proteins.\nVarious computational models have been proposed for\nprotein function prediction and their feasibility has been\nshown [5, 6, 13]. Most of these methods [2, 14\u201318] explic\u0002itly (or implicitly) assume that the available functional\nannotations of proteins are complete, and make use of\nthe annotations to predict the functions of unlabeled pro\u0002teins. Thus, these methods ignore the fact that proteins\nare partially annotated and they cannot replenish (or pre\u0002dict) functions of a partially annotated protein. Given that\nthe current functional annotation of proteins are shallow\nand far from being complete [4, 5], and given the true path\nrule, it is more desirable to know the specific functions\nof a protein, rather than the general ones. For example,\n\u2018GO:0072576\u2019 (liver morphogenesis) is a descendant of\n\u2018GO:0001889\u2019 (liver development); thus, a protein anno\u0002tated with \u2018GO:0072576\u2019 provides more biological infor\u0002mation than this protein annotated with \u2018GO:0001889\u2019. In\nthis paper, we investigate the possibility of replenishing\nmissing but more informative functions of a protein from\nthe currently annotated functions of the same protein.\nPredicting functions of proteins that already have some\nfunctional annotations has been set as a new challenge in\nthe second large-scale community-based critical assess\u0002ment of protein function annotation (CAFA) [5, 19]. A\nfew approaches explicitly consider the incomplete anno\u0002tations of proteins, and predict missing annotations for\npartially annotated proteins, or for completely unlabeled\nproteins [20\u201323]. Yu et al. [20] used co-expression data\nand an edge-based functional terms\u2019 taxonomy similar\u0002ity to determine specific functions of a protein. At first,\nall functions associated with the k nearest neighborhood\nproteins are chosen as candidate functions of a protein.\nThese candidate functions are weighted based on their\ntaxonomy similarity and their frequency. Eventually, the\nresulting representative functions are assigned to the pro\u0002tein. Zhu et...",

      "title": "Protein function prediction with gene ontology: from traditional to deep learning models",
      "text": "## Abstract\n\nProtein function prediction is a crucial part of genome annotation. Prediction methods have recently witnessed rapid development, owing to the emergence of high-throughput sequencing technologies. Among the available databases for identifying protein function terms, Gene Ontology (GO) is an important resource that describes the functional properties of proteins. Researchers are employing various approaches to efficiently predict the GO terms. Meanwhile, deep learning, a fast-evolving discipline in data-driven approach, exhibits impressive potential with respect to assigning GO terms to amino acid sequences. Herein, we reviewed the currently available computational GO annotation methods for proteins, ranging from conventional to deep learning approach. Further, we selected some suitable predictors from among the reviewed tools and conducted a mini comparison of their performance using a worldwide challenge dataset. Finally, we discussed the remaining major challenges in the field, and emphasized the future directions for protein function prediction with GO.\n\n**Keywords:** Gene Ontology, Protein function prediction, Machine learning, Deep learning, CAFA3, Annotation\n\n## Introduction\n\nProteins are organic macromolecules that are fundamental determinants of the structure and function of living organisms. They play a role in numerous processes, including biochemical reactions, transmission of signals, nutrient transport, immune system boosting, etc. Therefore, understanding protein properties is essential not only from the biological and evolutionary perspectives, but also from the viewpoint of leveraging their potential in biomedical and pharmaceutical applications, and other areas\u00a0( [Amiri-Dashatan et al., 2018](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#ref-3)).\n\nGenerally, protein function identification is accomplished through manual or computational annotation. The former approach is the gold standard for functional annotation, because it is implemented by expert annotators and yields high quality curated results. Nonetheless, this approach is expensive and laborious, and thus, it is difficult to scale. Furthermore, because of the development of high-throughput sequencing technologies, such as next-generation sequencing (NGS), the amount of sequences to be annotated has increased dramatically. Thus, computational annotation methods have been developed as a must to automatically process the high volume of newly generated sequences, and also to improve the accuracy of the annotated data\u00a0( [Sleator & Walsh, 2010](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#ref-63)).\n\nBecause of the variability in the vocabulary used to define protein function, which makes the annotation process confusing to both humans and machines, various databases have been proposed to provide a standardized scheme, such as the Enzyme Commission (EC)\u00a0( [Webb, 1992](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#ref-74)), Functional Catalogue (FunCat)\u00a0( [Ruepp et al., 2004](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#ref-57)), and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)\u00a0( [Kanehisa et al., 2004](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#ref-30)). Currently, Gene Ontology (GO)\u00a0( [Ashburner et al., 2000](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#ref-4); [Consortium, 2015](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#ref-11)) is the most comprehensive resource, as it possesses all the desirable properties of a functional classification system\u00a0( [Pandey, Kumar & Steinbach, 2006](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#ref-48)). The GO consortium created a database for a controlled vocabulary describing the functional properties of genomic products ( _e.g._,\u00a0genes, proteins, and RNA). Each ontology (vocabulary) belongs to one of three categories: molecular function (MF), biological process (BP), and cellular component (CC). In terms of structure, the GO follows a hierarchical organization as a directed acyclic graph (DAG), in which each term is a node and each edge connected to two nodes represents a parent\u2013child relationship. It can be used to infer many types of information, such as \u201cis-a\u201d or \u201cpart-of\u201d. For instance, if term A is denoted as \u201cis-a\u201d of term B, it means that A is a sub-type of B. Further, \u201cpart-of\u201d implies that the child node is necessarily part of the parent. This allows the flexible annotation of proteins with respect to the various levels of function\u2014from general to specific terms\u2014depending on the available evidence\u00a0( [Stein, 2001](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#ref-65)).\n\nAutomated function prediction (AFP) based on the GO system is a challenging problem in bioinformatics. Many studies have discussed protein functional annotation from different perspectives. Previous reviews focused on AFP\u00a0( [Rost et al., 2003](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#ref-56)) in terms of the data type used\u00a0( [Watson, Laskowski & Thornton, 2005](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#ref-73); [Pandey, Kumar & Steinbach, 2006](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#ref-48); [Sleator & Walsh, 2010](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#ref-63); [Shehu, Barbar\u00e1 & Molloy, 2016](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#ref-62)), drawbacks and corresponding solutions\u00a0( [Friedberg, 2006](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#ref-19)), protein interaction networks\u00a0( [Sharan, Ulitsky & Shamir, 2007](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#ref-61)), types of classified function\u00a0( [Rentzsch & Orengo, 2009](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#ref-54)), and GO assignment based on sequence information\u00a0( [Cozzetto & Jones, 2017](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#ref-12)). The two latest reviews are prepared by\u00a0[Bonetta & Valentino (2020)](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#ref-6) and\u00a0[Zhao et al. (2020)](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#ref-83).\u00a0[Bonetta & Valentino (2020)](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#ref-6) demonstrate protein function prediction in the machine learning workflow. Meanwhile,\u00a0[Zhao et al. (2020)](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#ref-83) discuss prediction of gene function prediction from the GO modeling perspective. All these researches provided independent perspectives to the issue, but we observed that there has not been any detailed review about deep learning, which is an emerging approach for protein function prediction with GO terms. Therefore, our paper suggests the possibility of predicting protein function using both conventional learning and deep learning, further indicating that better predictive performance can be expected by comparing several methods with each other.\n\nHerein, we reviewed automated protein function prediction using GO terms (ranging from traditional solutions to the most recently developed deep learning-based tools). We presented not only an overview of the literature, but also, a performance comparison of the emerging solutions. Further, we highlighted the challenges and future prospects of the field. We hope that this review will provide bioinformaticians, computer scientists or any researchers who are interested in this topic, with the latest updates in terms of protein features used, models, and evaluation criteria, hoping to contribute to further improvements in the future.\n\n## Survey Methodology\n\nBased on previous studies\u00a0( [Jung & Thon, 2006](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#ref-28); [Jung et al., 2010](http://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov#ref-29)) and the aforementioned surveys, our review is divided in two main parts offering an overview of the field (from its inception to its present state). The first parts covers the conventional approach and includes solutions that do not use deep learning, while the second part describes methods that rely on deep learning to address the prob...",

They have yet to be demonstrated useful for protein function prediction. In particular, the problem of automatic annotation of proteins under the Gene Ontology (GO) framework remains open. This paper makes two key contributions. It debuts a novel method that leverages the transformer architecture in two ways. A sequence transformer encodes protein sequences in a task-agnostic feature space. A graph transformer learns a representation of GO terms while respecting their hierarchical relationships. The learned sequence and GO terms representations are combined and utilized for multi-label classification, with the labels corresponding to GO terms. The method is shown superior over recent representative GO prediction methods. The second major contribution in this paper is a deep investigation of different ways of constructing training and testing datasets. The paper shows that existing approaches under- or over-estimate the generalization power of a model. A novel approach is proposed to address these issues, resulting a new benchmark dataset to rigorously evaluate and compare methods and advance the state-of-the-art.\n\n## I. Introduction\n\nAn explosion in the number of known protein sequences is now allowing us to leverage the Transformer \\[ [1](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.20.513033v1.full#ref-1)\\] architecture to build Protein Language Models (PLMS) \\[ [2](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.20.513033v1.full#ref-2)\\]\u2013\\[ [4](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.20.513033v1.full#ref-4)\\]. PLMs are highly appealing due to their ability to learn task-agnostic representations of proteins. In particular, they provide an alternative framework to link protein sequence to function without relying on sequence similarity. Sequence representations learned via PLMs have been shown useful for various prediction tasks, from predicting secondary structure \\[ [4](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.20.513033v1.full#ref-4)\\], subcellular localization \\[ [4](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.20.513033v1.full#ref-4)\\], \\[ [5](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.20.513033v1.full#ref-5)\\], evolutionary relationships within protein families \\[ [6](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.20.513033v1.full#ref-6)\\], superfamily \\[ [7](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.20.513033v1.full#ref-7)\\], and family \\[ [8](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.20.513033v1.full#ref-8)\\] membership.\n\nPLMs have yet to be demonstrated useful for protein function prediction, which remains a hallmark problem in molecular biology \\[ [9](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.20.513033v1.full#ref-9)\\]. and challenges both wet and dry laboratories. Throughput technologies have greatly increased the number of protein sequences in public repositories, but only about 1% of the sequences in the UniProtKB database have been functionally characterized \\[ [10](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.20.513033v1.full#ref-10)\\]. This gap motivates computational approaches \\[ [11](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.20.513033v1.full#ref-11)\\], and the computational literature on protein function prediction is rich \\[ [12](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.20.513033v1.full#ref-12)\\].\n\nIn this paper we focus on challenging, community-driven instantiation of protein function prediction that utilizes the gene ontology (GO) hierarchy. The GO hierarchy consists of terms/concepts via which one can describe protein functions at varying resolution \\[ [13](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.20.513033v1.full#ref-13)\\]. The GO framework is split into three sub-ontologies: the Cellular Component (CC), the Molecular Function (MF) and the Biological Process (BP). Each subontology is organized as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) that encodes the relationships between the GO terms in a subontology. The True Path rule is used \\[ [13](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.20.513033v1.full#ref-13)\\] to associate proteins to GO terms. If a protein is annotated with a particular GO term _t_, it is also annotated with all the ancestor terms of _t_ in the DAG of the sub-ontology to which t belongs. If a protein is not annotated with a particular GO term t, it is then also not annotated with any of the descendants of t.\n\nGO annotation is a well-formulated instantiation of protein function prediction. It remains an open problem, though much progress has been made over the years, particularly due to deep models \\[ [14](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.20.513033v1.full#ref-14)\\]\u2013\\[ [17](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.20.513033v1.full#ref-17)\\]. However, PLMs have yet to be demon-strated useful for GO annotation prediction. DeepChoi \\[ [18](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.20.513033v1.full#ref-18)\\], a method presented in an article that remains in preprint, is the only occurrence of a PLM-based GO annotation method.\n\nCurrently, there is little to no understanding of how transformer-based approaches perform compared to the state- of-art for GO term prediction. This paper addresses this gap in the research literature. In particular, the paper makes two key contributions, one regarding methodology, and the other regarding rigorous training and testing data construction.\n\nThe paper debuts a novel method, GOProFormer, which leverages the Transformer \\[ [1](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.20.513033v1.full#ref-1)\\] architecture in two ways.
