## Current Status
- Best CV: 0.0479 from experiment 001_baseline_cnn (ResNet50, 3 epochs)
- Gap to gold: 0.0091 (23.5% relative improvement needed)
- Experiments above gold: 0

## Response to Evaluator
- Technical verdict was **TRUSTWORTHY**. The baseline execution is sound with proper 5-fold stratified CV and no leakage.
- Evaluator's top priority: **Increase training duration with early stopping and progressive unfreezing**. I **fully agree** - this is the highest ROI change.
- Key concerns raised:
  - Only 3 epochs (severely undertrained) → Address by increasing to 15-20 epochs with early stopping
  - Complete freezing of pretrained layers → Address with progressive unfreezing
  - No hyperparameter exploration → Address with learning rate sweep
  - No TTA → Add as easy win after training improvements

## Data Understanding
- Reference notebooks: "See `exploration/evolver_loop1_analysis.ipynb` for gap analysis"
- 22,500 training images (balanced: 50% dogs, 50% cats)
- Images vary in size, resized to 224x224 for ResNet
- Key pattern: Validation loss still decreasing at epoch 3, indicating massive undertraining

## Recommended Approaches
Priority-ordered list based on ROI analysis:

1. **Increase training duration with early stopping (15-20 epochs)**
   - Current 3 epochs is the #1 bottleneck
   - Analysis shows we need ~0.008 improvement to approach gold
   - Implement early stopping with patience=3 based on validation log loss
   - Expected impact: 0.0479 → ~0.040 (gets us 88% of the way to gold)

2. **Progressive unfreezing with differential learning rates**
   - Freeze all layers initially, train only FC head for 3-5 epochs
   - Unfreeze last ResNet block (layer4), train for 5-7 epochs with lr=1e-4
   - Unfreeze layer3, train for 5-7 epochs with lr=5e-5
   - Keep early layers frozen to prevent catastrophic forgetting
   - Expected impact: Additional 0.002-0.003 improvement

3. **Learning rate optimization**
   - Current lr=0.001 is likely too high for fine-tuning
   - Try: 1e-3 for FC head, 1e-4 for layer4, 5e-5 for layer3
   - Use ReduceLROnPlateau with patience=2, factor=0.5
   - Expected impact: 0.001-0.002 improvement

4. **Test-time augmentation (TTA)**
   - Apply 5-10 augmentations per test image, average predictions
   - Use horizontal flip, slight rotations, color jitter
   - Expected impact: 0.001-0.002 improvement (5-10% relative)

5. **Stronger data augmentation**
   - Add RandomResizedCrop instead of simple Resize
   - Increase rotation range to ±20°, add zoom (0.8-1.2)
   - Expected impact: Better generalization, 0.001 improvement

6. **Model checkpointing and best model selection**
   - Save best model per fold based on validation log loss
   - Load best weights for test predictions
   - Prevents overfitting and captures optimal convergence point

## What NOT to Try
- Don't explore new architectures yet (EfficientNet, ConvNeXt) - ResNet50 has plenty of untapped capacity
- Don't do extensive hyperparameter grids - focus on the big wins first
- Don't add complex ensembles - 5-fold CV is sufficient for now
- Don't change image size from 224x224 - standard for ResNet and works well

## Validation Notes
- Keep 5-fold stratified CV (proven reliable, std=0.0043)
- Monitor per-fold scores to ensure consistency
- Track validation log loss curves to verify convergence
- Confidence: High - these are proven techniques for transfer learning

## Expected Outcome
Combined impact of these changes should yield:
- Training longer: -0.008
- Progressive unfreezing: -0.002
- LR tuning: -0.001
- TTA: -0.001
- **Total: ~0.036 (BEATS GOLD by 0.0028)**

This is a conservative estimate based on typical improvements seen in transfer learning scenarios.
