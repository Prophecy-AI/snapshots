    "# Loop 5 Analysis: Post-Gold Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "## Current Status\n",
    "- **Best CV**: 0.0360 (EfficientNet-B4 + Mixup, exp_008)\n",
    "- **Gold threshold**: 0.038820 \n",
    "- **Margin**: +7.3% (comfortable lead)\n",
    "- **Time remaining**: ~9 hours\n",
    "- **GPU status**: Currently unavailable (NVML error)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Findings from Experiment History\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Optimization Recipe is Proven\n",
    "The hyperparameter fixes from exp_007 transferred successfully to EfficientNet-B4:\n",
    "- 5x lower LRs (backbone=2e-5, head=2e-4)\n",
    "- 15-epoch training (3 head + 12 fine-tune)\n",
    "- Cosine annealing with 2-epoch warmup\n",
    "- Batch size 64 (32 for EfficientNet due to memory)\n",
    "- Strong regularization: Mixup (α=0.2) + RandomErasing (p=0.25) + label smoothing (0.1)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Result**: 39% improvement over ResNet50 (0.0590 → 0.0360)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Architecture Upgrade Delivered Expected Gains\n",
    "EfficientNet-B4 achieved the 7-10% improvement we anticipated:\n",
    "- More parameter-efficient (19.3M vs 25.6M params)\n",
    "- Better ImageNet performance (82.9% vs 76.2% Top-1)\n",
    "- Superior feature extraction for dog/cat discrimination\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Training Stability Confirmed\n",
    "- All 5 folds completed full schedule (no early stopping needed)\n",
    "- Low variance: σ = 0.0025\n",
    "- Individual folds: [0.0358, 0.0389, 0.0386, 0.0337, 0.0329]\n",
    "- No degradation pattern (unlike early experiments)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. GPU Issue Analysis\n",
    "The NVML initialization failure is a system-level issue:\n",
    "- `torch.cuda.is_available()` returns False\n",
    "- No processes actively using GPU (checked via lsof)\n",
    "- PyTorch CUDA version matches (11.8)\n",
    "- Likely requires system reset or driver restart\n",
    "\n",
    "## Strategic Decision Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 1: Stop Here (Conservative)\n",
    "**Pros**:\n",
    "- Already secured gold medal\n",
    "- No risk of breaking working solution\n",
    "- Can document and polish current approach\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons**:\n",
    "- Leaves 9 hours unused\n",
    "- Misses opportunity for additional margin\n",
    "- Single model risk (no ensemble backup)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 2: Continue with Ensembling (Aggressive)\n",
    "**Pros**:\n",
    "- Expected 5-10% additional improvement (0.032-0.034 target)\n",
    "- Provides ensemble robustness\n",
    "- Maximizes final ranking\n",
    "- Uses available time productively\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons**:\n",
    "- GPU issue may persist\n",
    "- Risk if new experiments fail\n",
    "- Time pressure if training runs long\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommendation: Continue with Parallel Strategy\n",
    "Given 9 hours remaining and proven recipe, we should attempt ensembling while monitoring GPU status.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps Priority\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Resolve GPU issue** (attempt system-level fixes)\n",
    "2. **Train ResNet50 + Mixup** (parallel model for diversity)\n",
    "3. **Create two-model ensemble** (average predictions)\n",
    "4. **Submit ensemble if it outperforms** (else keep current)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Expected Timeline\n",
    "- GPU troubleshooting: 0.5-1 hour\n",
    "- ResNet50 training: 6-7 hours\n",
    "- Ensemble creation: 0.5 hour\n",
    "- Total: 7-8.5 hours (fits within 9-hour window)"
