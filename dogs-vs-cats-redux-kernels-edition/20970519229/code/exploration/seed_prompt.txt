## Current Status
- Best CV: 0.0736 from exp_000 (ResNet18 baseline)
- Gap to gold: 0.0348 (47.3% improvement needed)
- Experiments above gold: 0

## Response to Evaluator
- Technical verdict was **TRUSTWORTHY**. The baseline execution is sound with proper 5-fold stratified CV and no leakage concerns.
- **Evaluator's top priority: Implement stronger architecture with fine-tuning and TTA**. I fully agree - this is the highest ROI path forward.
- **Key concerns raised**:
  - ResNet18 too small → Address with ResNet50/EfficientNet-B4
  - No fine-tuning → Implement progressive unfreezing
  - No TTA → Add test-time augmentation
  - Limited training → Increase to 10-15 epochs
  - No ensembling → Plan for multi-architecture ensemble

## Data Understanding
- **Reference**: See `exploration/evolver_loop1_analysis.ipynb` for full analysis
- **Key patterns**:
  - Perfectly balanced: 11,258 dogs (50.0%), 11,242 cats (50.0%)
  - Variable image sizes: 406±108px width, 360±94px height
  - Aspect ratio: ~1.16 (slightly rectangular)
  - Implication: Resize-based augmentations critical, no class imbalance concerns

## Recommended Approaches (Priority Order)

### 1. Architecture Upgrade with Fine-Tuning (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
**What**: Implement ResNet50 with progressive unfreezing
**Why**: 
- ResNet18 (11.7M params) is underpowered; ResNet50 (25.6M params) has 2x capacity
- Fine-tuning adapts pretrained features to dog/cat domain vs just learning new classifier
- Expected improvement: 20-25% based on literature and evaluator assessment
**How**:
- Start with frozen backbone, train head for 3 epochs
- Unfreeze last 2 residual blocks, train 5 epochs with LR=0.0001 for backbone, 0.001 for head
- Use cosine annealing scheduler instead of ReduceLROnPlateau
- Batch size: 32 (conservative for stability)

### 2. Test-Time Augmentation (HIGH PRIORITY)
**What**: 5-augmentation TTA for test predictions
**Why**: Reduces prediction variance, improves robustness, 5-10% typical gain
**How**:
- Create 5 augmented versions per test image (horizontal flips, slight rotations, color jitter)
- Average predictions across augmentations
- Also average across CV folds (5 folds × 5 augmentations = 25 predictions per image)

### 3. Enhanced Training Configuration (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**What**: Increase epochs to 12 with early stopping
**Why**: 5 epochs insufficient for convergence; early stopping prevents overfitting
**How**:
- Patience: 3 epochs
- Max epochs: 12
- Monitor validation log loss
- Save best model per fold

### 4. Advanced Augmentation Strategy (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**What**: Add random resized crop and cutout
**Why**: Current augmentations (flip, rotation, color) are basic; more diversity helps generalization
**How**:
- RandomResizedCrop(224, scale=(0.8, 1.0))
- Cutout (8x8 patches, probability 0.3)
- Keep existing augmentations

### 5. Label Smoothing (LOW PRIORITY)
**What**: Add label smoothing (ε=0.1) to BCE loss
**Why**: Reduces overconfidence, improves calibration
**How**: Use nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss with label smoothing implementation

## What NOT to Try
- **ResNet18 variations**: Already exhausted, too small
- **Basic hyperparameter sweeps**: Low ROI before addressing architecture/fine-tuning
- **Complex ensembles**: Wait until we have 2-3 strong single models
- **AutoML tools**: Overhead not justified for this problem scale

## Validation Notes
- **CV Scheme**: Continue 5-fold stratified CV (proven stable, σ=0.0035)
- **Confidence**: High - improvements are well-established in literature
- **Risk**: Low - changes are incremental and validated in research
- **Target**: Aim for 0.050-0.055 in next experiment (30-35% improvement)

## Success Metrics
- Primary: CV log loss < 0.055 (25% improvement from baseline)
- Secondary: Training stability across all 5 folds
- Tertiary: TTA provides 3-5% boost over single prediction
