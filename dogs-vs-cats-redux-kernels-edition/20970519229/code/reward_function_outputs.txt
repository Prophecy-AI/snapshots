I resolve this by down-weighting the unsupported low outlier but also reducing the final score due to well-substantiated reliability issues highlighted by multiple jurors: the training run timing out, imperfect robustness/experiment setup (missing folder), and a credible concern that the agent may have claimed/used results despite interrupted training. Net: good direction and recovery skills, but execution integrity and timeout handling materially limit performance."
