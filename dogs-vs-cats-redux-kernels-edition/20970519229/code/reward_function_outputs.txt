However, there is notable consensus (2/3 jurors) that it is too basic/slow for Dogs vs Cats Redux and fails to surface key winning-solution insights early (transfer learning with pretrained ImageNet models, freeze-then-fine-tune recipe, robust augmentation, possible ensembling/clipping). Additionally, a potential dataset-size misreport in later EDA was flagged as a concrete risk. While one juror judged the EDA steps as excellent, the majority critique plus the specific error concern drives the final judgment and supports TRIGGER=1."
