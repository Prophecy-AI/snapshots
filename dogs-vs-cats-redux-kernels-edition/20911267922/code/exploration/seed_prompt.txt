## Problem Type
Binary image classification (Dogs vs Cats) with log loss evaluation.

## Reference Notebooks for Data Characteristics
- See exploration notebooks for image dimensions, quality variations, and class balance analysis

## Models and Architectures
For binary image classification competitions, winning approaches typically use:

**Deep Learning Architectures:**
- Transfer learning with pre-trained CNNs (ResNet, EfficientNet, Vision Transformer)
- Fine-tune on the specific dataset for 10-20 epochs
- Use ImageNet pre-trained weights as starting point
- Consider ensemble of different architectures (CNN + Transformer)

**Traditional ML (if using extracted features):**
- Gradient boosting (XGBoost/LightGBM) on extracted image features
- SVM with appropriate kernels for image data

## Preprocessing and Augmentation
- Resize images to consistent dimensions (224x224 or 299x299 common)
- Normalize pixel values (ImageNet stats or dataset-specific)
- Data augmentation critical for small datasets:
  - Horizontal flips, rotations, zoom, brightness/contrast adjustments
  - Cutout/RandomErasing to improve robustness
- Consider test-time augmentation (TTA) for predictions

## Training Strategy
- Stratified K-fold validation (k=5) to ensure balanced classes
- Early stopping based on validation log loss
- Learning rate scheduling (cosine annealing or reduce-on-plateau)
- Use class weights if significant imbalance (though this dataset appears balanced)

## Ensembling
- Weighted average of multiple model predictions
- Snapshot ensembling (single model, multiple checkpoints)
- Model blending with different architectures
- Geometric mean often better than arithmetic for probabilities

## Post-Processing
- Clip predictions to [epsilon, 1-epsilon] to avoid log loss issues
- Calibration techniques (temperature scaling, isotonic regression)
- Rank-based post-processing if leaderboard shows systematic bias
