## Current Status
- Best CV score: 0.968226 from exp_000 (baseline LightGBM)
- Best LB score: Not yet submitted
- CV-LB gap: Unknown (need first submission for calibration)
- Phase: Early feature engineering (high ROI activities)

## Response to Evaluator
- **Technical verdict was TRUSTWORTHY**: Execution is sound, no critical issues to address
- **Evaluator's top priority**: Implement cyclical feature engineering for month/day. **I strongly agree** - my analysis confirms clear periodic patterns that sin/cos transformations will capture
- **Key concerns raised**: 
  - Label encoding leakage: Will address by moving encoding inside CV folds
  - No feature engineering: This experiment will add cyclical features as first step
  - Single model type: Will add XGBoost/CatBoost in subsequent experiments after features mature
  - No numeric→categorical: Will explore after establishing baseline with cyclical features

## Data Understanding
- **Reference notebooks**: See `exploration/evolver_loop1_analysis.ipynb` for feature analysis
- **Month patterns**: mar/sep/oct/dec have 2-5x higher target rates (0.49-0.57 vs 0.07-0.24) - cyclical encoding essential
- **Day patterns**: Peaks at day 1 (0.358), 10 (0.238), troughs at 5-9 (0.09-0.11) - periodicity captured by sin/cos
- **Duration**: Strongest predictor (corr=0.519) - will benefit from interaction features later
- **Job status**: Clear separation (student: 0.341, retired: 0.246) - target encoding candidate

## Recommended Approaches for Next Experiment

### 1. Implement Cyclical Features (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
**What to do**: Add sin/cos transformations for month and day features
```python
# Month cyclical (12 months)
df['month_sin'] = np.sin(2 * np.pi * df['month_num'] / 12)
df['month_cos'] = np.cos(2 * np.pi * df['month_num'] / 12)

# Day cyclical (31 days max)
df['day_sin'] = np.sin(2 * np.pi * df['day'] / 31)
df['day_cos'] = np.cos(2 * np.pi * df['day'] / 31)
```
**Why**: 8th place solution explicitly used these. My analysis shows clear periodic patterns that one-hot encoding misses. Expected gain: 0.002-0.005 AUC.
**Implementation notes**: 
- Map month names to numbers first (jan=1, feb=2, ..., dec=12)
- Keep original month/day as categorical for now (don't drop)
- Use same LightGBM parameters to isolate feature impact

### 2. Fix Label Encoding Leakage
**What to do**: Move label encoding inside CV loop - fit only on training fold
```python
# Inside each CV fold:
label_encoder = LabelEncoder()
X_train[cat_features] = X_train[cat_features].apply(lambda x: label_encoder.fit_transform(x))
X_valid[cat_features] = X_valid[cat_features].apply(lambda x: label_encoder.transform(x))
X_test[cat_features] = X_test[cat_features].apply(lambda x: label_encoder.transform(x))
```
**Why**: Prevents information leakage from test set. Essential for proper target encoding later.
**Expected impact**: Minimal score change but corrects methodology

### 3. Add Duration Cyclical Features (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**What to do**: Apply sin/cos to duration (max value ~500 seconds from EDA)
```python
df['duration_sin'] = np.sin(2 * np.pi * df['duration'] / 540)  # 540 = max + padding
df['duration_cos'] = np.cos(2 * np.pi * df['duration'] / 540)
```
**Why**: Duration is the top feature (corr=0.519). 8th place solution used this. Captures non-linear patterns.
**Note**: Try this if cyclical month/day show improvement - can be in same experiment or next

### 4. Prepare for Interaction Features (LOW PRIORITY - Future)
**What to do**: Plan but don't implement yet. Identify promising pairs:
- duration + campaign (both measure contact effort)
- duration + previous (call length vs past contacts)
- age + balance (demographics + financial)
- balance + duration (financial + engagement)

**Why**: Winning solutions heavily used interactions. But first establish baseline with cyclical features alone.

## What NOT to Try Yet
- **Target encoding**: Wait until after cyclical features proven. Requires careful fold-aware implementation
- **Hyperparameter tuning**: Diminishing returns. Focus on features first
- **Neural networks**: Add after we have 3-5 diverse tree models with good features
- **Original data augmentation**: Complex, save for later when approaching 0.977+ CV
- **Converting numerics to categorical**: Try after cyclical features, before target encoding

## Validation Notes
- **CV scheme**: Keep same 5-fold StratifiedKFold (seed=42) for fair comparison
- **Metric**: ROC AUC (direction: higher is better)
- **Early stopping**: 50 rounds (same as baseline)
- **Success criteria**: CV improvement >0.001 vs baseline (0.968226)
- **OOF predictions**: Save for future ensembling (critical for meta-learners later)

## Expected Performance Trajectory
Based on 8th place writeup and competition analysis:
- Baseline: 0.968226
- + Cyclical features: 0.970-0.973
- + Interaction features: 0.973-0.975
- + Target encoding: 0.975-0.977
- + Model diversity (XGBoost, CatBoost, NN): 0.977-0.978
- + Ensembling: 0.978+

**Focus**: This experiment aims for 0.970-0.973 CV by adding cyclical features and fixing encoding leakage. If we hit 0.972+, we're on track for target.
