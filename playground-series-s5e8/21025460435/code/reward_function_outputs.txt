There was some emphasis disagreement (o3 focused on timeout + recovery, Opus on lack of advanced feature engineering and below-target CV, Gemini on folder organization), which I resolve by treating the folder/logging failure as the clearest cross-model consensus defect and the feature-engineering shortfall as a secondary baseline limitation. Overall score remains the jury-consensus 0.7 with RL trigger enabled."

Resolving this, the majority view is more persuasive for an EvolverAgent context: the agent generated solid EDA insights (cyclical month/day, strong categorical signals, duration dominance) but did not implement a new experiment/submission, did not sufficiently operationalize leakage-risk mitigations, and was derailed by inconsistent memory-tool retrieval of evaluator feedback instead of verifying via direct file reads. Hence a mid-high score with RL trigger."
