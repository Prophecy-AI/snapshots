      "call_id": "call_5",
      "score": 0.95,
      "reasoning": "Broad agreement that the seed prompt is comprehensive and actionable, reflecting top Kaggle patterns (model diversity, feature engineering, ensembling). The primary critique was missing concrete EDA findings and not explicitly flagging potential leakage risk (e.g., duration) or giving strict leakage-safe guidance for target encoding."
    }
  ],
  "overall_failure_reason": "The jury mostly agreed the agent performed very well (two scores at 1.0 with no trigger), with a minority dissent (0.85, trigger) focused on omissions: deeper EDA (imbalance/missingness/distributions), explicit leakage checks (notably 'duration'), and train/test shift analysis. I resolved the disagreement by following the majority decision on triggering (no trigger) while modestly reducing the overall score to reflect the substantive but non-fatal gaps highlighted by the dissent."
