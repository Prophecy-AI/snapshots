I resolved the disagreement by following the majority decision on triggering (no trigger) while modestly reducing the overall score to reflect the substantive but non-fatal gaps highlighted by the dissent."

  "overall_failure_reason": "The jury largely agrees on a mid-level outcome: the agent delivered a reasonable baseline LightGBM approach, but reliability and process discipline issues reduced performance—specifically (1) execution robustness (timeout) and (2) experiment/file management (missing or inconsistent experiment subfolder leading to logging errors). There was some emphasis disagreement (o3 focused on timeout + recovery, Opus on lack of advanced feature engineering and below-target CV, Gemini on folder organization), which I resolve by treating the folder/logging failure as the clearest cross-model consensus defect and the feature-engineering shortfall as a secondary baseline limitation. Overall score remains the jury-consensus 0.7 with RL trigger enabled."
