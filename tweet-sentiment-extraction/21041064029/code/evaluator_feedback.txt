## What I Understood

The junior researcher just completed experiment exp_003, which tested space trimming post-processing on the RoBERTa span extraction model (exp_002). The hypothesis was that removing leading/trailing spaces from predictions would improve the Jaccard score. They applied a simple `strip()` function to all predictions and compared the results to the original model.

**Result**: NO IMPROVEMENT (0.7036 before and after). Only 1 prediction changed (a NaN value), and there were 0 meaningful changes where actual spaces were trimmed. The RoBERTa model already produces well-formed predictions without boundary space issues.

## Technical Execution Assessment

**Validation**: The experiment correctly uses the existing 5-fold CV predictions from exp_002. The methodology is sound - applying post-processing and re-evaluating on the same validation set.

**Leakage Risk**: None detected. This is pure post-processing on model outputs, no risk of data leakage.

**Score Integrity**: Scores are verified in the notebook. The 0.7036 score matches exactly between original and trimmed predictions, confirming the analysis.

**Code Quality**: The implementation is straightforward and correct:
- Proper handling of NaN values
- Type checking and conversion
- Clear comparison between original and trimmed predictions
- Error handling for edge cases

**Analysis Quality**: Excellent investigative work. The researcher didn't just report "no improvement" - they:
- Counted actual changes (only 1 out of 27,481 predictions)
- Investigated the nature of changes (NaN handling)
- Verified data types and edge cases
- Concluded correctly that space trimming is not useful for this model

Verdict: **TRUSTWORTHY** - The experiment was executed correctly and the conclusion is well-supported by evidence.

## Strategic Assessment

**Approach Fit**: This was a reasonable hypothesis to test. Space trimming is mentioned in winning solutions and Kaggle discussions as a post-processing technique. However, the result shows that modern transformer models with proper tokenization (using offset_mapping) already handle spaces correctly.

**Effort Allocation**: This was a low-effort experiment (single notebook, no model retraining) that tested a quick win. The negative result is valuable - it tells us to focus effort elsewhere. **This was time well spent** because it eliminated a dead-end path.

**Assumptions**: The experiment correctly assumed that:
- Space trimming is a valid technique (true, but not needed here)
- The RoBERTa model might have space issues (false - it's already well-formed)
- Quick post-processing experiments are worth trying (true - even negative results inform strategy)

**Blind Spots**: None evident in this experiment. The researcher correctly identified that space trimming is a standard technique, tested it efficiently, and moved on when it didn't work.

**Trajectory**: This experiment demonstrates good research discipline. The researcher is:
- Following the strategic plan from evolver_loop3_analysis
- Testing quick wins before committing to high-effort approaches
- Using evidence to eliminate dead ends
- Maintaining focus on the target (0.7362)

## What's Working

1. **Systematic testing approach**: Testing quick wins before high-effort implementations
2. **Evidence-based decision making**: The researcher didn't assume space trimming would work - they tested it
3. **Good analysis habits**: Investigated WHY there was no improvement (only 1 NaN changed)
4. **Strategic alignment**: Following the priority ranking from the analysis notebook
5. **Efficient execution**: Low-effort experiment with clear conclusion

## Key Concerns

- **Observation**: The researcher is still at 0.7036, with 0.0326 points to target
- **Why it matters**: We've exhausted the quick wins (space trimming didn't work). Now we need to commit to higher-effort, higher-impact approaches.
- **Suggestion**: Move immediately to **5-fold ensembling** (Priority #2 from the analysis). This has expected gain of +0.010 to +0.020 and is the proven path forward.

- **Observation**: No submissions have been made yet (all 3 attempts failed with API errors)
- **Why it matters**: We have no LB feedback to calibrate CV-LB gap. This is risky - we might be optimizing for CV that doesn't correlate with LB.
- **Suggestion**: **Fix the submission API issue immediately**. We need at least one successful submission to understand if our CV is realistic. Without LB feedback, we're flying blind.

- **Observation**: Character-level WaveNet (Priority #1) hasn't been started yet
- **Why it matters**: This has the highest expected gain (+0.015 to +0.025) and was the key innovation in the winning solution. Every day we delay is a day we can't iterate on this complex approach.
- **Suggestion**: **Start character-level implementation in parallel with ensembling**. The two approaches are complementary - we can ensemble multiple models AND then refine with character-level processing.

- **Observation**: The gap to target (0.0326) requires multiple improvements
- **Why it matters**: No single technique will get us there. We need to stack improvements: ensembling + character-level + maybe RoBERTa-large.
- **Suggestion**: Plan for a **cumulative approach**: ensembling (+0.015) → character-level (+0.020) → RoBERTa-large (+0.010) = +0.045 total, which would put us at 0.7486, well above target.

## Top Priority for Next Experiment

**Implement 5-fold ensembling of RoBERTa models** - This is the highest-leverage next step because:

1. **Proven impact**: Winning solutions consistently use this for +0.01-0.02 gain
2. **Parallelizable**: Can train 5 models simultaneously (different seeds or folds)
3. **Foundation for character-level**: Character-level models work better with ensemble predictions
4. **Quick validation**: We can test ensemble on current single model predictions first
5. **Low risk**: Simple averaging, no complex architectures

**Specific implementation**:
1. Train 5 RoBERTa-base models with different random seeds (or different 4-fold combinations)
2. Generate predictions for all 5 models on validation set
3. Average start/end probability distributions
4. Extract spans from averaged predictions
5. Expected score: 0.7136-0.7236

**Secondary priority (start in parallel)**:
- Begin character-level WaveNet implementation
- Modify RoBERTa inference to save token probabilities
- Convert token probs to character-level format
- This is higher effort but also higher potential gain

**Critical action**:
- Fix submission API issues - we MUST get LB feedback to calibrate our progress
- Without LB scores, we can't validate if our CV improvements translate to real gains

The space trimming experiment was a good quick test that eliminated a dead end. Now it's time to commit to the proven techniques that will close the gap: ensembling and character-level refinement.
