## Current Status
- Best CV score: 0.5481 from exp_000 (rule-based baseline)
- Best LB score: Not yet submitted
- CV-LB gap: Unknown (need first submission for calibration)
- Target: 0.736150 (gap: 0.188 points)

## Response to Evaluator
- Technical verdict was **TRUSTWORTHY**. The baseline is correctly implemented and scores are reliable.
- Evaluator's top priority: **Implement transformer-based sequence tagging model** - I completely agree. The 0.19-point gap cannot be closed with heuristics.
- Key concerns raised:
  1. Rule-based approach assumes sentiment at beginning (false - only 55% for positive/negative)
  2. No ML modeling - this is fundamentally a sequence extraction task
  3. Need semantic understanding of which words convey sentiment
  
  **My response**: Abandon rule-based approaches entirely. The analysis confirms:
  - selected_text appears throughout tweets (beginning: 55%, middle: 25%, end: 20% for sentiment tweets)
  - Length ratios vary (neutral: 0.98, positive: 0.32, negative: 0.34)
  - Sentiment words are 2-5x more common in selected_text vs full text
  
  The path forward is clear: implement RoBERTa with span extraction head.

## Data Understanding
- Reference notebooks: `exploration/evolver_loop1_analysis.ipynb` for position/length analysis
- Key patterns to exploit:
  1. **Neutral tweets**: 98.5% use full text (ratio ~1.0) - model should learn this pattern
  2. **Sentiment tweets**: selected_text is ~1/3 of full length, appears anywhere in tweet
  3. **Sentiment words**: 'good', 'love', 'great', 'bad', 'hate', 'sad' are highly enriched in selected_text
  4. **Position matters but isn't deterministic**: Need model that can identify spans anywhere

## Recommended Approaches
Priority-ordered list based on research and winning solutions:

1. **RoBERTa-base with span extraction head** (Highest priority)
   - Use start/end token classification (not BIO tagging)
   - Frame as span prediction: predict start and end positions
   - Input: tweet text + sentiment token (as shown in winning kernel)
   - Target: start/end indices of selected_text
   - Why: Winning solution (Dark of the Moon) used this approach with 0.736+ CV
   - Expected score: 0.70+ with proper implementation

2. **Data preprocessing improvements**
   - Clean text: handle special characters, URLs, mentions
   - Add sentiment token at beginning (as in winning kernel)
   - Use offset mapping to handle token-to-char alignment
   - Why: Proper preprocessing is critical for span extraction accuracy

3. **5-fold ensemble** (Medium priority)
   - Train 5 models on different folds
   - Average predictions at inference
   - Why: Winning solutions consistently use ensembling for +0.01-0.02 boost
   - Note: Start with single model to verify approach, then ensemble

4. **Character-level post-processing** (Lower priority - winning solution feature)
   - After getting token predictions, refine with character-level model
   - Why: 1st place solution used this for final boost from 0.734 to 0.736
   - Note: This is advanced - focus on transformer first

5. **Model variations to try**
   - BERT-base-uncased (alternative to RoBERTa)
   - DistilBERT (faster, slightly lower performance)
   - RoBERTa-large (better but slower)
   - Why: Ensemble diversity helps, but RoBERTa-base is the proven baseline

## What NOT to Try
- Rule-based improvements: Analysis shows this path is exhausted
- Simple heuristics: Position/length patterns are insufficient
- Traditional ML (TF-IDF, etc.): This is a semantic understanding task
- BIO tagging: Start/end prediction is simpler and more direct

## Validation Notes
- CV scheme: 5-fold KFold (same as baseline for consistency)
- Metric: Jaccard similarity (same as competition)
- Target for first transformer experiment: 0.65+ (should easily beat baseline 0.5481)
- If score < 0.65: Check preprocessing, model architecture, or training procedure
- If score >= 0.70: We're on track, focus on ensembling and refinements

## Implementation Priority
1. Start with RoBERTa-base + span extraction head
2. Implement proper data preprocessing with sentiment tokens
3. Verify CV score beats baseline significantly (>0.65)
4. Then add 5-fold ensemble
5. Finally consider character-level refinement (if time permits)
