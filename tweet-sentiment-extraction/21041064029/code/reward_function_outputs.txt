One juror (o3-mini-high) scored higher (0.8) emphasizing the correct strategic pivot and a successful notebook creation, while another (claude-opus) scored lower (0.6) emphasizing repeated tooling misuse (reading .ipynb by line ranges), confusion between OOF vs test submission artifacts, and lack of implemented training/ensembling despite identifying them. I resolve this disagreement by weighting the more detailed, multi-issue critique more heavily while still crediting the strong strategic research and diagnostic insight, yielding a moderate score (0.65). Trigger is ON because the remaining gap to target performance appears to require substantial additional iterations and the agent demonstrated notable process errors that warrant reinforcement."
