I resolve this by prioritizing the more detailed critiques: exploration is directionally correct but not yet completed into the required actionable artifact, so RL should trigger to drive completion. The main gap is missing explicit synthesis of winning-solution insights into a concrete seed_prompt strategy (and, per one juror, missing basic train.csv EDA)."

RL update is warranted primarily for operational reliability and secondarily for strategic direction-setting."
