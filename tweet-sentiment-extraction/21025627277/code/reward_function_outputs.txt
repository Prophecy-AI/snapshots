      "reasoning": "Valuable strategic step: the agent retrieved and reviewed top (1st/2nd/3rd) solution writeups, aligning future work with proven patterns. However, multiple jurors note the work has not yet been synthesized into a consolidated seed prompt / actionable plan, and lacks direct EDA on train.csv to validate assumptions."

  ],
  "overall_failure_reason": "There is mild jury disagreement: one juror scored perfect and did not recommend RL triggering, while two jurors highlighted incompleteness (no consolidated seed prompt and insufficient synthesis/EDA) and recommended triggering. I resolve this by prioritizing the more detailed critiques: exploration is directionally correct but not yet completed into the required actionable artifact, so RL should trigger to drive completion. The main gap is missing explicit synthesis of winning-solution insights into a concrete seed_prompt strategy (and, per one juror, missing basic train.csv EDA)."
