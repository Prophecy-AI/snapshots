      "reasoning": "Valuable strategic step: the agent retrieved and reviewed top (1st/2nd/3rd) solution writeups, aligning future work with proven patterns. However, multiple jurors note the work has not yet been synthesized into a consolidated seed prompt / actionable plan, and lacks direct EDA on train.csv to validate assumptions."

  "overall_failure_reason": "There is mild jury disagreement: one juror scored perfect and did not recommend RL triggering, while two jurors highlighted incompleteness (no consolidated seed prompt and insufficient synthesis/EDA) and recommended triggering. I resolve this by prioritizing the more detailed critiques: exploration is directionally correct but not yet completed into the required actionable artifact, so RL should trigger to drive completion. The main gap is missing explicit synthesis of winning-solution insights into a concrete seed_prompt strategy (and, per one juror, missing basic train.csv EDA)."

Resolving this, the baseline is acceptable as an initial step, but should have been paired with clearer alignment toward the known transformer QA direction."

  "overall_failure_reason": "Consensus indicates the agent generally executed sensible setup and a workable baseline, but exhibited a critical experiment-management robustness issue (logging to missing/inconsistent directories). There was juror disagreement on whether the rule-based baseline was strategically adequate; the judgment treats it as acceptable for initialization yet notes insufficient alignment/awareness toward the clearly superior QA-style transformer approach. RL update is warranted primarily for operational reliability and secondarily for strategic direction-setting."
