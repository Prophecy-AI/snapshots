      "finding": "Missing values are a common source of noise in Kaggle tabular competitions because many real\u2011world datasets contain incomplete records, and how you treat them can dramatically affect model performance.  Proper handling prevents information loss, avoids bias, and lets tree\u2011based learners (e.g., LightGBM, CatBoost) exploit the \u201cmissingness\u201d itself as a signal\u202f([BrettRomero](https://brettromero.com/data-science-kaggle-walkthrough-cleaning-data/)).  \n\nThe most effective toolkit combines simple, model\u2011aware, and advanced imputation steps:  \n\n* **Basic numeric imputation** \u2013 replace with the column mean, median, or a constant (e.g., \u2013999) and add a binary \u201cmissing\u2011indicator\u201d feature so the model can learn whether the absence is informative\u202f([BrettRomero](https://brettromero.com/data-science-kaggle-walkthrough-cleaning-data/)).  \n* **Categorical handling** \u2013 fill with the most frequent category or a dedicated \u201cunknown\u201d token, then use **categorical embeddings** to let the model learn a dense ",

      "finding": "Ensembling is the cornerstone of most winning Kaggle solutions that rely on gradient\u2011boosted trees because it reduces both bias and variance while exploiting the complementary strengths of different learners\u202f([Medium](https://medium.com/@stevechesa/stacking-ensembles-combining-xgboost-lightgbm-and-catboost-to-improve-model-performance-d4247d092c2e);\u202f[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/mastering-ensemble-learning-from-bagging-boosting-guide-kharche-kkyof)). For gradient\u2011boosting libraries such as XGBoost, LightGBM and CatBoost, the most effective ensembles are **stacked models** (or \u201cblending\u201d), where each base GBM is trained on the full training set and its out\u2011of\u2011fold predictions become features for a second\u2011level meta\u2011learner. This approach lets you combine the fast, histogram\u2011based learning of LightGBM with the regularization tricks of CatBoost and the depth\u2011wise control of XGBoost, often yielding a sizable lift over any single model\u202f([Medium](https://medium.com/@stevechesa/st",
