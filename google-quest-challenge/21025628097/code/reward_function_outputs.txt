Therefore the final judgment is a strong-but-incomplete research phase, warranting TRIGGER=1."

Resolving by weighting the repeated, competition-specific critiques, the agent is credited for producing and running a baseline and logging results, but penalized for methodological misalignment and a basic execution-range error."
