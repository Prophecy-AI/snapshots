Minor disagreement existed only in overall scoring (0.5–0.6); I resolved this by averaging toward the consensus midpoint (0.57). Note: the prompt mentions 4 jurors, but only 3 verdicts were provided, so the synthesis is based on those 3."

Resolving this, the consensus supports a strong but not flawless performance: accurate forensic review and validation, but with incomplete strategic depth; RL is triggered based on the majority view."

There was some disagreement on severity (one juror scored lower, emphasizing faulty QueryMemory reliance and smaller-than-expected gains); I weighted that critique as valid but not fully overriding the demonstrated successful experiment and recorded improvement.
