  "overall_failure_reason": "There was disagreement: one juror rated the work as complete (1.0, no RL trigger), while two jurors (both 0.8, RL trigger) judged the exploration as incomplete. The majority, and the more specific evidence-based critiques, indicate the agent gathered useful materials (description + several writeups) but did not fully cover the most informative top solutions (2nd/3rd) and did not yet synthesize findings into a comprehensive seed_prompt/data-informed strategy. Therefore the final judgment is a strong-but-incomplete research phase, warranting TRIGGER=1."

Resolving by weighting the repeated, competition-specific critiques, the agent is credited for producing and running a baseline and logging results, but penalized for methodological misalignment and a basic execution-range error."
